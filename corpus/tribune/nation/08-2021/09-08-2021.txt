But when there was no work, they took to stealing copper wires from railway tracks," he said.On that fateful day around 8 pm, when they were trying to steal copper wires from Seethanagaram railway bridge, a train halted by and a peanut vendor disembarked to see what the duo was up to."Fearing that the hawker would disclose the crime to police, they caught him and tied his hands and legs. Later, they fastened a noose on his neck with a copper wire and strangled him to death and dumped his body in the Krishna river," said the police officer.After killing the hawker and loitering on the sand banks of the river, the duo laid their eyes on the couple and proceeded to follow up the murder with a gang rape.Sensing that the police came to the crime spot, Reddy and Krishna fled in a boat towards Vijayawada.They reached Ranigari Thota and slept on the sand bank of the river that night. Next morning, the duo went to Tadepalli and gave the cell phones stolen from the couple to their friend Habib to sell.Fearing that the police would come after them, they ran away to Ongole and spent a day there and later separated.From then on, Krishna roamed in Hubli in Karnataka and worked for a week at Nirmal, Telangana, and another week in Bainsa to work as a labourer.Following this, he took a train to Secunderabad and lived by rag picking and stayed at a Saibaba temple near Secunderabad railway station.However, on Saturday, he decided to see his mother for some time. Kishore reached Vijayawada by train and was walking by the tracks towards Tadepalli when police swooped down on him.Police formed six teams to nab the accused and managed to capture Kishore while Reddy is still on the run. The teams searched for them in AP, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and several other places.—     IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-continues-hunt-for-2nd-accused-in-shocking-andhra-pradesh-rape-case-295289

Reaching net zero alone is not enough, as it is the cumulative emissions up to net zero that determine the temperature that is reached.“This has been amply borne out in the IPCC report. It vindicates India’s position that historical cumulative emissions are the source of the climate crisis that the World faces today,” he said amid reports of increasing pressure on India to commit to net zero ahead of Cop-26India’s cumulative and per capita current emissions are significantly low and far less than its fair share of global carbon budget, Yadav added.The report notes that the Carbon dioxide has been and will continue to be the dominant cause of global warming under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.Yadav said under Prime Minister Narendra Modi India has taken numerous steps to tackle the global problem of climate change and is well on the path of decoupling its emissions from economic growth.“India notes that the climate change is impacting the South Asian Monsoons. The report brings out that the monsoon rainfall is expected to intensify in all ranges of the projected scenarios. Intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events are projected to be on the rise. India notes that the rising temperature will lead to increased frequency and intensity of extreme events including heat waves and heavy rainfallIndia also notes that the GHG warming is assessed to be partially offset by aerosol cooling by almost 30%”Several Indian Scientists have participated in the report which says that the world is dangerously close to runaway warming for which humans are “unequivocally” to blame.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-welcomes-ipcc-report-says-reaching-net-zero-alone-is-not-enough-calls-it-a-vindication-of-indias-position-295284

A manhunt has also been launched for the three others who were allegedly involved in the incident which took place in her house on Saturday night when her husband and elder son were not present.The woman is currently undergoing treatment at Uluberia Super Speciality Hospital and a police picket has been posted in front of her house.Amit Malviya, senior BJP leader and the party’s co-incharge of West Bengal, alleged in a Twitter post tweeted that the 34-year-old wife of a BJP worker was tied and brutally gang-raped by TMC workers in Bagnan area of Howrah district.“Local police initially refused to even file her complaint and wanted to dilute the case. TMC is using rape as a political tool to silence opponents,” he tweeted.On the other hand, TMC Howrah district president Pulak Roy said that criminals have no caste, religion, or race.“All criminals are punished in our state. We are with the family and we demand that all culprits are punished,” Roy, the state public health engineering minister, said.Sukanta Kumar Paul, the TMC’s MLA of Amta, and other leaders of the party visited the victim at the hospital.The woman, who lives at a place under the jurisdiction of Bagnan police station with her husband and two sons, had suffered a brain stroke six years ago, following which she lost her speech but could hear.The victim’s husband, who is into the business of flex and banners, said that he had gone to Kolkata for some work on Saturday and could not return.According to the complaint lodged with the police, some people called the woman by her nickname that night and she opened the door. A group of five people barged into the house, beat her up and raped her after tying her up.They had dropped his motorbike on the legs of his wife before leaving his house, the BJP worker claimed in his complaint.The victim’s younger son, who was in another room when the incident happened, on Monday said that his elder brother was on night duty on Saturday, and he (elder brother) was the first one to see that their mother was tied up and there were cut marks on her body.The victim’s brother-in-law who lives next door said that he heard nothing.The victim was initially taken to the Bangan police station. From there she was taken to a local hospital and later admitted to Uluberia Super Speciality Hospital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-workers-wife-gang-raped-in-bengal-tmc-demands-punishment-for-culprits-295281

09-08-2021||---||‘There is nothing in sealed cover,’ SC on CBI report on Jharkhand judge’s ‘murder’||New Delhi, August 9Dissatisfied with the CBI’s sealed cover report having nothing substantial on the motive behind the alleged murder of Dhanbad District Judge, the Supreme Court on Monday asked the Jharkhand High Court Chief Justice to monitor the case on a weekly basis.“You have filed a report in a sealed cover. There is nothing in the sealed cover. Arrest and seizing of vehicles is done by the state (police). You people (CBI) have not indicated anything about intention…motive… anything. We want something concrete,” a Bench led by chief Justice of India NV Ramana said after perusing the report.On behalf of the CBI, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said two persons had been arrested and they were under interrogation. “We can’t reveal anything now,” Mehta added.The Bench – which had initiated a suo motu PIL proceedings on judges’ safety in the wake of alleged murder of District and Sessions Judge-8 of Dhanbad Court, Uttam Anand, last month—asked the CBI to file weekly status reports on the progress in the probe before the Jharkhand High Court Chief Justice for monitoring.Anand was out on morning walk when he was hit by a vehicle from behind near the district court, reports quoting the local police said. An auto-rickshaw driver took him to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. A purported CCTV footage of the incident suggested he was deliberately hit from behind.The Supreme Court had on August 6 pulled up the CBI and the Intelligence Bureau for not properly responding to complaints with regard to harassment of judges who often receive threats in cases involving gangsters.“There are several cases in the country which involve gangsters and where high profile people are accused. So judges are threatened mentally also by sending messages on WhatsApp, SMS. Complaints were made but the CBI has done nothing... No change in the CBI’s attitude... Sorry to observe that...,” it had said.“It’s a new trend in this country. If an adverse order is passed, the judiciary is maligned. Unfortunately, there’s no freedom for a judge to complain. Even though judges complain to the police or the CBI they don’t respond. IB, CBI aren’t helping the judiciary at all. I’m making this statement with a sense of responsibility,” the CJI had said.“Look at this unfortunate case of the death of a young judge. This is the state’s failure. This area has coal mafias and security should have been provided to the society and residences of judges,” the CJI noted.“It’s time some strong measures are put in place,” Attorney General KK Venugopal had said, sharing the court’s concerns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-is-nothing-in-sealed-cover-sc-on-cbi-report-on-jharkhand-judges-murder-295277
09-08-2021||---||Submit ATR of National Task Force on oxygen in two weeks, SC tells Centre||New Delhi, August 9The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to submit in two weeks its action taken report (ATR) on implementing the recommendations of a court-appointed National Task Force (NTF) on allocation of oxygen to states and Union Territories to deal with Covid-19 pandemic.On June 22, the NTF had recommended that India should have strategic reserves of medical oxygen for two-three weeks of consumption on the lines of the arrangements made for petroleum products.A Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said since NTF consists of senior doctors and experts from across the country, it’s imperative for the Centre to take steps to ensure that its recommendations were duly implemented at the policy level to meet any exigencies in present and foreseeable future.The Bench posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks along with the matter on Covid preparedness after the Centre’s counsel sought time to file an ATR on NTF recommendations. It sought to know how the government intended to implement the recommendations.The Bench is seized of the Centre’s petition challenging a Delhi High Court order initiating contempt proceedings against some central government officials for non-compliance of the HC’s direction to supply 700 MT of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients admitted in hospitals in the national capital. On May 5, it had stayed the contempt proceedings before the HC, saying putting officers in jail won’t bring oxygen.Amid wrangling over oxygen supply to hospitals, the Supreme Court had on May 6 set up a 12-member NTF to streamline allocation to the life-saving gas to various states/union territories.Consisting of top medical experts, the NTF is tasked with formulating a methodology for allocation of oxygen and to facilitate a public health response to the pandemic that has seen a sudden spike in the number of infections in its second wave across India.A sub-group led by AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria set of the court had earlier indicted the Delhi Government for allegedly inflating the oxygen requirement of the national capital by four times during peak of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, adversely affecting oxygen supply in 12 states. It had concluded that the Arvind Kejriwal government “exaggerated” oxygen consumption and made a claim of 1140 MT—four times higher than the formula for bed capacity requirement of 289 MT.As amicus curiae Jaideep Gupta said the sub-committee on evaluation of oxygen allocation to Delhi has submitted its interim report, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, objected to the findings in the interim report of the sub-committee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/submit-atr-of-national-task-force-on-oxygen-in-two-weeks-sc-tells-centre-295276

09-08-2021||New Delhi||Parliament passes bill to bury ghost of retrospective taxation||Parliament on Monday cleared a bill to bury the ghost of retrospective taxation which had created “discontent” among foreign investors even as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman assured the Rajya Sabha that the legislation does not dilute the sovereign right of India to levy taxes.The Rajya Sabha returned The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, after a brief discussion. Opposition parties, Congress, DMK, and TMC had walked out of the House to protest against the listing of the bill in the supplementary business circulated just hours before the House took it up.The amendment bill, passed by the Lok Sabha last week, will enable the government to withdraw all tax demands made on companies like Cairn Energy and Vodafone using a 2012 legislation on indirect transfer of Indian assets prior to May 28, 2012.The 2012 legislation, commonly referred to as the retrospective tax law, was enacted after the Supreme Court in January that year rejected proceedings brought by tax authorities against Vodafone International Holdings BV for its failure to deduct withholding tax from USD 11.1 billion paid to Hutchison Telecommunications in 2007 for buying out its 67 per cent stake in a wholly-owned Cayman Island incorporated subsidiary that indirectly held interests in Vodafone India Ltd.The Finance Act 2012, which amended various provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 with retrospective effect, contained provisions intended to tax any gain on transfer of shares in a non-Indian company, which derives substantial value from underlying Indian assets, such as Vodafone’s transaction with Hutchison in 2007 or the internal reorganisation of the India business that Cairn Energy did in 2006-07 before listing it on local bourses.Using that law, tax authorities in January 2013 slapped Vodafone with a tax demand of Rs 14,200 crore, including principal tax of Rs 7,990 crore and interest. This was in February 2016 updated to Rs 22,100 crore plus interest.Replying to the debate, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “This (bill) is appealing enough and putting an end to this ghost which we have been carrying all this while from 2012”.She stressed that the government has a right to tax, “but to apply it in retrospective has created a lot of discontentment”.“I seek the support of the House to make India look very clear, transparent, and fair taxation land. ...this whole thing about retrospective amendment bill, which was brought in, since then we were bearing the negativity of this all over the world.”                  The minister also told the House the bill provides for no payment of interest on refunds made under this and the parties seeking relief would not pursue further appeals or litigation in these cases.Seeking support of the House for the legislation, Sitharaman assured the Rajya Sabha: “We continue to have the sovereign right intact. That is not getting diluted. This is just a right decision which had to be taken years ago”. The minister said the government waited for the decision of arbitrations before bringing in the amendment.She further stressed that any correction in retrospective taxation “should be through Indian laws and not through any of the court outside”.While introducing the bill in the Rajya Sabha, Sitharaman also took a jibe on the Congress party saying it takes different positions in Parliament and outside on the same issue.While there was no substantial amount involved in the Vodafone case, in the case of Cairn Energy, the tribunal had asked the Indian government to return the value of the shares it had seized and sold, tax refund withheld and dividend confiscated to enforce the retrospective tax demand.With the government refusing to honour the award, Cairn Energy Plc moved a court in the US to seize assets of Air India. It got an order from a French court to freeze 20 Indian properties in Paris to recover USD 1.2 billion-plus interest and penalties.The move clubbed India with nations such as Pakistan and Venezuela that have faced similar actions by entities seeking enforcement of awards.Finance Secretary TV Somanathan said a total of Rs 8,100 crore was collected using the retrospective tax legislation. Of this, Rs 7,900 crore was from Cairn Energy alone. This money will be repaid.As much as Rs 1.10 lakh crore in retro taxes was sought from 17 entities that were levied taxes using the 2012 legislation. Of these, major recoveries were made only from Cairn. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-passes-bill-to-bury-ghost-of-retrospective-taxation-295274
09-08-2021||Lucknow||UP government renames ‘conspiracy’ to Kakori Train Action, pays tribute to martyrs||The Uttar Pradesh government has renamed a landmark freedom movement event as Kakori Train Action while paying on Monday tributes to the revolutionaries who were hanged for robbing a train at Kakori to buy weapons in 1925.The new name was used in official communications to refer to the event, usually described as the ‘Kakori train robbery’ or the ‘Kakori train conspiracy’.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Governor Anandiben Patel attended a programme held on the anniversary of the event at Kakori-based Kakori Shaheed Smarak on the outskirts of Lucknow.Family members of the freedom fighters were honoured on this occasion, and an art exhibition was also held, a statement issued by UP Raj Bhavan said.A government official said it was derogatory to describe the robbery that was a part of the freedom movement as “conspiracy”.“The revolutionaries were a bunch of passionate people, and their single goal was the independence of the country from the British. They did not commit any ‘kand’ (conspiracy), while fighting to gain freedom from the British, he said.“Their act was a glorious one, and using the derogatory word ‘kand’ would only malign their image. Hence, a decision was taken to replace ‘kand’ with ‘action’,” he added.On December 19, 1927, freedom fighters Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqulla Khan and Roshan Singh were hanged to death for their involvement in the robbery.At the programme organised Monday at Kakori Shaheed Smarak, Adityanath said: “People must rise above caste and religion, and associate with ‘rashtra dharma’. The first war of independence of 1857 shook the foundation of the British.”            “The acts of the revolutionaries remind us that we should unite, rise above caste and religion, associate with ‘rashtra dharm’, and realise the dream of ‘atma-nirbhar’ Bharat,” he added.Patel stressed that incidents such as Kakori Train Action must be taught in the schools, so that the students can know about the history of their ancestors.“The feeling of patriotism is gradually declining in our society, and this is very serious (matter). It is for their reason that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Amrit Mahotsav is being celebrated,” she said.The UP Governor also said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, “we emerged victorious due to collective efforts”.

09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Scientists develop carbon-based non-toxic and reusable wrapper to increase shelf-life of fruits||Indian scientists have developed a composite paper made of carbon that is loaded with preservatives, which can be used as a wrapper to help extend the shelf life of fruits. This product can benefit the farmers and food industry and is also ecologically friendly.Unlike the present preservative dipping technology, where the preservatives are absorbed by the fruit, causing chronic toxicity to the consumers; the graphene oxide carbon wrapper releases the preservative only when needed. The wrapper can be reused, which is not possible with the present technology.Fruits are highly perishable and about 50 per cent of the produce gets wasted, causing huge losses. Conventional preservation relies on coating the fruits with preservatives like resin, wax, or edible polymer, which can result in serious health problems.To address this problem, a team of researchers led by Dr PS Vijayakumar from the Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Mohali, looked for an alternative, that could be generated from waste and would not lead to adsorption of preservatives in the fruit.The activated graphene oxide molecules were loaded with preservatives. This high preservative-loaded graphene oxide, when cast into a paper used to wrap fruit, ensures that the fruit is not contaminated with excess toxic preservatives.When the fruit over-ripens or gets infested by pathogens, the increase in the level of acidity triggers the release of the preservatives. Otherwise, the preservative stays with the carbon wrapper. In the fruit dipping method, the preservative will be lost along with the fruit, whereas the wrapper can be re-used after the consumption of the fruit for the preservation of the next batch of fruits.To develop this non-toxic and reusable wrapping paper, the team allowed the carbon matrix to incubate with the preservative. After the incubation for 24 hours at room temperature, the resultant was washed several times to remove the extra preservatives. Finally, this carbon-preservative composite was cast into paper.“Already waste-derived carbon materials are known to harbour a huge amount of organic molecule loading. Hence the preservative-loaded carbon has been prepared and cast into paper for fruit preservation. Increasing the capacity of carbon to hold organic molecules helped us to develop this product,” Dr Vijayakumar said.The production of this graphene fruit wrapper requires only the carbon produced from the heating of biomass, hence it will also benefit biomass consumption and aid employment generation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-develop-carbon-based-non-toxic-and-reusable-wrapper-to-increase-shelf-life-of-fruits-295261

We condemn the attacks on Abhishek and our party activists in Tripura,” she said after meeting injured TMC workers at state-run SSKM hospital here.“Such attacks would not have been possible without the Union home minister’s active support. He is behind these attacks which were carried out in front of Tripura Police as it remained mute spectators. The Tripura chief minister doesn’t have the audacity to order such attacks,” she said.Two TMC leaders were injured in an attack allegedly by BJP workers at Ambassa in Tripura’s Dhalai district on Saturday.Referring to the attack, Banerjee said, “The car carrying our youth leaders Debangshu Bhattacharya, Jaya Dutta and Sudip Raha was pelted with stones. The windshield of the vehicle was smashed and even shots were fired, everything in front of the police.”“Raha has sustained a serious head injury, while Dutta’s face has swollen from shrapnel injuries. Still, they were denied medical treatment for 36 hours. They were not even given water to drink. The barbaric regime in Tripura has treated them inhumanly,” she said.The TMC chief alleged that at the behest of the Centre, the BJP government in Tripura had hatched plans to prevent TMC leaders from booking flight tickets.“There were clear instructions to not allow TMC leaders to book flight tickets, or hire aircraft and helicopters. Five seats were booked close to Abhishek’s seat in his flight for planting goons. His life is in danger.“Abhishek’s convoy was attacked on August 2 during his visit to Tripura. Had his car not been bullet-proof, his skull would have been fractured. Who knows what would have happened after that?” Banerjee said.She alleged that the BJP had earlier prevented TMC delegations from being beside NRC-affected people in Assam, and from meeting the rape victim’s family in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras.“BJP leaders talk about democracy during their visits to West Bengal but reveal their true colours in the states they rule,” she said.Banerjee asserted that the people of West Bengal and Tripura have strong ties and the BJP cannot prevent the TMC from reaching out to the people of the northeastern state.The Chief Minister, who interacted with the two injured TMC leaders and the doctors attending to them, called upon the youth and the students to protest the attack.Responding to Banerjee’s charge, state BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu said, “The allegations against the Union Home Minister are baseless. Going by her logic, she should be held responsible for the post-poll violence and murders of BJP workers in West Bengal. Our CM should be the last person to talk about political violence.”“The BJP doesn’t lack political acumen that it would attack a non-entity like TMC to give it importance in Tripura politics,” BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.

09-08-2021||New Delhi||Amidst Opposition protests, 3 bills passed in LS, 3 others introduced; Congress says democracy 'murdered'||The central government on Monday pushed through six bills, three of which were passed, in Lok Sabha despite the unrelenting Opposition protests over Pegasus snooping row and other issues, prompting the Congress to dub it as “murder democracy".The bills that were passed amid the din were—The Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill 2021, The Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill 2021, and The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill 2021.RSP's NK Premachandran said the three bills were passed in 10 minutes and likened it to "cooking dosas”.Lok Sabha proceedings were repeatedly disrupted following uproar by the Opposition, but amid the protests, the government also introduced two other bills —The National Commission for Homoeopathy (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine (Amendment) Bill, 2021.Congress leaders Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Manish Tewari alleged that democracy is being "murdered" with the government pushing ahead with its legislative agenda in such a manner when the House was not in order.When the third bill, The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2021 to restore the states' right to list OBCs, was to be introduced, opposition members vacated the Well of the House and went back to their seats.When the House met for the day in the morning, Opposition members sought to raise various issues, including the Pegasus spyware controversy, and started shouting slogans following which the proceedings were adjourned till 11.30 am When the Question Hour resumed at 11.30 AM, Opposition members trooped into Well.Rajendra Agrawal, who was in the Chair, asked members to go back to their seats."Question Hour is a medium to discuss issues, please participate in this," Agrawal said.Soon, he adjourned the House till noon as the opposition ignored his plea and continued their protests.When the House met again at noon, Agarwal, who was in the chair, allowed papers related to different ministries to be tabled in the House.He then asked Union Minister for Aayush Sarbananda Sonowal to introduce The National Commission for Homoeopathy (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine (Amendment) Bill, 2021.The first bill proposes to amend the National Commission for Homoeopathy Act, 2020 to provide a medical education system that improves access to quality and affordable medical education.The other bill seeks to repeal the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970, and help make available the Indian system of medicine professionals across the country.TMC member Saugata Roy said he opposed the introduction of the Homeopathy bill as it would be detrimental to the Homeopathy profession.However, Sonowal defended the bills saying these were very important for the country.Tewari said the introduction of bills amidst opposition protests is a violation of the Constitution.After the admission of the two bills moved by Sonowal, Agarwal allowed Social Justice and Empowerment minister Virendra Kumar to introduce The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2021.The bill seeks to give power to states and UTs to make their own OBC lists.Chowdhury strongly opposed the move and said that the entire opposition has been demanding discussion on the alleged snooping by Pegasus spyware but the government was ignoring the demand.Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Meghwal strongly objected to it, saying the government was ready for discussion on all issues.As protests continued, Agarwal adjourned the House till 12.30 pm.When the House met again, the House passed The Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill 2021, which seeks to encourage the start-up ecosystem and further boost ease of doing business, and The Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill 2021 that seeks to help small cooperative banks and small depositors.Both the bills were earlier passed by Rajya Sabha.The House also passed The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill 2021, which seeks to amend the list of Scheduled Tribes in Arunachal Pradesh, after a brief discussion amidst opposition protests.Chowdhury said today is World Tribal Day and his party wanted to participate in the debate on the bill but alleged that the government has been "trying to suppress the voices of opposition through its brute majority" in the lower house.He claimed that the people of the country have been protesting against the policies of the government and it was scared of the people."This government is arrogant and vindictive," Chowdhury alleged.Meghwal said Chowdhury's allegations were baseless as the Modi government is committed to the welfare of the tribals.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi also countered the opposition allegations and said the Modi government wants constructive, long and fruitful debate but the opposition was not allowing the House to function properly.Soon, the chair adjourned the House till 2 pm.As the House reconvened at 2 pm members again trooped in the Well and continued with their protest.Rama Devi, who was in the Chair, asked the members to go back to their seats so that discussion on Covid-19 could take place, However, the members were unwilling to relent. She later adjourned the proceedings for the day.Earlier, Speaker Om Birla, on behalf of the House, paid tributes to those who had participated in the Quit India Movement.  The members also stood in silence briefly as a mark of respect to those who took part in that movement.The country is celebrating the 79th anniversary of the Quit India Movement that was launched in 1942 under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.Birla also mentioned India's performance at the just-concluded Olympic Games in Tokyo and congratulated the medal winners. Members thumped their desks when the name of Neeraj Chopra, who won the gold medal in the javelin throw at the Olympics, was mentioned.While noting that winning seven medals was the best Olympics performance by India, Birla exuded confidence that it would encourage youngsters to take up sports. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amidst-opposition-protests-3-bills-passed-in-ls-3-others-introduced-congress-says-democracy-murdered-295231

They are deputed for your security. You must plan in a way that you don’t have to venture out every day. Go out only when necessary. You must take precautions until the case is over.”The court also noted that the survivor and her personal security officers have agreed to amicably resolve the issue.The judge added, “For now, the prosecutrix is impressed upon to ensure that whenever she or family members wish to go outside Delhi in connection with any pending case, they would communicate it to CRPF Assistant Commandant so that proper security arrangements and escorts could be made.” The court further said likewise, in case she or family members wish to meet their counsel for the pending cases, they would make sincere efforts to inform the schedule a day before.The woman was kidnapped and raped by expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.On December 20, 2019, Sengar was sentenced to jail for the “remainder of his natural biological life in the rape case.In 2019, the apex court had directed that the survivor, her mother and other members of the family be provided security by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).

Today, when India is becoming recognized as a big agricultural exporting country, it is not right to stay dependent on imports for our needs of edible oil”.He also said that the world famous ‘kesar’ (saffron) of Jammu and Kashmir will now be available in the Nafed outlets in the country.“This will encourage the production of saffron in J&K,” the Prime Minister said.While farmers protesting at Jantar Mantar called the yearly grant of Rs 6,000 under PM-Kisan “a minuscule amount”, questioning “whether a family can survive on Rs 500 a month”, BJP’s West Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari said farmers of the state have been “deprived of the central benefit” due to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s “objection regarding direct transfer to the beneficiaries”.An annual financial benefit of Rs 6,000 is provided to eligible beneficiary farmer families, payable in three equal four-monthly installments of Rs 2,000 each under the PM-KISAN scheme.The PM hoped that the amount received on Monday will help the farmers. The scheme of Kisan Infrastructure Fund with Rs 1 lakh crore corpus also completed one year on Monday. The Prime Minister said the government has made the biggest ever purchase from farmers at MSP, whether Kharif or Rabi season. With this, about Rs 1,70,000 crore have reached directly into the accounts of rice farmers and about Rs. 85,000 crore have gone directly into the account of wheat farmers, he saidThe PM said small and marginal farmers are now being given utmost priority in the agricultural policies by his government.Under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, Rs 1.6 lakh crore has been given to farmers so far. Out of this, Rs 1 lakh crore were transferred to small farmers during the pandemic period, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.Tomar the government is focusing on boosting the domestic production of edible oils and pulses through several schemes so that the country’s dependence on imports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-releases-ninth-installment-of-pm-kisan-asks-farmers-to-make-india-self-sufficient-in-edible-oil-295226
09-08-2021||New Delhi||55 dengue cases in Delhi this year||At least 55 cases of dengue have been reported in the national capital this year, according to a civic report released on Monday.The number of dengue cases for January 1-August 7 period is also the highest this year since 2018 when the count had stood at 64 in that same duration.Three cases were reported in the month of August, according to the report. Dengue mosquito larvae breed in clear, standing water, while those of malaria thrive even in dirty water. Cases of vector-borne diseases are usually reported between July and November, but the period may stretch till mid-December.Fifty-five cases of dengue have been recorded till August 7 this year. No cases were recorded in January, two in February, five in March, 10 in April, 12 in May, Seven in June and 16 in July, the report said.In the previous years, the cases in the same period were 171 in 2016, 251 in 2017), 64 in 2018, 47 in 2019 and 35 in 2020, it said. However, no deaths have been reported due to dengue in the city till now, it added.According to the civic report released on Monday, 24 cases of malaria and nearly 15 cases of chikungunya have also been reported till August 7 this year.Malaria, dengue and chikungunya are accompanied with high fever and therefore, doctors feel that people might suspect that they have contracted Covid-19.The standing committee of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation on July 29 had cleared a proposal to create 710 posts of Dengue Breeding Checking (DBC) staff.On July 24, the EDMC had launched a month-long campaign to raise awareness on prevention of dengue.Other civic bodies have also intensified their measures to prevent the outbreak of vector-borne diseases.

09-08-2021||London||UK High Court grants Nirav Modi permission to appeal on depression, suicide risk grounds||A High Court judge in London on Monday granted fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi permission to appeal against a magistrate's court order in favour of extradition to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering before the Indian courts on mental health and human rights grounds.Justice Martin Chamberlain delivered his verdict remotely under Covid rules to conclude that the arguments presented by the 50-year-old diamond merchant's legal team concerning his “severe depression” and “high risk of suicide” were arguable at a substantial hearing.He also noted that the adequacy of the measures capable of preventing “successful suicide attempts” at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where Nirav Modi is to be detained upon extradition, also fall within the arguable ambit.“At this stage, the question for me is simply whether the appellant's case on these grounds is reasonably arguable. In my judgment, it is. I will grant permission to appeal on Grounds 3 and 4,” Justice Chamberlain's ruling notes.Grounds 3 and 4 relate to Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), or the right to life, liberty and security, and Section 91 of the UK's Criminal Justice Act, 2003, related to fitness to plead.The judge noted that the arguments made under both grounds overlap in this case as they both rely principally on the appellant, Nirav Modi's mental ill health.“I will not restrict the basis on which those grounds can be argued, though it seems to me that there should be a particular focus on whether the judge was wrong to reach the conclusion he did, given the evidence as to the severity of the appellant's [Nirav Modi's] depression, the high risk of suicide and the adequacy of any measures capable of preventing successful suicide attempts in Arthur Road prison,” the ruling notes.

A police team was sent to Khagaria from where the sorcerer was arrested,” the SP added.

09-08-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain pleas of Amazon, Flipkart against CCI probe||The Supreme Court Monday refused to entertain pleas of e-commerce firms, Amazon and Flipkart, challenging an order permitting the Competition Commission of India to carry out a preliminary investigation into the alleged violation of the competition law.A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana said that challenging the enquiry is like wanting a notice before the registration of an FIR under the criminal law and asked the e-commerce giants to submit themselves to the probe by the CCI.“We expect big organisations like Amazon and Flipkart to offer themselves for the inquiry and you do not want that. You have to submit and enquiry has to be permitted,” said the bench which also comprised justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant.On being told by senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Flipkart, that the time to respond to the CCI was expiring on August 9 itself, the Bench extended the time by four more weeks which was objected to by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the CCI.Mehta said that a week should be given to these firms as in COVID times people mostly shop online through these companies.The Karnataka High Court had on July 23 junked the plea of Amazon-Flipkart against the CCI probe for alleged violations of the competition law.The high court had said that the e-commerce firms had no need to shy away from an inquiry if they were not involved in violations.“The inquiry cannot be crushed at this stage. If the appellants aren’t involved in violations of any provisions of the competition law, they should not feel shy in facing an inquiry by the Competition Commission of India,” the bench had observed.It had added that the appeals were devoid of merits and substance and deserved to be dismissed.The CCI’s January 2020 probe order had followed a complaint by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, whose members comprise many traders dealing in smart phones and related accessories.Challenging the order, the two e-commerce giants had approached the Karnataka High Court but a single judge bench of Justice P S Dinesh Kumar had dismissed it saying that it would be unwise to prejudge the issues raised by the petitioners in these writ petitions at this stage and scuttle the investigation.

This government no longer deserves the trust of the people, including the farmers, and has no right to continue in power,” BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik told PTI.Delhi Police had granted permission for the protest at Jantar Mantar from July 22 till August 9 with a maximum of 200 protesters at the site.A senior police officer said, "Today is the last day of the protest by farmers at Jantar Mantar here. As per permission given, they held their protest peacefully for all these days and will leave Jantar Mantar after their protest this (Monday) evening." The protesters, otherwise, have been camping at Delhi's border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November 2020 with a demand that the Centre repeal the three farm laws introduced last year.“On this very day (August 9) several years ago, Indians had called for the British to quit India; today we call for the BJP to leave (the seat of) power,” Malik said, referring to the landmark 1942 episode of the national freedom movement.“We are not going to seek any further permission for the protest at Jantar Mantar because the government is just not concerned. We will pass the 'no confidence motion' against it and return to the (Delhi) borders where protest will continue until our demands are met,” he added.

09-08-2021||Mumbai||Renaming Khel Ratna award not people's wish, but 'political game': Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Monday claimed the Centre's decision to rename the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award after hockey legend Dhyan Chand was not the people's wish, but a "political game".An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' also asked what was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's contribution to cricket that a stadium (in Ahmedabad) was named after him.India's highest sporting honour Khel Ratna Award, which was named after former PM Rajiv Gandhi, was on Friday rechristened in the honour of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand, following the admirable performance of both men's and women's hockey teams at the Tokyo Olympics.Making the announcement, Prime Minister Modi said he had been getting many requests from citizens across India to name the Khel Ratna after Major Dhyan Chand.On Monday, the editorial in 'Saamana' said late prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were victims of terror acts. There could be political differences with leaders like them, but their sacrifices towards the country's development cannot be mocked, it opined."Changing the name of the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award to Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award is not the people's wish, but a political game,” it claimed."Major Dhyan Chand could have been honoured without insulting Rajiv Gandhi's sacrifice. But, the country has lost such tradition and culture. It would have made Dhyan Chand sad in heaven," the Sena said.It said just because the Modi government changed the name of the award does not mean earlier governments had forgotten Dhyan Chand.It is not a great honour for Dhyan Chand to use his name for the award by replacing it with the name of Rajiv Gandhi, who had made "supreme sacrifice for the country", the Sena said."Removing Rajiv Gandhi's name (from the award) is political hatred," it claimed.The Marathi publication said the question raised by some BJP leaders about whether Rajiv Gandhi ever held a hockey stick in his hands was valid."People are also asking what Narendra Modi has done for cricket that a stadium in Ahmedabad is named after him by replacing the (earlier) name of Sardar Patel,” it said.The same yardstick should have be applied while renaming a Delhi stadium (Feroz Shah Kotla) after (late BJP leader) Arun Jaitely. People are also asking these questions, the Sena said.The editorial also claimed that while the Modi government was celebrating India's wins at the just-concluded Olympic Games, it had cut down the sports budget by Rs 300 crore.When the Sahara Group withdrew sponsorship of the men's and women's hockey teams, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik accepted their guardianship, it stated."Hence, the Odisha government's contribution is equally important in the (men's) hockey team's win (at the Olympics)," it added.When Khashaba Jadhav had won the first individual Olympic medal (bronze) for the country, why no one thought of setting up a 'Khel Ratna' award in his name? the Sena asked.

09-08-2021||Kochi||Failure to pay Rs 110 fees under Special Marriage Act delays interfaith couple's wedding||Failure to pay on time a requisite fee of Rs 110 along with an intended notice of wedding under the Special Marriage Act delayed the registration of an inter-faith couple's nuptials and led to postponing of the bride-to-be's return to Saudi Arabia where she works as a nurse.The couple also failed to get any relief from the Kerala High Court which said that registration or solemnisation of a marriage under the Special Marriage Act will not happen if notice of the intended wedding is not accompanied by the requisite fees.The couple had initially given the notice of the intended wedding to the Marriage Officer on June 11, but had not remitted the requisite fees along with that.It was only a few weeks later that the couple realised that the notice had not been published as the fees were not paid as required under the Kerala Special Marriage Rules of 1958, advocate R Rajesh, who appeared for them in the high court, told PTI.As they paid the amount only on July 9, the date for registration -- which can happen only after 30 days from publishing the notice -- could not be done before August 5, the date when the bride was to return to Saudi Arabia.Since the Marriage Officer was refusing to register their nuptials before August 5, the couple had moved the high court, which too did not grant any relief.The court had said that it was clear from the Kerala Special Marriage Rules of 1958 that "if notice is given without remitting the fees, the same cannot be considered as one given in conformity with the requirement of the Special Marriage Act"."If that be so, the Marriage Officer is not obliged to act upon such notice," the court had said in its August 4 order.Rajesh, told PTI, that since the couple got no relief from the high court, the woman has postponed her return by a few more days and a date for registration of their marriage would be given by the Marriage Officer after August 9.He said that a marriage certificate was necessary for the woman to get a visa for her husband so that he can join her in Saudi Arabia.

09-08-2021||New Delhi||SC notice to Centre, others on plea seeking disclosure of data on Covid vaccines’ clinical trials||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre, Bharat Biotech, SII and others to respond to a plea seeking directions for disclosure of data on clinical trials of Covid vaccines as also on post-jab cases.The apex court, while referring to the issue of “vaccine hesitancy” in India, especially in rural areas, observed that the World Health Organisation (WHO) says that nobody will be safe unless everybody is vaccinated.“We are fighting with vaccine hesitancy in this country. The WHO says one of the major problems in the world is vaccine hesitancy. If we launch an investigation into this, would it not be throwing doubts in the minds of people,” a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose observed.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, said it is not an “anti-vaccine petition” and transparency on the issue was needed as disclosure of data would rather clear all the doubts and hesitancy.Bhushan, while making clear that the petitioner was not seeking to stop the ongoing vaccination, said the plea had also raised the issue of coercive vaccine mandates being issued like putting certain restriction on travel if someone is not vaccinated.The bench issued notices to the Centre and others, including Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India (SII), seeking their responses on the petition within four weeks.Observing that it does not want to get into the scientific decisions taken by the experts, the bench said personal autonomy will have to be balanced with public health.“We will issue notice.

Many of the passes that lie close to the border with China are off limits to civilian visitors.Till Umling La was opened to vehicles, the 17,582-foot-high Khardung La in Ladakh, also a popular tourist destination, was said to be the highest motorable pass in the world. Other passes that lie above 18,000 feet include Gyong La (Siachen, Muling la (Uttarakhand), Sia La (Siachen), Marsimik La (Ladakh), Mana Pass and Sin La (both in Uttarakhand).Maintaining passes and roads and tracks in the vicinity of the border is the responsibility of the BRO that was established in May 1960. Functioning under the Ministry of Defence, its operations spread across 19 states and three union territories as well as neighbouring countries such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, Myanmar, Tajikistan and Sri Lanka.Besides those in the Himalayas, many of which are well known and popular with tourists and adventurers, there are other passes in the country that lie at much lower elevations, including those in the Western Ghats and Nilgiris in peninsular India.Other activities by the BRO in various parts of the country to commemorate the Independence Day this year include 75 medical camps, plantation drives at 75 locations and 75 school samvad to motivate children through interactions and lectures.In addition, gallantry award recipients and war heroes are also being felicitated, a defence spokesperson said.

On July 28, it had arrested Dhami Reddy Konda Reddy and Pamula Sudheer. Lingareddy Rajasekhar Reddy, who was residing in Kuwait, was arrested on July 9 when he landed in India. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-held-over-posts-against-judges-cbi-294956

This is inappropriate considering that the occasion is of great national importance. There is clearly a need to remind the officers that it is their duty to attend the Independence Day ceremony,” a senior government functionary quoting the Cabinet Secretary’s letter said.In his letter, Gauba added that in view of social distancing requirements due to the Covid-19 pandemic, officers of only joint-secretary level and above have been invited for the ceremony this year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-secretary-warns-officers-against-not-attending-i-day-event-294957

Indonesia and Thailand are increasingly looking at alternatives after losing trust in Chinese vaccines, say highly placed sources and India along with its vaccine partners is ready to fill the breach. There are ongoing studies of the efficacy rate, but Sinovac may be losing the race to others on both effectiveness and a smooth supply chain.Sources said Sinovac would also lose out on cost-effectiveness once India-made vaccines priced at around $10 will compete with Chinese offerings at close to $40.Besides multiple production centres for the Russian Sputnik vaccine, the government is pursuing manufacturing facilities of Pfizer, J&J and Moderna vaccines. It is not clear if the western vaccines will be part of the Quad initiative, but are planned to cover future requirements such as boosters and single shots.“We are part of the discussions with major vaccine manufacturers,” Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had said at a recent WHO interaction. Malaysia has decided to stop administering the Sinovac vaccine on efficacy issues. Indonesia may give booster shots to health workers inoculated with Sinovac.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/little-trust-in-chinese-vaccines-india-set-to-benefit-294959

09-08-2021||---||Mixed Covishield, Covaxin doses produce better immunity: ICMR||New Delhi, August 8The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) today said a mixed Covid immunisation routine, with a dose of Covishield followed by one of Covaxin, was safe and elicited a better immune response than the regime where uniform two doses of any of the two vaccines were administered.Effective against Alpha, Beta, Delta “The immunisation with a heterologous combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine (Covishield) followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine (Covaxin) is safe and elicits better immunogenicity than two doses of homologous vaccination using the same vaccines,” said the study, published as a pre-print but yet to be peer-reviewed.Led by ICMR scientist Rajni Kant, the study said the findings had an important implication for the Covid-19 vaccination programme wherein heterologous immunisation would pave the way for induction of improved and better protection against the variant strains of SARS-CoV-2.“Such mixed regimens will also help to overcome the challenges of shortfall of particular vaccines and remove hesitancy around vaccines in people’s mind that could Mixed Covishield, Covaxin doses...have genesis in programmatic ‘errors’, especially in settings where multiple Covid-19 vaccines are being used. However, to conclusively prove these findings, a multicentre random clinical trial needs to be carried out,” say study authors at a time when the WHO is yet to issue guidance on mixing of vaccine doses. The study, titled ‘Serendipitous Covid-19 Vaccine-Mix in Uttar Pradesh, India: Safety and Immunogenicity Assessment of a Heterologous Regime’, also found that no major systemic adverse events were reported and reactogenicity profile of the participants of heterologous group (mixed vaccine) was comparable to homologous groups.“Despite the high median age of the participants of the heterologous group (62 years) which got mixed vaccine in our study, the reactogenicity profile demonstrated that mixing of the two vaccines based on different platforms is safe,” the study shows.The study followed 18 Uttar Pradesh residents who inadvertently received mixed doses when the inoculation plan was expanded and 40 recipients each of Covishield and Covaxin. The study authors say the sample size of 18 participants was small and, therefore, a larger trial was needed to further corroborate the findings of the current study. The authors said theirs was the first report of heterologous (mixed vaccines) immunisation with an adenovirus vector-based and an inactivated whole virion vaccine in humans demonstrating safety and significantly improved immunogenicity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mixed-covishield-covaxin-doses-produce-better-immunity-icmr-294932
09-08-2021||New Delhi||Parliament panel wants schools reopened, cites hazards||The Standing Committee on Education, Women and Children said in its report to Parliament this week that closure of schools due to Covid-induced lockdowns had aided child marriages and child labour and hazards of continued closure were too serious to be ignored.Panel Suggests slew of measuresBacking school reopening, the panel said, “The closure of schools has impacted the social fabric of families in a negative manner, leading to early marriages or child marriages and increased involvement of children in household chores. The present situation has exacerbated the learning crisis that existed even before the pandemic with the marginal and vulnerable children getting adversely affected.”Not just the Parliament panel, the ICMR too has backed the idea saying children could handle viral infections better than adults, as shown by recent evidence.The closure of schools for over a year had a deep impact on the wellbeing of students and their mental health, the panel chaired by BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe noted. It said the confinement of young children within the four walls of the house, where they were unable to attend school, had altered the relationship between the parent and the children adversely.“The learning loss caused by school closure is a huge deficit and is likely to impair the cognitive capabilities of students. This might have a debilitating effect on vulnerable sections of the society like poor and rural students, marginalised sections of society and young women who might have been unable to connect to any form of digital education during the pandemic,” the panel said.The ICMR today reiterated its green signal to reopening of schools.“Children can handle viral infections better. Younger children have lesser ace receptors in the lungs, which the virus uses to bind to the cells. Our surveys tell us that the level of exposure of children is almost the same as adults. Also, Scandinavian nations did not close primary schools through any Covid wave. Our advice would be to open primary schools first and then the secondary sections but all staffers must be fully vaccinated before the schools can be reopened,” ICMR Director General Balram Bhagrava said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-panel-wants-schools-reopened-cites-hazards-294933
09-08-2021||Silchar/Guwahati||Truck movement resumes 13 days after Assam-Mizoram border clash||Long lines of trucks from the rest of the country rumbled into Mizoram across a disputed border with neighbouring Assam on Sunday, some 13 days after a bloody clash between the police forces of the two states.After assurances of police escorts given on Saturday, truckers in ones and twos started moving out of Dholai near the tense border, where they had parked their trucks, ever since violence broke out.What was a trickle on Saturday night became a flood of vehicles moving in convoys, guarded by police escorts, ferrying essential supplies including medicines, diesel and cooking gas, to landlocked Mizoram, which had been complaining of shortages of medicines and gasoline.Truckers had kept their trucks parked and refused to move even after an informal blockade enforced by locals in Assam soon after violence broke out was lifted more than a week back. They started moving after two Assam ministers on Saturday convinced them it was safe to travel across the border to Mizoram.Suklabaidya said movement of essential commodities from Hailakandi district to Mizoram, which had been hit since the violent face-off between the two states, too resumed from Sunday.“Transportation through rail would begin once tracks, which were damaged during demonstrations following the July 26 flare-up, are repaired,” he added.Kolasib SP Vanlalfaka Ralte said more than 50 vehicles have entered Mizoram since Saturday night till Sunday morning. “Traffic movement between the two states as of now is quite smooth…However, we are still on alert as untoward incident can happen at any time,” Ralte said.Silchar’s Mizoram House Liaison Officer Kaptluanga said before trucking began in earnest, some nine Mizoram-bound vehicles were attacked by miscreants at Lailapur on Saturday. Some drivers, however, remained reluctant to move across the border. Rahul Hussain, a stranded driver, said they were willing to enter Mizoram, but demanded written assurances. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/truck-movement-resumes-13-days-after-assam-mizoram-border-clash-294944
09-08-2021||New Delhi||Threat to human rights is highest in police stations: CJI||Expressing serious concern over custodial torture and human rights violations by police, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Sunday asked the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) to undertake “nationwide sensitisation” of police officers.“The threat to human rights and bodily integrity are the highest in Police Stations. Custodial torture and other police atrocities are problems that still prevail in our society… Going by the recent reports even the privileged are not spared third-degree treatment,” the CJI said while releasing NALSA’s vision and mission statement along with its mobile app.The mobile app is expected to help the poor and needy people in applying for legal aid and seeking victim compensation.“To keep police excesses in check dissemination of information about the constitutional right to legal aid and availability of free legal aid services is necessary. The installation of display boards and outdoor hoardings in every Police Station/Prison is a step in this direction. However, NALSA must also actively carry out nationwide sensitisation of Police Officers,” he suggested.With an average of almost five persons a day 1,697 died in custody (1,584 in judicial custody and 113 in police custody) across India between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, the Centre had told Parliament last year.In a move aimed at checking police brutality, the Supreme Court had in December 2020 ordered the Centre, states, and union territories to install CCTVs with night vision cameras in each police station, including central probe agencies such as CBI, ED, NIA, etc. across India. However, the order was yet to be fully complied with.The CJI said: “In spite of constitutional declarations and guarantees, lack of effective legal representation at the police stations is a huge detriment to arrested/detained persons. The decisions taken in these early hours will later determine the ability of the accused to defend himself”.Noting that majority of those who do not have access to justice were from rural and remote areas which suffered from lack of connectivity, the CJI said he has already written to the government emphasising the need to bridge the digital divide on a priority basis.NALSA Executive Chairman Justice UU Lalit said besides spreading awareness about legal services through post offices and police stations, Bar Councils and law colleges can also be roped in.Terming the project “Access to Justice” as an “unending mission”, the CJI said, “If we want to remain as a society governed by the rule of law, it is imperative for us to bridge the gap of accessibility to justice between the highly privileged and the most vulnerable. For all times to come, we must remember that the realities of socio-economic diversity which prevail in our nation, cannot ever be a reason for denial of rights.”He said: “Although, a majority of our population is eligible for the aforesaid services, it is an undeniable truth that, still, there are significant barriers in accessing the relevant legal information”.“If, as an institution, the judiciary wants to garner the faith of the citizens, we have to make everyone feel assured that we exist for them. For the longest time, the vulnerable population has lived outside the system of justice,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/threat-to-human-rights-is-highest-in-police-stations-cji-294874

09-08-2021||New Delhi||‘Listen to us’: Opposition tells govt as it releases video of Members speaking on Pegasus, farmers||The opposition’s strategy of speaking on the Pegasus snooping row and farm laws during discussions of bills in the Rajya Sabha has now been compiled in a three-minute video in an attempt to make the government listen to their demands, leaders said on Sunday.The video, released by the TMC on Sunday morning from RS MP Derek O’Brien’s handle, urges, “Mr Modi come listen to us”.Opposition party sources indicated that over the last few weeks, leaders have realised that the disruptions by them in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are not enough. It was important to say the words, “farmers”, “Pegasus” and spyware on the floor of the Houses.Asked about the opposition MPs’ strategy of raising such issues while seeking to speak on bills in Parliament, O’Brien said that their “strategy was deliberate”.“When the official channels are being denied, this is a new way to reach the masses,” said O’Brien who is also the leader of the TMC in the Rajya Sabha.“PM @narendramodi seems to have lost his nerves. Why is he not keen on answering questions in Parliament? The opposition parties are ready for discussions in Parliament, but @BJP4India govt is stalling the proceedings so that the truth doesn’t get to the people,” Congress’s Mallikarjun Kharge said in a tweet posting the video.The video, which has been compiled using clips from RSTV, comprises statements made by the opposition MPs in the Upper House, with the words “farmer” and “Pegasus” in the opening lines.PM @narendramodi seems to have lost his nerves. Why is he not keen on answering questions in the Parliament?The opposition parties are ready for discussions in the Parliament, but @BJP4India Govt is stalling the proceedings so that the truth doesn’t get to the people. pic.twitter.com/1IpOxj2TX8  “You are not allowing the discussion we have been asking for the past 14 days and the discussions we can do later. You are passing that bill now. If you have courage, begin the discussions on Pegasus now,” Kharge is heard saying in the video on the floor of the House.The compilation includes opposition speakers like Vandana Chavan of the NCP who raised the Pegasus issue, accusing the government of “not listening to the people”.RJD’s Manoj Jha too is seen speaking on the spyware issue. “Pegasus has reached everyone’s house. We have to discuss this,” says Jha.Congress’s Deepinder Hooda raised the issue of farmers stating that he would talk about the matter if his “microphone is not switched off”. The CPI(M) accused the government of “stealing” parliamentary democracy, while TMC’s Sukhendu Shekar Roy raised the issue of “freedom of speech in Parliament”.The other parties which have representation in the video include Samajwadi Party, TRS, DMK and AAP.One of the leaders in the video, Shiv Sena MP in Rajya Sabha Priyanka Chaturvedi said in a democracy if the government of the day has a responsibility, so does the opposition.“Whether it is about farmers, about the economy, safety and security of women, just the word mentioned by the opposition makes them silence our voices, makes them adjourn Parliament, makes them mute our microphones," Chaturvedi said."Our inability to be heard by a government which is so brazen has made us realise that the only way we can speak and make our point heard is when such bills are being discussed and passed in such a hurry," Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said.CPI (M) leader and RS MP Elamaram Kareem said that speaking during the discussion on bills was the only way to make the government listen.“This tactic is going to be continued the coming week as well. There is no other option as the government is not admitting our motions. Everyone is seeing how the chairperson is behaving, switching off microphones even as the Pegasus word is being uttered. The entire opposition is one on this and we will stick by it till the government relents,” said Kareem, who is the leader of his party in the Upper House.Chaturvedi also hit out at the government over the alleged switching off of microphones when opposition leaders raise certain issues, saying it shows the intolerance of the government.“By muting our mics, by trying to suppress our voices, they think they can silence us then they should be rest assured that we will raise our voice further and our voices will get louder,” the Shiv Sena MP said.Senior Congress leader and party spokesperson Manish Tewari said that what is happening in the House is a “complete murder of democracy”.“The institution of Parliament is being trifled with by the NDA-BJP government,” said Tewari, slamming the government for getting bills passed when the House is not in order.“There is a time honoured convention that legislation is never passed in din and it is not even discussed when the House is not in order,” he said.Since the start of the Monsoon Session on July 19, parliamentary proceedings have been continuously witnessing disruptions due to protests by opposition parties and a logjam has persisted over their demand for a discussion on the Pegasus snooping row.The opposition has also been strongly protesting against the price rise issue and demanding the repeal of the farm laws.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers, including that of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Union ministers Prahlad Singh Patel and Ashwini Vaishnaw, businessman Anil Ambani, and at least 40 journalists, were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Israeli firm NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/listen-to-us-opposition-tells-govt-as-it-releases-video-of-members-speaking-on-pegasus-farmers-294843

The moment he landed in India, the officers took him into their custody”, an official said.The arrests were made by the CBI in the case in which it had booked 16 individuals for allegedly posting defamatory content against the judges.The Andhra Pradesh High Court had directed the agency to probe the case and submit a report to it in a sealed cover.“It was alleged that the accused, by intentionally targeting the judiciary, made derogatory posts on social media platforms against judges and judiciary, following some court verdicts delivered by the judges of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh,” Joshi said.After registration of the case, the CBI traced 13 of the 16 accused named in the FIR on various digital platforms, he said.“Three out of them were found to be abroad. The CBI has so far examined 11 out of the above 13 accused persons and arrested five out of them. Evidence against the remaining six accused persons is being evaluated for further necessary legal action. CBI is pursuing to secure the presence of two other accused said to be abroad for their examination,” Joshi said.The agency carried out searches at the premises of the accused persons that led to the information that one of them was allegedly using a passport in a different name, he said.During the searches, incriminating documents were found, the CBI spokesperson added.“Action was also initiated by CBI, after it had registered this case to get objectionable posts removed from the social media platforms, public domains and a lot of such posts or accounts were removed from the internet,” Joshi said.The investigation is underway, including through the channels of MLAT and Interpol, to collect evidence from abroad, he said.Taking cognisance of the alleged defamatory posts, the high court had directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the role of prominent persons in the southern state who were intentionally targeting Supreme Court and high court judges.“...the postings were made to bring hatred, contempt, incite disaffection and ill-will against the high court and honourable judges,” the court had noted.Recently, in an unrelated case, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had passed stern comments on the working of the CBI and other agencies with regards to complaints raised by judges.The CJI said though judges complain to the chief justice or the head of the district concerned, when they complain to the police, the CBI or others, these agencies do not respond.“They think it is not a priority item for them. The IB, CBI they are not helping the judiciary at all. I am making this statement with a sense of responsibility and I know the incident that is the reason I am saying this. I do not want to divulge more than this,” the CJI had said while hearing a suo motu case on the issue of safeguarding courts and protecting judges in the wake of a recent incident of the alleged mowing down of a judge in Dhanbad.

09-08-2021||New Delhi||Covishield, Covaxin combination gives better results, says ICMR||A study by ICMR involving 98 people, 18 of whom had inadvertently received Covishield as first dose and Covaxin as the second in Uttar Pradesh, showed that combining these two Covid-19 vaccines elicited better immunogenicity than two doses of the same vaccine.The study also found that immunisation with a combination of Covishield and Covaxin was safe, and the adverse effects were also found to be similar when compared to the same dose regimen.The study titled ‘Serendipitous Covid-19 Vaccine-Mix in Uttar Pradesh, India: Safety and Immunogenicity Assessment of a Heterologous Regime' has been uploaded on medRxiv, a preprint server and is yet to be peer reviewed."To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which reports the effects of heterologous prime-boost vaccination with an adenovirus vectored vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine," the researchers said.The immunisation program against Covid-19 in India started with two vaccines--adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine Covishield and inactivated whole virion BBV152 -Covaxin--and homologous prime-boost approach was followed. However, 18 individuals, under the national program, in Siddarthnagar, Uttar Pradesh inadvertently received Covishield as the first jab and Covaxin as the second.The nationwide vaccination program at this time had entered in its fourth month of its existence and the event of mixed dosing raised considerable anxiety in the public domain with a potential to contributing to vaccine hesitancy.The study was conducted against this backdrop.So, including these 18 individuals who had received one dose of Covishield and second dose of Covaxin, 40 recipients of two doses of Covishield and 40 recipients of two doses of Covaxin, were recruited in the study. The study duration was from May to June 2021."We compared the safety and immunogenicity profile of them (18 individuals) against that of those receiving either Covishield or Covaxin. Lower and similar adverse events following immunisation in all three groups underlined the safety of the combination vaccine-regime."Immunogenicity profile against Alpha, Beta and Delta variants in the heterologous group was superior and IgG antibody and neutralising antibody response of the participants was also significantly higher compared to that in the homologous groups," the study stated."The findings suggest that immunisation with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine was not only safe but also elicited better immunogenicity," it said.The reactogenicity analysis was carried out based on solicited local and systemic AEFIs reported in the three groups within seven days of immunisation. None of the participants enrolled in the study had any serious AEFI within 30 minutes of immunisation with the first or second dose.The most common local AEFI reported after the first and second dose was pain at the injection site.No other local AEFI such as erythema, induration, pruritis or pustule formation was recorded by any of the participants. Most commonly reported systemic AEFI were pyrexia and malaise.No other systemic AEFIs like urticaria, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia or cough was reported. The pyrexia was of low to moderate grade and was managed by administration of paracetamol and subsided in all participants within three to four days post vaccination, according to the study."Despite the high median age of the participants of the heterologous group (62 years) in our study, the reactogenicity profile demonstrated that mixing of the two vaccines based on different platforms is safe," the study said.The study demonstrates that immunisation with a heterologous combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine is safe and elicits better immunogenicity than two doses of homologous vaccination, using the same vaccines.These findings have an important implication for the Covid-19 vaccination program wherein heterologous immunisation will pave the way for induction of improved and better protection against the variant strains of SARS-CoV-2.Such mixed regimens will also help to overcome the challenges of shortfall of particular vaccines and remove hesitancy around vaccines in people's mind that could have genesis in programmatic 'errors' especially in settings where multiple Covid-19 vaccines are being used, the study highlighted.However, to conclusively prove these findings a multicentre RCT needs to be carried out, the study underlined. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covishield-covaxin-combination-gives-better-results-says-icmr-294826
09-08-2021||New Delhi||Disclose number of EVMs, VVPATs that showed defects in firmware audit: CIC||The Central Information Commission (CIC) has ordered the disclosure of the total number of EVMs and VVPATs that showed defects and errors during testing and evaluation of their firmware by the Standardization, Testing and Quality Certification (STQC) Directorate.The ruling of the CIC came on a petition of activist Venkatesh Nayak, who had approached the STQC Directorate under the Ministry of Electronics and IT, seeking information related to audit and testing of firmware of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) of M3 and M2 generation and Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) units manufactured by ECIL and BEL, and used in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.He had also sought to know the total number of M3 and M2 EVMs and VVPATs whose firmware were tested and evaluated by the STQC team, the total number of machines whose software was found not to be a perfect match with the reference software provided by ECIL and BEL for the purpose of testing and evaluation, and the number of machines that revealed other kinds of defects or errors during the testing and evaluation of firmware.The information was denied to him citing section 8 (1)(d) of the RTI Act which allows exemption of information pertaining to commercial confidence from disclosure.On the question of total number of machines that were tested and those which showed defects, Information Commissioner Vanaja N Sarna held the plea of Nayak “justified”, calling it “statistical information” which can be given and “there is no exemption applicable in disclosing the numbers”.In addition, Nayak had also asked for the details of officers of the STQC, a third-party independent audit agency, who did the audit, its dates and geographical locations where it was conducted among other details.The commission allowed the STQC to withhold names and designations of auditing officers, but asked it to disclose dates and geographical locations of the audit done by it.“...the dates are eminently disclosable and can be given to the appellant. In respect of point no. 3, the geographical locations without specifying further details can be given. During the hearing, the CPIO stated that the testing was done at various locations including at BEL and ECIL. The specific locations can therefore be provided,” she said.Nayak had said his RTI application was aimed at obtaining information to ascertain the role and duties and the performance of such duties by the public authority while carrying out third-party audits of the software or firmware embedded in the EVMs and the VVPATs in compliance with the recommendations of the TEC constituted by the Election Commission.The issue of EVMs in an election is hotly contested among political parties and sections of people.

09-08-2021||Vijay Mohan||In a first, two women combatised officers join ITBP as Assistant Commandant||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 8In a first, two women have joined the Indo Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBP) as combatised officers. Heretofore, women officers in the ITBP were serving in the medical branch or were on deputation from the Indian Police Service at top echelons.Prakriti and Diksha were “pipped” as Assistant Commandant during a passing-out parade held at the ITBP Academy in Mussoorie today after completing their 52-week long basic training. They will be posted as company commanders in ITBP battalions, a spokesperson said.Both the women officers are technical graduates. While Prakriti is an electrical engineer and the daughter of a retired IAF warrant officer, Diksha holds a B.Tech degree and is the daughter of an Inspector serving with the ITBP. They have been posted to the force’s 14th and 2nd Battalion, respectively.A total of 53 officers from the 26th Assistant Commandant (General Duty) and 49th Assistant Commandant (Engineers) passed out today. The parade was reviewed by Uttarakhand Chief Minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami. ITBP Director General, SS Deswal and other senior officers were also present on the occasion. A book, ‘History of ITBP’, was also released by the Chief Minister.ITBP had initiated the process of induction of women as combatised officers in 2016 through the entrance examination for Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).While women have joined the border guarding force as junior commanders for the first time, women are being inducted as constables in the rank and file for the past few years and are undertaking operational tasks along the Line of Actual Control with China and other security related duties. The force has a strength of about 83,000 personnel out of which about 1,500 are women.Of the five CAPFs that function under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the ITBP was the only force that had not yet inducted women officers in supervisory combat roles owing to its primary task of guarding the difficult Sino-India border.Other CAPFs, including the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), have been inducting direct-entry women officers through the UPSC for a long time. The Border Security Force (BSF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) were allowed to directly induct women officers in 2013 and 2014, respectively.All CAPFs also have combatised women constables in their rank and file, with their total strength being about 30,000. The CISF has the highest number of women personnel followed by the CRPF.In compliance of recommendations given by the Parliamentary Committee on Empowerment of Women in its sixth report, directions were issued to all CAPFs to bring percentage of women in the forces to five per centIn 2016, the Central Government also decided to reserve 33 per cent posts at the constable level for women in the CRPF and the CISF and 14-15 per cent of such posts in the border guarding forces, i.e,, the BSF, SSB and ITBP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-a-first-two-women-combatised-officers-join-itbp-as-assistant-commandant-294822
09-08-2021||London||UK eases restrictions on travellers from India||The UK on Sunday eased travel restrictions for India by moving the country from its “red” to “amber” list, which means fully vaccinated Indian passengers will no longer be subjected to a compulsory 10-day hotel quarantine on their arrival in Britain.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has confirmed that all arrivals from India who have been vaccinated in India, which is on the amber list as at 4 am local time on Sunday, are required to isolate at home or their designated location mentioned on the compulsory locator form.While the requirement for a compulsory 10-day self-isolation in a government-approved facility at an additional cost of 1,750 pounds per head will no longer apply, only travellers vaccinated in the UK or Europe would qualify for an exemption of the home quarantine requirement. “We recognise there are a large variety of COVID-19 vaccines being administered worldwide and work is ongoing to determine which non-UK vaccines and certification solutions to recognise,” a DHSC source said.There had been some speculation over Covishield, the Serum Institute of India made Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, being considered within the wider UK-approved vaccines ambit.However, the government has clarified that the India-made version of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine so far approved by the UK’s Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is branded as Vaxzevria and that is the only one currently recognised under the exemption rules.Under the legal rules for countries on the amber list of the UK’s traffic light system, passengers must take a COVID test three days before departure and book in advance for two COVID tests to be taken upon arrival in England as well as complete a passenger locator form on arrival.On arrival in England, the passengers must quarantine at home or in the place they have confirmed as their location for 10 days and take a COVID-19 test on or before day two and on or after day eight.Under-18s and those fully vaccinated in the UK are exempt from the home quarantine, as well as those who have received both jabs in the EU and US.Also exempt are those “fully vaccinated in the UK or under the UK vaccine programme overseas; under 18 on the day you arrive in England and resident in the UK or in a country with a vaccination programme approved by the UK; and part of a UK-approved vaccine trial”.All regularly scheduled international flights remain suspended. However, under a bilateral agreement between the UK and Indian governments, a limited number of flights between India and the UK continue to operate.Airlines have reported a massive surge in bookings soon after the announcement of India moving off the Red List was made on Wednesday, a move overwhelmingly welcomed by the Indian diaspora in the UK hoping for India visits during the ongoing summer break in the country.India has been on the Red List since end-April when the Delta variant was at its peak, which meant an effective ban on travel except for returning British residents who had to self-isolate in a government-sanctioned hotel at a considerable additional expense.The update of the travel list this week came alongside an announcement that the cost for solo travellers from destinations still on the Red List staying at a quarantine hotel will go up from August 12, from 1,750 pounds to 2,285 pounds. The charge for an additional adult sharing a room will increase from 650 pounds to 1,430 pounds.According to the government, this is to “better reflect the increased costs involved”.

09-08-2021||Ajay Banerjee||India building warships to hunt down subs close to its shores||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 7India is adding to its ability to hunt down submarines, especially in shallow waters, or in areas closer to the coast. All along the western coast, there are vast areas of shallow waters. Several of the refineries, crude-oil moorings, strategic oil storage reserves and key ports are on the west coast.Yesterday, the project to make eight Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Craft (ASW-SWC) kicked off at the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata. The keel of the first such warship was ‘laid virtually’ by Vice Chief of the Indian Navy Vice Admiral SN Ghormade.Project to make 8 Shallow Water Craft Guarding waters: 16 warships, 13k crore costFour vessels in use: INS Abhay, Ajay, Akshay, AgrayThe ‘keel laying’ is a major milestone activity in the shipbuilding process and indicates the amalgamation of various blocks towards construction of a ship. The project at the GRSE, a company owned by the Ministry of Defence, is in collaboration with private Larsen and Toubro (L&T). This is the second part of the project, the other one of making eight similar warships is being done at Cochin Shipyard Limited, Kochi. The first steel cutting at the shipyard in Kerala was done in December last year. The project to make these 16 warships is close to Rs 13,000 crore. At present, the Indian Navy uses four vessels — INS Abhay, Ajay, Akshay and Agray — for scouting submarines in shallow waters. These are more than 30 years old and are customised variants of the Russian Pauk-class corvettes.Besides these specialised shallow water sub-hunters, the Navy has a brand new fleet of submarine hunting warships called the ‘Kamorta class’ that ventures to high seas. In the air, specialised aircraft called the Boeing P8I keep an eye on submarines and carry anti-submarine missiles, the Harpoon. The Navy has 10 such surveillance planes. India has also contracted for 24 specialised submarine hunting helicopters from US company Lockheed Martin, to replace three-decade old Russian Kamov-28 copters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-building-warships-to-hunt-down-subs-close-to-its-shores-294557
