14-08-2021||Islamabad||PM Modi’s Partition Horrors Remembrance Day ‘political stunt’: Pakistan||Pakistan on Saturday termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that India will observe August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day as a “political stunt” that only seeks to divide.Prime Minister Modi announced on Saturday that August 14 will now be observed as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day in memory of the struggles and sacrifices of people, and said the pain of partition can never be forgotten.Pakistan was carved out as a Muslim country after the division of India by the British in 1947. Millions of people were displaced and many lakhs of them lost their lives in the communal violence that followed.Modi noted that millions of people were displaced and many lost their lives due to the mindless hate and violence caused by the partition.May the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day keep “reminding us of the need to remove the poison of social divisions, disharmony and further strengthen the spirit of oneness, social harmony, and human empowerment,” he said.In a statement about the events of 1947, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said that no modern state is so much in contradiction with itself as the Indian state.“We are sure that the people of goodwill in India would completely reject this political and publicity stunt that only seeks to divide,” the FO said.The FO said that decision by the Indian leader was hypocritical and one-sided.It is shameful that the practitioners of Hindutva ideology would so hypocritically and one-sidedly invoke the tragic events and mass migration that occurred in the wake of Independence in 1947, the FO statement said.India will celebrate its 75th Independence Day on Sunday while Pakistan celebrated its Independence Day a day ahead on Saturday, August 14.Hours after Modi’s announcement, the Union Home Ministry notified August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said Partition Horrors Remembrance Day will be a fitting tribute to all those who lost their lives due to the partition of the nation and were displaced from their roots.Declaration of such a day would remind the present and future generations of Indians of the pain and suffering faced by the people during the partition, it said.The partition caused one of the largest migrations in human history, affecting about 20 million people, it noted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modis-partition-horrors-remembrance-day-political-stunt-pakistan-297599
14-08-2021||Jaipur||Former Union minister Natwar Singh’s son Jagat rejoins BJP||Former External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh’s son Jagat Singh on Saturday rejoined the BJP after two-and-half years.After his induction in the presence of other BJP leaders at the party headquarters here, Singh said he had made a mistake by quitting the party.He said the BJP has given him another chance after more than two years, which he would use to propagate the Centre’s schemes in villages and hamlets.Singh, whose father Natwar Singh is a Congress veteran, was denied a ticket in the 2018 assembly election after which he left the party. Later in 2019, the two-time MLA contested on a BSP ticket from the Ramgarh seat of Alwar.The election to this seat was put off after BSP candidate Laxman Singh (62) died of a heart attack.BJP state president Satish Poonia said with Jagat Singh joining the party again, it will gain strength in eastern Rajasthan.

14-08-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus snooping: TN MP seeks AG’s consent to initiate contempt action against Home Secretary||Tamil Nadu Member of Parliament T. Thirumaavalavan has sought Attorney General KK Venugopal’s consent to initiate contempt of court proceedings against Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla and his predecessor Rajiv Gauba for alleged surveillance of a judge of the Supreme Court and its officials through Pegasus spyware.The MP has also sought permission for contempt action against directors of NSO group, which owns the spyware.According to Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, the Supreme Court or a high court may take action on its own motion or on a motion made by the Advocate-General, or any other person with written consent the Advocate-General. However, an explanation to the provision says: “In this section, the expression “Advocate-General” means— (a) in relation to the Supreme Court, the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General”.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. It had also been reported that phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted using the spyware.The top court had on August 5 expressed surprise that the Pegasus issue came to light in 2019 and no one made any serious attempt to collect verifiable material about snooping.On August 10, it had deferred to August 16 the hearing on petitions seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into Pegasus snooping controversy even as it took exception to parallel debates on social media and websites by some petitioners.Maintaining that it wasn’t against debates, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had, however, said when the matter was pending in the court, “it should be deliberated upon here” and the petitioners should observe discipline.Earlier, it had agreed to hear petitions seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into Pegasus snooping controversy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-snooping-tn-mp-seeks-ags-consent-to-initiate-contempt-action-against-home-secretary-297595

He told her that he would send her to a good school and look after her well if she married him. Eventually, he managed to persuade the girl to elope with him.With her family struggling financially since her father lost his job during lockdown, Shahida was excited about the good life that Aadil promised to give her.At the end of May, when Aadil came to take Shahida with him, child representatives of the Village Child Protection Committee alerted a social worker who stopped the wedding in time.“Aadil made me believe that I could go to a good school if I married him. He said that would also make my school admission easier,” said Shahida, who lives with her family in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district.“I agreed to his proposal as I hoped to have one square meal a day. I never thought that there might be danger lurking for me,” she said.Rita Paramick, a frontline child protection worker with Save the Children, who stopped Shahida’s wedding, said Shahida’s is one of the many cases of traffickers using social media to target children, who are spending a lot more time online as schools are closed and they can’t even go out to play.“These days, traffickers have changed their modus operandi. Social media is one platform through which they trap young children like Shahida,” she said.“Children have been out of school for more than a year now and girls like Shahida, who are living in extreme poverty, are always soft targets for predators,” she added.Mamata Sardar, a youth advocate for Save the Children in West Bengal, said girls are increasingly being lured into marriage on social media.“As most children are now at home and attending classes online, they’re glued to social media,” she said.Sardar said she has stepped up vigilance as parents of many children have lost their jobs during the pandemic, leading to an increased possibility of child trafficking.She said she has counselled at least three girls who were almost ready to marry men who contacted them on social media.“Since the second wave of the pandemic, I have intervened to stop five child marriages and convinced the girls’ parents to let them finish their education before they marry them off,” she added.In one such case, the unemployed father of a 15-year-old girl fixed her marriage so that he would have one less mouth to feed. He didn’t even consult his wife.When the girl’s mother found out, she informed a frontline child protection worker of their village in South 24 Parganas. The frontline child protection worker made the girl’s father understand that marrying her before the age of 18 was illegal and that he should let her continue her studies.Anindit Roy Chowdhury, director-Programmes and Policy, Save the Children, said child marriages have risen sharply during the pandemic and are even being held in villages that have not seen any in years.“Child marriage is extremely harmful to girls. Not only does it mean that they are unable to continue their education but also poses danger to their physical and mental health,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/traffickers-using-social-media-to-prey-on-schoolgirls-297591

14-08-2021||New Delhi||Parliament is ‘temple of country’s democracy’ to debate and decide issues of people’s well-being: Prez Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said Parliament is the “temple of the country’s democracy” which provides the highest forum to discuss, debate and decide issues for the well-being of people, remarks that came against the backdrop of the recent ruckus and continuous disruptions that led to the abrupt adjournment of the two Houses.In a televised address to the nation on the eve of the 75th Independence Day, the President also referred to the second COVID-19 wave, and said the country is yet to come out of its devastating effects. He asserted this is the time for extra care and caution, and people should not let their guard down.President Kovind also sought to address the concerns raised by protesting farmers’ unions against the three contentious farm laws, saying the series of agricultural marketing reforms will empower our ‘annadata’ farmers and help them get better price for their produce.Referring to the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, he lauded the “stellar” performance by the country’s sportspersons.President Kovind said when India won independence, many sceptics thought democracy would not survive in India.“Little did they know that roots of democracy were nurtured in this soil in ancient times, and even in modern times India was ahead of many western nations in offering franchise to all adults, regardless of any distinctions.” The founding fathers had reposed their faith in the wisdom of the people, and ‘we, the people of India’ have made India a strong democracy, he added.“We have adopted the system of parliamentary democracy. Therefore, our Parliament is the temple of our democracy which provides us highest forum where we discuss, debate and decide issues for the well-being of our people,” the President said.Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha were adjourned sine die on August 11, two days ahead of the scheduled date of August 13, after a tumultuous Monsoon session that witnessed unruly scenes in the Upper House on Wednesday when the Insurance bill was being passed.The Government and the opposition parties had traded charges over the abrupt end of the Monsoon session which was marred by continuous disruptions since it commenced on July 19.The opposition parties accused the government of crushing their voice in Parliament, “murdering” democracy and bringing “outsiders” as marshals to beat up MPs, a charge denied by the government. The government on its part had alleged that it was pre-planned by the opposition to not allow Parliament to function.Kovind also said it is a matter of great pride for all Indians that our Parliament will soon be housed in a new building.“It will be a fitting statement of our outlook. It will honour our legacy while also walking in step with the contemporary world, he said, adding that it is more than symbolic that the new building will be inaugurated in the year of the 75th anniversary of Independence.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-is-temple-of-countrys-democracy-to-debate-and-decide-issues-of-peoples-well-being-prez-kovind-297585

But when elections near, he starts diversionary politics at home,” Surjewala said.The Congress leader also shared the prime minister’s congratulatory letters to Pakistan on August 14 and tweets on March 22.Prime Minister Modi on Saturday announced August 14 will be observed as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, saying the pain of Partition can never be forgotten.He said the day will keep reminding the country of the need to remove the poison of social divisions and disharmony and further strengthen the spirit of oneness.Pakistan’s Independence Day falls on August 14.

14-08-2021|| Hailakandi (Assam)||Bomb blast on Assam-Mizoram border damages school||After a brief lull, tension along the Assam-Mizoram border escalated again on Saturday after unidentified miscreants bombed a government educational institute in Hailakandi district, triggering fear among locals, a senior police officer said.The blast that took place at Sahebmarra around midnight damaged a major portion of a primary school, close to the interstate border, though no casualty has been reported so far, Hailakandi Superintendent of Police Gaurav Upadhyaya told reporters.Locals in the area suspect that miscreants from the other side of the border bombed the school.According to the SP, more details will be available after a thorough investigation.Meanwhile, AIUDF MLA from Katlicherra, Suzam Uddin Laskar, alleged that people from Mizoram have initiated road construction work in Chuninullah area of Hailakandi, and demanded immediate action from the Assam government.He alleged that “inaction on the part of the state government has made the boundary dispute critical”.Officials in Mizoram are yet to respond to the allegation.Border dispute between Assam and Mizoram had reached a flashpoint with six Assam policemen and a civilian losing lives in a bloody conflict on July 26 in Cachar district.A series of complaints was filed in both the states against top officials, with the Mizoram Police even registering a case against Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.Assam followed it up by issuing a travel advisory cautioning people from travelling to Mizoram while several organisations resorted to a road blockade to prevent trucks from moving to the neighbouring state.It was after the Centre intervened and neutral forces were deployed along the interstate border, the situation eased considerably with both the states withdrawing the cases against each other.Two Assam ministers Atul Bora and Ashok Singhal visited Aizawl and the both the state governments subsequently issued a joint statement pledging to maintain status quo and peace along the border.The Assam government also persuaded the organisations staging a blockade to lift it and free movement of vehicles resumed from August 8.Tension along the border with Mizoram in Cachar and Hailakandi districts of Assam has been building up since October 2020 with frequent incidents of land encroachment, grenade blasts reported from these areas.The two states share a 164.6-km border spanning across Assam’s districts of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj, and Mizoram’s Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl.The long-standing dispute has its origin in two notifications—one of 1875 that differentiated Lushai Hills from the plains of Cachar, and another of 1933 that demarcates a boundary between Lushai Hills and Manipur.Mizoram insists that the boundary demarcation made in the 1875 notification be followed.

He had, however, conceded that Singh wanted a “better” portfolio.Nagaraj had also expressed his desire to have portfolios like public works department and transport.Meanwhile, BJP MLA from Krishnaraja in Mysuru district and former Minister Ramadas and MLC Yogeeshwara called on Bommai on Saturday.Speaking to reporters, Ramadas said he gave a letter in a sealed envelope to the Chief Minister.“Today I handed over a letter in the sealed cover. I told him (the Chief Minister) to read when he is free. I have explained certain things in the interest of the state and the government,” Ramadas said.He added that he has explained in his letter why he did not meet the Chief Minister during his visit to Mysuru on Monday.Addressing the media outside Bommai’s residence, Yogeeshwara, who was a Minister in the Yediyurappa government, however, said, “Earlier also I had met the chief minister and now also I met him. There are no reasons behind meeting him. I have no discontentment. I am a party worker and work accordingly”.  Bommai took over as the Chief Minister on July 28 two days after Yediyurappa resigned from the post. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-discontent-over-cabinet-exercise-karnataka-cm-holds-discussions-with-yediyurappa-297562

He claimed that the five arrested people are TMC members close to Ghosh.Shrivastava had worked hard for Sinha, who succumbed to Covid-19 after the polling and before the counting, leading to countermanding of elections in the Khardah constituency.

14-08-2021||Vijay Mohan||Navy’s Submarine Rescue Unit airlifted to search for Army helicopter that crashed in Ranjit Sagar Dam||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 14The Army has intensified the search operations for the wreckage of its Dhruv helicopter that had crashed into the Ranjit Sagar Dam on August 3 by flying in a Submarine Rescue Unit of Indian Navy to the crash site near Kathua in Jammu region. The bodies of the two pilots, a Lieutenant Colonel and a Captain, are also yet to be retrieved.The unit will explore the digitally located wreckage at the depth of approximately 80-100 meters. The Indian Air Force lifted the heavy equipment for underwater search and rescue from Vishakhapatnam to Air Force Station Pathankot on the intervening night of August 13 and 14. Earlier, a small area of 60 meters by 60 meters had been localised and special sonar equipment flown in from Kochi was employed to enable the search operations to enter the final phase. On August 11, the Army had stated that the wreckage had been identified at a depth of approximately 80 meters from the surface of the reservoir.The Indian Army and all other agencies to include Indian Navy, Indian Air Force, NDRF, Ranjit Sagar Dam Authority, local District Authorities including locals are sparing no efforts for bringing the operations to a final conclusion.  The reservoir is 25-km long, 8-km wide and more than 500-foot deep.“Experts, specialised equipment and divers are being continuously flown in and international assistance is also being sought,” the Army’s Western Command had said. Divers from the Navy and the Army’s Special Forces have been involved in the search operation, along with multi-beam sonars, side scanners, remotely operated vehicles and underwater manipulators which have been flown in from Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi.The search continued unabated in spite of bad weather and rain. This deep underwater operation is especially challenging due to the near-zero visibility below 50 meters, owing to the colloidal nature of water in this season which adversely impacts accuracy of sonars and other sensors.The Dhruv helicopter from an Army Aviation Corps squadron based at Pathankot had taken off on a routine sortie when it crashed into the reservoir. Only a part of the helicopter’s wreckage was recovered in the initial phase of the search. The Army has not officially released the names of the missing persons.Sources said that this is the second incident involving Dhruv helicopters from the same squadron in the past about six months.Another Dhruv from a different unit, also based at Pathankot, made a forced landing last week after suffering an oil leak, sources added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navys-submarine-rescue-unit-airlifted-to-search-for-army-helicopter-that-crashed-in-ranjit-sagar-dam-297550

The GEAC cannot and must not abdicate its responsibility for regulating to protect the environment, nature, and health, as given in the objective of the Rules,” the letter signed by Kavitha Kuruganti stated, urging Yadav to “reconsider the decision” and ensure that “GEAC performs its duty”.The BKS “condemned” the decision, calling the reason for granting the permission “not only ridiculous, but disgusting”.“Considering the pretext of permission, all the products where the living modified organism is directly not involved in any product will be permitted for import. If this is the case, then factually all the available products or by-products made up of using GM crops qualify for import.“The BKS has time and again demanded that products and byproducts of agricultural commodities involving GM technology/event at any stage should not allowed, even for import, without a robust a policy guideline in place. “It is a long-lasting demand of the BKS to form an inter-ministerial group to draft a policy for research, production, and use of GM commodities,” BKS general secretary Badri Narayan Chaudhary said in a letter to Atul Chaturvedi, Secretary, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, and marked to Yadav, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Minister of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Parshottam Rupala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-bks-coalition-for-a-gm-free-india-take-strong-objection-to-centres-permission-to-gm-soy-meal-for-livestock-feed-297534

14-08-2021||New Delhi||Child rights body summons Facebook officials over Rahul Gandhi's Instagram post||The country's apex child rights body NCPCR has summoned Facebook officials on Tuesday for not responding to its notice flagging Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's Instagram post allegedly revealing the identity of a nine-year-old rape and murder victim.The latest NCPCR communication to Facebook, which owns the photo and video-sharing social networking platform Instagram, follows its notice seeking action against Gandhi's profile for posting a video of the affected family."However, no reply/action taken report has been received by you," the commission said in its follow-up letter.The commission has now asked Facebook officials to appear at 5 pm on Tuesday in person at the NCPCR Office in Janpath or through video-conferencing along with the details of the action taken.Earlier, the NCPCR had asked Facebook to take appropriate action against the Instagram profile of Gandhi over the alleged violation of provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and the Indian Penal Code, and demanded the removal of the video.Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, prohibits the disclosure of the identity of a child in any form of media and Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012, also states that no information or photo of a child should be published in any form of media which could reveal the identity of the child.This information under Section 23 of the POCSO Act includes his/her name, address, photograph, family details, school, neighbourhood or any other particulars which may lead to disclosure of identity of the child.On August 4, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) wrote to Twitter, asking it to take action against the handle of Gandhi for posting the photo of the family.The microblogging site blocked the account of Gandhi following the complaint. Twitter on its part has said that it has followed the due process as Gandhi's tweet on the family of the victim was against its rules and the law.A Congress leader on Saturday said the account had now been restored.Gandhi last week met the family of the nine-year-old girl and asserted that he is with them on the path to justice and "will not back down even an inch".Later, he posted a picture of his meeting with the girl's parents on Twitter and wrote in Hindi, "Parents' tears are saying only one thing that their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice".The girl died under mysterious circumstances when she went to get water from a cooler at a crematorium in the Old Nangal area in southwest Delhi. The girl's parents alleged that she was raped and her body forcibly cremated by a crematorium priest who had falsely claimed that she was electrocuted.Hundreds of locals, including the victim's parents, have been staging a protest near the site of the incident, demanding capital punishment for the accused.

14-08-2021||New Delhi||Twitter unlocks Rahul Gandhi's handle||A week after temporarily suspending his account, Twitter restored Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's handle on Saturday, but not before the principal opposition party accused it of bias.Gandhi's account was temporarily suspended last week after he tweeted pictures of the family of a nine-year-old victim of alleged rape and murder in northwest Delhi. Twitter deemed it violation of its rules.Also read: Twitter transfers India head amid Cong’s bias chargeSources said the Twitter accounts of some of the party leaders who had shared the same pictures had also been restored."Rahul Gandhi's Twitter account has been unlocked," a party functionary said, adding that the accounts of some of the leaders had also been restored.The former Congress chief had made a strong outburst on Friday accusing Twitter of "interfering in the national political process" and said shutting down of his handle amounted to an "attack on the country's democratic structure".Gandhi, in a YouTube video statement titled ‘Twitter's dangerous game’, alleged that it was not a neutral and objective platform and was "beholden to the government”.Questioning Twitter's action, Gandhi had said the company was denying millions of his followers the right to an opinion, which was unfair."It's obvious now that Twitter is actually not a neutral, objective platform. It is a biased platform. It's something that listens to what the government of the day says," Gandhi had alleged.In the wake of the friction with the Congress, Twitter has transferred its India head Manish Maheshwari, against whom an FIR was registered in Uttar Pradesh in connection with a probe related to a video of an alleged hate crime, to the US.While the company did not specify any reason for the change, it said Maheshwari would move to the US as Senior Director (Revenue Strategy and Operations) and focus on new markets in his new role.

He had also requested the Navy to go ahead with its scheduled programme.The cancellation of the event due to the local residents’ opposition kicked up a row.But the Navy finally hoisted the tricolour in the presence of some locals on Saturday afternoon after a “misunderstanding” with them cleared up.“After a slight misunderstanding yesterday (August 13), a team of the Goa Naval Area and residents amicably participated in the National Flag hoisting at St Jacinto Island,” a statement issued by the naval spokesperson said.The flag was hoisted around 2.45 pm on Saturday with the residents singing the national anthem along with the naval team during the event, he said.Earlier in the day, CM Sawant had said that the flag would be hoisted at the island “at any cost” and assured full cooperation to the Navy from the Goa police for the event.However, after the event was finally held, Sawant expressed happiness over it.Posting a photo of the ceremony, the CM tweeted, “Heartening to see locals at St Jacinto Island joining the Indian Navy in hoisting the Indian Flag. I am glad, better sense prevailed. #JaiHind #NationFirst.”Sao Jacinto island is located in South Goa, around 4 km from INS Hansa base. Approximately 100 families reside on the island. Some local residents had earlier said they were worried that the Mormugao Port Trust might take over the island in future.

Kandahar, Herat, Lashkar Gah, Nimroz, Farah, Kunduz and Ghazni have been captured. Apart from a clutch of small towns, capital Kabul, Jalalabad and Mazar-e-Sharif, that have large populations, remain to be taken.The capitals of Goh and Uruzgan provinces were abandoned by local officials and security forces. The Taliban have captured India’s most visible public work in Afghanistan — the Salma Dam — following the surrender of Ismael Khan in Herat. They are also in control of the power transmission station built by India at Pol-e-Khumri in Kunduz province.Embassies in Kabul are packing up and the US is sending 3,000 soldiers to secure the airport to carry out the safe evacuation of its staff. US Defence Secretary Austin Lloyd and Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to embattled Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who then summoned a high-level security meeting.First Vice-President Amrullah Saleh said the meeting decided to “continue the fight” against the Taliban though the only voices of support came from ageing insurgent warlords of the north-east whose Uzbek and Hazara populations are apprehensive of the Pashtun-dominated Taliban.Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum said in Mazar-e-Sharif that he would defend the nation. Atta Mohammad Noor also vowed to fight on, saying President Ghani had agreed to provide them with equipment and support. Meanwhile, the UNSC is discussing a draft statement to threaten the Taliban for attacks that have caused high civilian casualties and risked Afghanistan’s peace and stability.The draft states that it would neither support the establishment of any government through military force or the restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The text has to be adopted unanimously by the 15-member Security Council. NATO has called a meeting next week to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. The UK, a prominent NATO member, has warned the situation is leading to a civil war, calling on the West to understand that the Taliban was not a single entity but an umbrella for several competing interests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/warlords-kabul-regime-vow-to-fight-it-out-as-taliban-make-rapid-advances-297209

With another judge (Justice Navin Sinha) scheduled to demit office on August 18, judicial vacancies will rise to 10 in the SC where 69,476 cases are pending.The Collegium consists of five senior-most judges, including the CJI, for appointment of judges to the SC, while it’s CJI plus two senior-most judges for clearing the names for appointment as HC judges.The Collegium has failed to recommend names for appointment of judges to the SC after August 28, 2019. Justice RF Nariman, who demitted the office on Thursday, reportedly insisted on elevating two senior-most HC judges — Karnataka HC Chief Justice Abhay S Oka and Tripura HC Chief Justice Akil Kureshi — to the top court before any other names were cleared for the purpose.Because of the stalemate, the Collegium led by then CJI SA Bobde could not recommend any names for elevation to the top court. After Justice Narimman’s retirement, the SC Collegium will consist of CJI NV Ramana, Justice UU Lalit, Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice LN Rao. Will the deadlock end?Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Vikas Singh said, “The way the Collegium system is functioning, it’s better we revert to the old system as neither there is transparency nor are they able to decide names.”He said the top court had failed to implement its verdict in the NJAC case that had specifically talked about having transparency in the Collegium’s functioning.According to “Vacancy Positions” displayed on the Department of Justice website, 455 (41.43%) of 1,098 posts of judges are vacant in 25 high courts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-retirement-supreme-court-vacancies-to-touch-10-297214

Congrats on your new US-based role in charge of revenue strategy and operations for new markets worldwide. Excited to see you lead this important growth opportunity for Twitter,” he said.When contacted, Twitter confirmed the development and said Maheshwari is “moving into a new role based in San Francisco as Senior Director, Revenue Strategy and Operations focused on New Market Entry”.The company did not disclose details around the succession plan after Maheshwari moves to the US.Before joining Twitter, Maheshwari was the CEO of Network18 Digital. He has also worked with organizations, including Flipkart, P&G, among others.Notably, in May, Twitter had expressed concern about employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression. The company had been sent a notice by Delhi Police’s Special Cell in connection with the probe into a complaint about an alleged ‘Covid toolkit’. Two police teams had also descended on the microblogging site’s offices in Lado Sarai in Delhi and in Gurugram.Twitter has been drawing severe criticism for the past many months for various actions it has taken on tweets and accounts of high-profile users as well as delay in compliance with the IT rules that came into effect in May this year.The latest in this was the temporary suspension of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s account after he shared pictures of the family of a nine-year-old victim of alleged rape and murder in Delhi.Twitter, on its part, had said it followed due process as Gandhi’s tweet on the family of the victim was against its rules and the law.In June, an FIR was registered against Maheshwari and some others in connection with a probe related to a video of an alleged hate crime that went viral on social media.            In July, the Karnataka High Court had quashed the notice issued to Maheshwari by the UP police, seeking his personal appearance as part of the probe.Maheshwari was also named in police complaints related to showing an incorrect map of India.The US-based company -- which has an estimated 1.75 crore users in India -- had also courted controversy over the new social media rules, and the Indian government had confronted Twitter over deliberate defiance and failure to comply with the IT rules, despite repeated reminders.On August 10, the Centre had told the Delhi High Court that Twitter was “prima facie” in compliance with the new IT rules by appointing a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) and Nodal Contact Person on permanent basis.
