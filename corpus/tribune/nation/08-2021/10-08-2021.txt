10-08-2021||Lucknow||Congress holds protest marches against Uttar Pradesh government across state||The Congress held protest marches against the Uttar Pradesh government across assembly constituencies in the state for the second day on Tuesday as part of its ‘BJP Gaddi Chhodo’ campaign.In a release issued here, the Congress claimed that police personnel tried to stop the marches in most districts, leading to heated arguments with partymen. The police also used force but it did not deter party workers and the members of the public who were supporting them.The party alleged that the police lathi-charged its workers in Mau district and said that people will give a befitting reply to the Yogi government in the 2022 UP Assembly elections.The Congress’ two-day ‘BJP Gaddi Chhodo’ campaign was inspired by August Kranti Diwas, which is celebrated on August 9. It sought to highlight the failures of the BJP government like atrocities against Dalits, rising inflation and unemployment, deteriorating law and order and continued fuel price rise, etc., the release said.Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the government can lodge cases, use sticks and send Congress workers to jail but they are not afraid of any of it.“If there is anyone who has been harassed the most by the Yogi Adityanath government, it is the ‘annadata’ (farmers) of the state,” he said.“Only telling lies is the work of the double engine government,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-holds-protest-marches-against-uttar-pradesh-government-across-state-295784

10-08-2021||New Delhi||Opposition’s undemocratic behaviour in RS proves nothing wrong in farm laws: Tomar||Slamming the Opposition for creating ruckus during a short-duration discussion on farm issues in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar outside Parliament said the “undemocratic behaviour” of Congress, TMC and AAP proves that there is nothing wrong in the new farm laws but the problem lies in their perception.The government was ready to listen to their criticism and suggestions and was even open for amendments to the policies if the discussion on agriculture issues had taken place, he said.In the Upper House, the Opposition protested vehemently when its request for a calling attention motion on agriculture issues was converted into a short-duration discussion.While the discussion was underway amid the din, the protesting members trooped into the well with sloganeering. In fact a protesting member climbed atop the table of the secretary general.Stating that this “irresponsible behaviour” of the Opposition has hurt the democracy, Tomar said, “I reproach the undemocratic behaviour of Congress, TMC and AAP in the House when the discussion began on agriculture.”  He said if the Opposition members were concerned about farmers and agriculture, they would have participated in the discussion and kept their viewpoints instead of protesting.“We were ready to listen to their criticism as well as their suggestions. If the policies were to be amended based on those suggestions, the government was open to that also,” he said.Tomar further said the Upper House discussed the Covid-19 issue and the government wanted discussion should take place on agriculture as it is connected with everyone’s life. However, the irresponsible behaviour of the Opposition in the House during discussion on agriculture has hurt the Indian democracy.“Today, this step of Opposition proves that there is nothing wrong in the farm laws, it is in their perception. (Aaj vipaksh ke is kadam se, ek baar ... siddh hogaya hai krishi sudaar kaanoonon mein kala kuchh bhee nahin hai.Vipaksh ke kapade mein kaalaapan dikahi deta hai),” he said.The Opposition wants to mislead the country by telling lies. Its motive is to do vote-bank politics and family-based politics with selfish intention, he added.The minister highlighted that the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken several measures to improve the farm sector and many schemes are being implemented which all have led to growth in the sector and prosperity in the lives of farmers.“But the Congress members are unable to digest this,” he said, adding that the farmers across the country are standing with the new farm laws and agriculture schemes.Condemning the ruckus created in the Upper House, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi told reporters that the Opposition had demanded that agriculture matters should be discussed and the Chair accepted it.“Later the Opposition created a ruckus sitting on the reporter’s table and threw book over chair and members....They were sitting on the table even after the House was adjourned. Some staff have been hurt. ....we have never seen such behaviour,” he said, and asked what the Congress and its allies want.The government is ready for discussion on the agrarian crisis, he said, adding that the OBC Bill being passed in the Lok Sabha is not being tolerated by them.Eight months on, thousands of farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been camping at Delhi’s borders in protest against the three laws.The government and unions have held 11 rounds of talks, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers’ protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.

10-08-2021||New Delhi||SC holds 9 parties guilty of contempt for not sharing antecedents of candidates in Bihar polls||Maintaining that persons with criminal antecedents and involved in criminalisation of politics cannot be permitted to be lawmakers, the Supreme Court Tuesday held nine political parties including the ruling BJP and Janata Dal (United) guilty of its contempt in 2020 Bihar assembly polls for disobeying an order requiring them to publish antecedents of candidates within 48 hours of selection or not less than two weeks before filing of nominations.While imposing varying fines on political parties, the top court lamented the apathy of the legislative wing of the government in not taking steps to decriminalise the political system.“The nation continues to wait, and is losing patience. Cleansing the polluted stream of politics is obviously not one of the immediate pressing concerns of the legislative branch of government,” a bench headed by Justice R F Nariman said.The bench, also comprising justice B R Gavai, imposed a fine of Rs five lakh each on two political parties, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Nationalist Congress Party, saying that they “have not at all complied with the directions issued by this court”.It also imposed a fine of Rs one lakh each on Janata Dal (United),  the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Lok Janshakti Party, Indian National Congress,  Bharatiya Janata Party and  the Communist Party of India and asked them to deposit the money within eight weeks with the poll panel.The Rashtriya Lok Samta Party was spared of fine. The poll panel had said that 469 candidates, having criminal antecedents, were fielded by 10 political parties in recently held Bihar assembly polls.The bench held that the selection of candidates having criminal antecedents on the ground of mere winnability is the violation of the apex court’s direction of February 13, 2020.The Election Commission, to whom the fine will be deposited, is directed to carry out an extensive awareness campaign to make every voter aware about his right to know and the availability of information regarding criminal antecedents of all contesting candidates, the top court directed.“This shall be done across various platforms, including social media, websites, TV ads, prime time debates, pamphlets, etc. A fund must be created for this purpose within a period of four weeks into which fines for contempt of Court may be directed to be paid,” the verdict said.The verdict said that no one can deny that the menace of criminalisation in the Indian political system is growing day by day.“Also, no one can deny that for maintaining purity of political system, persons with criminal antecedents and who are involved in criminalisation of political system should not be permitted to be the lawmakers. The only question is, whether this Court can do so by issuing directions which do not have a foundation in the statutory provisions,” it said.It said though nine political parties have been found guilty of having committed contempt of the order of February 13, 2020, but a lenient view has been taken taking into consideration the fact that these were the first elections that were conducted after the issuance of the directions.“However, we warn them that they should be cautious in future and ensure that the directions issued by this Court as well as the ECI are followed in letter and spirit”, Justice Nariman, writing the 71-page verdict for the bench, said.The bench modified its one of the earlier directions on furnishing of details about the criminal antecedents of candidates.“We clarify that the direction in paragraph 4.4 of our Order dated 13.02.2020 be modified and it is clarified that the details which are required to be published, shall be published within 48 hours of the selection of the candidate and not prior to two weeks before the first date of filing of nominations,” it said.                              Highlighting the separation of power, the verdict said that the top court has been appealing time and again to the lawmakers of the country to rise to the occasion and take steps for bringing out necessary amendments so that the involvement of persons with criminal antecedents in polity is prohibited.“All these appeals have fallen on the deaf ears. The political parties refuse to wake up from deep slumber. However, in view of the constitutional scheme of separation of powers, though we desire that something urgently requires to be done in the matter, our hands are tied and we cannot transgress into the area reserved for the legislative arm of the State.The apex court accepted the submissions of senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the poll panel that the ECI cannot be said to have committed any contempt of the order as the circumstances pointed out that it did bring to the notice of the court the flouting of the directions.“We must, however, caution the ECI to do so as promptly as possible in future so that prompt action may be taken by this Court, it being understood that the ECI must by itself take prompt action in accordance with the directions contained in this Order,” the top court said.The bench also issued more directions in continuation of earlier ones in order to make “the right of information of a voter more effective and meaningful.“Political parties are to publish information regarding criminal antecedents of candidates on the homepage of their websites, thus making it easier for the voter to get to the information that has to be supplied. It will also become necessary now to have on the homepage a caption which states ‘candidates with criminal antecedents’,” it said.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-holds-9-parties-guilty-of-contempt-for-not-sharing-antecedents-of-candidates-in-bihar-polls-295775

10-08-2021||New Delhi||IAF focused on boosting capabilities after Balakot strikes, Galwan Valley clashes: IAF chief||India’s air power capabilities in terms of hitting targets with precision, defending assets and use of new technologies have gone up significantly after the Balakot air strikes and rapid developments in eastern Ladakh following the Galwan Valley clashes, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Tuesday.In an address at a leading think-tank, the IAF chief said India now has an “edge” in its ability on both the Western and Northern fronts to “react fast, respond fast and hit fast”, noting that induction of Rafale jets has helped in bringing the “next level” of operational transformation.About the drone strike on the Jammu airbase, he said the IAF is taking a series of initiatives including procuring next-generation jammers to deal with such challenges and added that the attack would not have been possible if it was attempted two-three months later.Referring to the 11-day conflict between Israel and Hamas in May, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said that Israel’s use of air power in carrying out operations with surgical precision to achieve its objectives in Gaza against the militant group while ensuring minimum collateral damage was a reflection of the ability of the air assets.Explaining the role of air power, the IAF chief also talked about the general perception to look at only its offensive role and the general tendency to say “no-no” for its use in certain situations, saying the paradigms and scenarios have shifted and there is a need to keep this in mind.“The ability of air power which was largely seen as an offensive, as a no-no in some situations particularly in the subcontinent...the paradigms have shifted, the scenarios have shifted and we need to keep this in mind as we go ahead,” he said at the United Service Institution of India (USI).At a seminar last month, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, while referring to the proposed integrated theatre commands, described the Air Force as a “support arm” but Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria disagreed with him, saying airpower has a huge role to play.About the IAF’s operational readiness, he said the focus was to bring in the next level of operational transformation including in the cyber-security domain after the Galwan Valley clashes and his force has been largely successful in its endeavour.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said the “edge” that the IAF has today came from a combination of its weapons, training status, platforms network environment and its ability to “react fast, respond fast and hit fast”.“That is the edge we have today in both scenarios, be it on the western front or be it on the northern front,” he said.He said the “transformation” was triggered by the developments like Balakot strikes and situation in eastern Ladakh and it has now taken the IAF to the “next level”.The IAF chief said the induction of the Rafale aircraft has helped in lifting the overall offensive capability of the Air Force.“It is a level or a level-and-a-half above where we were.” He said the focus after the Galwan Valley clashes was to bolster the cyber security system as it was identified as an area of concern mainly because of some of the “actions”, he said in an apparent reference to the ability of the adversary to the IAF’s networks.He said the IAF’s operational offensive capability has gone up in terms of having long-distance air-to-ground weapons, in carrying out precision strikes and possessing network-centric environment.Twenty Indian Army personnel laid down their lives in clashes with Chinese troops on June 15 last year that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.In February, China officially acknowledged that five Chinese military officers and soldiers were killed in the clashes though it is widely believed that the death toll was higher.The chief of Air Staff also mentioned Balakot air strikes as an important event while talking about the transformation of the IAF in the last few years, and said it sent out a clear message about India’s approach in dealing with security challenges.Indian fighter jets bombed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s biggest training camp near Balakot deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019, 12 days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Kashmir, killing 40 soldiers.Pakistan retaliated by attempting to target Indian military installations the next day. However, the IAF thwarted their plans.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria also spoke about the low cost activities of commercial drones and its use for supply of arms, drugs, money as well as use of the armed version of the unmanned aerial vehicles to launch an attack on the Jammu airbase.He referred to China’s emergence at the world stage, its diplomacy, economic clout and military belligerence in Indo-Pacific.

10-08-2021||New Delhi||India ranked 122nd in 2020 Global Youth Development Index||India is ranked 122nd in the 2020 Global Youth Development Index, which measures the status of young people in 181 countries around the world, the Commonwealth Secretariat said on Tuesday.Singapore ranked top for the first time followed by Slovenia, Norway, Malta and Denmark.Chad, the central African Republic, South Sudan, Afghanistan and Niger finished at the bottom, respectively.The index revealed that the condition of young people improved around the world by 3.1 per cent between 2010 and 2018, but progress remained slow.The Commonwealth Secretariat released its triennial rankings of youth development in 181 countries, with 156 of them recording at least slight improvements in their scores.While the data used in the index pre-dates Covid-19, the report highlights the positive trajectory of youth development, which the virus could reverse for the first time unless urgent action is taken to secure the pre-pandemic gains.The index ranks countries between 0.00 (lowest) and 1.00 (highest), according to the developments in youth education, employment, health, equality and inclusion, peace and security, and political and civic participation.It looks at 27 indicators, including literacy and voting, to showcase the state of the world's 1.8 billion people between the age of 15 and 29.Afghanistan, India, Russia, Ethiopia, and Burkina Faso were the top five improvers, advancing their score on an average by 15.74 per cent.On the other hand, Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Jordan and Lebanon showed the greatest decline in youth development between 2010 and 2018.Overall, the index showed advances in youth's participation in peace processes and their education, employment, inclusion and healthcare since 2010.Health made the largest gains of 4.39 per cent driven by a 1.6 per cent decline in global youth mortality rates and a 2 per cent drop in each HIV, self-harm, alcohol abuse and tobacco use.Sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest strides in improving the health of young people.Levels of underemployed youth and those not in school, training or work remained constant. Advances in equality and inclusion are led by improved gender parity in literacy as well as fewer child marriage cases and pregnancies in girls under 20. Yet, no progress occurred in women's safety.The global education score increased by 3 per cent, with South Asia making the largest improvement at 16 per cent, followed by sub-Saharan Africa at 10 per cent.Peace and security improved by 3.41 per cent, resulting from fewer young people dying from direct violence.Somalia recorded the largest gains in peace and security of young people, followed by Colombia, Sri Lanka, Eritrea and Russia.Youth participation in politics is the only domain that recorded a decline in most parts of the world, reporting deterioration in 102 countries. However, sub-Saharan Africa recorded a 5 per cent improvement in the average regional score.Globally, Sweden led on education, Luxembourg on equality and inclusion, Indonesia on political and civic participation, while Singapore topped the employment, health and peace and security domains.Speaking before the release, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said: "Young people are indispensable to delivering a future that is more just, inclusive, sustainable and resilient. By measuring their contributions and needs with hard data, our advocacy for their development becomes more powerful, and we are then able incrementally to increase the positive impact and benefits youth are able to add towards building a better future for us all". — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-ranked-122nd-in-2020-global-youth-development-index-295754
10-08-2021||New Delhi||RSS strong supporter of reservation; should continue as long as inequality exists in society: Hosabale||Asserting that RSS is a “strong supporter” of reservation, the organisation’s general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Tuesday said it is a tool for affirmative action and should continue as long as a particular section of the society experiences “inequality”.Underlining that the history of India would be “incomplete” without the history of Dalits, Hosabale said they have been at the forefront of social change.He was speaking at an event organised by the India Foundation for the launch of a book, titled “Makers Of Modern Dalit History”.“History of India is not different from History from Dalits. Without their history, India’s history is incomplete,” Hosabale said.Talking about reservation, Hosabale categorically said he and his organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh “are strong supporters of reservation.” He also said, “Social harmony and social justice are not political strategies for us and both of these are articles of faith for us.” Stating that reservation is a “historical necessity” for India, Hosabale said, “It should continue as long as there is inequality being experienced by a particular section of society.”Describing reservation as a tool for “affirmative action”, Hosabale said that reservation and reconciliation (between all sections of society) should go hand in hand. He also said it would be unfair to term the personalities who led social change in the society as “Dalit leaders” as they were leaders of the entire society.“When we discuss the various aspects of SC and ST sections of society, invariably certain aspects come to fore such as reservation. My organisation and I are strong supporters of reservations for decades. When there were anti-reservation protests in many campuses, we passed a resolution and organised a seminar in Patna in support of reservation,” Hosabale said.

10-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks Centre’s reply on why new IT rules should not be stayed||The Bombay High court on Tuesday asked the Union government to file a reply as to why an interim stay should not be given to the implementation of the Information Technology (IT) Rules, 2021, as demanded by two petitions.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni sought the government’s reply by August 12.The petitions filed by digital news portal ‘The Leaflet’ and journalist Nikhil Wagle claimed that the new regulations are “vague”, “draconian”, and bound to have a “chilling effect” on the freedom of press and right to free speech guaranteed by the Constitution.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, the Union government’s lawyer, urged the court not to grant a stay without a final hearing.Senior counsel Darius Khambata, who appeared for The Leaflet, had argued earlier that the new rules were a brazen attempt to regulate online content.  They  go beyond the parameters set by the Information Technology Act and limits set under Article 19 of the Constitution, he said.On Tuesday, the HC asked if it could grant an interim stay to the rules with the petitioners agreeing, for now, not to publish anything in violation of the restrictions under Article 19 (which defines the freedom of speech and its limits) and the Union government promising not to take coercive action against them under the new rules until the court gives its final decision.“Suppose we accept your (petitioners’) argument and grant a stay. So the rules will remain in suspension. If you fail in the writ (petition) and rules are violated in the interim, you cannot use our orders to seek relief if you fail in the writ...And the Union does not take any coercive action as per the new rules?” the HC said.Advocate Khambata said the petitioners always adhere to the restrictions under Article 19 and oppose only the new rules which go beyond Article 19.“As long as Article 19 (2) is the only limit, there is no difficulty,” he added.But the additional solicitor general opposed the court’s proposal.“Instead of granting an interim stay, the final matter can be heard,” Singh said.The court pointed out that similar petitions opposing the new rules have been filed in high courts across the country, but the Union government was yet to file its replies.If a stay was not granted, the petitioners will be under “constant fear” of adverse action whenever they publish anything online, the judges said.“File a short affidavit on why interim relief should not be granted,” the HC told the Union government, adjourning the hearing to August 13.Arguing that the new rules were vague, advocate Khambata had said on Monday that among other things, they prohibit media organizations from carrying out sting operations without proof and publishing defamatory content against a public personality.But the rules do not define ‘adequate proof’ or ‘defamatory content’, he said.“These rules are seeking to effectively monitor and censor speech on the internet by giving powers to a ministerial committee,” he alleged.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-hc-seeks-centres-reply-on-why-new-it-rules-should-not-be-stayed-295741

While some used the AB-PMJAY ecosystem, including the NHA’s IT platform, others made it free.Therefore, Covid-19 treatment has been covered in both general packages and packages specific to the disease under AB-PMJAY.“As on 25th July 2021, 20.32 lakh Covid related testing and 7.08 lakh Covid related hospital admissions have been authorised under the scheme,” Pawar said.

He was afraid after this incident it would have cost his life if he was using that right away. Such a shame!! How can I get my phone back? You ruined my money!!”OnePlus replied to him on Twitter: “We are truly dejected to hear about this incident. We earnestly hope that the untoward incident did not cause any harm to your father. We would like to have this addressed on priority and to further scrutinise this matter and ascertain the cause of this instance, please DM us.” However, the post as well as his Twitter account was deleted within a few hours after the post.“All OnePlus products undergo thorough quality and safety tests to ensure that they are up to leading industry standards and are safe to use,” the company stressed.“We also follow strict internal processes to ensure the health and safety of our users, while also protecting the reputation of our brand. We urge the public to exercise restraint in judging unverified allegations such as this.”Recently, Bengaluru-based Ankur Sharma also reported in a tweet about a day old OnePlus Nord 2 exploding, along with pictures of burnt smartphone.

Any Indian nationals in and around Mazar-e-Sharif are requested to leave for India in the special flight scheduled to depart late today evening," the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif tweeted.It asked Indian citizens who want to leave by the special flight to submit the details like their full name and passport number to the consulate immediately.It is learnt that the consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif will continue to operate through the local staff.Last month, India pulled out around 50 diplomats and security personnel from its consulate in Kandahar following intense clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters around the city.A special aircraft of the Indian Air Force was sent to bring back the Indian diplomats, officials and other staff members, including a group of Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel.According to government data, around 1,500 Indians are currently staying in Afghanistan.Last week, the Ministry of External Affairs said in Lok Sabha that India remained vigilant and is taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of Indians in the conflict-ridden country.The Taliban has been making rapid advances across Afghanistan by resorting to widespread violence since the US began withdrawing its troops on May 1.The US has already pulled back majority of its forces and is looking to complete the drawdown by August 31.

The removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) was the only option."                 She was counselled to undergo a surgery that employs an advanced robotic system, citing its benefits over old robotic and other conventional surgical techniques, he said.On obtaining the patient's consent, the surgery was performed and the woman was able to go home within 24 hours.The doctor said this advanced robotic surgery offers three-dimensional vision and preciseness in hand movements as compared to traditional open and laparoscopic surgery.The finesse in precision led to very little loss of blood during the two-hour-long surgery."In conventional surgeries, the patient remains hospitalised for a minimum of four to five days with higher risk of infection. Here, the patient was able to go to the washroom on her own in less than 24 hours and the next day she was discharged,” Dr Manchanda said.“This advanced technology machine or robot has not been used for this procedure in the north before and heralds a new dimension for quality care for women in north India,” the hospital's spokesperson said.

The enrolment procedure will require minimum paperwork and in Ujjwala 2.0, migrants will not be required to submit ration cards or address proof.A self-declaration for both 'family declaration' and as a 'proof of address' will suffice, they said.Ujjwala 2.0 will help achieve the prime minister's vision of universal access to LPG, it said.Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri was also present on the occasion.In his address, Union minister Puri said that the use of wood and coal for cooking has adverse effects on health of women. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-launches-ujjwala-2-0-for-providing-free-lpg-connections-295716

The expanse of the dam is 25 km-long, 8 km-wide and more than 500 feet deep,” Lt Col Anand said.He said the Army is coordinating the efforts of Indian Navy deep divers' team consisting of two officers, four junior commissioned officers and 24 other ranks, Indian Army special forces divers' team consisting of two officers, one JCO and 24 other ranks, multi beam sonars, side scanners, remotely operated vehicles and underwater manipulators, which have been flown in from Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi and pressed into action at the crash site. “Search operations continue unabated inspite of bad weather and rain. Expertise and equipment of the Army, Navy, IAF, NDRF, SDRF, NGOs, state police, dam authority and private firms from all over the country have also been into action,” the army PRO said.He said this deep underwater operation is especially challenging due to the near-zero visibility below 50 metres owing to the colloidal nature of water in this season which adversely impacts accuracy of sonars and other sensors. “Experts, specialised equipment and divers are being continuously flown in and international assistance is also being sought. No efforts are being spared for early conclusion of the search operation,” Lt Col Anand said.The Army Aviation Corps' advanced light helicopter (ALH) took off from Mamun military station near Pathankot with its pilot and co-pilot and crashed into the lake during a routine sortie on August 3.Neel Joshi, brother of Captain Jayant Joshi, the co-pilot of the helicopter, took to Twitter to express anguish over the slow pace of search and rescue operations and said “we have lost all hope at this point.”   In a series of tweets, Neel Joshi said almost one week has passed since the crash but there is no news of his brother. “…I wish I could explain the agony of my parents. Operations to extract the wreckage are ongoing at a snail's pace with no end in sight,” he wrote on twitter.He said the family has lost all hope at this point and the friends and family are desperate for any news of his brother. “If the pilots are in the wreckage, then the condition of the remains after one week in the water will leave my parents in a shock no one should experience. For a second generation officer (my mother has served 40 years in the Army), the apathy of the @adgpi is astounding,” Neel Joshi said.He said the anticipation, the wait and day after day of “futile search” by the Navy and Army is a “torture for our mother who has to wait everyday to hear any news.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/search-ops-for-missing-pilots-in-jk-enters-8th-day-army-seeks-international-assistance-295697

10-08-2021||Washington||‘India needs USD100 billion FDI annually to become USD5 trillion economy’||India needs at least USD100 billion of foreign direct investment every year to reach its target of a USD5 trillion economy from the current USD2.7, the head of a top India-centric American business advocacy group has said.The group made the observation, asserting that a major chunk of this FDI is going to come from the United States.“India needs to grow its economy from the current USD2.7 trillion to USD 5 trillion. It will need a lot of FDI coming in - at least USD100 billion dollars a year to fuel that growth,” Mukesh Aghi, president of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum, told PTI in a recent interview.“I believe that is going to come mainly from the US,” he added.India, he observed, “needs to look at what it needs to do to get that FDI coming in and have the technology coming in, to fuel this growth”.“From a US perspective, it needs to leverage India on vaccination diplomacy, have Indian factories produce these vaccines so they can ship it to the rest of the world, and they can make this vaccine much, much cheaper than anybody else can get,” he said.Last week, USISPF, which now has more than 300 Fortune 500 companies as its members, celebrated its fourth anniversary. Four years ago, Aghi, along with several top American corporate leaders established USISPF after they had sharp differences on key issues with the then leadership of US Chambers of Commerce.

10-08-2021||Washington||India played constructive role in Afghanistan: Pentagon||India has played a constructive role in Afghanistan in the past, the Pentagon acknowledged on Monday.“India has played a constructive role in Afghanistan in the past in terms of training and other infrastructure improvements,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference.“That kind of work, that kind of effort to help Afghanistan maintain stability and good governance is always welcome,” he said when asked about India-US cooperation on Afghanistan.Responding to a question, Kirby said the United States continues to have conversations with Pakistani leadership about the safe havens that exist along that border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.“We are mindful that those safe havens are only providing a source of more insecurity and more instability inside Afghanistan. We are not bashful about having that discussion with Pakistani leaders,” he said.“We are also mindful that Pakistan and the Pakistani people also fall victim to terrorist activities that emanate from that region. So, we all have a shared sense of the importance of closing down those safe havens and not allowing them to be used by the Taliban or other terrorist networks,” Kirby said.“And again, we're having that conversation with the Pakistanis all the time,” he added.Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, he said, shares the concern of the international community about the security situation in Afghanistan which is clearly not going in the right direction.“The secretary continues to believe that the Afghan forces have the capability, they have the capacity to make a big difference on the battlefield,” he asserted.

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.” But scientists eased back a bit on the likelihood of the absolute worst climate catastrophes.The authoritative Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which calls climate change human-caused and “unequivocal,” makes more precise and warmer forecasts for the 21st century than it did last time in 2013. The report says the world will cross the 1.5 degree Celsius warming mark in the 2030s, earlier than some past predictions. “But we can avoid further levels of warming by acting on greenhouse gas emissions,” said report co-chair Valerie Masson-Delmotte.The 3,000 plus-page report from 234 scientists says warming is accelerating sea level rise and worsening extremes such as heat waves, droughts, floods and storms. Tropical cyclones are getting stronger, the Arctic sea ice is dwindling and permafrost is thawing.“Scientists have issued this message for more than three decades, but the world hasn't listened,” said United Nations Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen. For the first time, the report offers an interactive atlas for people to see what has happened and may happen to where they live. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nowhere-to-run-says-un-on-global-warming-295481

It sought to know how the government intended to implement the recommendations.The Bench is seized of the Centre’s petition challenging a Delhi High Court order initiating contempt proceedings against some central government officials for non-compliance with the HC’s direction to supply 700 MT of medical oxygen for Covid patients admitted to hospitals in the national capital. On May 5, it had stayed the contempt proceedings before the HC, saying putting officers in jail won’t bring oxygen. Amid wrangling over oxygen supply to hospitals, the Supreme Court had on May 6 set up the 12-member NTF to streamline allocation of the life-saving gas to states and UTs.Comprising top medical experts, the NTF is tasked with formulating a methodology for allocation of oxygen and to facilitate a public health response to the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-submit-atr-on-averting-oxygen-crisis-295472

Speaking at one of the best-attended UN Security Council debates (UNSC) where other members, barring China, fielded Presidents, Prime Ministers and senior Cabinet ministers, PM Modi outlined a five-principle framework for the first-ever debate on maritime security.The session began with a moment of silence for those who died during the Covid-19 pandemic. Presiding over the debate on “Enhancing maritime security: A case for international cooperation”, which was attended by Russian President Valdimir Putin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, PM Modi said first on the agenda should be removing barriers to maritime trade by fully respecting the rights of seafarers of other countries.Modi’s 5 Principles1 First and foremost, remove barriers to maritime trade2 Fully respect rights of seafarers of other countries3 Resolve maritime disputes peacefully, ensure peace4 Jointly tackle maritime threats & natural disasters5 Conserve marine resources, have norms to boost tradeSecond, it was extremely important for ensuring global peace and stability for maritime disputes to be resolved peacefully. Third, countries must jointly tackle maritime threats from non-state actors and natural disasters with India as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean. Fourth, the PM said the maritime environment and marine resources must be conserved, and fifth — a structure was required to boost maritime trade with the development of global norms and standards.US, China clash over South China SeaThe US and China clashed during the meeting, with Washington asserting it had seen “provocative actions” to advance unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea by Beijing. China’s Deputy Permanent Representative Dai Bing retorted the US was not qualified to make “irresponsible remarks” on the issue.While PM Modi steered clear of mentioning any maritime stretch, Blinken pointed out that maritime security was in serious danger, especially in the South China Sea. A Presidential Statement on Maritime Security was adopted by the UNSC. “This is an important recognition of the importance of maritime security by the UNSC. A call for international cooperation,” said India’s UN Permanent Representative, TS Tirumurti.Putin lauded India for initiating the meet during its presidency of the UNSC for the month of August and concurred with PM Modi on the requirement for a special structure to deal with maritime crime. He also said Russia stood for strict observance of key norms and principles of international law fixed in the UN Charter.

Once they are registered on this portal, they will get a slot for vaccination,” a government statement said.A significant number of foreign nationals are living in India, especially in large metropolitan areas.In these areas, the potential of spread of Covid-19 is high due to higher population density.“To counter any possibility of such occurrence, it is important to vaccinate all eligible persons,” health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said.The initiative, the ministry said, will ensure the safety of foreign nationals residing in India and reduce the possibilities of further transfer of infection from unvaccinated persons residing in India.It will also ensure overall safety from the further transmission of the Covid-19 virus.Today’s decision marks a new milestone in the journey of the Covid-19 Vaccination Programme which started on January 16.The vaccination programme in its current phase covers all adults.

10-08-2021||United Nations||PM Modi calls for breaking down maritime trade barriers||Stressing on enhancing maritime security, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called for peaceful settlement of disputes as per international law and for jointly combating maritime threats posed by non-state actors as he chaired a high-level UN Security Council open debate.Addressing the debate on “Enhancing Maritime Security - A Case for International Cooperation” via video conferencing, Modi proposed five principles for inclusive maritime security strategy, and mentioned India’s vision ‘SAGAR’ for sustainable use of the oceans.He also emphasised that the oceans are the world’s common heritage and sea routes are the lifeline of international trade. He also highlighted that maritime routes were being misused for terrorism and piracy.“We need a framework for mutual cooperation in order to conserve and utilise our shared maritime heritage. Such a framework cannot be created by any country alone. It requires joint efforts by all of us,” he said.Underlining that the countries’ shared maritime heritage is facing many challenges, the Prime Minister said, “we should remove barriers for legitimate maritime trade. Global prosperity for all our nations depends on the active flow of maritime trade. Any hindrance in maritime trade can threaten the global economy.”          Noting that free maritime trade has always been part of the civilisational ethos of India, Modi said that New Delhi has put forward the vision of Sagar - security and growth for all in the region – and it wanted to create an inclusive framework for maritime security in the region.“The vision aims for a safe, secure and stable maritime domain. For free maritime trade, it is also necessary that we fully respect the rights of the seafarers of other countries,” he said.The second principle, he said, was that the settlement of maritime disputes should be peaceful and on the basis of international law.His remarks assume significance amidst China’s maritime territorial dispute with countries in the Indo-Pacific region on the South China Sea and the East China Sea.“This is very important for mutual trust and confidence. This is the only way we can ensure global peace and stability,” he asserted.Modi said it was with this understanding and maturity that India resolved its maritime boundary issues with its neighbour Bangladesh.He said the third key principle was that the global community should jointly fight maritime threats posed by natural disasters and non-state actors, and added that India has taken several steps to enhance regional cooperation to address these issues.India has taken several steps to enhance regional cooperation on this subject, he added.“We have provided support for hydrographic surveying and training of maritime security personnel to several countries. India’s role in the Indian Ocean has been that of a net security provider,” he added.Preserving the maritime environment and maritime resources, and encouraging responsible maritime connectivity were the fourth and fifth principles enunciated by the prime minister.“Our Oceans directly impact our climate and hence, it is very important that we keep our maritime environment free of pollutants like plastic waste and oil spills,” he said.“I’m confident that we can develop a global roadmap for maritime security cooperation based on these five principles,” he added.Modi is the first Indian Prime Minister to preside over a UN Security Council Open Debate, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.The meeting was attended by several heads of state and government of member states of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), including Russian President Vladimir Putin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and high-level briefers from the UN system and key regional organisations.The open debate was focussed on ways to effectively counter maritime crime and insecurity, and strengthen coordination in the maritime domain.The UN Security Council has discussed and passed resolutions on different aspects of maritime security and maritime crime in the past.However, this is the first time that maritime security was discussed in a holistic manner as an exclusive agenda item in such a high-level open debate. — PTIChairing the UNSC High-Level Open Debate on “Enhancing Maritime Security: A Case For International Cooperation”. https://t.co/cG5EgQNENA||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-calls-for-breaking-down-maritime-trade-barriers-295256
10-08-2021||New Delhi||No transaction with NSO Group: Defence Ministry in Rajya Sabha amid Pegasus snooping row||In the midst of the Pegasus snooping controversy, the defence ministry on Monday said it did not have any transaction with the NSO Group, which sells the spyware.NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance software company, has been under increasing attack following allegations that its Pegasus software was used for surveillance of phones of people in several countries, including India.“Ministry of Defence has not had any transaction with NSO Group  Technologies,” Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt said while replying to a question in Rajya Sabha.He was asked whether the government had carried out any transaction with the NSO Group Technologies.The opposition parties have been targeting the central government over the snooping row and disrupting proceedings in Parliament since it met on July 19 for the Monsoon session.IT and Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnawhad had dismissed media reports on the use of Pegasus software to snoop on Indians, saying the allegations levelled just ahead of the Monsoon session of Parliament were aimed at maligning Indian democracy.In a suo motu statement in Lok Sabha, Vaishnaw had said that with several checks and balances being in place, “any sort of illegal surveillance” by unauthorised persons is not possible in India.The controversy erupted after an investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data claimed evidence that the military-grade malware from the NSO Group was being used to spy on politicians, journalists, human rights activists and others.

10-08-2021||New Delhi||Indian Ocean warming at faster pace, India to witness increased heat waves, flooding: Report||The Indian Ocean is warming at a higher rate than other oceans, the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said on Monday, with scientists warning that India will witness increased heatwaves and flooding, which will be the irreversible effects of climate change.'Code red for humanity': UN sounds clarion call over humans 'irreversible' impact on climateThe authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), "Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis", said the warming of the ocean will lead to a rise in sea levels, which will contribute to more frequent and severe coastal flooding in low-level areas."For a country like India, some of the increase in heat waves is masked by aerosol emissions, and reducing that is important for air quality. We will also see an increase in the heatwaves, heavy rainfall events, and the further melting of glaciers, which will impact a country like India, more compound events from sea-level rise, which could mean flooding when tropical cyclones hit. These are some of the impacts which will not go away," Friederike Otto, one of the authors of the report, said.Another author, Swapna Panickal, who is a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said about 50 per cent of the sea level rise is due to thermal expansion."The Indian Ocean region is warming at a higher rate, which means the relative sea-level can also increase over the regions. Hence, the coastal regions will see the sea-level rise through the 21st century and it will contribute to more frequent and severe coastal flooding in low-level areas and coastal erosion. Along with this, extreme sea-level events that were previously seen once in a hundred years, could also happen every year by the end of the century," she said.The report also observed that it is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change, making extreme climate events, including heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts, more frequent and severe. "Human influence has led to ocean warming since the 1970s and ocean acidification along with changes in the frozen areas of the planet. There has been a 40 per cent decrease in Arctic Sea ice since the 1990s and spring snow cover has decreased since the 1950s," it said.The authors of the report said in the next 20-30 years, India will not see much increase in the rainfall beyond the internal variability change, but both annual and summer monsoon precipitation will increase by the end of the 21st century."While there is not much model agreement on the changes in the heavy precipitation events, we can definitely say that hot extremes are projected to increase and cold extremes are projected to decrease in the 21st century," Panickal said.She said if large-scale reductions are not made in the greenhouse gas emissions, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees Celsius will be beyond reach.The report said under the global warming scenario of 2 degrees Celsius, the magnitude of length and the frequency of fire seasons are projected to increase with strong effects in India, China, and Russia. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-ocean-warming-at-faster-pace-india-to-witness-increased-heat-waves-flooding-report-295245
