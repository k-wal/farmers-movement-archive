19-08-2021||Pune||Maha: PM Modi's bust removed from temple built for him by BJP worker||Days after a BJP worker constructed a temple for Narendra Modi in Pune, the bust of the prime minister has been removed from it.Mayur Munde, who built the temple, could not be reached for comments on what prompted him to remove the bust.Meanwhile, some NCP workers on Thursday staged a mock protest outside the temple in Aundh area here in Maharashtra."Optimism had prevailed in the city that now (after construction of the temple for Modi), the fuel prices would come down, inflation would dip and people will get Rs 15 lakh in their accounts. However, we came here and saw that the 'god' is missing from the temple," NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said sarcastically.He said constructing such a temple was a symbol of "intellectual bankruptcy".Munde, 37, had earlier said the temple was his tribute to the prime minister who "built Ram temple at Ayodhya"."After becoming PM, Modi has done a lot of developmental work and dealt with issues such as the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, Ram Mandir construction and triple talaq successfully," he had said.Munde had also said the prime minister's bust as well as the red marble used in construction were brought from Jaipur and the total expenditure was around Rs 1.6 lakh.

Earlier this year, the makers had announced that the film will release in cinema halls in 2021.

19-08-2021||Agartala||Tripura BJP MLA Arun Chandra Bhowmik asks workers to attack TMC leaders in ‘Talibani style'||A ruling BJP MLA in Tripura, Arun Chandra Bhowmik, has stoked a controversy by allegedly saying that his party activists should counter Trinamool Congress leaders in “Talibani style” if they land at Agartala airport.The saffron camp, however, said it is the MLA's version and not that of the BJP.With an eye on the Tripura Assembly polls in 2023, TMC leaders, including its national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, are visiting the hilly state frequently to try and build a base and an organisation for the party which till now has been confined to West Bengal.“The TMC is trying to harm the Biplab Kumar Deb-led government in Tripura that came to power by ending the 25-year-long Communist rule. All these are happening due to the instigation of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee,” the legislator who represents Belonia constituency said.Bhowmik made this remark Wednesday during a felicitation ceremony for newly inducted Union minister of state for Social Justice and Empowerment, Pratima Bhowmik at Belonia old town hall in South Tripura district.“I appeal to all of you that we need to attack them in Talibani style. We need to attack them once they land at the airport here. We will protect our government led by Biplab Kumar Deb with every drop of blood,” he said.A video clip of his comments went viral on the social media inviting wide criticism.Reacting to his remarks, Tripura TMC leader Subal Bhowmik demanded the BJP MLA's arrest.“West Bengal TMC leaders were harassed last night at a private hotel in Agartala where they are staying. The incident happened after the MLA made this provocative remark,” he claimed.BJP Tripura chief spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said the comment made by Bhowmik is exclusively his own and the party does not take any responsibility.“ It is entirely his responsibility. This is not the culture of BJP,” Chakraborty told PTI.When contacted, Bhowmik said he had made the remark as an example to justify how to counter the TMC seriously.“I used the word 'Talibani' to make it clear that the way the Trinamool Congress is trying to harm the BJP government in Tripura, it needs a strong reaction. Use of the word ‘Talibani' might have sent a wrong message, but my intention was just to narrate how to counter them seriously,” the BJP legislator said.Clashes between the TMC and the BJP have been reported from Tripura over the past few weeks.On his first visit, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee's convoy was allegedly attacked by BJP workers in Tripura on August 3.The TMC had claimed that two of its youth leaders from West Bengal sustained injuries after being attacked by BJP workers in Dhalai district of the north-eastern state on August 7.The TMC alleged that two of its MPs -Dola Sen and Aparupa Poddar – were attacked twice by BJP supporters in South Tripura district on Independence Day.The saffron party, however, has denied the allegations, saying the TMC posed no threat to them in the state.

However, the expected visit has again generated buzz about a possible Cabinet expansion in Uttar Pradesh. A senior UP leader recently said that unless the expansion and appointments to corporations are done this month (August) they will lose meaning given that the polls are just about six to seven months away.The response to the ‘Jan Ashirvad Yatra’ (interaction and public meetings of the newly inducted central ministers) will also be a discussion point during the meeting, they say.Party leaders insist the programme has been “tremendous hit”.However, recently a BJP MLA’s car was also allegedly attacked in western UP’s Muzaffarnagar by people protesting the centre’s contentious farm laws. Budhana MLA Umesh Malik was attending an event in Sisauli village, the home turf of farmer leader Rakesh TikaitNotably, this will be the third visit of Adityanath to Delhi since June when he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah and Nadda amid speculation of a change of guard in the state.

Some sugar mills have also signed forward contracts for export for the ensuing sugar season 2021-22.With international prices of sugar increasing substantially in the past month, the demand for Indian raw sugar is very high. Accordingly, an advisory has been issued to all domestic sugar mills that they should plan for raw sugar production for export in the ensuing sugar season 2021-22 right from the very beginning and sign forward contracts with importers to take advantage of high international prices of sugar and global deficit, according to an official statement Sugar mills that export sugar and divert sugar to ethanol will also be given incentives in the form of an additional monthly domestic quota for sale in the domestic market.In the past few years, sugar production in the country has been more than domestic consumption.In order to find a permanent solution to deal with the problem of excess sugar, the Government is encouraging sugar mills to divert excess sugarcane to ethanol which is blended with petrol, which not only serves as a green fuel but also saves foreign exchange on account of crude oil import.However, as the adequate ethanol distillation capacities would be added by 2024-25, therefore, export of sugar will continue for another 2-3 years, explain officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-assembly-polls-centres-push-on-export-diversion-of-sugar-to-ethanol-to-ensure-timely-payment-of-cane-dues-to-farmers-299446

19-08-2021||New Delhi||Spirits run low in Delhi’s ‘Little Kabul’ on Afghanistan’s Independence Day||For the Afghan community living in India, August 19 is a milestone as Afghanistan had achieved Independence on this very day in 1919, but following the takeover of the war-torn country by the Taliban, the mood at Delhi’s ‘Little Kabul’ is anything but celebratory.From restaurants to departmental stores, the spirit of freedom, otherwise peaking on the anniversary day, was running low on Thursday in Lajpat Nagar, Bhogal and neighbouring Hazrat Nizamuddin area.Sharifa Ashuri, 23, who had moved to Delhi from Kabul in 2015, after the death of her father, said what is happening in Afghanistan is “weighing heavy on our minds”.At a restaurant in Lajpat Nagar—dubbed as “Little Kabul” of Delhi—where she works to make a living, she scrolls through social media feed to read about the situation in the war-torn country, her colleagues, also Afghans, huddle around her to watch videos, purportedly showing the Taliban roaming the streets.“My father worked in the military, but he was later killed. My mother and I along with other family members then moved from our village in Parwan province to Kabul and then later to India, as we didn’t feel safe there. We feel safe in India,” Ashuri told PTI.At most of the restaurants in the area, the spirit is either too low or staffers were discussing the current situation in Afghanistan, no country flags decked up at stores or eateries run by Afghans, overall a sombre mood on what would have been the 102nd anniversary of their Independence Day.Kabul Delhi Restaurant in Lajpat Nagar-II, otherwise brimming with guests and known for offering choicest Afghan delicacies, only had very few patrons in the afternoon who ate quietly in a corner.The 17-year-old restaurant, named after the capital cities of India and Afghanistan to signify the cultural connect of the two countries, is one of the preferred culinary destinations in Delhi to enjoy Afghan cuisine like Kabul Uzbeki, kofta chalao, qawrdagh (mutton fry), qorma kofta, and firni (desserts).A framed picture of Jami Masjid of Herat is hung on the wall, and a period drama plays on TV screen with low volume, but no special menu for August 19 this year.Mohammad Shafique, another resident of Lajpat Nagar, who had moved to Delhi from Kabul in 2016, detests Taliban.“They are hardliners, and they won’t let women have education or freedom. Right now, they are trying to appear moderate or reformed as they have to form a government. My Afghanistan as it was, is no more, my country has been destroyed,” he rued.“What to think of Independence Day celebrations when your brothers and sisters are living in fear in their own homeland,” Shafique said.Afghanistan had achieved Independence in 1919, overthrowing the British colonial yoke, with Amanullah Khan being its first sovereign ruler, a revered figure among the Afghans.Ashuri, wearing a black t-shirt which reads ‘Paris’, and sporting a tattoo near her left wrist, said, she shuddered to even think of the fate of women in Afghanistan.“I feel comfortable wearing a pair of denim or a t-shirt in India, but in Afghanistan, I will be shot dead now, if the Taliban see me in this dress,” she said, as she fixed a dupatta over her head.Ashuri and her co-workers, four Afghans, two Iranian chefs and an Indian chef, try to keep the mood light so that no one feels tense, even though the situation is having a psychological impact on their minds.“How can you avoid it, the news about the developments is everywhere, from Facebook to YouTube. My own friends had messaged me the day Taliban had overrun Kabul,” she said.Ijazul Haque Durrani, 23, her co-worker, looks calm but a storm is raging inside him.“My parents are camping at Kabul airport, since the day the capital city fell to the Taliban. Since, my father had worked odd jobs for the US nationals in Afghanistan, the Taliban had warned them of dire consequences if they continued to work, so he fled home,” he said.Durrani rued that two days ago he had spoken to his parents on phone, but now the mobile phone is coming switched off. The battery must have run out, don’t know what will happen to them, he said with a sense of worry.“I am safe here, and have chosen to not have a long beard. In Afghanistan, right now, I will be forced to grow long beard. So, I am still free here in India,” he added.Sheikh Ali, in mid-50s prays, sitting on a wide ‘dastarkhwan’—traditional sitting arrangement for eating—at Chopan Kebab Restaurant, but his optimism about Afghanistan’s fate has run dry.“I came to Delhi a month ago, with a family member for his medical treatment. The visa expires in two months. If India accepts me, I will not go back,” he said.Ashuri, when asked the meaning of Independence for her, pointed to her tattoo, and said, “Birds! That’s what freedom should be. Maybe, one day, I will fly to my dream city, Paris, from Delhi if not from Kabul”.

Further, the treatment and care at the hospital were such that Mr Mudijja did not require a lung transplant, even after 9 weeks of ECMO support,” Rela Hospital, a multi-speciality quaternary care hospital at Chrompet, here, claimed.After testing positive for Covid-19 in April end, Mudijja developed breathing difficulties before being referred to Rela Hospital. A CT scan prior to his admission at Rela Hospital indicated moderate Covid-19 pneumonia.His oxygen saturation level was at 92 percent in room air, when he was transferred to the hospital. His condition deteriorated and he required 10 litres of oxygen per minute. The heart and lung team led by Dr C Arumugam, senior consultant, heart and lung transplant surgeon, decided to move him into ECMO. Despite the progress being minimal during the initial 4-5 weeks, the hospital continued the medicare, it said.“ECMO, traditionally, has been used as an intermittent arrangement until lung transplantation. However, now this team has truly made it a life-saving procedure,” Dr Mohamed Rela, the hospital chairman said.Speaking to reporters here he said it had allowed critical patients a better opportunity to survive and get back to their normal life. “It was an amazing outcome for the patient and his family,” he added.After almost 50 days into ECMO, Mudijja slowly started improving, with enhancing lung performance. The clinical team decided to proceed with the treatment plan but without a transplant said Dr C Arumugam.“On the 54th day of his ECMO support, the CT scan showed few areas of resolution and we gradually reduced the ECMO support. And after 62 days into ECMO, the patient came off ECMO completely.”“We witnessed a miracle in front of our eyes. We kept him on minimal ventilator support with tracheotomy for another two weeks and weaned him off the ventilator on 29 July, 2021,” Dr Arumugam explained.Soon, the patient was made to sit and walk and take regular normal feeds.“Mr Mudijja is the only patient in the country to recover without lung transplant after being hooked up to an artificial lung ECMO for over 60 days,” said Dr Arumugam.With apprehensions of third coronavirus wave and the public still to be fully vaccinated, Prof Rela felt that the ECMO machine will be a critical tool on which the healthcare fraternity shall depend upon in this uncertain time for the treatment of other life-threatening illnesses.Meanwhile, MGM Healthcare, a super-specialty hospital here, announced that it has successfully treated a 32-year-old male Covid-infected patient who was on ECMO—a procedure that oxygenates a patient’s blood outside the body—support for 72 days, making him another longest ECMO Covid-19 survivor in the country.MGM Healthcare which runs one of the most comprehensive ECMO programmes in the country, has treated more than 200 patients on ECMO during the Covid times with lung transplantation wherever required.In a release here, Dr KR Balakrishnan, Chairman-Cardiac Sciences Director, Institute of Heart and Lung Transplant & Mechanical Circulatory Support, MGM Healthcare said the patient from Chennai became critically ill after contracting Covid-19 on May 18 and was treated at another local hospital.His lungs were severely damaged and he suffered from numerous other health issues after contracting the coronavirus which includes ENT, bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation and episodes of seizure. The patient even suffered from cardiac arrest during this time. The patient was put on ECMO in the first week of June and underwent tracheostomy in the second week of June to stabilise his health condition, he said.The patient was discharged recently. The hospital further said that two young patients have recovered fully after being on ECMO support for over 62 days and have been discharged from the hospital recently.

Former CII DG Tarun Das is the Chairman and Prof Ajit Mishra is the IEG Director.The name of Singh was suggested by the former PM who has served as President of IEG since 1992, according to an IEG news release.“The role of institutions like IEG in the developmental journey of our economy and society can never be understated. True to the wishes of our founder VKRV Rao, and other stalwarts, this institution has inspired generations of researchers, practitioners and policymakers in the field of development and public policy. Going forward it is only natural that there will be new challenges which can through our endeavour be translated into new opportunities and initiatives,” said Dr Singh in his letter to the Institute Director.“However, in the light of my advanced age and indifferent health, I have to withdraw from many active duties. I am afraid I will have to ask you to continue your journey with another leader. With this mind, I would propose the name of my trusted and able friend NK Singh to lead IEG Society as president,’’ he wrote.“NK had a long association with the Institute and this relationship has been revived recently in the form of his induction in the Board of Trustees as member. He is a proven leader with five decades of work in public policy design and implementation,’’ he said about NK Singh who also served in the PMO during Dr Singh’s premiership.“While honouring his wish to be relieved of the presidency, members highlighted his role in shaping IEG’s strong research culture and standing as an institution of excellence in research and training,’’ said the IEG new release.NK Singh was formerly with the IAS and became a Rajya Sabha MP for the Janata Dal (United). After the end of his term in 2014, he joined the BJP. Besides handling senior bureaucratic assignments, he has also served as Member, Planning Commission and was Officer on Special Duty to then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nk-singh-replaces-manmohan-singh-as-institute-of-economic-growth-president-299395
19-08-2021||New Delhi||On our Independence Day, we Afghans feel like prisoners, says former journalist||Cooped up inside his Kabul home with his family since the Taliban took over the capital city, Akhtarabir Akhtar, who eagerly waits to celebrate August 19 to mark the Independence Day of his beloved Afghanistan, says instead of festivities, fear and an uneasy calm rule the streets.Akhtar, a former journalist, is not a stranger to the fear of being targeted, but the chain of events in the past few days has given him sleepless nights."August 19 is our Independence Day and we celebrate this occasion every year with feast and much gaiety. People decorate their homes and plant country flags, make merry, go to decked-up bazaars, wear colourful national clothes and do the national dance 'Attan'. All of that is missing today," the 54-year-old told PTI over phone from Kabul.While phone lines and internet are working in Afghanistan, the network connection is wobbly and his voice sometimes quivered as he bared his sentiments on the situation in his homeland."Afghans celebrate August 19, but the government has fallen, what to talk of freedom. People are locked up inside their homes from Kabul to Kandahar and are afraid to step out as the Taliban men are marching in the streets. We all feel like prisoners on our anniversary day of 'azadi'," he said.Prices of food and other commodities have "shot up as borders are practically sealed", he said.Akhtar, who works as a government official, lives in Kabul with his wife and two daughters aged 27 and 18, while his elder son works in Germany and the younger one is studying at a university in Beijing."My wife is a midwife at a private hospital. She is scared to go to work now. My elder daughter who worked in a bank earlier is feeling uncertain and my younger daughter who was dreaming of going to a college and pursue higher studies, is now wondering if she will be even allowed to study by the Taliban and live freely," he rued.A despondent Akhtar, who has not gone to office since the Taliban intensified its offensive early this month, lamented that "Afganistan has descended into an abyss of uncertainty"."No one wants to live here anymore as they fear for their lives. Some of my relatives and friends had also rushed to the Kabul airport to seek a flight out of the capital city the day it had fallen to the Taliban, but they couldn't escape, so returned to their homes," he said.The story of the Akhtar family finds echoes in tens of thousands of households across Afghanistan, which had achieved Independence way back in 1919, overthrowing the British colonial yoke, with Amanullah Khan being its first sovereign ruler, a revered figure among the Afghans.However, the civil wars in later decades had fractured the peaceful and progressive atmosphere that once existed in Afghanistan.The Taliban swept across the country this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1.The insurgent forces has now sought to portray themselves as more moderate than when they had imposed a brutal rule in the late 1990s. But many Afghans remain sceptical of this and fear return of "regressive" regime.Akhtar says he loves Afghanistan and is emotionally attached to his motherland, but given the current situation, if an opportunity comes up, "I will move out of country with my family, preferably to India, which is like my second home".The former journalist from Kabul, recalled his visit to India in 2011-12 when had come to Delhi for a mid-career course and become an admirer of India and its culture."I have fond memories of my India visit and besides academics, we had also gone to see the Taj Mahal and other places. The food and the culture of India are very colourful like we have in Afghanistan. We are good friends and it breaks my heart that Kabul had fallen to Taliban on August 15, the day India marked its 75th Independence Day," Akhtar said, with a tone of sadness in his voice.He recalled his visit 10 years ago to south Delhi's Lajpat Nagar -- dubbed as 'Little Kabul' -- and how he felt it was "piece of Afghanistan in India"."India and its culture and cinema always attracted me. Even I have seen the Hindi film 'Kabuliwala'. It was such a beautiful coincidence that both countries achieved liberation in the month of August, Afghanistan in 1919 and India in 1947," the Kabul resident said.In August 2019, a suicide bomb attack in Kabul had delayed the centenary Independence Day celebrations in Afghanistan and its at embassies in Delhi and elsewhere.Asked how the Independence Day is generally marked in capital Kabul, Akhtar said, "Women wear beautiful 'Gande Afghani', men wear kurta and salwar, and lot of merriment takes place at home, people eat chopan kebab, Kabuli palaw, firni, dry fruits halwa, and greet each other, visit markets to shop"."Today with Taliban at our doorsteps literally, we can't even put up our national flag. Only Allah knows, what will happen to Afghanistan now," he lamented. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-our-independence-day-we-afghans-feel-like-prisoners-says-former-journalist-299393

19-08-2021||New Delhi||India’s national security challenges becoming complex, says Rajnath Singh||Noting that India's national security challenges are increasing and becoming "complex" in view of the changing geopolitical situation globally, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday strongly pitched for a strong, capable and completely 'self-reliant' defence industry in the country.Singh's comments came amid growing concerns in India and elsewhere over the Taliban sweeping across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of Afghanistan following the collapse of the US-backed government."Today, the security scenario in the whole world is changing very fast. Because of this, the challenges to our national security are increasing and becoming complex. There are constant changes in the global geopolitical situation," Singh said, without making specific references.He was speaking after launching the ‘Defence India Startup Challenge 5.0’, an initiative under the Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) that acts as an umbrella organisation to promote technology development for the defence sector.Singh said considering the fast-changing security challenges, India must focus on having strong, capable, and 'self-reliant' defence industry to cater to the needs of the armed forces."It is necessary that we not only create strong, modern and well-equipped forces, but also develop our defence industry, which is equally strong, capable, and most importantly, completely 'self-reliant'," the defence minister said.

If we take various parameters like the number of new cases being reported, daily positivity rate and hospitalisation rate, coronavirus, as of now, is fully under control across Telangana, in all districts and all regions," state Director of Public Health G Srinivasa Rao said.He said the administration is, however, fully alert in dealing with the situation and urged people not to let their guard down.Telangana on Wednesday recorded 424 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of positive cases in the state to 6,53,626.The recovery and case fatality rates were at 98.35 per cent and 0.58 per cent, compared to the national average of 97.50 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.While the Covid-19 situation is under control, seasonal diseases like dengue and malaria are being reported in some districts of the state, he said on Wednesday.Observing that the state government has initiated various measures to deal with the rise in cases of malaria and dengue, he urged people to take precautionary measures to avoid contracting them.Though the state is at a stage of eliminating malaria, he said the districts of Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Mulugu have seen cases of malaria this year, Rao said.Dengue cases are witnessed predominantly in urban areas, with 50 per cent of them being reported in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), he said.The state government has taken up anti-larva operations and other measures to prevent the spread of the seasonal diseases, he said. A door-to-door fever survey has been taken up in the GHMC. Preparedness in hospitals has also been stepped up.The Health department official cautioned people against mistaking or neglecting the symptoms of seasonal diseases with Covid-19 symptoms and suggested seeking medical care without delay. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-second-wave-over-in-telangana-health-official-299385
19-08-2021||New Delhi||Vehicle scrapping will help in import substitution of metal: Gadkari||The scrapping policy unfolded by the Union Government recently could help India meet its entire requirement of metal, so that metal was no more needed to be imported, Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Road Transport and Highways, said here at a press conference.Gadkari said that metal worth about Rs three lakh crore was imported to India annually through the Commerce Ministry.The scrapping policy, designed to encourage vehicle owners to sell their old cars for scrapping and get a slew of benefits, would lead to a reduction of the volume of metal import or could even put an end to the practice of buying metal from abroad, he said.In the absence of an adequate supply of local steel, the metal had to be purchased from abroad at an exorbitant price. This creates a problem for the automobile industry, who export a sizeable portion of their products, Gadkari said.He said that the new policy is expected to give a boost to the scrapping of vehicles and steel extracted from the scrapped vehicle would be able to meet the requirement of the automobile industry.Gadkari said that following the recent increase in the draft of various ports in the country, it has become easier for ships carrying heavy loads to come to India. Wreckage of cars from foreign countries could also be brought to India by ships and turned into scrap. Besides steel, aluminium and copper and plastic and rubber could be extracted from the scrap.The Minister pointed out that India imported aluminium and copper too.Gadkari said industrial clusters would be set up for doing value addition to the raw material extracted from scrap for producing various useful items including automobile components. “Component industry is also quite good. A lot of these are exported to other countries”, the Minister said. He said the use of recycled material would bring down the production cost of cars and make automobiles cheaper in the domestic market also.“This is because the material extracted from waste is cheap”, Gadkari said.Gadkari said 86 per cent of the total demand for lithium-ion batteries in the country was met by local manufacturers, Gadkari. Very soon, the entire demand for lithium-ion batteries would be met by the local manufacturers, he added. The use of recycled lithium-ion in batteries would also bring down the price of battery-operated vehicles in the country, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vehicle-scrapping-will-help-in-import-substitution-of-metal-gadkari-299384
19-08-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh fined Rs 25,000 for not appearing before inquiry commission||An inquiry commission headed by a retired high court judge has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh for not appearing before it.The Maharashtra government in March formed a one-member commission of Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal (retd) to conduct a probe into corruption allegations levelled by Singh against the then state home minister Anil Deshmukh.As Singh failed to appear before the commission on Wednesday, a fine of Rs 25,000 was imposed on him, a government lawyer said on Thursday.During the previous hearing, the probe panel had given Singh the "last chance" to appear before it.This is the second instance of fine being imposed on Singh.In June, the commission had asked the senior IPS officer to pay a fine Rs 5,000 for not appearing before it despite a summons. The amount was to be deposited in the Chief Minister's Covid Relief Fund.Days after he was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner and transferred to the Home Guards in March, Singh claimed in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh used to ask police officers to collect money from restaurant and bar owners in Mumbai.Deshmukh, an NCP leader, has denied the allegations. The Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate are probing the allegations made against Deshmukh by the senior IPS officer.

19-08-2021||Chennai||Chennai surgeon designs 3D printed heart valve||A city-based surgeon has designed and developed a unique prototype of 3D printed specialised biopolymer heart valve to replace the valves currently made with metal components (mechanical) or animal tissue (bioprosthetic).The 3D printed heart valves, made with specialised biopolymers that are very similar to human tissue, can be directly implanted in heart patients requiring valve replacement, according to Dr Sanjay Cherian."We are happy to announce we have designed and developed India's first 3D printed heart valve. We came up with four different prototypes and this is the fourth generation. It seems to be working well," Dr Cherian, who has been researching on this project for about a year, told PTI.This scientific innovation was undertaken in collaboration with the Centre for Automation and School of Mechanical Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Chennai, he said.Dr Cherian claimed the 3D printed heart valve will revolutionise valve replacement surgeries and will considerably improve the chances of the body accepting the implant."Valve surgeries are being performed for over half-a-century. In several cases the patients turn up after 5 or 10 years with the valve probably infected or torn off in the case of valves made with animal tissue," he said.As to his inspiration, he said "we have been doing extensive research on the concept of 3D printing in the field of medicine."Earlier, 3D printing was used to plan the surgical approach, especially for complex procedures, in order to help cardiac surgeons and cardiologists to navigate and choose the best approach to treat heart diseases."This time, we focused our efforts on using 3D printers to manufacture heart valves using specialised biopolymers that are very similar to human tissue, which can be directly implanted in heart patients," he explained.The process of patenting this 3D printed heart valve, and testing it to confirm its biocompatibility, efficacy and durability is on, he added.Declining to reveal the biopolymer, which he proposes to use, Dr Cherian said "we need to conduct a series of tests (in laboratory) before trying it on animals like dog, pig or sheep models that have heart valves similar to humans." This would take some time before commencing human trials, he said and indicated that the biopolymers will be divulged at a later stage.As this innovative produce is being made under the "Made in India" programme, the cost of implant would be much lower than the imported heart valves currently used in India, he claimed.The cost of imported surgically implantable heart valve ranges between Rs 45,000 (mechanical) and Rs 65,000-80,000 for animal tissue valve. Presently, they are imported mainly from the US. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chennai-surgeon-designs-3d-printed-heart-valve-299363

BenchNotification soonIn an interim order, a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul, however, clarified that the results would be subject to the final outcome of the petition.It also directed the Union Public Service Commission to issue an appropriate notification taking into account its order and give it due publicity. The court wondered why the government was continuing in this direction even after its 2020 verdicts extending permanent commission in the Army and Navy to women. “If you are introducing women in the Army then why do you create a bar in NDA,” the Bench asked Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, adding that the government shouldn’t always invite judicial intervention.As Bhati said the Army has conferred Permanent Commission to many women, the Bench shot back, “You had kept on opposing it till the orders were passed by this court. You didn’t do anything on your own. The Navy and Air Force were more forthcoming while the Army seems to have some kind of bias.”Bhati said there were several modes of entry into the Army like the NDA, Indian Military Academy (IMA) and Officers Training Academy (OTA) and women could enter into the force through the OTA and IMA.“Why is it not through the NDA? Is co-education a problem?” the Bench asked.As Bhati said it was a policy decision that women were not allowed in the NDA, the Bench said the policy decision was based on gender discrimination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-women-to-appear-for-nda-exam-299146

A strategically important road passes through Charikar via the Salang Tunnel, which connects Kabul with Mazar-i-Sharif, the largest city in northern Afghanistan and once held by Dostum.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/panjshiris-remain-defiant-claim-uzbek-leader-dostums-support-299155

The genuine manufacturer of Covishield (Serum Institute of India) has confirmed that the products listed in this alert are falsified. These falsified products have been reported at the patient level in Uganda and India.”The WHO said only genuine Covishield vaccine was indicated for active immunisation of individuals 18 years or older for the prevention of Covid-19 disease. “Falsified Covid-19 vaccines pose a serious risk to global public health and place an additional burden on vulnerable populations and health systems,” it said, calling for urgent detection and removal of falsified product batches in India and Uganda to prevent harm to patients.The world body also asked nations and regions likely to be affected by the falsified Covishield product mentioned in its alert to enhance vigilance within supply chains.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fake-covishield-vaccines-found-in-india-uganda-who-issues-alert-299156

We are finding it absurd. Will the Army act on after the judicial orders are passed? We will then pass an order, if that is what you want. I have this impression right from the High Court that till an order is passed, the Army does not believe in doing anything voluntarily,” the Bench said.As Bhati said the Army has conferred Permanent Commission to many women, the Bench shot back, “You had kept on opposing it till the orders were passed by this court.

Probably by September or just after September, we may have a vaccine for children… this is Covaxin,” she said.The trials for Zydus Cadila are on and the vaccine can be made available for inoculating children. “Even that (Zydus Cadila vaccine) will be available,” she said.The NIV is a body under the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) under the Ministry of Health.Last month, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had told BJP MPs that Covid vaccination for children is likely to start soon.Currently, only those who are 18 or above are eligible for vaccination against coronavirus.On other vaccine candidates, Abraham said apart from Zydus Cadila, which will be the first DNA vaccine, another vaccine from Gennova, which is an mRNA vaccine, vaccine candidate of Biological E and Novavax, which will be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, are in the pipeline.In response to a question on the Delta-plus variant, she said this variant is less likely to spread than the Delta variant itself.She said the antibodies produced in the bodies of vaccinated people were checked against this variant and it was found that the efficacy of antibodies was reduced two to three fold.“Yet, the vaccines are still protective against the variants,” she said.Vaccines may show a little less efficacy, but they are very important to prevent serious forms of disease due to which patients may get hospitalised and even die.“So, whatever the variant, the vaccine is till now protective against all, including the Delta variant. So, there should not be any hesitancy at all,” she said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccines-for-children-may-be-available-by-september-niv-director-299003

19-08-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Afghan man, who had narrow escape from Taliban and is a research scholar at Kerala University, worries about his family||It was only a few years ago that Hakeem Jan Muffaker had a fortunate escape from the gunpoint of the Taliban when he travelled from Kabul to his sleepy home village in Paktia province in Afghanistan.Even days after he managed to flee the mountainous province giving the militants a slip, the frightening memories of the turban-clad insurgents wielding guns continued to haunt him.Before and after the shocking incident, Muffaker, a research scholar at the Kerala University here since 2019, has several horrendous tales of Taliban's cruelty to share.When the news of the Taliban sweeping into the Afghan capital trickled in, Muffaker was thousands of miles away from his native place, in Kerala.But, the 38-year-old man is all anxious about the safety of his parents and siblings living in Kabul, especially his brother, a serving officer in the Afghan national army."As soon as the news broke, I called my family members. They are all scared of the brutal Taliban. As my brother is a national army officer, his life is at risk," Muffaker told PTI.As the Afghan government collapsed and the reign of the country landed in the hands of the fundamentals, his brother returned home the other day.Accusing the neighbouring Pakistan of providing all support to the Taliban, the man said dictatorship would not last for long."The Afghan people will stand firmly against them if they (Taliban) are trying to implement Pakistan's dirty policies there, violating the rule of law, human freedom and rights," he said.Detailing the cruelties of the insurgents, the Afghan national alleged that Taliban had 25 years of experience in killing the innocent and destroying infrastructure worth billions.Muffaker recounted his own personal experience of having a miraculous escape from the clutches of the insurgents nine years ago.It happened when he had gone to his native village in Paktia province, which was under the control of Taliban, to attend a family function."A day before my return to Kabul, the local Taliban had planned to kill or kidnap me. Fortunately one of my relatives got a whiff of their plan and shared it with us," he said."I was scared to the bones and could not sleep for the next two days. I stayed in the village. I had to delay my trip out of fear and lied to the villagers that I and other guests had already left the place. We secretly travelled to Kabul later," the man said, adding that he could narrate several stories of gun fire and suicide attacks masterminded by the Taliban.Noting that women would have only limited role, freedom and rights under the Taliban rule as compared to the previous government, he said most of the key government military and civil officials had already left the country out of fear for life.The only positive aspect about the present developments was that the decades-long internal violence had ended as the elected government collapsed and the insurgents gained control over the country, he said.Observing that it was difficult to predict the future of internal conflicts now, he said it was just the beginning and one had to wait and watch what would happen in the coming days under the Taliban rule.Muffaker, who is pursuing PhD in political science with scholarship, sees only a bleak future for him under the Taliban regime if he goes back to his home country."I had clarity with regard to my future under President Ghani's dispensation. Now, I don't believe the Taliban will respect my voice of freedom, professionalism and experience," he rued.Working with the Ministry of Urban Development and Land in the Afghanistan government, Muffaker took a sabbatical from his job to pursue his academic dreams.Luckily, he brought his wife and children along to Kerala when he came here to join the university.Asked whether he would like to go back to his home country soon in view of the present developments, the man said he would prefer to stay in India or migrate to any Western country if there is no respect for democracy and human rights in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan."I am committed to my country if there is respect for democracy and human rights. If not possible then I will prefer to stay in India or any Western country," he added.Muffaker is one of several Afghan nationals studying in various universities of Kerala under the Union government's Indian Council for Cultural Relationship scholarship programme.When contacted, Mustafa Salimi, another student from Afghanistan in Kerala University, was reluctant to talk, saying he was anxious about the present developments in the home country, so it was difficult for him to answer queries regarding it.Professor Sabu Joseph, Director of the Centre for Global Academics at Kerala University, said there were some students who went back to Afghanistan recently to renew their visa and were trapped there due to the ongoing issues."An Afghan student, who completed his PhD and was about to join as a post doctoral fellow in sociology, recently went to Kabul to change his visa. He is now trapped there and it is not clear now whether he can return to India and continue his studies," he told PTI.As many as 11 students have enrolled in the new batch, to begin next month, in Kerala University in various streams after winning the ICCR scholarship.Joseph said they are concerned about the academic future of those students.Due to the Covid situation, the classes would be on the offline mode in the initial two-three months and as per the new directive, foreign students can attend the class staying in their homeland during the period.Of the total 3,500 ICCR scholarships, provided by the Government of India every year, 1,000 are reserved for Afghan students alone, university sources added.

That is a confession that software-spyware was used. For what, we do not know.""We want to know if that spyware-software was called Pegasus and for what purpose was it used," the former home minister said in a series of tweets.If the government answers these two questions, the remaining questions will answer themselves in due course, Chidambaram said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told a bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana that those involved in terror activities might take pre-emptive steps if the government divulged details of which software is used for various purposes, including interception.The apex court, which made it clear that it did not want the government to disclose anything which compromised national security, issued notice to the Centre on the batch of pleas seeking an independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter and posted the matter for hearing after 10 days.During the arguments, Mehta said this could not be a subject matter of affidavit and public debate and the government had said in its limited affidavit that it would constitute a committee of experts to examine all the aspects of the Pegasus issue.

With the retirement of Justice Navin Sinha on Wednesday, the actual strength of the top court would come down to 23 judges.If the recommendations are processed by the government and the appointments are made the top court's strength would go up to 33, one short of its total sanctioned strength.Justice UU Lalit, Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice LN Rao are the other judges who are part of the Collegium led by CJI Ramana.As 69,476 cases remained pending in the top court, the Supreme Court Bar Association president Vikas Singh had demanded that India should go back to the old system of judicial appointment. "The way the Collegium system is functioning, it’s better that we revert to the old system as neither there is transparency nor are they able to decide names for elevation. A large number of vacancies in the Supreme Court and high courts don’t inspire confidence in the Collegium system," Singh had told The Tribune recently.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-women-judges-among-9-recommended-by-collegium-for-appointment-to-supreme-court-298920
