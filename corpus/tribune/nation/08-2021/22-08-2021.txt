Efforts are on to identify others,” Shukla said.CM Chouhan had also said the government has taken a tough stand vis-a-vis the Ujjain incident.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pro-pak-slogans-ten-arrested-nsa-invoked-against-four-in-ujjain-300678

Since increasing the ticket fares affects the passengers, we cannot do so. During the pandemic, the Railways suffered losses of Rs 36,000 crore,” he said.“Only goods trains generate revenue. During the pandemic, these trains played an important role in carrying goods and providing relief to people,” the minister added.Speaking about bullet train, he said this project would be rolled out along the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway as it is necessary for people.The Railways has undertaken the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor project, which will connect Navi Mumbai to Delhi, Danve said.He assured doubling of tracks between Nanded and Manmad stations, and said he would check if the Jalna-Khamgaon railway line was viable or not.Hitting out at his detractors, Danve said he was being attacked from all quarters. “But I become stronger after facing criticism,” he said.Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope, who was also present at the event, said the state government has sanctioned a hospital in Jalna for treatment of those suffering from mental illnesses.

The attack on the 60-year-old woman took place at Parvathipuram village of Nidmanoor Mandal in Nalgonda district today. As per the complaint registered with the police, the man identified as Ette Suraiah and his wife Bhoodevi first sprayed chilli powder on the face of his mother Kistamma and attacked, not satisfied with the act, hit her with a sickle. In the attack, Kistamma suffered severe injuries on her head. The police report said that Kistamma and her husband Kotaiah owned 20 acres of land; out of this, they transferred 8 acres each to two of their sons and kept four acres for themselves. The couple lived in a separate house in the village and took care of their needs from earning their four acres. For some time, the elder son had been pressurising the parents to give the land in the name of the parents to him. There was a fight over the issue today, after which the parents refused to accept Suraiah proposal. Angry with his parents, he and his wife attacked Kistamma when she was alone in the house and later fled. He had attacked his mother in 2019 too with a stick, but the police did not pursue the complaint due to a family compromise.  After the villagers informed the police, it rushed to the spot and shifted Kistamma to a hospital at Miryalaguda, where her condition is severe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elderly-woman-attacked-with-sickle-by-son-for-land%C2%A0in-telangana-village-300667
22-08-2021||New Delhi||Quad’s 4-day Malabar wargame to begin on Thursday off the coast of Guam||The Quad countries—India, the US, Australia and Japan—will carry out the next edition of the high-voltage Malabar naval exercise from August 26 to 29 off the coast of Guam amid mounting global concerns over China’s growing military muscle-flexing in the Indo-Pacific region.Indian stealth frigate INS Shivalik and anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kadmatt arrived in Guam, an island territory of the US in the Western Pacific, on Saturday to take part in the exercise that will feature an array of complex drills, Indian Navy officials said on Sunday.“The Malabar-21 would witness high-tempo exercises among destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, helicopters and long-range maritime patrol aircraft of the participating navies,” Indian Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.“Complex surface, sub-surface and air operations including live weapon firing drills, anti-surface, anti-air and anti-submarine warfare drills, and joint manoeuvres and tactical exercises will be conducted during the exercise,” he said.The Malabar exercise is taking place in the midst of growing convergence of interests in the maritime domain as well as military cooperation among the four Quad countries in the face of China’s increasing assertiveness.Though the exercise is not part of the framework of cooperation under Quad, it is increasingly seen as a reflection of increasing partnership among the four countries.Later this year, US President Joe Biden is expected to hold an in-person summit of the leaders of the Quad countries in Washington to explore ways to further expand cooperation among its member countries.Senior officials of India and the other member nations of the Quad on August 12 held extensive talks on advancing practical cooperation in areas of infrastructure, maritime security, counter-terrorism and cybersecurity to achieve the goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific.Commander Madhwal said the conduct of the exercises despite the coronavirus restrictions is a “testimony of synergy” among the participating navies and their commitment to safer seas.Following India’s invitation, Australia participated in the Malabar exercise last year that effectively made it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015. This annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.Last year, the exercise was hosted in two phases in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.There have been mounting global concerns over China’s growing military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.India, the US, Australia, Japan and many other like-minded countries are working towards ensuring a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.“The exercise will provide an opportunity for common-minded navies to enhance inter-operability, gain from best practices and develop a common understanding of procedures for maritime security operations,” the Navy spokesperson said.“As part of the exercise, Vice Admiral AB Singh, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command will have operational discussions with Rear Admiral Leonard C ‘Butch’ Dollaga, Commander task force-74, focussing on developing an action plan and coordinated operations in the maritime domain,” he added.

22-08-2021||New Delhi||Sowing area of kharif crops 1.55% lower than last year so far: Government data||The area under kharif crops as of August 20 this year increased to 1043.87 lakh ha, up by 33.40 lakh ha against the normal of 1010.48 lakh ha in the corresponding week—the average of five years. However, when compared to last year, the area dropped by 16.49 lakh hectares due to “deficient/scattered/erratic rainfall at the beginning of monsoon season”, according to the official data.The total area under Kharif in the corresponding week in 2020 was 1060.37 lakh ha.Cotton has seen a decrease of 10.65 lakh ha as compared to 2020 and constitutes the maximum component of the 16.49 lakh ha overall Kharif shortfall. Though when compared with the ‘normal’ the deficiency is only 1.01 lakh ha. About 97.28% of the normal area (Directorate of Economics & Statistics) coverage has been reported by the states as on August 20, which comprises rice 94.54%, pulses 99.21%, coarse cereals 92.09%, oilseeds 104.36%, sugarcane 114.94%, jute & mesta 95.25% and cotton 94.7%.“Cotton acreage decreased marginally by 1.01 lakh ha to 117.04 lakh hectares against 118.06 lakh ha during the corresponding period of normal. Less acreage is reported from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Punjab, due to deficient/ scattered/ erratic rains at the beginning of kharif season,” officials say.  “Sowing of Kharif crops can be continued up to end of August, particularly paddy, urad, moong, sesamum (sesame), castor, kulthi etc,” they say adding that “significant improvement in progress of area coverage has been observed with the improvement of monsoon rains”.Compared to the ‘normal’ of the corresponding week, area coverage increased under rice, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane. However, there was “marginal drop” under coarse cereals, jute & mesta, and cotton.The area under coarse cereals decreased by 1.35 lakh ha to 169.06 lakh hectares against 170.42 lakh ha, the normal during the corresponding period, as per the official figures. The major reduction was reported mainly from states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana, Haryana, and Gujarat due to erratic monsoon at the beginning of the season. Between June 1 and August 20, the cumulative rainfall received in the country is 575.9 mm against normal of 628.3 mm, a deficit of 8 per cent.Though water storage available in 130 reservoirs in the country is 96% of live storage of corresponding period of last year and 99 per cent of storage of average of last 10 years according to the Central Water Commission.So far as paddy is concerned, total acreage increased by 15.14 lakh ha to 374.03 lakh hectares against 358.89 lakh ha during the corresponding period of normal but less than 378.07 lakh ha last year. The area coverage is less mainly in Odisha, Assam, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh due to deficit/excess rainfall, which hampered land preparation as well as raising of nursery beds for carrying out timely transplantation.However, all areas have been covered by monsoon rains except for Odisha, officials saidMeanwhile, the area under pulses increased by 3.11 lakh ha to 134.23 lakh hectares against 131.12 lakh ha during the corresponding week of normal. Oilseeds’ area also increased significantly by 14.35 lakh ha to 187.88 lakh hectares against 173.53 lakh ha during the corresponding period of normal. The area under sugarcane increased significantly by 3.19 lakh ha to 54.63 lakh hectares against 51.44 lakh ha during the corresponding period of normal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sowing-area-of-kharif-crops-1-55-lower-than-last-year-so-far-government-data-300661

22-08-2021||New Delhi||721 children in child care institutions contracted Covid since outbreak: RTI||Over 700 children in child care institutions in 11 states and Union Territories have contracted Covid-19 till now and no fatalities have been reported, according to data from the country’s apex child rights body.The data, which was shared by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights in response to an RTI query from PTI, also stated that 686 children living in child care institutions (CCIs) have been infected with Covid-19 so far this year.Last year, Uttar Pradesh was the only state out of the 11 states and Union Territories (UTs) to report coronavirus cases among children in CCIs. It had reported 35 cases, according to the data.This year, no coronavirus case has been reported yet from such institutions in Uttar Pradesh, it stated.According to the commission’s data, no death due to the coronavirus infection has been reported among children residing in CCIs from these 11 states and UTs.Out of 721 children in such institutions, who contracted the infection, the highest number was reported from Haryana (288) followed by Tamil Nadu (149) and Bihar (131), according to the data.It stated that the number of Covid-19 cases among children in CCIs in Mizoram was 46, Karnataka 37, Delhi 19, Telangana seven, Gujarat six, Chandigarh three.No case was reported from Andaman and Nicobar Islands, stated the data of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights for 11 states and UTs.There are 857 CCIs in these states and UTs and 33,695 beneficiaries reside in them, according to government data.In June, the Women and Child Development Ministry had asked states to make suitable arrangements for isolation facilities within CCIs to take care of children suffering from Covid-19 and prepare a roster of child psychologists or counsellors to visit the facilities and interact with them.To ensure institutional support through CCIs, the ministry had also asked states and UTs to organise special inspection drives in collaboration with district magistrates, for assessment of quality care at all CCIs for ascertaining the wellbeing of children.CCIs were also directed to ensure proper facilities such as clean and hygienic living conditions, basic amenities, quality food and safety for all children from the infection.

22-08-2021||Panaji||Goa, the land of feni, gets its first alcohol museum||The land of feni just got a museum wholly dedicated to the locally brewed alcohol.Started by local businessman Nandan Kudchadkar, who is a collector of antiques, the museum ‘All About Alcohol’ located in the tiny beach village of Candolim, houses hundreds of artefacts linked to feni, including large, traditional glass vats in which the local cashew-based alcohol was stored centuries ago.“The objective behind starting the museum was to make the world aware of Goa’s rich heritage, especially the story of feni and the legacy of the alcohol trail from Brazil to Goa,” Kudchadkar told IANS.The cashew nut plant was first believed to be imported into Goa by its colonial rulers, the Portuguese, from Brazil in the 1700s. Both Brazil and Goa share a common Lusophonian colonial influence.After the plant was brought to the shores of Goa, cashew has taken root in Goa and so has feni.Cashew feni is distilled from fermented juice extracted from the cashew apple and is a popular alcoholic beverage in Goa. The cashew apple is harvested from orchards by farmers, who lease the tracts from the government every season. The juice from the apples is then fermented and distilled using traditional equipment. Distilled once, the fermented juice transforms into a popular mildly intoxicating summer drink called ‘urrak’, while once double distilled, the drink is referred to as feni. Feni is also blended with spices like clove, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon to make another variation called ‘masala feni’.A similar process is also used to distill coconut feni from palm toddy. Cashew feni is also the country’s first indigenous liquor to obtain the Geographical Indication tag, a process which was initiated by local manufacturers of the brew in 2009.Feni, a drink commonly and socially consumed by the local residents of the coastal state, was notified as the state heritage drink by the Goa government in 2016 in a bid to allow its manufacturers to market it globally on the lines of scotch and tequila.“We have glass garafaos (vats) which date back to centuries, an era when the Portuguese ruled Goa. There are hundreds of exhibits, each made with love and the very act of seeing them in their glory makes us feel passionate about our heritage,” Kudchadkar said.Once manufactured, the feni was stored and aged in the large vats for years, in order to mature it.Kudchadkar added that the alcohol museum would serve as a repository which preserves alcohol-making implements such as utensils, glass, bottles and more from yesteryears when Goa was regarded as the ‘Rome of the East’.Speaking about his inspiration behind starting the museum, Kudchadkar said: “The inspiration was simple, it was the sheer pleasure of showcasing Goa as something different as usual. The cosmopolitan world traveller visits Goa and what better place is there in India other than Goa, where you can show to the world the history, respect and flavours of our colonial drink”. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goa-the-land-of-feni-gets-its-first-alcohol-museum-300639

22-08-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut likens India’s Partition to situation in Afghanistan||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday likened India’s partition to the present situation in Afghanistan and said it reminds people of the pain of destruction of a country’s existence and sovereignty.In his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut also said if Nathuram Godse had killed Jinnah, “who was responsible for creating Pakistan”, instead of Mahatma Gandhi, the Partition could have been avoided and there would have been no need for observing August 14 as ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’.“The situation in Afghanistan reminds us of what is the pain of destruction of a country’s existence and sovereignty,” the Marathi daily’s executive editor said.Raut compared India’s Partition to the current situation in Afghanistan where, he said, its troops “ran away”.How can the pain of Partition be eased unless the part which was broken away is included back? There will be no peace of mind, he said.“Even though we feel an ‘Akhand Hindustan’ should happen, it doesn’t look possible. But, hope is eternal. If PM Narendra Modi wants an ‘Akhand Hindustan, he is welcome. He should also speak about what he plans to do about 11 crore Muslims from Pakistan,” Raut said.The advocates of ‘Akhand Hindustan’ had accepted the idea of the Muslim League and two-nation theory and did not fight against it, he said, while quoting Marathi writer Narhar Kurundkar on the issue.Raut said Mahatma Gandhi was not in active politics when a system of separate Muslim electorate was introduced by the British.Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru abolished the system of separate Muslim electorate and special perks for them when India gained freedom, said the Sena leader, whose party shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra.He also said Muslim leaders had left the Congress when Gandhi refused their unreasonable demands.

22-08-2021||United Nations||Prevent UN General Assembly’s Session from being Covid ‘super-spreader’: US to world leaders||Amid the surging Delta variant of Covid-19, the US has urged world leaders to deliver their statements to the UN General Assembly’s Annual Session next month by video, instead of travelling to New York, to ensure that the high-level week doesn’t become a “super-spreader event”.The UN General Debate begins on September 21 and will run through September 27. According to the first provisional list of speakers for the General Debate at the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly released by the UN, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address the annual UN General Assembly Session in-person on September 25.US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield wrote a letter to the 193 member states of the UN that as the host country of the UN headquarters, her country bears a “significant responsibility” to ensure the safety of participants and New York residents.“So too does the Secretariat and President of the General Assembly. We need your help to prevent UNGA 76 High-Level Week from being a super-spreader event,” she wrote in the letter last week, seen by PTI.Thomas-Greenfield noted with concern that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a significant health risk around the world, with the Delta variant “necessitating enhanced mitigation” measures given its virulence among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated persons alike.With cases and hospitalisations increasing significantly in the US and all counties in New York City currently rated as having the highest level of community transmission, she said, “In light of current health concerns, we will convey to all member states and observers that heads of delegation should consider delivering their statements to the UN General Assembly’s General Debate by video.”           In case delegations choose to travel to New York for the General Debate, the US requested that delegations bring the minimum number of travellers necessary.US President Joe Biden is scheduled to address the session in-person, his first address to the world organisation as the American leader.As per the first provisional list of speakers, so far 167 Heads of State and Heads of Government and 29 Ministers and diplomats are scheduled to address the UN General Debate. About 40 leaders are listed to address the high-level session through pre-recorded statements, including Iran, Egypt, Indonesia, South Africa and Nepal.The 76th session of the UN General Assembly will begin September 14. Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid will be President of the year-long session.The US is also categorically telling member states that apart from the General Debate, when global leaders address the world organisation, all other high-level events, including those held on the sidelines, should be held virtually.Thomas-Greenfield said while the UN Secretariat has already communicated some modalities for the high-level week, “I want to make clear our call, as the host country, for all UN-hosted meetings and side events, beyond the General Debate, to be fully virtual”.Parallel meetings and high-level events drawing travellers to New York needlessly increases risk to the community, New Yorkers and other travellers, she said.“I am particularly concerned regarding the possibility of the UN, through the auspices of the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly, hosting several in-person high level events during high-level week—possibly to include events on climate change, vaccines, the 20th Anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the Food Systems Summit, and the high-level dialogue on Energy.“We feel strongly that the General Debate should be the only event held with in-person participation during High-Level Week; the United States is willing to make every effort to make these important events on shared priorities successful in a virtual format,” Thomas-Greenfield said.She said with a view to ensure safety of UNGA participants and New York residents, the US will significantly limit its in-person delegation travelling to New York and Washington encourages other member states to do the same.“We must each do our part in reducing the number of activities that would draw travellers to New York City at this time,” Thomas-Greenfield said.Last year, world leaders had submitted pre-recorded video statements for the United Nations General Assembly session in September, as heads of state and government could not physically attend the annual gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was the first time in the UN’s 75-year history that the high-level session had gone virtual.

Words can’t express how saddened I am for the disgrace. The wars in Afghanistan have been fairly constant since 1979.“Currently as we all are aware of the Afghanistan situation that the Taliban have seized power in Kabul and all parts of Afghanistan, it’s dangerous and fearful for people to go out of their homes, and everyone feels scattered and helpless.“Mostly I feel bad for women in Afghanistan. It is difficult for them to work or study. They have to cover their faces and be accompanied by a male relative if they want to venture out of their home. Women and children are suffering the most. People become prisoners in their own country. I feel like America just abandoned and betrayed common people. They kept us in dark and left us in darkness.”“With this current situation in Afghanistan, I won’t be able to go back to my country. It’s difficult to return and visit our homeland,” she said.'Going back to Afghanistan is out of question now'Dunya Bariz, 21, who grew up in Balkh province in Mazar-e-Sharif city, came to India in April 2018.She joined an English class and worked as a youth club leader in Don Bosco, a non-profit organisation.She is currently pursuing her higher education in Delhi University in political science honours course.“The situation is so risky as whole world knows how cruel and dangerous these Taliban militants are. As an Afghan girl, I can feel the fear and pain of my people and especially fear of thousands of girls and women who are not sure about their rights and freedom. Taliban never change, they are the same people of 20 years ago.“Witnessing this situation in my country breaks my heart and I feel shattered,” she said.She shared that mostly all her relatives are there in Kabul.“Unfortunately, they are in a great fear and can’t even get out of their homes. I am worried about them and I can’t do anything for them which makes me really sad. I am worried about my cousins who lost their dreams. My female cousins are not even able to continue their college,” she said.Going back to Afghanistan is out of question now as you saw how my people are dying especially in airport just because they wanted to get out of Afghanistan, as they know how Taliban is going to treat them, she shares.“I know the future of my country lies in its youth. So as an Afghan girl and as I have an opportunity of being here, I will do my best and do my studies very hard so that I can change the future of my country,” she said. Recounting fond memories of her homeland, she said, “I was born there and grew up there so each and every day was a memory for me. Yes, my country was not developed as other countries but it was like a heaven for me. The first day of school was the sweetest memory of my life.”'The world abandoned us when we needed them the most'Rangina, 23, from Kandahar, left Afghanistan in September 2011 during the ongoing war after she lost a family member.“All I can say about the current situation in Afghanistan is that the world abandoned us when we needed them the most, and it’s the people of Afghanistan who are suffering and losing their lives.”Based in France now, she recalls her simple life back in Afghanistan with her family but because of war she said they faced so much pain and agony.“I still remember when I was in 6th class and we were at school in our last lecture and then we got the news that there’s a bomb at the door of our school and that was horrible. We were all so scared as it was the third time such an incident occurred but thankfully no one got hurt.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lost-for-words-afghan-women-expatriates-fear-a-return-to-the-oppressive-past-after-taliban-takeover-300611

22-08-2021||Kanpur (UP)||Man held with 65 porn clips of girls he befriended on social media||The Kanpur crime branch police have arrested a man who has been blackmailing girls by making obscene videos.The police have recovered obscene videos of about 65 girls from the mobile phone of the accused.The man was arrested after one of the victims lodged an FIR at Kalyanpur police station on August 7.“The complainant had alleged that a person named Ankur Omar, had befriended her on Facebook, made physical relations with her and then filmed obscene videos. She alleged that he was now blackmailing her. Her family members have also come to know about all this,” DCP (crime) Salman Taj Patil said.The arrested man has been identified as Shekhar Suman, 28, a resident of Shahjahanpur.When the crime branch cops cross-checked his mobile and Facebook account, they were stunned.“Around 65 pornographic videos of girls were recovered from his mobile phone. Along with this, chatting details of hundreds of girls and their contact numbers were also found,” the police official said.Apparently, Shekhar used to send friend requests to girls through fake IDs on Facebook and Instagram. He would lure them into a relationship and then blackmail them by making obscene videos.“Shekhar Suman used to chat with 150 to 200 girls every day. He has made fake IDs on Facebook in the name of Ankur Gupta, Ayush Aggarwal, Ankur Omar, Neha Aggarwal, Soumya Omar etc. The account which has been created under the name Ankur Omar, only has his real photo in it while in the rest, fake photos of girls have been used. Ankur is Shekhar’s nick name”, the DCP said.Investigations revealed that Shekhar was in touch with girls from Agra, Shahjahanpur, Lucknow, Bareilly, Moradabad, Prayagraj as well as Delhi, Mumbai, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand.Shekhar, who has trapped hundreds of girls, had pursued his graduation from a postgraduate Sanskrit college of Shahjahanpur.He got this idea from a friend of his, named Satyam Awasthi.According to Shekhar, who was arrested on Saturday, Satyam also used to befriend girls in a similar manner.“The crime branch will now try to contact other victims. For this, the social media accounts of Shekhar Suman will also be scanned. His victims can now come forward and register their complaints,” said DCP Salman Taj Patil.

The Chinese Embassy statement also asked Pakistan officials to take practical and effective measures “to accelerate, to implement, (and) strengthen whole-process security measures and upgrade security cooperation mechanisms to ensure that similar incidents do not happen”.Chinese and Pakistani media outlets have reported the death of two children and injuries to one Chinese worker. The Pakistan Interior Ministry said the suicide bomber targeted a convoy of three vehicles carrying Chinese nationals and a police contingent. The investigating team is also due to identify the nature of the blast.This was a much stronger reaction than the previous one by Beijing to an attack on a bus last month in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that killed nine Chinese engineers working on a dam project which, like Gwadar, is part of the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-gwadar-attack-china-asks-pak-to-upgrade-security-300320

Kumar, after talking with Biswas, issued a statement, saying he would visit Tripura on August 29 and would discuss with him to sort out the party's organisational matter.Sushmita Dev, who resigned from the post of president of the All-India Mahila Congress and joined the TMC, told reporters at Silchar, her hometown, that she was in touch with Biswas and discussed various issues related to Tripura politics. Having defeated the BJP in the West Bengal Assembly elections held recently, Mamata has earned the distinction of being someone who can take on PM Narendra Modi.

22-08-2021||---||Former UP CM Kalyan Singh passes away||New Delhi, August 21Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh passed away at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, on Saturday due to multi-organ failure.He was 89. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath announced a state mourning of three days. “His last rites will be performed on the banks of Ganga in Narora on August 23. It will be a public holiday on that day,” he said in Lucknow.He gave voice to crores of people belonging to marginalised sections. Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterPrime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted a series of messages, calling the late BJP leader a veteran administrator and a grassroots-level leader. “I am saddened beyond words... Generations to come will remain forever grateful to Kalyan Singh ji for his contribution towards India’s cultural regeneration. He was firmly rooted in Indian values,” he said, adding that the veteran leader gave voice to the marginalised sections.The BJP’s success in Uttar Pradesh is attributed to a large degree to Kalyan Singh, a prominent OBC face who helped the saffron party build a solid vote base. A well-known face of Hindutva, he symbolised the rise of the saffron party in the Hindi heartland, successfully bringing together ‘mandal’ and ‘kamandal’.He was the CM of UP during the Babri Masjid demolition. Just hours after mobs of ‘kar sevaks’ demolished the structure, he quit as CM owning moral responsibility. The state Assembly was dissolved as riots erupted in the country. But observers say: “He had no regrets over his failure to save the mosque which he had assured the Supreme Court would be protected”.Kalyan Singh had filed an affidavit, assuring the court that the mosque would be protected. But he ordered the police not to open fire on protesters, arguing later that this would have led to a bloodshed.“May be it was destined that the structure would be demolished with me as CM,” he was quoted as saying ahead of the 2020 “bhoomi pujan” for Ram Temple at the once disputed site in Ayodhya.Hailed by many for his administrative acumen during his two stints as CM, the influential OBC leader from western UP left the BJP twice and floated his own party. Kalyan Singh won the Assembly polls several times, held important posts in the BJP and was appointed Rajasthan Governor in the last phase of his public life. He was admitted to the ICU on July 4. His last wish — to see Ram Temple come up — remained unfulfilled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-up-cm-kalyan-singh-passes-away-300328
22-08-2021||---||Opposition worried as SP, BSP skip Sonia-led meeting||New Delhi, August 21Off to a heartening start with a joint meeting hosted by Sonia Gandhi on Friday, the broader Opposition faces a major hurdle in the race to 2024 Lok Sabha elections — the 2022 Uttar Pradesh polls where principal regional parties SP and BSP continue to be distant.The absence of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav from the meeting of 19 parties on Friday has had the Opposition titans worried, knowing well that for any success in the 2024 General Election, Uttar Pradesh has to be won. The state has the maximum number of seats in the Lok Sabha.With both the BSP and SP consistent in staying away from any Congress-led Opposition, it remains to be seen whether the emerging non-BJP front can forge unity in UP, where elections are due next year. The BJP had in the 2017 state elections won 312 of 403 seats — a vote share of 39.7 per cent. The SP won 47 seats (21.9% votes), BSP 19 seats (22.2% votes), Congress seven seats (6.25% votes) and the RLD one seat (1.78%) votes.The four Opposition parties together clocked 52.13 per cent votes even though they won much fewer seats. A similar unity in the 2015 Bihar elections had led to BJP’s defeat.It remains to be seen how the Opposition will prevail on major UP parties beyond merely calling upon them to “come together against an autocratic BJP to save secularism and democracy.” Several leaders, including Congress men, recently threw their weight behind Akhilesh, arguing that the Congress must back him.Congress sources pointed out that Sonia Gandhi had already called upon all parties to rise above their compulsions for winning the 2024 polls.“Will the Congress support the SP then? If yes, at what cost since Akhilesh may not be willing to offer too many seats to the Congress,” a former minister observed, adding that the first test for Opposition unity would be the UP poll strategy.LOOKING BACK||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-worried-as-sp-bsp-skip-sonia-led-meeting-300326

The military aircraft could not arrive on Saturday. For evacuations, India has parked C-17 transporters at the Ayni Air Base in Tajikistan. The US, which controls the Kabul airport, will give the clearance for flights.A convoy of vehicles carrying Indians as well as Afghan Sikhs and Hindus was detained by the Taliban after midnight as they headed to the airport. There were tense moments for Indian officials here as Kabul’s security is largely in the hands of the Haqqani network, considered a “veritable arm of the ISI”. The Indians were taken for verification of documents. The Afghan Hindus and Sikhs were turned back.Taliban spokesman Ahmadullah Waseq denied the allegations of abduction and suggested that the convoy of vehicles was taken away from Hamid Karzai International Airport as it was blocking the road. Some Afghan Hindus and Sikhs reportedly reached their homes in Kabul. Those from outside the city are reportedly staying at Gurdwara Karta-e-Parwan. The Indians were subsequently asked to board the buses to the Kabul airport and some were served lunch. The coordinator, a local Afghan, then got in touch with Indian officials after his mobile was returned. Sri Lanka has requested India to evacuate 20 of its nationals from Afghanistan.The absence of a government in Kabul has led to chaos at the airport. The Americans control one entry to the airport and the Taliban the other. Also, Taliban checkpoints detain outsiders. While a senior Haqqani network leader has been put in charge of Kabul security, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Chief Peace Negotiator Abdullah Abdullah met the acting Governor of Taliban for Kabul, Abdul Rahman Mansour, to discuss the state of security in the city.The absence of a central authority showed in a fatwa issued from Herat banning co-education and most shops in Shia Hazara-dominated Bamyan remained closed.Haji Mullah, the police chief of the Badghis province, was shown on social media as alive in the custody of the Taliban after assurances that he would not be harmed. Videos later showed his execution after being blindfolded.Family members of several government officials, including the former governor and police chief of the Laghman province, appeared on social media, claiming that their relatives could not be traced.Taliban ban co-ed in Herat provinceDays after vowing to respect women’s rights, Taliban officials in restive Herat have banned co-education in universities, describing it as the ‘root of all evils’, Khaama Press News Agency reported on Saturday.

22-08-2021||Lucknow||Kalyan Singh: Hindutva icon under whose watch Babri Masjid fell||The defining moment in Kalyan Singh’s life was the fall of Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992. Just hours after mobs of kar sevaks demolished it, Singh quit as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh owning moral responsibility.Not that he had any regrets over his “failure” to save the mosque which he had assured the Supreme Court would be protected.“Maybe it was destined that the structure would be demolished with me as chief minister,” he told a newspaper ahead of the 2020 “bhoomi pujan” for the Ram temple, now being built at the once disputed site in Ayodhya after a historic Supreme Court verdict.Read also“Had there been no demolition, probably the courts too would have ordered status quo,” he said then. And his last wish, he said, was to live till the temple comes up.Singh, a Hindutva icon and a Bharatiya Janata Party veteran, died at a Lucknow hospital on Saturday. He was 89.Hailed by many for his  administrative acumen during his two stints as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, the influential backward caste leader from western UP parted ways twice with the BJP and has briefly also floated his own outfits.His second parting was in 2009, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, when he said he felt “humiliated” by the party and complained that he had hardly any say in the selection of candidates in his state.Singh said it was a “political blunder” to have rejoined the BJP, which he had left the first time in 1999, only to return in 2004 before the General Election.Born on January 5, 1932, Kalyan Singh first became an MLA in 1967. Since then, he won the assembly polls several times, held important posts in the BJP and was appointed Rajasthan Governor in the last phase of his public life.Soon after his Raj Bhavan term ended in 2019, Singh formally rejoined the BJP as a primary member, signalling that he was not keen on retiring from political life just yet.Back in 1991, he became the first BJP chief minister of the country’s most populous state. A little over a year later, the Babri Masjid was demolished as the Sangh Parivar campaign to build the temple at the same spot picked momentum.As UP’s chief minister, Singh had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, assuring that the 16th century mosque will be protected. But he had also ordered police not to open fire at protesters, arguing later that any such action would have led to much bloodshed.Admitting failure to protect the mosque, he resigned the same evening. The state assembly was dissolved as riots erupted at several places in the country.In the next assembly elections in November 1993, he contested from two seats ---- Atrauli and Kasganj—and won both.A Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party combine formed the government in the state under Mulayam Singh Yadav, even though the BJP won the largest number of seats. Singh was Leader of the Opposition in the UP Assembly.He got his second shot at the top post in September 1997, becoming CM again under a six-month rotation formula with the Bahujan Samaj Party.  The arrangement collapsed soon with the BSP withdrawing support.But, backed by a group of disgruntled opposition members, his government survived. A controversial order by Governor Romesh Bhandari dismissing his government was also stayed by the high court.But a section of BJP MLAs was gunning for him. One reason for the dissent was the alleged interference in the state government by Lucknow corporator Kusum Rai, who was also said to control access to the chief minister.As opposition within the BJP mounted, Kalyan Singh was removed from the CM’s post by the party high command in November 1999.Later, he was also formally expelled from the party over remarks targeting the party’s top leadership. Singh appeared to cosy up with Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, who offered a ticket to his son Rajvir Singh.In 2010, he also floated the Jan Kranti Party, but let his son head it – till it “merged” with the BJP.All these years, the Babri Masjid demolition case trial dragged on. Singh enjoyed immunity from trial as he held a gubernatorial post.After demitting office as Rajasthan Governor, he appeared before the CBI court which pronounced its order in September 2020, acquitting him and 31 others accused of conspiracy to demolish the mosque.The judge concluded that there was no evidence to show that the demolition was pre-planned.He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences here on the evening of July 4 due to an infection and reduced consciousness levels.Before being shifted to the PGI, the former chief minister was undergoing treatment at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences here.

22-08-2021||---||Former UP CM Kalyan Singh passes away at 89||New Delhi, August 21Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh on Saturday passed away at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow due to sepsis and multi-organ failure.He was 89.The veteran leader was admitted to the intensive care unit.Condoling his death, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath announced a state mourning of three days. “His last rites will be performed on the bank of Ganga in Narora in the evening of August 23. There will be a public holiday on the day,” Adityanath said in Lucknow.Read alsoHe's a two-time Member of Parliament and a former governor of Rajasthan. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was among the first to offer his condolences on social media.Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted a series of messages, calling the late BJP leader a “statesman, veteran administrator, grassroots level leader and great human”.“I am saddened beyond words. Kalyan Singh Ji…statesman, veteran administrator, grassroots level leader, and great human. He leaves behind an indelible contribution towards the development of Uttar Pradesh.“Generations to come will remain forever grateful to Kalyan Singh Ji for his contributions towards India’s cultural regeneration. He was firmly rooted in Indian values and took pride in our centuries old traditions.“Kalyan Singh Ji gave voice to crores of people belonging to the marginalised sections of society. He made numerous efforts towards the empowerment of farmers, youngsters, and women,” he saidThe BJP’s success in Uttar Pradesh is attributed to a large degree to Singh, a prominent OBC face who helped the saffron party build vote base beyond the traditional upper caste support. As a well-known face of Hindutva and the agitation to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Singh symbolised the rise of the saffron party in the Hindi heartland, successfully bringing together ‘mandal’ and ‘kamandal’ for the party.He was the CM of the state during the demolition of the Babri Masjid.Just hours after mobs of ‘karsevaks’ demolished it, he quit as CM owning moral responsibility. The state assembly was dissolved as riots erupted at several places in the country. But as observers say, “he had no regrets over his failure to save the mosque which he had assured the Supreme Court would be protected”.As the CM, Singh had filed an affidavit in the court, assuring that the mosque will be protected. But he also ordered police not to open fire at protesters, arguing later that such an action would have led to much bloodshed.“Maybe it was destined that the structure would be demolished with me as chief minister,” he was quoted as saying ahead of the 2020 “Bhoomi pujan” for the Ram temple at the once-disputed site in Ayodhya. “Had there been no demolition, probably the courts too would have ordered status quo,” he also said.Hailed by many for his administrative acumen during his two stints as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, the influential backward caste leader from western UP left the BJP twice and also floated his own political party.Kalyan Singh won the Assembly polls several times, held important posts in the BJP and was appointed Rajasthan Governor in the last phase of his public life.He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) on July 4 due to an infection and reduced consciousness levels. His last wish, he said, was to live till the temple comes up, which remained unfulfilled.   Deeply saddened by the passing away of former Governor of Rajasthan and former CM of UP, Sh. Kalyan Singh ji. My heartfelt condolences to his family members. May God give them strength in this difficult time. May the departed soul rest in peace.  I am saddened beyond words. Kalyan Singh Ji…statesman, veteran administrator, grassroots level leader and great human. He leaves behind an indelible contribution towards the development of Uttar Pradesh. Spoke to his son Shri Rajveer Singh and expressed condolences. Om Shanti. pic.twitter.com/ANOU2AJIpS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-up-cm-kalyan-singh-passes-away-at-89-300301
22-08-2021||Agartala/New Delhi||Tripura Cong chief withdraws resignation on high command’s request||Tripura state Congress president Pijush Kanti Biswas, who earlier on Saturday resigned and announced to quit politics “for the time being”, withdrew his resignation following the request of the party high command.Congress Working Committee Member and party’s Tripura in-charge Ajoy Kumar spoke to Biswas and requested him to withdraw his resignation letter. Kumar, after talking with Biswas, issued a statement saying that he would visit Tripura on August 29 and would discuss with him to sort out the party’s organisational matter.“During my discussion with Kumar, it was decided that I would go to Delhi to discuss with the central leadership to rejuvenate the party in Tripura,” Biswas told IANS.Biswas, a renowned lawyer, on Saturday morning sent his resignation letter to the party president (interim) Sonia Gandhi and announced to remain out of politics for the time being.Biswas, who was appointed Tripura state president in December 2019 after the former state chief quit the party, intended to quit the Congress six days after the All India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev left the party and joined Trinamool Congress on August 16.Dev told the media in Silchar that she and Biswas talked over phone and have discussed the Congress’ weak organisational matters and Tripura politics.Congress sources said that Biswas was annoyed as the party high command despite repeated requests did not constitute or did not allow the state leaders to reconstitute district and block level organisational committees. “After 2016, the district and block level committees were either defunct or inactive. Several state committee leaders were also not active,” a senior party leader told IANS refusing to be named.Former Tripura state Congress President and Royal scion Pradyot Bikram Manikya Deb Barman, who was also known to be a close friend of Rahul Gandhi, had quit the party in 2019 over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) issue and he subsequently formed a tribal based party ‘TIPRA Motha’.Biswas was the fifth important Congress leader in the northeastern states - Assam, Manipur and Tripura - keen to quit the party in the past three months.Four-time Congress legislator and prominent Assam tea garden leader Rupjyoti Kurmi and two-time Assam Congress MLA Sushanta Borgohain had recently deserted the party and joined the BJP. In Manipur, state party president, Govindas Konthoujam, a six-time MLA and former Minister in the Congress led government in the northeastern state, resigned from the party and joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party last month.

22-08-2021||---||Indians survive midnight scare in Kabul, to reach on Sunday||New Delhi, August 21About 150 Indians managed to reach the safety of the airport and will be evacuated on Sunday after a midnight scare in which they were detained by the Taliban and taken to the eastern part of the city. The military aircraft could not arrive on Saturday and is likely to pick up the Indians on Sunday.For evacuations, India has parked C-17 transporters at Ayni Air Base in Tajikistan. The aircraft fly in whenever the US, which controls the airport, gives the clearance.A convoy of vehicles carrying Indians as well as Afghan Sikhs and Hindus was detained by the Taliban after midnight as they were heading to the airport.There were tense moments for Indian officials here as the city’s security is largely in the hands of the Haqqani network, considered a “veritable arm of the ISI”. The Indians were taken for verification of their documents and the Afghan Hindus and Sikhs were turned back.Taliban spokesman Ahmadullah Waseq denied the allegations of abduction and suggested that the convoy of vehicles was taken away from the Hamid Karzai International Airport as it was blocking the road.Some of the Afghan Hindus and Sikhs reportedly reached their homes in Kabul while others who from outside the city have been put up at Gurdwara Karta-e-Parwan.Subsequently, the Indians were asked to board the buses to the airport and some were also served lunch.The coordinator, a local Afghan, then got in touch with Indian officials after his mobile was restored. Sri Lanka has also requested India to vacate 20 of its nationals from Afghanistan.The absence of a Government in Kabul has led to chaos at the airport. The Americans control one entry to the airport and the Taliban other. Besides Taliban checkpoints detain outsiders and it requires channels to senior leaders to allow them to proceed unmolested.While a senior Haqqani Network leader has been put in charge of Kabul security, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Chief Peace Negotiator Abdullah Abdullah met the acting Governor of Taliban for Kabul, Abdul Rahman Mansour to discuss the state of security in the city.The absence of a Central authority showed in a fatwa issued from Herat banning co-education and most shops in Shia Hazara dominated Bamyan remained closed on apprehension of reprisals. Haji Mullah, the police chief of Badghis Province, was shown on social media as alive in the custody of the Taliban after assurances that he won’t be harmed. Videos later showed his execution after being blindfolded and made to kneel.Family members of several government officials appeared on social media claiming that their relatives are not traceable. These include former governor and police chief of Laghman Abdul Wali Wahidzai and Lotfullah Kamram, respectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indians-survive-midnight-scare-in-kabul-to-reach-on-sunday-300228
22-08-2021||Washington||Pakistan’s strategic interest in Afghanistan is to counter Indian influence, says US govt report||Pakistan’s strategic security objectives in Afghanistan almost certainly continue to be countering Indian influence and mitigating spillover of the Afghan civil war into Pakistani territory, a US government report has said, citing inputs from the Defence Intelligence Agency."Pakistan continues to support peace talks, while maintaining ties with the Afghan Taliban," US Department of State Office of the Inspector General noted in its latest quarterly report on Afghanistan."According to the DIA, Pakistan's strategic security objectives in Afghanistan almost certainly continue to be countering Indian influence and mitigating spillover into the Pakistani territory," the report said.The report for the quarter April 1 to June 30 said the Pakistani government is concerned that a civil war in Afghanistan would have destabilising effects on Pakistan, including an influx of refugees and providing a potential safe haven for anti-Pakistan militants.During the quarter, financial contributions to the Afghan Taliban increased in the Pakistan border regions, according to media reports, citing eyewitness sources. Solicitation efforts traditionally targeted mosques, but Afghan Taliban militants now openly visit the bazaar areas in nearby Pakistani towns, it said."The militants typically solicit contributions of USD 50 or more from shopkeepers. Local residents told reporters that solicitation efforts were now commonplace in the towns and cities of Quetta, Kuchlak Bypass, Pashtun Abad, Ishaq Abad and Farooqia," it said.According to the report, the DIA, citing media reports, said that Iran welcomes the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan but "almost certainly" remains concerned about the resulting instability in Afghanistan.According to the DIA, Iran will continue to pursue influence in any future Afghan government through relations with the Afghan government, the Taliban, and power brokers, but Iran opposes the re-establishment of the Taliban's Islamic Emirate, it said.As a resurgent Taliban continues to occupy new territory and an overtaxed Afghan National Defence Security Force is increasingly unable to provide security in certain areas, Afghan power brokers have increasingly begun raising private militias, it said, citing media reports."During the quarter, leaders related to the Northern Alliance spoke openly of a 'second resistance' to the Taliban, and some of the leaders began to mobilise anti-Taliban forces under their respective commands," the report said.The Northern Alliance comprised militias of primarily Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara ethnicity, while the Taliban was largely of Pashtun ethnicity. The period of direct conflict between Northern Alliance and the Taliban included significant violence, often targeting civilians because of their ethnicity.According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, a resumption of conflict between the Taliban and the elements, which formerly made up the Northern Alliance risks a recurrence of such violence.In April, Ahmed Massoud - a militia commander and son of the Northern Alliance's most prominent leader Ahmed Shah Massoud killed by al-Qaeda shortly before the attacks of September 11, 2001 - said in a media interview that his followers were prepared for the "failure of peace".In May, Massoud told reporters that over 100,000 militia leaders, fighters and other stakeholders in northern Afghanistan have pledged support to his anti-Taliban movement.He said public concerns about the stagnant peace process, US withdrawal of troops and apparent Taliban gains against the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) have led to an increasing number of Afghans to take up arms and organise independently, the report noted.
