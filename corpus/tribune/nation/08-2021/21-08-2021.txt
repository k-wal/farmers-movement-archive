He made numerous efforts towards the empowerment of farmers, youngsters and women,” he said.Singh (89), who had been ailing for some time, breathed his last on Saturday night, the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) in Lucknow said.Singh was closely associated with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.The Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished when he was the state’s chief minister in 1992.The Supreme Court had in 2019 handed over the disputed site to Hindu bodies, paving the way for the beginning of the construction of Ram temple there.A backward caste leader, Singh was instrumental in the rise of the BJP to power in Uttar Pradesh in 1990s.

We accordingly impose a fine of Rs 1,00,000 on the respondents. The fine shall be paid over to the National Legal Services Authority within four weeks and shall be recovered from the officers responsible for compliance,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said in its August 16 order.“There is a clear non-compliance with the directions of this Court,” said the Bench, which also included Justice MR Shah.“The actual benefits, including arrears of salary shall be paid over to the petitioner with effect from the date on which the upgradation or, as the case may be, promotion, has been granted to him within a period of one month from the date of the order. The petitioner would be entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the arrears of the salary,” it said.Rejecting the Ministry’s explanation, the Bench said, “We are unimpressed by this explanation in the compliance affidavit. The reason why the petitioner could not avail of his promotion earlier was due to the fault of the authorities. The judgment of the Tribunal was delivered on November 8, 2000. There was no stay of the decision of the Tribunal or of the High Court affirming it.“Consequently, it is the failure of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to implement the binding judgments of the Tribunal and the High Court and eventually of this Court that has led to the present situation. Even after the judgment of this Court, no steps were taken,” it noted.The top court said, “The grant of notional promotions to a person in service does not effectuate compliance. Arrears of pay have to be paid over. Had there been compliance with the judgments of the Tribunal and High Court, the petitioner would have received promotion earlier. The petitioner has been deprived of this due to the delay of the respondents.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-of-court-sc-imposes-rs-1-lakh-fine-on-information-and-broadcasting-ministry-300294

A senior leader in the know of the developments said that the “expansion and appointments to MLC and corporations (if at all) will be done after the festival of ‘Rakhshabandhan’ by August-end”.“Any time after that will lose meaning given that polls are just about six months away and newly inducted ministers will hardly get any time,” he said. Though apparently the state unit “is not in favour of the expansion, given the acrimony it may create among those left out”, the central leadership appears to be in its favour and wants some prominent Brahmin and OBC faces included in the Adityanath Cabinet and vacant MLC posts to be filled, the sources added  The names of Jitin Prasada, Laxmikant Bajpai and AK Sharma, a close confidante of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and some from the NDA allies like the Nishad Party and the Apna Dal are doing the rounds in this context.So far as the strategy party is concerned, the sources said Shah will personally monitor the detailing. So far, the party is believed to have decided to appoint a ‘prabhari’ (in charge) in every Assembly constituency.“There will be a coordinator responsible for four to five constituencies. BJP ministers, Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha MPs from the state will be given these responsibilities,” they said, underlining the seriousness with which the party is taking the UP elections.The BJP is also launching a massive membership drive with the aim to add 2 crore members from the state. Next week Nadda is expected to address party cadres and interact with booth and sector heads in the state. The party will also start ‘panna pramukh’ conferences in September to activate the cadresWhile leaders insist the BJP is “doing well and all is under control”, observers are sensing “worries in the saffron camp” regarding the coming polls. Recently a BJP MLA’s car was allegedly attacked in western UP’s Muzaffarnagar by “people protesting the centre's contentious farm laws”. Budhana MLA Umesh Malik was attending an event in Sisauli village, the home turf of farmer leader Rakesh Tikait in Western UP, the region where the saffron party is expected to face a tough challenge in 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-to-lead-bjps-strategising-for-high-stake-uttar-pradesh-elections-300291

Their partnership ended last year over some differences, the officer said.Kumar said Sahu unnecessarily interfered in his property business and lured clients, which caused massive financial loss. Thus, he was looking for an opportunity to take revenge, police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-man-shoots-former-business-partner-surrenders-at-police-station-300284

The service chiefs also visited their parent squadrons 'Hunter' (Naval Chief) & 'Lima' (Army & Air Chiefs), and interacted with the cadets of the respective squadrons, according to the release.Notably, the Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed eligible women to take the examination for admission to the NDA, scheduled to be held on September 5.The top court, however, said that the women candidates can take the examination subject to further orders of the court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-service-chiefs-course-mates-visit-alma-mater-national-defence-academy-300283

Karmalkar announced a special helpline (020-25621938), in addition to NGO Sarhad's WhatsApp helpline (0-8007066900) for Afghan students across Maharashtra.NGO Sarhad's President Sanjay Nahar along with a group of Afghan students met N.R. Karmalkar, who discussed their issues with ICCR President Vinay Sahasrabuddhe.The ICCR Head spoke on concall with the V-C and a few of the Afghan students' representatives, and spelt out the various measures the Central government is taking to ensure no student misses an academic year."All efforts are underway to help those students who have taken admission in Indian universities or have submitted passports for India visas in Afghanistan. The officials concerned in the Ministry of External Affairs are in touch with the authorities concerned at all levels," Nahar told IANS after the meeting.The Indian government has said it will help not only those students coming here through ICCR scholarships, but also others wanting to pursue academics in the country through self-finance modes.Sarhad has announced its readiness to 'adopt' 1,000 stranded students by bearing all their lodging, boarding, fees and other expenses till the situation in Afghanistan normalises.Even the SPPU authorities have decided to chip in by offering all help, including accommodation facilities, to the students, according to Nahar.At a meeting on Friday, the V-C and Pro V-C, N. S. Umrani had readily agreed to help all past and present students while Management Council member Sanjay Pandey would take up the issue with the Union Minister for External Affairs, S. Jaishankar.On its part, Sarhad has started coordination efforts with various Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim organisations and educational institutions to help them out in the humanitarian efforts.An estimated 11,000 Afghan students, including nearly 35 per cent women, study in colleges and universities across India, with the largest chunk of nearly 5,000 in Maharashtra, according to Umrani.They include nearly 3,000 in Pune, 700 in Mumbai and the rest scattered in other cities, though the ICCR data shows less than 2,500 students here on government scholarships.A majority of the students in the state, including nearly 600 girls, with self-finance face common problems of expired or soon-to-lapse Indian visas, no contacts with families back in Afghanistan as banking and diplomatic channels are shut, due to rentals and money for food, college fees or other routine expenses. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iccr-pune-varsity-to-help-stranded-afghan-students-300280
21-08-2021||New Delhi||Rs 935 crore misappropriated in MGNREGA schemes over last 4 years: Congress||The Congress on Saturday alleged that Rs 935 crore had been misappropriated in MGNREGA schemes over the last four years and said the government must be held accountable for failing to check corruption.The party also demanded that the government restore the four per cent quota for differently-abled persons in police forces.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said a media report, which assessed publicly available information of the Rural Development Ministry, revealed that Rs 935 crore was misappropriated in schemes under the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) over the last four years.These numbers are the outcome of audits done by social audit units under the Rural Development Department of the Ministry of Rural Development, he told a press conference.Khera said the significant outcome of the social audit unit was that the primary type of misappropriation in most cases was “financial misappropriation” which includes and is not limited to bribery, payments to non-existent persons and to vendors at inflated procurement prices.He said of the “whopping” Rs 935 crore misappropriated, only Rs 12.5 crore, which is 1.34 of the misappropriated amount, stands recovered.The very fact that misappropriations has been happening is a testament to the lack of accountability and due diligence by the Narendra Modi government, the Congress leader alleged.“The Congress party demands that the government of India is held accountable for the misappropriations in the MNREGA scheme and ensures that social audit is undertaken as per the provisions of the MGNREGA,” Khera said.“We also demand that the government of India recovers the misappropriated amount at the earliest and ensures that the recovered money is used to compensate the poor and marginalised who have suffered a lot due to COVID-19 mismanagement,” he said.The Congress leader claimed that Tamil Nadu had the highest misappropriation of Rs 245 crore between 2017–18 and 2020-21, and in Bihar, Rs 12.34 crore was misappropriated.Jharkhand, then ruled by the BJP, saw misappropriations to the tune of Rs 51.29 crore, while Rajasthan did not see any misappropriation of MGNREGA funds, Khera claimed.He alleged that this reflects on the real intentions of the BJP, whose government allowed misappropriation of Rs 935 crores of tax-payers money meant for the poor and marginalised.Khera also demanded that the Centre withdraw the notification that scrapped the four per cent quota for differently-abled persons in police forces and undo this “inhuman” wrong.With rising crimes against women under this government it is a matter of shame that more than 90 per cent of the reserved posts for women police officers are vacant, he claimed.“We demand filling them on a war footing,” Khera said.

The occasion is marked by tying a decorative thread that signifies a 'safety cover' on the wrists of brothers by their sisters, both related by blood or having an emotional bond.A large number of healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, and other staff, have died in the line of duty in the fight against the pandemic.The 'rakhis' and cards carry words of love and gratitude. The children's gesture has overwhelmed the entire team of Max Healthcare hospitals, the spokesperson said.Arpita Mukherjee, vice president of operation, Max Hospital, Gurgaon said, "Rakhi is an occasion for the celebration of faith and duty. Our healthcare professionals have been at the frontline during the pandemic with untiring efforts to help patients. We thank the children from the NGO for lifting our spirit." Settling over four generations of once parentless or abandoned children of the country, SOS Children's Villages of India has served for over 56 years till now, according to the NGO's website.Sumanta Kar, Secretary General of SOS Children's Villages of India, said, "Our children are well aware of the sacrifices the doctors, nurses, and administrators of hospitals make to save lives during the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, they came up with the idea of sending rakhis and handmade cards to medical professionals." Making 'rakhis' and cards is an art in itself. It has brought out creative juices flowing in our children.The children also had an opportunity to understand the profound meaning of this age-old tradition and appreciate Indian culture, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rescued-children-send-handmade-rakhis-cards-to-doctors-and-nurses-as-mark-of-respect-300260
21-08-2021||Bengaluru||Union Minister visits serving soldier’s house to offer condolences, embarrassed||Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment A Narayanaswamy visited the residence of a living soldier, instead of the one who had died, after apparently being misled by local leaders, and announced a government job and land to his kin.The gaffe happened on Thursday, when the newly appointed Minister in the Modi government was in Gadag district, as part of his ‘Jan Ashirvad Yatra’.According to BJP sources, Narayanaswamy was taken to the house of Ravikumar Kattimani, who is currently posted in Jammu and Kashmir region, instead of taking him to the house of Basavaraj Hiremath, who died in Pune a year ago.As part of the Minister’s itinerary, he was scheduled to visit the dead soldier’s family and offer condolences to them.Sources said Narayanaswamy, who was behind the schedule when he reached the district’s Mulagund along with Member of Parliament Shivakumar Udasi, was taken to Kattimani’s residence, much to the surprise of family members.The Minister, who enquired the family members, announced that a government job would be given to one of them and also land, which left them in a state of “shock and confusion”.Later, a local BJP worker who knew about the family, made a video call to soldier Kattimani and asked the minister to speak to him directly, they said, adding that after realising the “blunder”, Narayanaswamy trying to control the damage praised the soldier’s service and felicitated the family members, before he left.After leaving the soldier’s residence, the Minister took local BJP leaders to task for embarrassing him, by providing wrong information, party sources added.“My husband is working in Kashmir, it has been two months since we got married. The Minister coming to our house and inquiring about us caused some confusion, but neighbours’ said he might be coming out of respect to soldiers serving in border areas....when he started assuring job and land, I felt somewhat and told him that- my husband is there and I will have to ask him,” Kattimani’s wife told  local media.Noting that someone has given wrong information to the Minister, she said the family was relieved only after speaking to her husband.“....it caused unnecessary tension to us and my husband there.” The Minister, however, did not visit the dead soldier Hiremath.“No one came to our house. He (Minister) is said to have gone to the house of a soldier who is alive....I only want my son back,” an emotional Hiremath’s mother said.

21-08-2021||New Delhi||Children in India, 3 other S Asian nations at extremely high risk of climate crisis impacts: UNICEF||India is among four South Asian countries where children are most at risk of the impacts of climate change threatening their health, education, and protection, according to a new UNICEF report.'The Climate Crisis Is a Child Rights Crisis: Introducing the Children's Climate Risk Index' (CCRI) is UNICEF's first focussed on children. It ranks countries based on children's exposure to climate and environmental shocks such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks based on their access to essential services.Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India are among four South Asian countries where children are at extremely high risk of the impacts of the climate crisis, with a ranking of 14th, 15th, 25th and 26th respectively.CCRI has placed India as one of the 33 extremely high-risk countries, with flooding and air pollution being the repeated environmental shocks leading to socio-economic adverse consequences for women and children.Approximately 1 billion children live in one of the 33 countries classified as “extremely high-risk”, including the four South Asian countries.It is estimated that more than 600 million Indians will face 'acute water shortages' in the coming years, while at the same time flash flooding is to increase significantly in the majority of India's urban areas once the global temperature increase rises above 2° Celsius. Twenty-one of the world's 30 cities with the most polluted air in 2020 were in India.Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF India Representative, said, “Climate change is a child rights crisis. The Children's Climate Change Index data has pointed to the serious deprivations faced by children due to the intensifying effect that climate and environmental shocks have on existing inadequate access to essential services such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education." "Understanding where and how children are uniquely vulnerable to this crisis is crucial to building our resilience and effectively addressing climate change. UNICEF hopes the findings of the report will help prioritize action to protect those most at risk and to ensure that children inherit a livable planet." India's neighbours Nepal is ranked 51st and Sri Lanka 61st. Bhutan is ranked 111th, with children at relatively lower risk."For the first time, we have clear evidence of the impact of climate change on millions of children in South Asia. Droughts, floods, air pollution and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless and hungry, and without any healthcare and water,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia.“Together, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have created an alarming crisis for South Asian children. The time to act is now - if we invest in water, healthcare and education, we can protect their futures from the impacts of a changing climate and degrading environment,” Laryea-Adjei said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/children-in-india-3-other-s-asian-nations-at-extremely-high-risk-of-climate-crisis-impacts-unicef-300255

She passed away at her Saligramam residence here.

21-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: Critically-ill teenaged boy gets new life as siblings donate portions of livers||A 14-year-old boy who was terminally ill with liver failure has received a new lease of life thanks to his two elder sisters who donated portions of their organs to him for a challenging transplant surgery, doctors said on Saturday.The teenager from Budaun in Uttar Pradesh had undergone the surgery recently at a leading private facility in Gurgaon, and the hospital authorities claimed that it was "the country's first paediatric dual lobe liver transplant".On the eve of Rakhi festival that marks the bond between a brother and a sister, Akshat and his siblings, Neha (29) and Prerna (22), shared their sentiments in a media interaction, along with a few doctors of the Medanta Hospital where the transplant took place mid-July."The patient was fighting for his life just over a month ago, terminally ill with liver failure resulting in deep jaundice. He was in a pre-coma state. The case was made even more complex since the patient was overweight, weighing around 92 kg," the hospital said in a statement.While two of his sisters were eligible donors, they were both much lighter. Therefore, he required half-a-liver from both his sisters. To fit in both halves while keeping him from sinking through the long surgical procedure was challenging.Akshat, who now weighs 65 kg, and his sisters had an excellent recovery after the surgery and are now enjoying normal lives a month later, doctors said.Dr Arvinder Soin, Chairman, Medanta Liver Transplant Institute and Chief Surgeon in the case, said, "The decision to embark on a first-of-its kind surgery for a critically-ill child by putting all three siblings on the operating table together was a very tough one not just for the team but also for the parents." "For a successful transplant, it is essential that the newly transplanted liver weighs at least 0.8 to 1 per cent of the patient's body weight. In this case, a single donor liver half weighed only 0.5 to 0.55 per cent of Akshat's weight. Hence, two liver halves were needed to make up the required liver volume. We are delighted it all worked out well," he said.Dr Neelam Mohan, Director, Pediatric Liver Diseases and Transplantation, Medanta said, "While the patient's sisters were eligible donors, the situation required both of them to donate portions of their livers. While the initial period of recovery in ICU was complex for the patient, eventually all the three siblings recovered well." The story of these siblings will certainly bring cheers on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan."This is a unique example of the power of organ donation to save lives. It draws attention to the fact that any healthy person can save a loved one's life by donating half their liver or a single kidney without suffering any harm," Dr Naresh Trehan, Chairman and Managing Director, Medanta Hospital, was quoted as saying in a statement. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-critically-ill-teenaged-boy-gets-new-life-as-siblings-donate-portions-of-livers-300231

But this is preliminary information, and we hope that the Goa Police will investigate the matter thoroughly and rule out any possible suspicion in her death," Varma said.The FIR, which Varma has referred to, was registered in Chennai in 2019, after Djavi accused a photographer of harassing her for sexual favours."Matter of death and specially where the death involves a young person, the levels of suspicion have to be very high and we should rule out any possibility of homicide, because people who commit murder, sometimes they disguise their acts in such a clever manner that it appears like a suicide or an accident," Varma said.The bodies of Djavi and Titova were recovered from their respective rented apartments in Siolim on October 19 and 20.According to the North Goa Superintendent of Police Shobhit Saxena, prima facie any foul play has been ruled out."Prima facie cause of death was asserted as hanging and in the other case a 34-year-old Russian passport holder lady was found dead in her bedroom. In both cases we are following legal procedure, which is, we have informed the embassy to appoint a representative and inquest proceedings in the meantime are ongoing," Saxena said."Once the representative is assigned, further medico-legal formalities such as post-mortem examination will be conducted. In the meantime, we are not suspecting any foul play as of now. However, we will wait for a statement from representatives and the final decision on the cause of death by the medico-legal examination," he also said, adding that the Goa Police had written to Russian consular officials to appoint a representative for carrying out the post-mortem formalities. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dead-russian-woman-was-sexually-harassed-in-2019-consular-lawyer-300229
21-08-2021||Kolkata||Leaving Afghanistan: An Indian's tale of fear, gloom and disguise plan||When the New Delhi-bound Kam Airlines flight finally took off from Kabul airport hours before the Taliban entered the city on August 15, Subrata, an Indian working in a senior position of an International NGO (INGO) posted in Afghanistan, sent up a silent prayer of thanks.Subrata had been able to board the flight after travelling two hours in his car to travel the 12 km distance between his lodging and the Hamid Karzai International Airport, as the road was clogged with vehicles even early in the morning.To top it all, his flight was stopped from taking off for over an hour almost at the edge of the runway, as US Air Force planes were landing to evacuate nationals of that country, sparking fears of imminent Taliban entry into the city.Hours earlier, Subrata, who prefers to go by his first name, spent a tense and sleepless night planning his disguise to make it to the airport without any trouble."I contemplated travelling to the airport dressed as an Afghan sporting the customary long beard and turban, or a deaf and mute person. I was afraid that I might be held by the Taliban in the check posts they might have put up on the road," he told PTI over the phone from Delhi.Subrata even tried out his disguises before discarding each of them and deciding to travel in his normal clothes.There were Indians, Europeans and Africans besides people from Afghanistan in the plane who were leaving the strife-torn picturesque country.Afghan stewards of the plane, however, were sceptical about their return.“I heard a steward whispering in Pashto: God knows how and when we will return to Kabul',” said Subrata.On the night before he took the flight, Subrata realised that guns alone cannot ensure security and information is the strongest defence."I had no information that night whether the Taliban had already entered the city. Nobody goes out in the night for fear of being attacked and killed. And there were looters."I left my lodging at dawn to travel the 12 km distance to the airport and reached it at around 6.15 am. The flight was scheduled to depart at 10.45 am,” Subrata, who had been posted in Afghanistan since 2015, said.He had advanced his flight ticket to Delhi, where his family stays, after the security officer of his organisation told him that the Taliban were expected to enter Kabul soon and he should “just leave”.Subrata had been hesitating as he, like many of his counterparts in other INGOs, was sure that Kabul will not fall before Muharram on August 20.It turned out later that his was the second last commercial flight to leave Afghanistan for India.“The situation in Kabul had become tense since August 13 as the Taliban had captured Herat, Kandahar, Kunduz and other provinces one by one by then. I think even the Taliban themselves did not expect that these provinces would fall so fast,” said Subrata, who has been posted in that country since 2015.With the memory of Taliban torture during its rule two decades ago still fresh in their mind, the people of Afghanistan had been living in fear since the US peace deal with the group in Doha in February 2020.The pact had drawn up plans for withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the terrorist outfit.Subrata said that many Afghan people – both men and women - had requested him to help them find refuge in Delhi.“I did not want to return home before August 18 as I had reached Kabul only a week back and had a lot of work left. But the scenario was changing fast. I was told that banks had downed shutters saying they had no money left," he said.Rumours that fresh passports were not being issued anymore fanned the fear among the people manifold.Subrata could not contact the Indian embassy and to add to his fears, he was told that there were blasts at Pul-e-charkhi jail in Kabul, which is the largest prison in Afghanistan, allegedly to liberate jailed members of the Taliban.“I saw the narrow streets of Kabul chock-a-block with cars of internally displaced people who had come with their families to the city from neighbouring areas thinking it would not fall. The parks were occupied by these hapless people who had nowhere else to go,” he said.They had been coming for the past one month but the situation had turned chaotic on August 14 as the roads were completely blocked, he said.Subrata also recounted his conversation with a kiosk owner at the airport from whom he used to buy biscuits and cakes during his frequent travels.“The man looked very sad. He told me: 'Please remember that Afghanistan is a beautiful country but has no luck as far as lasting peace is concerned'," Subrata said.There was an air of desperation, a feeling of helplessness, arising out of the fear of an uncertain future."People are tired of the constant insecurity and want to leave the country. Their agony is increased manifold by the frequent attacks of armed looters who find them easy prey and do not hesitate to kill if faced with resistance," he said.The losses due to the unprecedented drought and the havoc wreaked by COVID-19 appear to have taken a back seat in the mind of the people of Afghanistan, Subrata said.Most of them wish to relocate to either the US or India as they perceive these countries as peaceful and stable, he said.Asked whether he would like to return to Afghanistan, Subrata said he would, as there is a lot of work left to be done.“The INGOs are into the development work in the country in a big way. They are building roads, bridges, hospitals which the government cannot," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leaving-afghanistan-an-indians-tale-of-fear-gloom-and-disguise-plan-300227

Justice is yet to be delivered in any of the cases,” a central leader of a Left party said.“The judiciary can as so much pass orders, but they have to be eventually implemented by the Executive.” The Left parties apprehend that the BJP, which has emerged as a political force to reckon with in West Bengal, could take advantage of the probes.The Left parties find themselves squeezed for a place between the TMC and the BJP in the state.The Left parties are on the horn of dilemma; if they go full throttle against the TMC, the campaign would help the BJP.On the other hand, if they zero in against BJP, the TMC would stand to gain.The Left parties are dead set against both these parties.It was because of this dilemma that the Left parties had adopted the policy to defeat the TMC, and to keep the BJP out of power in the last assembly election in the state.However, the CPI(M)-led Sanyukt Morcha- which constituted of Left parties, Congress and Indian Secular Front—were blown away in the elections as it failed to impress either the Hindu or the Muslim voters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-parties-caught-in-dilemma-in-west-bengal-wary-of-high-courts-order-to-probe-post-poll-violence-300201

Both were admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, they said.The police said the woman is undergoing treatment.They said she is from Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur and was allegedly raped by Bahujan Samaj Party MP Atul Rai in 2019.The MP has been in judicial custody in the case for the last two years.Before attempting suicide, the woman, together with the associate, had recorded a Facebook live video, in which she disclosed her identity and alleged that she had filed the rape case against Rai in 2019.She had also alleged that some senior police officers and others were supporting the accused.Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav had at that time said an inquiry was underway to ascertain the exact reason, but it was suspected she attempted suicide as she feared being farmed in fraud cases by the accused party.In the live Facebook video, she had claimed that a non-bailable warrant had been issued against her by a local court in UP and that she was summoned by the judge.In March, the woman had filed a plea in the Supreme Court, seeking transfer of her rape case for fair trial from Allahabad to Delhi on grounds of threat to her life.Later in August, a local court in Varanasi issued a non-bailable warrant against her in a case of forgery based on a complaint filed by the accused MP’s brother.

India’s ratification of the Kigali amendment is a welcome decision that will collectively help avoid 0.5 degrees C which is a significant climate co-benefit,” said Tripathi.Making yet another step towards helping prevent climate change and benefiting people, the Union Cabinet recently gave the nod for ratification of the Kigali Amendment for phase-down of HFCs by India.The phase-down of HFCs is expected to prevent the emission of up to 105 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases, helping to avoid up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of global temperature rise by 2100, while continuing to protect the ozone layer, officials said.India also became one of the first countries in the world to launch a cooling action plan in 2019.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ratification-of-kigali-amendment-to-montreal-protocol-india-has-exemplified-its-climate-leadership-say-experts-300181

There was sporadic firing in the air to disperse the crowds.External Affairs MinisterS Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the situation and agreed to continue close coordination over the matter. Jaishankar reportedly underlined the urgency of restoring airport operations in Kabul. After the Taliban’s strong arm suppression of protests on Independence Day in eastern Afghanistan over the past two days, Friday saw fighters from the Panjshir Valley taking over two districts — Pul-e-Hesar in northern Baghlan province where the demography also favours them and Deh-e-Saleh.The Taliban’s reasonable face in Kabul on Friday maintaining that the T-20 cricket tournament will be permitted was at odds with reports of rounding up of people on the blacklist in Jalalabad and Herat and a UN report finding evidence of the group murdering nine Shia Hazaras in Ghazni province last month.In Kabul, a woman presenter of the state-run TV complained that she was turned back without reason while Taliban checkpoints were screening people heading to the airport. Several Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who remained huddled in a Kabul basement were also turned back.German state-supported media house Deutsche Welle reported the killing of a family member of its Afghan correspondent after the Taliban entered his house.The reported house-to-house searches by the Taliban for Afghans who had worked with Westerners prompted foreign ministers to converse with each other. As Afghans critical of the Taliban scrubbed their digital identities, Facebook removed the ability to view and search “friends” list in Afghanistan. LinkedIn has also hidden the connections of anyone in the country.However, it was not clear whether the Hazara murders and the searches were ordered by the Taliban or the fallout of local settling of scores after the change of regime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-talks-to-blinken-over-evacuation-hurdles-amid-chaos-299991
21-08-2021||New Delhi||Eye on 2024, 19 Oppn parties decide to hold nationwide protest||Leaders of 19 Opposition parties today announced a joint agitation plan from September 20 to 30 after Congress president Sonia Gandhi urged them to rise above political compulsions to defeat the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.It’s time to rise above political compulsions — Sonia Gandhi, CongressAll secular, democratic forces must join hands —  Sharad Pawar, NCPMamata proposes core committee to steer fight against BJPTejashwi Yadav seeks ‘driving seat’ for regional partiesIn a signed statement, Opposition stalwarts, including NCP’s Sharad Pawar, TMC’s Mamata Banerjee, DMK’s MK Stalin, Shiv Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray and JMM’s Hemant Soren, called upon the people of India to defend “the secular, democratic, republican order with all their might”.11 demands“Save India today, so that we can change it for a better tomorrow,” they said listing 11 demands, including restoration of full statehood and elections in Jammu and Kashmir; repeal of three farm laws and institution of an SC-led inquiry into the Pegasus snooping row.The statement followed a major Opposition outreach in which Sonia Gandhi said, “Our ultimate goal is the 2024 Lok Sabha poll for which we have to begin planning systematically with the single-minded objective of giving to our country a government that believes in the values of the freedom movement and in the principles and provisions of our Constitution. This is a challenge, but together we can and must rise to it because there is simply no alternative to working cohesively together. We all have our compulsions, but clearly, a time has come when the interests of our nation demand that we rise above them.”Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee proposed the formation of a core group of Opposition leaders to chalk out joint programmes. The like-minded parties “needed to unite to defeat the BJP”, she said.The meeting was attended by leaders of the TMC, NCP, DMK, Shiv Sena, JMM, CPI, CPM, NC, RJD, AIUDF, VCK, Loktantrik Janta Dal, JDS, RLD, RSP, Kerala Congress Mani, PDP and IUML.

While high-income countries are around 50 per cent fully vaccinated and upper-middle-income ones 40-43 per cent, the poorer half of the world lags considerably. Lower-middle-income countries stand at merely 7-8 per cent and low-income countries at 0.6 per cent,” data show.Discrepancies in vaccination rates with at least one dose are also stark. Due to mass vaccinations in China, high-income and upper-middle-income countries have similar rates of 60 per cent when it comes to people vaccinated with at least one dose. The WHO said inequities in inoculation will mar the global march against the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/50-fully-vaccinated-in-richest-nations-only-0-6-in-poorest-300007

The military equipment making industry has regularly pitched for providing greater access to the details of procurements planned by the MoD especially with regard to cost, quantity, trials and transfer of technology. All these are planned at the stage of the Acceptance of Necessity, the first step of the acquisition process.The move will provide an opportunity to new players in the market. The timely visibility will enable the industry to plan technology tie-ups with original equipment manufacturers, initiate the process to set up production lines and augment production capacity. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mod-okays-proposal-to-publish-purchase-details-on-website-300008

The incident took place around 12.10 pm near Kademeta camp of 45th battalion of the ITBP under the Chhotedongar police station limits, IGP (Bastar range) Sundarraj P said.According to the preliminary information, a squad of the ITBP’s 45th battalion, which was out on an area domination operation, was fired upon by a small action team of the ultras, when it was approximately 600 m away from the camp, he said.The Naxals also looted and escaped with one AK-47 rifle, two bullet-proof jackets and one wireless set of the security personnel, he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-itbp-men-killed-in-naxal-attack-300010

It has been developed in partnership with the Department of Biotechnology,” said DBT secretary Renu Swarup.The three-dose vaccine when injected produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/zycov-d-worlds-first-plasmid-dna-vaccine-okayed-300011
21-08-2021||---||US to start issuing H-1B visas next month: Foreign Secretary Shringla||New Delhi, August 20The US government has agreed to start issuing H-1B category visas for Indian professionals in September, and by the end of the year, it may become possible to resume issuance of all categories of US visas, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said here on Friday.The H-1B visa allows US employers to hire foreign workers for specialty jobs, with Indians among the major beneficiaries.This is contingent on a continuous drop in the virus level and increasing pace of vaccination in India. The UK could go the same way, he said at the All India Management Association’s (AIMA) LeaderSpeak program.Student visas are the highest priority for the MEA right now. The US and many western European countries are currently issuing visas to Indian students, and the MEA is trying to expedite those. The MEA is also talking to the Australian mission here to prevent delays in visa issuance to Indian students.While student visas have resumed, the MEA is trying to persuade many countries, including the US and Canada, to issue visas for Indian professionals also. The Gulf countries would soon recognise Covishield, thus easing the woes for Indian workers and professionals working in that region.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that no country was insisting on vaccination for entry at the moment, though it was a condition for easier entry. However, a time will come when most countries will start demanding vaccination certificates for entry. For that eventuality, the MEA s is negotiating bilateral recognition of vaccines with individual countries. “So far, no multilateral arrangement has been concluded,” he said.India’s vaccine reciprocity negotiations are centered on mutual recognition of approved vaccines, he said, as India will keep adding more vaccines to its list of vaccines for reciprocal recognition, including Sputnik and Johnson.Seventeen EU countries had recognised Covishield so far and have lifted the blanket ban on Indian travelers. Two countries -- Estonia and Romania -- have recognised Covaxin as well. Once the WHO approves Covaxin, India would work on reciprocal recognition of that vaccine also.Speaking on Afghanistan, Shringla said the silver lining is the Taliban making the right noises and seeking international legitimacy and recognition, which they did not have the last time they ruled Afghanistan.“We can work with a dispensation that is willing to look after the interests of the Afghan people,” he said.Harsh Pati Singhania, President, AIMA, moderated the discussion with the foreign secretary while AIMA DG Rekha Sethi anchored the session.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-to-start-issuing-h-1b-visas-next-month-foreign-secretary-shringla-299906
21-08-2021||New Delhi||'Time has come to rise above compulsions and win 2024 LS polls': Sonia Gandhi’s big signal to Oppn at 19-party meet||In a major signal that the Congress was willing to play along with the larger opposition to defeat the BJP in the next General Elections, party chief Sonia Gandhi said on Friday that the time had come to rise above political compulsions to achieve the intimate goal of winning the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Pledging that the Congress won’t be found wanting in this duty, Gandhi, addressing leaders of 19 like-minded parties, said, “Of course, the ultimate goal is the 2024 Lok Sabha elections for which we have to begin to plan systematically with the single-minded objective of giving to our country a government that believes in the values of the Freedom Movement and in the principles and provisions of our Constitution. This is a challenge, but together we can and must rise to it because there is simply no alternative to working cohesively together. We all have our compulsions, but clearly, a time has come when the interests of our nation demand that we rise above them.”The Congress chief said the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence is indeed the most appropriate occasion for us to reaffirm “individual and collective resolve”. “Let me say for its part, the Indian National Congress will not be found wanting,” she assured leaders including NCP’s Sharad Pawar, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, DMK chief MK Stalin, Shiv Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray among others.The virtual meeting, Gandhi symbolically organised on the birth anniversary of her late husband and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, saw the participation of 19 parties minus the SP, BSP, AAP, BJD.Hailing the opposition unity in the recent Parliament session Gandhi said she hoped the momentum of opposition unity would last across future sessions too.Blaming the washout of the Monsoon session on the government’s “obstinate and arrogant unwillingness to discuss and debate urgent issues of public importance including Pegasus snooping scandal and repeal of the three anti-farmer laws”, Gandhi said, “In spite of this, the session was marked by the determined unity that all Opposition parties demonstrated for over twenty days in both the houses. We functioned in a coordinated manner with daily discussions among our floor leaders.”She said it was due to Opposition parties that the Constitutional Amendment Bill was passed to restore the long-standing rights of states to identify and notify OBCs. “I am confident that this unity will be sustained in future sessions of Parliament as well. But the larger political battle has to be fought outside it,” she said at a time when leadership of the anti-BJP national front is seen as the biggest sticking point in the fight against the BJP.Sonia’s signal that Congress won’t be found wanting is significant as it indicates flexibility on the leadership issue, with several opposition leaders already having suggested that Pawar should take over the UPA reins.Mamata Banerjee has already exhibited national ambitions, and currently commands significant leverage in the opposition camp due to her recent victory over the BJP in Bengal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/time-has-come-to-rise-above-compulsions-and-win-2024-ls-polls-sonia-gandhis-big-signal-to-oppn-at-19-party-meet-299887

21-08-2021||New Delhi||Images from Kabul airport reminds me of Kandahar horror: IC814 pilot||The images of Kabul airport in the past few days remind him of the horror he experienced 22 years ago, according to Devi Sharan, who was captain of the Indian Airlines flight IC814 that was hijacked in December 1999 and taken to Kandahar in Afghanistan.Various images and videos have come out where people can be seen crowding inside as well as outside the Kabul airport and scrambling to enter into the planes on the runway in order to escape from the Taliban that took control of Afghanistan's capital city on Sunday."It was like I have gone 22 years back. Over 20 years have passed, but the images (of today) are the same," Sharan, 59, told PTI in an interview."The difference is that we were the only people at that time in Kandahar, but now you can see a crowd at the (Kabul) airport. But definitely, these people are desperate to come out just like we wanted to come out," he added.IC814 was heading from Kathmandu to New Delhi on December 24, 1999—with 179 passengers and 11 crew members on board—when it was hijacked and taken to Taliban-controlled Kandahar by five Pakistani terrorists.Sharan was the captain, Rajinder Kumar was the first officer and Anil Kumar Jaggia was the flight engineer of IC814.The hijackers executed one passenger, Rupin Katyal, and finally negotiated the release of terrorists Masood Azhar Alvi, Syed Omar Sheikh and Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar from Indian jails on December 31, 1999, in exchange for the hostages.On Friday, Sharan said: "I find the images to be quite like of that time. Definitely, it gives us all the memories of horror of that time. It reminds us of that." He said there were two kinds of Taliban forces that they encountered at the Kandahar airport in December 1999."One was Kabali. You can see these Talibanis with turbans and civil clothes and rocket launchers and all. So one force was this one which was type of a moral police. The other one was commandos," he stated."These Kabalis, I would say, they were quite in favour of our hijackers. The commands were there only to ensure that there is no bloodshed there. They might be with the hijackers but they were definitely not with us," he added.Sharan said no direct threat was issued by Taliban to him but you can see the "threat" as these Kabalis had surrounded the aircraft with rocket launchers and all."So, you can see that threat that they would not let us go without agreeing to the demands (of the hijackers)," he said.On December 24, 1999, Sharan was first asked by hijackers to take the IC814 plane to Lahore. After Pakistan refused to let the flight land there, the aircraft was taken to Amritsar airport. Then, it was taken to Lahore airport, which allowed the plane to land this time at the last moment. Later, it departed from there and went to the Dubai airport, from where it was taken to the Kandahar airport.Sharan said he retired last year from Air India. Indian Airlines was merged with Air India in 2007.He said Jaggia passed away 7-8 years ago while Kumar is still with Air India.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities including Kabul in the backdrop of the withdrawal of the US forces. Kabul fell to the Taliban on Sunday.The Taliban was removed from power in Afghanistan when the US-led forces attacked them in October 2001, a few weeks after terrorist attack on World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/images-from-kabul-airport-reminds-me-of-kandahar-horror-ic814-pilot-299869

He was living in a rented place in Dighori area of the city. Acting on a tip-off, the police had started keeping a watch on his activities. He was finally nabbed and deported to Afghanistan on June 23," he said."After his deportation, he seems to have joined the Taliban and his photo holding a gun has emerged on social media," he added.During the probe earlier, police had found that he had come to Nagpur in 2010 on a six-month tourist visa. Later, he had applied to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) seeking a refugee status for himself, but his application was rejected. His appeal was also turned down by the UNHRC. Since then, he stayed in Nagpur illegally, the official said.Another police official said that Noor Mohammad's original name is Abdul Haque and his brother was working with the Taliban. Last year, Noor had floated a video on social media with a sharp-edged weapon.After he was nabbed, police found that he had "entry and exit wounds" from a gunshot near his left shoulder, he said, adding that when his social media accounts were checked, it was found that he was following some terrorists whose videos of gun firing were available on social media."He was in the business of selling blankets and was unmarried. Police conducted searches at his rented accommodation, but did not find anything suspicious. His call details are also under the scanner of the police," the official said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/afghan-man-deported-from-nagpur-has-joined-taliban-say-cops-as-his-gun-wielding-snap-surfaces-299844

But it came up in its full glory after every destructive attack, which gives us self-confidence," Modi said."Forces that strive for destruction and those who follow the ideology of creating empires out of terror can dominate for some time, but their existence is never permanent as they cannot suppress humanity forever," he added.It was true when the Somnath temple was being destroyed in the past and it is true even today, the PM said.His remarks come in the wake of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Modi said India, which was at 65th position in 2013 in Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index, jumped to 34th position in 2019.

21-08-2021||New Delhi||Personal liberty important aspect of constitutional mandate, arrest should not be routinely made: Supreme Court||Merely because an arrest can be made as it is lawful does not mandate that it must be made, the Supreme Court has said, while observing that personal liberty is an important aspect of constitutional mandate.The apex court said if arrest is made routine, it could cause "incalculable harm" to the reputation and self-esteem of a person.A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said if the investigating officer of a case does not believe that the accused will abscond or disobey the summons, he or she is not required to be produced before the court in custody."We may note that personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional mandate. The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises when custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused may abscond," the bench said in its order passed earlier this week.The top court passed the order while hearing a plea against the Allahabad High Court verdict which had dismissed an application seeking anticipatory bail in a case in which FIR was registered seven years ago.The bench noted that contrary to the observations made in the apex court verdict of 1994 on how a police officer has to deal with a scenario of arrest, the trial courts are stated to be insisting on arrest as a pre-requisite formality to take charge sheet on record in view of provisions of Section 170 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Section 170 of the CrPC deals with cases to be sent to magistrate when evidence is sufficient.The top court said the word 'custody' appearing in Section 170 of the CrPC does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of accused by the investigating officer before the court while filing charge sheet.It noted that Section 170 of the CrPC does not impose an obligation on the officer-in-charge to arrest the accused at the time of filing of charge sheet."Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful does not mandate that arrest must be made," the bench said, adding, "If arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person."While setting aside the high court order, the bench noted that the petitioner had already joined the investigation before approaching the apex court and charge sheet was ready to be filed."If the investigating officer has no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation, we fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the officer to arrest the accused," it said.
