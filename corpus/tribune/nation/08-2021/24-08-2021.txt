It said three months have lapsed since the matter was taken up by the court, but "no concrete action has been taken by the state which could inspire confidence, except filing affidavits and placing on record thousands of papers". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-to-conduct-zone-wise-investigation-of-post-poll-violence-cases-in-bengal-301520

24-08-2021||New Delhi||UP government withdrew 77 cases related to 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots without giving any reason: SC told||The Uttar Pradesh government has withdrawn 77 cases related to the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 related to offences entailing punishment of life sentence without giving any reasons, the Supreme Court was told on Tuesday.  A bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant is scheduled to hear a plea filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay seeking speedy disposal of cases against lawmakers. Senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, who has been appointed amicus curiae in the matter, in his report filed through advocate Sneha Kalita said that the state government has informed that a total of 510 cases relating to the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 were registered in five districts of Meerut Zone against 6,869 accused. “Out of these 510 cases, in 175 cases the charge sheet was filed, in 165 cases final reports were submitted, 170 cases were expunged. Thereafter, 77 cases were withdrawn by the state government under section 321 of CrPC. The Government Orders do not give any reasons for withdrawal of the case under section 321 of CrPC. It merely states that the administration after full consideration has taken a decision to withdraw the particular case,” Hansaria submitted. He said that many of such cases relating to offences of dacoity under section 397 IPC are punishable with imprisonment for life. Hansaria said that these 77 cases relating to Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 withdrawn under section 321 of CrPC may be examined by the High Court by exercising revisional jurisdiction under section 401 of CrPC in the light of the law laid down by this Court. Similarly, the amicus curiae pointed out that the Karnataka government has withdrawn 62 cases without assigning any reason, Tamil Nadu has withdrawn four cases, Telangana has withdrawn 14 cases and Kerala has withdrawn 36 cases.  Hansaria submitted that this court in the order dated August 10, 2021, had directed that no prosecution against a sitting or former MP/MLA shall be withdrawn without leave of the High Court.  “It is submitted that withdrawal from prosecution under section 321 CrPC is permissible in the public interest and cannot be done for political consideration. Such applications can be made in good faith, in the interest of public policy and justice and not to thwart or stifle the process of law," he said.  The amicus in his report told the top court that in view of the repeated misuse of power by the state in withdrawing prosecution for political and extraneous considerations, the court may issue some directions in addition to the already laid down guidelines.  He said that a court may issue directions like the appropriate government may issue instructions to the public prosecutor that only if the government, in a given case, is of the opinion that the prosecution was launched maliciously and there is no foundation for prosecuting the accused the case can be withdrawn.  “Such an order can be passed for reasons to be recorded for each individual case by the Home Secretary of the concerned state,” he said, adding that no general order can be passed for the withdrawal of prosecution of any category of persons or offences committed during a particular period. He said that all the cases which have been withdrawn under section 321 CrPC after the order of this Court dated September 16, 2020, may be examined by the respective high Ccurts by exercising revisional jurisdiction.  On August 10, the top court had, in a significant order affecting politicians facing criminal cases, curtailed the power of state prosecutors and ordered that they cannot withdraw prosecution against the lawmakers under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) without prior sanction from high courts. It had expressed strong displeasure over the non-filing of requisite status reports by the Centre and its agencies like CBI and indicated that it would set up a special bench in the top court to monitor criminal cases against politicians. The amicus curiae had pointed out earlier that states like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, and Karnataka have sought to withdraw criminal cases against politicians by using section 321 of CrPC, which empowers prosecutors to withdraw cases. The top court had directed that no prosecution against a sitting or former MP/MLA shall be withdrawn without the leave of the high court in the respective suo motu writ petitions registered in pursuance of its order.The high courts are requested to examine the withdrawals, whether pending or disposed of since September 16, 2020, in light of guidelines laid down by this court, it had said.In another important direction, it had ordered that judges of special courts hearing cases against the MPs and MLAs will not be transferred until further orders.The apex court had said that to ensure expeditious disposal of pending cases, it is necessary to direct the officers presiding over Special Courts or CBI Courts involving the prosecution of MPs or MLAs to continue in their present posts until further orders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-government-withdrew-77-cases-related-to-2013-muzaffarnagar-riots-without-giving-any-reason-sc-told-301510
24-08-2021||Satya Prakash||‘Skin-to-skin’ contact: AG urges SC to reverse Bombay HC’s controversial verdict||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 24Terming as “outrageous” the Bombay High Court’s ruling that sexual assault offences under the POCSO Act weren’t made out if there was no direct ‘skin-to-skin’ contact between the offender and the child, Attorney General KK Venugopal on Tuesday urged the Supreme Court to reverse it.“If tomorrow a person wears a pair of surgical gloves and feels the entire body of a woman, he won’t be punished for sexual assault as per this judgment. This is outrageous. To say that skin-to-skin contact is required (to attract POCSO Act) would mean an accused wearing gloves getting an acquittal. The judge clearly didn’t see the far-reaching consequences,” Venugopal told a Bench led by Justice UU Lalit.The Bench directed the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee to make available two senior advocates along with advocates-on-Record from its panel to represent the accused as he was unrepresented before it so far and posted it for final hearing on September 14.The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court had on January 19 acquitted an accused, holding that groping the breasts of a minor girl over her clothes didn’t amount to “sexual assault” under Section 8 of The Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The HC had held that it amounted to “outraging modesty of woman” under Section 354 of the IPC.Stating that 43,000 offences were registered under POCSO in the last one year, the Attorney General said the Bombay High Court verdict set a bad precedent having far-reaching ramifications for the magistrates’ courts in Maharashtra.As the controversial order of the Bombay High Court acquitting a man accused of child abuse under POCSO Act created a furore, the Supreme Court had on January 27 stayed it after Venugopal made an urgent mentioning of the case and urged the top court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter. “It’s a very disturbing conclusion,” Venugopal had said.Later, the Youth Bar Association of India and the National Commission for Women had also filed separate petitions requesting the top court to reverse the Bombay High Court’s verdict.The top court has already issued notices to the government and the accused.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/skin-to-skin-contact-ag-urges-sc-to-reverse-bombay-hcs-controversial-verdict-301508
24-08-2021||New Delhi||Pak objects to Kiru hydro plant design; India says it is compliant with Indus treaty||Pakistan has raised objections to the design of India’s Kiru hydroelectric plant, a mega 624 MW project over the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir, but New Delhi asserts that the project is fully compliant with the Indus Water Treaty, officials said on Tuesday.Confirming this development, India’s Indus Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Saxena told PTI that his Pakistan Indus Commissioner Syed Muhammad Meher Ali Shah raised the objections last week.Saxena, however, asserted that the design of the project is fully compliant with the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty. It has been certified by the Central Water Commission, an apex organisation of the country in the field of water resources.This run of river project is being implemented by Chenab Valley Power Projects Limited, a joint venture of the National Hydropower Company and Jammu and Kashmir State Power Development Corporation (JKSPDC).“As a responsible upper riparian state, India is committed for full utilisation of its rights and believes in an amicable resolution the issues raised by Pakistan side in letter and spirit of the treaty.“Pakistan’s objections on this project may come up for discussions in the next meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission scheduled this year in Pakistan. In the forthcoming meeting, the Indian side will explain its position and hope that Pakistan will appreciate the same and its apprehensions will be addressed through discussions,” Saxena said.The treaty provides Pakistan the right to raise objection on Indian design within three month of the receipt of the information. India has supplied the information on this project in June to Pakistan.Under the IWT signed between India and Pakistan in 1960, all the waters of the eastern rivers—Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi—amounting to around 33 million acre feet (MAF) annually is allocated to India for unrestricted use. The waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab—amounting to around 135 MAF annually has been assigned largely to Pakistan.According to the treaty, India has been given the right to generate hydroelectricity through run-of-the-river projects on the western rivers subject to specific criteria for design and operation. The treaty also gives right to Pakistan to raise objections to designs of Indian hydroelectric projects on the western rivers.India is permitted to construct the run of the river plants on western rivers with limited storage as per criteria specified in the treaty, Saxena said.Earlier this year, during the meeting between Indus Commissioner of India and Pakistan, Shah also raised objections on the designs of Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir. To this, India said the designs are fully compliant with the treaty.Pakistan has also raised objections on hydropower projects in Chilling (24 MW), Rongdo (12 MW) and Ratan Nag (10.5 MW) are in Leh; while Mangdum Sangra (19 MW), Kargil Hunderman (25 MW) and Tamasha (12 MW) are in Kargil. India had said the designs of these projects are also fully compliant with the treaty.

The MMHGs have a distinctive design giving flexibility of  employment in both defensive (fragmentation) and offensive (stun) modes."They have highly accurate delay time, very high reliability in usage and are safe for carriage. These modern grenades were designed by Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory of DRDO," the release said.EEL had taken the technology from DRDO in 2016.Extensive trials of the grenades were successfully undertaken by the Indian Army and DGQA (Directorate General Of Quality Assurance) in 2017-18 in plains, deserts and high altitude over summer and winter, the release said.Against a General Staff Qualitative Requirement (GSQR) of 95 per cent reliability, the grenades manufactured by EEL had highly superior reliability of 99.8 per cent, it added. The success of the MMHG story is further amplified by its usage of 100 per cent indigenous content, the release added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hand-grenades-made-by-private-firm-delivered-to-army-301505

They are repeatedly making irresponsible statements that have grave implications on national security”.“I would urge the topmost national leadership of the Congress to state clearly whether they support the remarks on Kashmir and Pakistan made by Congress leaders in Punjab?“Silence on the matter will be seen as implicit support to such objectionable remarks,” Nadda added.Party spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed such remarks could not have been made without the approval of senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. “The remarks made by advisors of Punjab Congress chief clearly show that the party has divisive and anti-India approach towards Kashmir,” he added.“These people earn their livelihood in India but sing Pakistan’s tune,” he said, also wondering why Sidhu, “who hugged the Pakistan Army Chief”, had been made Congress’ Punjab unit chief and “on whose behest”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-attacks-congress-over-punjab-leaders-remarks-on-kashmir-pak-301498
24-08-2021||New Delhi||2 in 3 Indian adults addicted to being online due to Covid: Report||Nearly two in three Indians (66 per cent) have become addicted to being online as a result of the Covid pandemic, a report released on Tuesday said.The 2021 Norton Cyber Safety Insights report by consumer security company NortonLifeLock is based on an online survey of more than 1,000 Indian adults conducted by the Harris Poll.The survey found that on average, adults in India spend 4.4 hours a day in front of screens, outside of work or educational time.About eight in 10 (82 per cent) said that the amount of time they spent on screens, aside from educational or work purposes, has increased significantly during the Covid-19 pandemic.Smartphones by far are the most common device Indian adults surveyed feel they are spending too much time on (84 per cent).The majority of Indian adults (74 per cent) agree that the amount of time they spend in front of a screen negatively impacts their physical health, while more than half (55 per cent) say it negatively impacts their mental health."It is understandable that the pandemic has increased our dependence on screens for activities that could otherwise have been done offline. It is important for every individual, however, to find a healthy balance between their on-screen and off-screen time so that their health and, more importantly, their children's health is not adversely impacted," NortonLifeLock's Director, Sales and Field Marketing, India & SAARC Countries Ritesh Chopra said in a statement.The survey also showed a lack of trust among Indian adults in smart home devices and/ or the companies that manufacture them.Nearly half of adults decided against purchasing a smart home device due to security concerns or because of privacy concerns (40 per cent).People also cited a lack of information about smart home devices (40 per cent) and a lack of transparency from smart home device manufacturers about how they use consumer data (35 per cent) as reasons for not purchasing a smart home device."The online landscape has seen an increase in the numbers and types of cyber threats. Users must take great care of how and where they use their connected devices. Convenience should not come at the cost of security," Chopra said."Today, the loss of personal or confidential information can have very serious repercussions indeed. It is important for parents to be aware of this fact and to educate their children on the need for cyber safety," he added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-in-3-indian-adults-addicted-to-being-online-due-to-covid-report-301493
24-08-2021||New Delhi||Assets created in last 70 years being sold: Rahul on National Monetisation Pipeline||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday questioned the move of the government to monetise its assets across key sectors, saying all assets created in the last 70 years are being sold.Addressing a press conference here with former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, he said the BJP has claimed that nothing happened in India for 70 years, but now all assets created in all these years are being sold.Gandhi alleged that the Modi government’s privatisation plan was aimed at creating monopolies in key sectors which will kill jobs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday unveiled an ambitious Rs 6 lakh crore National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) that included unlocking value by involving private companies across infrastructure sectors—from passenger trains and railway stations to airports, roads and stadiums.As many as 25 Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports, including ones at Chennai, Bhopal, Varanasi and Vadodara, as well as 40 railway stations, 15 railway stadiums and an unidentified number of railway colonies have been identified for getting private investments. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assets-created-in-last-70-years-being-sold-rahul-on-national-monetisation-pipeline-301489
24-08-2021||Chandigarh||Technology developed to significantly reduce repair costs and overhaul time of aero-engines||Indian Scientists have for the first time repaired aircraft engine components through an emerging additive manufacturing or 3-D printing technique called Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process, which can significantly reduce repair costs and overhaul time.A team of scientists from the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI) have indigenously developed powders suitable for additive manufacturing by melting unused scrap material.Utilising using inert gas atomizer available at its facility, ARCI is developing the Laser-DED process for the repair of aero-engine components made of a Nickel-based superalloy.Nickel-based superalloys are widely used in aero-engine components. Despite having exceptional properties, they are prone to damage due to extreme operational conditions.Manufacturing defects during the casting or machining process are another major cause of rejection, and tons of such unused components are scrapped due to minor defects.The impact of repair and refurbishment technology developed by ARCI can be best realized in the aerospace sector, where expensive materials, manufacturing costs and stringent quality checks are important factors, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology on Tuesday.Furthermore, the ARCI team developed a technology to refurbish pinion housing assembly, a critical component used for power transmission to the main rotor in helicopters, by machining out the damaged layer and rebuilding it using laser cladding process followed by final machining.A post-cladding heat treatment method was also designed to minimize micro-structural discrepancy and ensure minimal substrate properties variation.These laser-clad repaired prototypes were found to be free from distortion and exhibited excellent performance.The team has also developed repair and refurbishment technologies for other industrial sectors, such as refurbishing diesel engine cylinder heads made of grey cast iron and refurbishing shafts used in the refinery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/technology-developed-to-significantly-reduce-repair-costs-and-overhaul-time-of-aero-engines-301488

Voices of Afghan women, aspirations of Afghan children and the rights of minorities must be respected,” he said.“A broad-based representation would help the arrangement gain more acceptability and legitimacy,” he added.Pandey, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, said stability in Afghanistan is linked to the peace and security of the region.  “We hope that the situation in Afghanistan does not pose a challenge to its neighbours and its territory is not used by terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) , to threaten any other country,” he said.There has been increasing concern in the security establishment in India about the possible security impact of developments in Afghanistan in Jammu and Kashmir as LeT and JeM have close links with the Taliban.The ambassador said as a neighbour of Afghanistan, the situation prevailing there is of “great concern” to India.“We are closely monitoring the rapidly evolving security situation in Afghanistan and we continue to call upon parties concerned to maintain law and order, ensure the safety and security of all Afghan nationals, UN personnel and diplomatic staff members, and observe human rights and international humanitarian law in all circumstances in Afghanistan,” he added.The UN Human Rights Council has convened the special session to discuss the human rights concerns and situation in Afghanistan after Kabul fell to the Taliban.“While the security situation remains precarious, a grave humanitarian crisis is unfolding. Everyone is concerned about the increasing violations of the fundamental rights of Afghan citizens. Afghans are worried about whether their right to live with dignity would be respected,” Pandey said.He said the international community must extend full support to the people of Afghanistan.“We, as the international community, must ensure full support to the people of Afghanistan in their desire for peace, stability and security in the country and to enable all Afghans, including women, children and minorities, to live in peace and dignity,” he said.Pandey said thousands of people who have been internally displaced are facing an acute shortages of food, medical care and shelter.“The basic rights of civilians, children and women including freedom of speech and opinion, access to education and medical care have been drastically hampered due to the ongoing situation,” he said, and called upon all the parties concerned to allow unhindered access to international assistance for all those who are in the need of it.Pandey also referred to India’s significant contribution in recent years to the development of Afghanistan.“India’s development partnership with Afghanistan rests on the five pillars: large infrastructure projects and connectivity; humanitarian assistance; human resource development and capacity building; and High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDP)s,” he said.He said India has undertaken projects in critical areas of power, water supply, road connectivity, healthcare, education, agriculture and capacity building, noting that its emphasis has been on the welfare and well-being of the people of Afghanistan.India’s development projects are in every one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan and India has also extended humanitarian assistance of 75,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan to strengthen food security during the Covid-19 pandemic, he added.He said India’s “millennia-old” friendship with Afghanistan rests on the strong pillars of people to people relationships and that it has always stood for a peaceful, prosperous and progressive Afghanistan.“India stands ready to assist our friends from Afghanistan in fulfilling their aspirations.. We hope that the situation stabilises soon, and the parties concerned address the humanitarian and security issues,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hope-situation-in-afghanistan-doesnt-pose-challenge-to-its-neighbours-india-at-unhrc-301486

The fifth woman is out of danger," the officer stated.The agitating teachers, all members of a platform for contractual school teachers, 'Sikshak Oikyo Manch', had been seeking regularisation of services and revocation of transfer orders that have forced some of them to move to places that are far from their homes.The five teachers had earlier this month demonstrated before the residence of education minister Bratya Basu seeking to know why their demands were not being met with.Strongly reacting to the incident, BJP state vice president Jaiprakash Majumdar said, "Lack of concern on the part of the education minister prompted the teachers to consume poison." Kunal Ghosh, the ruling TMC's spokesperson, wished the teachers a speedy recovery."It has to be looked into if there was any provocation from any quarter. A proper investigation will reveal the details," he added.The education minister and his department officials were not available for comment. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-contractual-teachers-drink-poison-outside-west-bengal-education-dept-hq-over-job-related-demands-301485

The description of a missing woman from Govandi matched with the body as she had two tattoos on her arms," he told reporters.The police came to know that the woman was spotted near the Inorbit mall signal in Vashi on July 29 where an unidentified man approached her.An autorickshaw driver identified the accused, the official said, adding the accused had cut short his hair from front to change his look to evade arrest."The accused, identified as Kanifnath Kamble, had taken the old woman near the bridge of the Inorbit mall promising her food but tried to rape her. However, when she resisted, Kamble slit her throat with a piece of broken glass. He smashed her face and head with a huge stone. He stuffed her body in a gunny bag and fled," Vashi police station inspector Prakash Todarmal said.The accused was arrested on August 22, police said."The two tattoos on both the arms of the victim helped the police identify the victim and reach the accused," he said.A case was registered under section 302 (Punishment for murder) and 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navi-mumbai-cops-identify-murder-victim-by-tattoos-on-her-arms-killer-held-301479

The woman's boyfriend, who was living with her in the same apartment, had gone out when she died.Meanwhile, advocate Vikram Varma, the Goa representative of the Russian Consulate in Mumbai, urged the police to conduct a probe into the "possible role" of a Chennai-based photographer into the woman's death.The deceased had filed a complaint of sexual harassment against the photographer in Chennai in 2019, he said."I was informed that the woman had been hounded and blackmailed by a person in Chennai. After a preliminary inquiry, the Chennai police had found enough evidence to register an FIR and subsequently arrest him,” he said.Varma said the case (of the woman's death) "may have other facets which are not clearly visible at this stage".The Russian Consulate was monitoring the case and would provide all required information and assistance to the Goa police, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-russian-actor-alexandra-djavis-death-chennai-photographer-to-be-probed-301470

24-08-2021||New Delhi||Woman who attempted self-immolation outside Supreme Court dies||A 24-year-old woman who allegedly attempted suicide with a man outside the Supreme Court here died on Tuesday, police said.The woman had sustained 85 per cent burns in the self-immolation bid on August 16. The man, 27, had suffered 65 per cent burns and succumbed to his injuries on Saturday. Both were admitted to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said, "The woman succumbed to her injuries during the course of treatment on Tuesday." After the woman and the man attempted self-immolation, the police had registered a case under Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide) of the Indian Penal Code.They suspected that the man had convinced the woman to take the extreme step.They said she was from Uttar Pradesh's Ghazipur and was allegedly raped by Bahujan Samaj Party MP Atul Rai in 2019.The MP has been in judicial custody in the case for the last two years.Before attempting suicide, the woman, together with her associate, had recorded a Facebook Live video in which she disclosed her identity and claimed that she had filed the rape case against Rai in 2019.She alleged that some senior police officers were supporting the accused.Earlier, a senior police officer had said that the man and the woman took the extreme step as a court had issued a non-bailable warrant against them in a case of forgery for allegedly submitting wrong proof of age in the rape case.In her Facebook video, the woman had mentioned the warrant and that she had been summoned by the judge.In March, the woman had filed a plea in the Supreme Court, seeking transfer of her rape case from Allahabad to Delhi for a fair trial and claimed that she faced a threat to her life.Later in August, a local court in Varanasi issued a non-bailable warrant against her in the forgery case based on a complaint filed by Rai's brother. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-who-attempted-self-immolation-outside-supreme-court-dies-301467
24-08-2021||New Delhi||Taliban had killed our kin; we have no hope from them: Afghan refugees in India||Rishad Rahmani, who moved to India from Afghanistan in 2019, carries on the side of his neck a tattoo depicting flight of a pigeon, symbolising a desire of freedom for Afghans, but his mind bears the scars of his uncle's killing at the hands of the Taliban a few years ago.The 22-year-old Afghan, who hails from Mazhar-i-Sharif, capital of Balkh province in northern part of the war-torn country, detests the mention of the word 'Taliban', which ironically, in Pashto means students."We have a bad feeling about the situation in Afghanistan since the Taliban took over. People there are scared, and we refugees in India are also tense, as many of our family members are there. So, many Afghans are fleeing their homeland left with no choice," Rahmani told PTI.He was among hundreds of Afghan refugees, drawn from Delhi and neighbouring cities, who vociferously protested in front of the UNHCR office here, demanding safety for themselves and their compatriots in Afghanistan."The Taliban claim they will not cause any harm to Afghans. But, they are already targeting people who worked for the government they just toppled, or those who were associated with the US Army when it was present in Afghanistan. They are shooting people who carry the Afghan flag," he said.While sharing his thoughts on the current situation, Rahmani, who lives in an enclave of Afghan refugees in Noida, points to his pigeon tattoo, and says, "I carry this as a desire for freedom for us Afghans and for our beloved Afghanistan, which has seen decades of fractured peace due to civil war and the Taliban"."My mother and other family members, living in India, are tense right now. My mother is under depression thinking about the fate of Afganistan. Her brother who was a translator was killed by the Taliban a few years ago. We had left our homeland seeking peace and better future," he recalled.The Taliban swept across the country this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1.On August 15, the capital city Kabul also fell to the Taliban, even as a large number of Afghans attempted in vain to flee the war-torn nation.The insurgent forces have now sought to portray themselves as more moderate than when they had imposed a brutal rule in the late 1990s. But many Afghans remain sceptical of this and fear the return of the "regressive" regime.Anjam Ahmad Khan, 28, another Afghan refugee, who lives with his wife and three children in Delhi, has grown pessimistic after the Taliban recaptured Afghanistan, swiftly and without much force."I spoke to my mother in Kabul a few days ago, she was crying. She mostly cries now. We are worried about her and other family members, as the Taliban are going after various families. With the Taliban in control, no have no hope left for Afghanistan or its people now. Taliban is not the rule of Islam, it's just sheer terror," he rued.Khan had lost an immediate family member, who worked in the country's army, to the bullets of the Taliban, a few years ago, and its return scares him."They are keeping a sham of reformed Taliban with rights for women, just to form a government. They will go back to their old ways, once they are legitimately in power. We can't trust this regressive Taliban, which opposed learning of English by Afghans as anti-Islam, and suppressed women and girls," he lamented.Khan is also a member of the Afghanistan Solidarity Committee, an umbrella outfit of Afghan refugees in India, which organised the protest in Delhi in front of the UN Refugees Agency in Vasant Vihar.The protestors also demanded release of "support letters" from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), seeking to migrate to other countries for better opportunities.Many other refugees, men and women, echoed the woeful tales narrated by Rahmani and Khan, and for some it triggered the 1990s era when the Taliban had run riot, and later even blown up the world heritage site of the iconic Bamiyan Buddhas statutes in 2001."All beautiful lands are mostly a troubled paradise. I hanker for my country, but the Taliban will not let it be our homeland. We don't want to live like slaves in our own country. This 'pigeon' (tattoo) with me keeps reminding me that I will have to keep striving for my freedom too," Rahmani said, before returning to the protesting crowd to chant slogans. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taliban-had-killed-our-kin-we-have-no-hope-from-them-afghan-refugees-in-india-301465
24-08-2021||Jaipur||2 people beaten up for begging in Ajmer, told to 'go to Pakistan'; 5 youth arrested||Five people were arrested in Rajasthan's Ajmer town for allegedly thrashing two beggars who apparently looked like Muslims and asking them to go to Pakistan, police said on Tuesday.The police action followed a video on social media that purportedly showed the accused, who have been booked under various offences, including promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, beating and threatening the men seeking alms in a housing colony in Ajmer.The three victims in the video, two men and a woman, are yet to be identified, police officials said. The video was circulated across various social media platforms on Friday, and the police registered the case on Tuesday.“The victims are not yet identified, and they are being traced. They apparently looked like Muslims,” said SHO of Ramganj police station, Satendra Singh.The main accused Lalit Sharma, who beat up the beggars, was arrested on Friday while four other accomplices identified as Shailendra Tak, Tejpal, Surendra and Rohit were arrested on Saturday, the SHO said.He said the action was taken suo motu on the basis of the video clip.The video purportedly shows a boy, a man and a woman being cornered by the group of five youths. Sharma is seen purportedly kicking the boy on his head as he is crouched on the street. He is also seen slapping the man for apparently begging in the housing colony, and asked him to "go to Pakistan" for alms.Meanwhile, some members of the Muslim community approached the police officers raising objection over the issue, saying their religious sentiments have been hurt.The SHO said that case was registered on Tuesday by police itself under IPC Section 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion etc.), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (wrongful restraint).“No fresh arrest has been made, and the matter is being investigated,” he added.The incident comes a few days after a bangle seller was thrashed by a group of people even as he begged for mercy in Madhya Pradesh's Indore city. The viral video showed the people levelling allegations of eve-teasing against the bangle seller and egging on others to beat him up. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-people-beaten-up-for-begging-in-ajmer-told-to-go-to-pakistan-5-youth-arrested-301463
24-08-2021||New Delhi||India does not have sufficient data to decide on Covid-19 booster dose: Experts||Not enough data has been generated locally to decide on the need for a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine for those fully inoculated, say experts, amid the possibility of a third wave of the viral disease hitting the country between September and October.An expert panel set up by an institute under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has predicted that the third wave of Covid-19 can hit the country anytime between September and October and suggested significantly ramping up the vaccination pace.The World Health Organisation has, however, sought a two-month halt on administering booster shots of Covid-19 vaccines in view of severely constrained vaccine availability around the globe."India will decide on booster dose based on scientific evidence generated locally. Studies are already underway to determine the need and timing of booster for currently used vaccines in the country," said Dr N K Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 working group of NTAGI.The need for booster doses will be determined by the epidemiology of the Covid infection in the country, besides the durability of protection provided by the current dosage regime of the vaccines."Any booster dose regime has also to ensure that adverse events are not associated with boosting," Arora said.AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said there is no definite evidence to suggest currently that there is a need to give booster shots to those who have been vaccinated in the past."Current data suggests that the vaccines are effective in preventing severe disease and death in those who have been vaccinated, even against the Delta variant."Also, we should vaccinate those who have not even received a single dose and are in the high risk category first, so as to prevent severe disease and death in the upcoming wave. Currently, booster shots are not required and as more data emerges it will then be clear when and what type of booster shot is required," he said.A number of countries including the US and Israel are planning to offer booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines.The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) has discussed the issue of giving booster vaccine dose, and it is being looked into very deeply, NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul had said earlier this month.He had said it must be taken as a work in progress, as science is still emerging in this area.Responding to a question on the need for giving booster Covid-19 vaccine dose, Paul had said, "I would say we are watching the science for the need for such an imperative very carefully. Global work as well, as you may know that certain studies in the country are being instituted, and we are looking at it very deeply," he said.The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers getting inoculated and inoculation of frontline workers started from February 2. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-does-not-have-sufficient-data-to-decide-on-covid-19-booster-dose-experts-301459

The Devasthanam Board will not be allowed to hurt the interest of teerth purohits, hak hakookdharis and Panda Samaj,” Dhami said.“There should be no communication gap. A solution will be found through talks. All doubts will be addressed and amendments made wherever required,” he told the delegation.Before the implementation of Badrinath master plan begins, everyone concerned will be heard, he assured.Teerth purohits, hak hakookdharis and members of Panda Samaj have been agitating for months demanding dissolution of the Devasthanam Board, saying it infringes upon their rights.

24-08-2021||New Delhi||1,500 farm union representatives from across India to come together at national convention||Over 1,500 representatives of farm unions from across the country will come together to discuss future strategies for the ongoing farmers' protest during the national convention on August 26 and 27, farmer leaders said.The two-day convention at the Singhu border is being held to mark the completion of nine months of the farmers' agitation against the three contentious farm laws."Unlike our other events, the national convention is not going to be a mass gathering or a rally. Instead, 1,500 representatives of farmer unions from across the country will come together for two days at the Singhu border to discuss strategies to sharpen and intensify our protests," farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar told PTI.He added that the convention was aimed at bringing together farmers from across the country, so that everybody could be part of the decision making on how the protest was to be taken forward."We have been protesting for nine months. It is not a short span of time. We want to include everybody, and representatives of farmer organisations from east, west, south and north… everybody will be here," Kohar added.One of the major issues that will be up for discussion at the convention will be the farmers' upcoming 'mahapanchayat' in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar on September 5."Our next strategy is the Muzaffarnagar 'mahapanchayat' on September 5, which will also be discussed at the convention. Preparations for the 'mahapanchayat' are in full swing. I know that at least 5,000 vehicles will be travelling to Muzaffarnagar,” Kohar said.On August 26, the farmers' protest against the three contentious laws will complete nine months since they first arrived at the Delhi borders. The farmers have been demanding the repeal of the three laws, which they are afraid will do away with the MSP system leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.While the Singhu border will be the central point of the national convention, gatherings will be organised in different parts of the country parallely.In Chandigarh, farmer leader Paramjit Singh said about 2,000-2,5000 people are expected to come together to discuss the "issues that have been impacting the farmers as well as the common man"."We will gather on the ground in sector 25 where a stage will be put up. On one of the days of the national convention, Rakesh Tikait is expected to visit our gathering and address the crowd,” he said."Leaders of different farm unions will also participate to discuss how the agitation should be taken forward,” Singh said.He added that the farmers have ensured that their protests are peaceful, and do not cause any inconvenience to people."Farmers have been very straightforward about their demands from the beginning. It is the government that is being stubborn,” Singh said."We will continue to be patient because we do not want to cause any inconvenience to anyone. The government will have to give in to our demands because we will continue building pressure,” he said.According to the farmers leaders, the visiting representatives from different states, including Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, will be provided accommodation at the Singhu border itself."We have been protesting constantly over the last nine months. This convention will also be a way to recall our struggle through the last nine months," said Rachpal Singh, another farmer leader."The farm union leaders from across the country, who will stay at the Singhu protest site, will address the protesters there talking about our agitation, the three black laws and the state of farmers in the country," he added.

However, on January 29, the AirAsia India flight was on a route that is usually taken by planes descending to land at the Mumbai airport.Due to the change in routing by AirAsia India flight and "direct routing" of the IndiGo flight that was coming from the opposite direction, "heading of both aircraft became reciprocal to each other" but at different altitudes, it mentioned.At this time, when there was enough lateral separation, the automation system of the air traffic controller issued a "predicted conflict warning". However, the controller did not respond to the visual "predicted conflict warning", the report stated.The controller presumed that the AirAsia India flight was following its usual route over Bhavnagar due to his or her previous experience. Therefore, the controller perceived that the AirAsia India flight is not in the immediate vicinity of the IndiGo flight, it said.By the time the controller realised the situation, the Air Asia India flight had reached 38,008 ft while the IndiGo flight was flying at 38,000 ft. The AirAsia India flight continued its ascent as its traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) issued a warning to the pilots, it said."It (Air Asia India flight) was at 38,396 feet when the conflicting traffic was resolved," the report said. The IndiGo flight maintained an altitude of 38,000 feet."The minimum separation between both the aircraft was recorded as 8 km laterally while (it was) 300 feet vertical(ly) when the AirAsia India flight was below the IndiGo flight and it was 6.5 km laterally when the vertical separation was 500 feet when IndiGo flight was below the AirAsia India flight," the report mentioned.It recommended that suitable corrective training may be imparted to the controller with an emphasis on situational awareness and the importance of warnings generated on the automation system."It is recommended that Airports Authority of India may reassess the volume of traffic in all sectors which were withdrawn due to less number of traffic during the lockdown and may implement sectors as before pandemic," it stated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/airasia-india-indigo-flights-came-within-8-km-of-each-other-on-january-29-investigation-report-301451
24-08-2021||New Delhi||Attack on Indore bangle seller prelude to polarisation ahead of assembly polls: Chidambaram||The Congress on Tuesday said the Indore incident involving the beating up of a bangle seller is a prelude to “inciting communal conflict and polarisation” ahead of next year’s assembly elections.The opposition party also asked whether there was any rule of law in force, and said the goons are insulting the great Hindu culture.A 25-year-old man selling bangles on the streets was beaten up by a mob in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore city on Sunday.“These incidents are a prelude to inciting communal conflict, violence and polarisation in the run up to the next round of state elections,” said senior Congress leader P Chidambaram.“Ghaziabad, Kanpur and now Indore. Who are these persons who are emboldened to decide what is right and what is wrong,” he asked.“If the State Home Minister will justify mob violence and vigilante justice, why is he remaining in the chair of Home Minister,” the former union minister said.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, the poor bangle seller will be beaten up and sent to jail too.“These goons are insulting the great Hindu culture by spreading violence. Shame on you, is this the rule of law,” he asked in a tweet in Hindi.Three persons have been arrested on charges of assaulting the bangle seller, but the episode took a new turn when he himself was later booked under the POCSO Act for allegedly touching a 13-year-old girl inappropriately and was detained, officials said.The bangle seller identified as Tasleem Ali was also accused of possessing fake documents related to his identity, they said.The officials said the minor girl filed a complaint with the Banganga police station in Indore against Ali, alleging he introduced himself as Golu, son of Mohan Singh to sell bangles at her home on Sunday and after describing her as very beautiful, he touched her inappropriately.When the girl raised an alarm, her mother rushed out of home and when the bangle seller tried to escape from the spot, neighbours and other local residents caught and thrashed him, they said, adding three persons were arrested for assaulting him.

24-08-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||ISRO conspiracy case: Ex-DGP granted anticipatory bail by Kerala court||Former Kerala DGP Siby Mathews was on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail by a court here in the case registered by the CBI in connection with the illegal arrest of former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan and two Maldives nationals in a 1994 spying case.The relief was granted by Principal District and Sessions Judge P Krishnakumar, advocate V Ajakumar—who appeared for Mathews—confirmed.The order was also confirmed by advocate Prasad Gandhi, who had appeared for the two Maldivian nationals—Mariyam Rasheeda and Fouziyya Hasan.The detailed order is awaited.Both Narayanan and the two women from Maldives had opposed granting any relief to Mathews.Recently Kerala High Court had granted anticipatory bail plea to three former police officers and a retired Intelligence Bureau (IB) official in the same case.CBI has lodged the case against Mathews and 17 others, including IB officials, for various offences like criminal conspiracy and kidnapping and fabrication of evidence, under the IPC in connection with the arrest of Narayanan and the two Maldives nationals.The Supreme Court had on April 15 ordered that the report of a high-level committee on the role of erring police officials in the espionage case relating to Narayanan be given to the CBI and directed the agency to conduct further investigation on the issue.The three-member committee, headed by former apex court judge Justice (retd) D K Jain, was appointed by the top court in 2018 after acquitting Narayanan in the case.The Supreme Court had also directed the Kerala government to pay Rs 50 lakh as compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo “immense humiliation”.The espionage case, which had hit the headlines then, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India’s space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.The CBI, in its probe back then, had held that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan’s illegal arrest.The case also had a political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then Chief Minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation.

Their leaders, including two lawmakers, have reached India along with their relatives.Ahead of a G-7 virtual meeting on Tuesday, the Taliban warned against extending the complete pullout of foreign forces by August 31, which is being pushed by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Faced with a financial crunch and a falling currency, the Taliban appointed an acting director general of the country’s central bank — Da Afghanistan Bank — after the IMF disbursed $650 billion in Covid aid to all countries on Monday, barring the war-torn nation.Though several Taliban leaders were in Kabul and held dialogues with members of the former ruling regime, there was no indication about the government formation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/146-more-brought-from-doha-govt-calls-all-party-meet-on-afghanistan-301114
24-08-2021||---||Govt to raise Rs6 lakh cr from infra assets||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 23Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday launched the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) to unlock value in infrastructure assets across sectors ranging from power to road and railways that is expected to net Rs 6 lakh crore in over four years.Looking to pvt sectorAsset monetisation is aimed at tapping private sector investment for new infra creation. — FINMINMaintaining that the asset monetisation did not involve selling of land, she said, “We are talking of brownfield assets where investment is already being made, but the assets are either languishing or not fully monetised or underutilised. We will monetise it better with the private sector.” Sitharaman said roads, railways and power were the top three sectors identified for the purpose.The maximum monetisation is expected from the road sector where Rs 1.6 lakh crore worth of national highways have been identified. The Railways is next with about 400 stations, 150 trains, dedicated freight corridor and tracks, which are expected to yield Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The power sector will see about Rs 45,200 crore from transmission lines and Rs 39,832 crore from hydro, solar, and wind projects of the NHPC, NTPC and Neyveli Lignite.The National Stadium in Delhi will also be monetised, so will all guest houses of public sector undertakings.Officials say asset monetisation is not just a funding mechanism, but an overall shift in entrusting infrastructure operations and maintenance to the private sector, which is more efficient and able to quickly adapt to the evolving global and economic reality.An empowered Core Group of Secretaries on Asset Monetisation (CGAM) under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary has been constituted to monitor its progress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-to-raise-rs6-lakh-cr-from-infra-assets-301115

Mr Mehta what is happening? You have to find a solution, they might have the right to a place to agitate, but the roads can’t be blocked like this,” the Bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.As the Solicitor General said, “We’ll look into this,” the Bench adjourned the hearing to September 20.The top court was hearing a petition filed by a woman resident of Noida, alleging that due to blockade of roads by the agitating farmers travelling between Noida and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes.The UP Government told the court that it was making efforts to make farmers understand that their grossly illegal act of blocking roads was causing grave inconvenience to commuters.As the main roads connecting Delhi and Noida have remained blocked since the beginning of protests in November last, the Supreme Court had on March 29 issued notices to the Centre and the UP Government on the petition by the Noida woman.Acting on the PIL filed by Monicca Agarwaal – a single parent with some medical issues—- the Bench had asked the Centre and UP Government to explain why the roads connecting Delhi and Noida were not kept blockade-free.

It will help the most deprived. If animals and trees can be counted, why not people? — Tejashwi Yadav, RJD LeaderAfter the meeting, which featured 10 parties, including the RJD and BJP, the CM said the PM gave everyone a patient hearing and “did not deny what the delegation said”.“All parties spoke in unison about the need for caste-based census and said data will aid effective drafting of policies considering many sections of OBCs have not received benefits in proportion to their population. The PM heard us patiently and did not deny what we said,” the CM said.RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, countering the argument that caste census could foment divisions, said counting on the basis of religion was already being done. “Caste census will be in national interest and will turn out to be a historic pro-poor measure. It will help the most deprived. If animals and trees can be counted, why not people?” he asked.Yadav also said caste census would not entail extra cost as SCs and STs were already been covered. “All you need is one more column,” Tejashwi Yadav noted.The JDU, BJP, RJD, Congress, HAM, CPI, CPIML and LJP were among parties represented at the PM’s meeting today. About the new-found bonhomie with RJD, Nitish said the opposition had always backed Bihar government’s “pro-people moves”.The meeting with the PM came days after the government said in Parliament that there was no proposal for a caste-based census in the pending Census 2021 exercise, triggering apprehensions among Bihar parties.The demand for caste census gained ground with the passage of the Constitution (127th) Amendment Bill, 2021, which enables states to enlist OBCs.Critics of caste census say the makers of the Constitution had dropped the idea for a reason. The last caste census happened in 1931. Politically, commissioning a caste-based census could alter the political landscape for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, where elections are due in 2022 and upper castes are a major factor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nitish-tejashwi-meet-pm-to-push-for-caste-based-census-301121

Around three million children were persistently missed in 2020 and 2021 so far, with around one million children in southern Afghanistan missing out on vaccination for almost three years. The cohort of missed children continues to grow,” the committee said.It unanimously agreed that risks of international spread of poliovirus remained a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and extended its recommendations to member nations for three more months.Globally, wild poliovirus types 1 and 2 were certified as eradicated after 2012.

While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorisation, as the first FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock.He said while millions of people have already safely received Covid-19 vaccines, the FDA recognised that for some, its approval may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated.Today’s milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the US, the FDA chief added. Since December 11, 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine has been available under EUA in individuals 16 years of age and older, and the authorization was expanded to include those 12 through 15 years of age on May 10, 2021.EUAs can be used by the FDA during public health emergencies to provide access to medical products that may be effective in preventing, diagnosing, or treating a disease, provided that the FDA determines that the known and potential benefits of a product, when used to prevent, diagnose, or treat the disease, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.FDA-approved vaccines undergo the agency’s standard process for reviewing the quality, safety and effectiveness of medical products.“Our scientific and medical experts conducted an incredibly thorough and thoughtful evaluation of this vaccine. We evaluated scientific data and information included in hundreds of thousands of pages, conducted our own analyses of safety and effectiveness, and performed a detailed assessment of the manufacturing processes, including inspections of the manufacturing facilities,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pfizer-becomes-first-covid-vaccine-globally-to-get-full-usfda-approval-301059

But in the column of father’s name, ‘Mohan Singh’ is printed on it.” State Congress spokesman Aminul Khan Suri posted a 44-second video of Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh-based Ali, in which he is heard stating, “Years back, an identity card was made in my village with my pet name “Bhura” while in the Aadhaar card my name is written as Tasleem Ali. None of these identity documents are fake and they both are real.”Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said in Bhopal, “The controversy started when this man described himself as a Hindu to sell bangles to women during the holy month of saavan, while he actually belongs to another community.”“The home department has given a report that this man (Tasleem Ali) had identified himself with a Hindu name though he belongs to another community. Cops have found two suspicious Aadhaar cards from his possession,” he said.The home minister said legal action was taken in matters related to the bangle seller, including the assault on him.Three persons, who were part of the crowd that had assaulted Ali,  were arrested, Mishra said.In a viral video of the incident, some people are purportedly seen thrashing the bangle seller even as he begs for mercy.A man was also seen levelling allegations of eve-teasing against Ali and egging on people to beat him up.The bangle seller had filed a complaint in the Central Kotwali police station late Sunday night alleging five to six persons, who were part of a mob, started beating him up after asking his name in the Govind Nagar area of Indore, the officials said.Ali also alleged in his complaint that members of the mob used objectionable words against him and snatched Rs 10,000 in cash, mobile phone, Aadhaar card and other documents besides bangles worth over Rs 25,000 from him.A police official said based on the man’s complaint, an FIR was earlier registered under IPC sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 141 (unlawful gathering), 147 (rioting), 395 (dacoity), 120- B (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant provisions against unidentified persons.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/case-filed-against-bangle-seller-under-pocso-act-in-indore-3-held-for-assaulting-him-301040

You have to find a solution, they might have the right to a place to agitate, but the roads can’t be blocked like this,” the Bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. As the Solicitor General said, “We’ll look into this,” the Bench adjourned the hearing to September 20.The top court was hearing a petition filed by a women resident of NOIDA alleging that due to blockade of roads by the agitating farmers travelling between NOIDA and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes.The Uttar Pradesh Government told the court that it’s making all efforts to make farmers understand that their grossly illegal act of blocking roads was causing grave inconvenience to commuters.As the main roads connecting Delhi and Noida remain blocked since the beginning of protests against farm laws in November last, the Supreme Court had on March 29 issued notice to the Centre and the UP Government on a petition by a woman from Noida who said commuting had become a nightmare for her.Acting on the PIL filed by Monicca Agarwaal – a single parent with some medical issues, the Bench had asked the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government to explain why the roads connecting Delhi and Noida were not kept free from blockades.Agarwaal said though her work place was in Noida she had to travel to Delhi frequently as she was in a marketing job. Noting that it was taking two hours instead of the normal 20 minutes, she contended that it had become a nightmare to commute between Noida and Delhi.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 7, 2020 ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.On February 9, the top court had dismissed a petition seeking review of the verdict, saying the right to protest can’t be anytime and anywhere.Agarwaal said despite directions issued by the top court to keep the roads blockade-free nothing had happened.Noting that a judicial view had already been taken and the matter reflected an administrative failure, the Bench had agreed to take up the matter after the petitioner said the court should ensure that people’s right to passage wasn’t hindered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blockade-of-roads-by-farmers-sc-asks-centre-up-and-haryana-to-find-solution-301038

24-08-2021||New Delhi||Experts warn of imminent third wave of Covid-19 in September-October||An expert panel, set up by an institute under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), has predicted a third wave of Covid-19 hitting the country anytime between September and October and suggested significantly ramping up vaccination pace.The committee of experts, constituted by the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), also said that children will have a similar risk as adults since paediatric facilities, doctors and equipment like ventilators, ambulances, etc. are nowhere close to what may be required in case a large number of children become infected.The report, which has been submitted to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), observed that only around 7.6 per cent (10.4 cr) people are fully vaccinated in India and if the current vaccination rate is not increased, India can witness six lakh cases per day in the next wave.“Leading experts have repeatedly warned of an imminent third Covid-19 wave in India. Epidemiologists predict a series of surges till we achieve herd immunity through infection or vaccination and the disease becomes endemic,” the report said.The NIDM report quoted the prediction of experts from IIT Kanpur which suggested three likely scenarios for the third wave based on the level of unlocking.In scenario one, it said that the third wave could peak in October with 3.2 lakh positive cases per day.In scenario two, with the emergence of new and more virulent variants, the third wave could peak in September with likely five lakh positive cases per day.In scenario three, the experts predicted that the third wave could peak in late October with two lakh positive cases per day.According to the report, earlier, it was proposed that if 67 per cent of the population became immune (a few by infection and rest through vaccination), herd immunity could be achieved.But this has now been complicated by the new and more virulent mutated variants of SARS Cov-2 that have the ability to escape immunity from earlier infections and in some cases even the prevalent vaccines, it said.This has pushed the target immune population for achieving herd immunity to 80-90 per cent.Hence, our health system and vaccines are caught in a race against the virus and are trying to catch up with risks that are evolving every day creating uncertainty all over the world, it said.The NIDM is now taking a clue from several warnings indicating an imminent third wave, trying to understand them and prepare for the third wave. With this backdrop, it engaged with multiple stakeholders from diverse backgrounds in an attempt to formulate consolidated recommendations for actions that can prevent or mitigate an impending surge.The report said there isn’t sufficient data to back widespread fears that children will be hit more severely in the anticipated third wave of the pandemic. However, as the virus continues to evolve, this is going to be a major challenge for children as there is no approved vaccine for children in India yet (first week of August).Children with Covid-19 infection have largely been seen to be asymptomatic or develop mild symptoms. But this becomes worrisome in case children have any comorbidity or other special needs.According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, out of all the children hospitalised due to Covid, 60-70 per cent had comorbidities or low immunity.Children have also been seen to develop MIS-C (Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome) which is a rare but extremely serious condition developed post-Covid recovery, it said.According to a parliamentary standing committee report in 2015, there is an 82 per cent shortage of paediatricians in India’s primary health centres and up to 62.8 per cent of positions for paediatricians in community health centres were vacant.The working group committee experts suggested a holistic home care model, immediate increase in paediatric medical capacities and prioritising mental health issues among children, the report said.According to the Covid vaccination dashboard of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as of August 2, 2021, 47,85,44,144 (over 47 crore) individuals have been administered at least one dose of Covid vaccine.According to a recent study done by professors and alumni from Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) in collaboration with Nirma University, the vaccination rate of India is currently 3.2 per cent and if does not improve, India can witness six lakh cases per day in the third wave.But if the government’s proposal to increase this rate by five times (1 crore doses per day) comes to fruition, India will see only 25 percent of the cases (seen in the second wave) during the third wave peak.According to data from the CoWin portal, out of the total 30.9 crore doses administered since January 2021 till 25 June 2021, 14.3 crore went to women vis-a-vis 16.7 crore to men. The proportion of vaccine coverage -- 856 doses to women for every 1,000 doses for men—does not match India’s current sex ratio of 924 women per 1,000 men.The largest state in India, Uttar Pradesh, has 42 per cent vaccination of women, West Bengal has 44 per cent female coverage, Dadra and Nagar Haveli (predominantly rural UT) 30 per cent.Only a few states- Kerala and Andhra Pradesh—have more vaccine coverage for women than men. Rural women are even more marginally placed vaccination-wise, the report said.

This includes three newborns with one born on Saturday," United Sikhs said in a statement.So far, only India has helped evacuation of Afghan Sikhs after the takeover of the country by the Taliban.Also read: Afghan Sikhs, Hindus among 392 airlifted"We are in communication with governments in the United States, Canada, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Tajikistan, Iran and the United Kingdom among others," the United Sikhs said.“We are also in communication with international aid agencies and non-governmental organisations trying to support rescue efforts in Afghanistan. In addition, our teams are communicating with companies that can execute rescue efforts on the ground in Afghanistan," it said.According to the United Sikhs, the 10-kilometre drive to the international airport in Kabul from Gurdwara Karte Parwan through various checkpoints is one of the biggest challenges in the rescue efforts, it said."We are ready to go to the airport, but we fear the cancellation of evacuation flights from the Kabul airport. This is our only chance to take out the women, children, elderly, and infants from the country. Once current authorities capture the whole country it will be the end of our community," said Surbeer Singh from Jalalabad who has taken refuge at the Gurdwara.

Strengthening technology, and innovation partnership is also central to strengthening the strategic pillar of our relationship,” he said.“Both the Prime Minister and Education Minister are keen on strengthening the knowledge partnership between both our countries further,” Sandhu said in his address to the presidents of US universities.Among those who attended the meeting were Satish K Tripathi, State University of New York, Buffalo; Pradeep Khosla (University of California, San Diego); Michael Rao (Virginia Commonwealth University), Prof. Kumble Subbaswamy (University of Massachusetts, Amherst); Ashish Vaidya (Northern Kentucky University), Renu Khator (University of Houston), Venkat Reddy (University of Colorado, Colorado Springs), Mauli Agrawal (University of Missouri, Kansas City), Mantosh Dewan (Upstate Medical University, SUNY) and Mahesh Daas (Boston Architectural College, Boston).Currently, there are 16 presidents of Indian origin in various universities.“We are proud of your achievements; we also hope that we will have several more success stories in the years ahead. It is not just about more students or more faculty tie-ups,” the ambassador told the participants.    “These are important, however, I would like to see the creation of a set of tools for engagement on a more sustained basis. Can we create a virtual platform where we bring in universities in both countries? Can we facilitate seamless information flows? Can we promote more joint research?” the ambassador said.Keen on strengthening the partnership in education and knowledge-sharing between India and the United States, Sandhu said that the future of India-US relations will depend on how closely the youth in both countries remain connected to each other.“It is also personal for me. My parents were both educators, and they completed their doctoral degrees from the University of Ohio, and returned to India,” he said.In recent months, Sandhu has visited many universities, including Georgia Tech, Emory University, University of California Los Angeles.“I have written to Chancellors/Presidents of around 75 universities; I have had virtual interactions also with many of them. When I speak to the Governors, they are so excited about strengthening the education connect. I see the potential to do a lot more. Each one of you has an important role to play in this regard,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-envoy-taranjit-singh-sandhu-interacts-with-heads-of-us-universities-300199

This is contingent on a continuous drop in the virus level and increasing pace of vaccination in India. The UK could go the same way, he said at an All India Management Association’s (AIMA) programme.Student visas are the highest priority for the MEA right now. The US and many western European countries are currently issuing visas to Indian students, and the MEA is trying to expedite those. The MEA is also talking to the Australian mission here to prevent delays in visa issuance to Indian students. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-h-1b-visa-from-next-month-harsh-vardhan-shringla-300009
24-08-2021||New Delhi||Indians with travel plans to Canada struggling with norm to take RTPCR test in third country||A flight from India to Dubai, over nine hours layover to take next flight to Barcelona, two hours for next flight to Mexico, two days' stay in Mexico to take a an RT-PCR test and ultimately a flight to Vancouver, is all what 19-year-old Lareina Kumar had to do to arrive at the university of her dreams in Canada.Kumar's trip to four countries is not part of a tourism itinerary, but she did not have a choice as Canada has restricted direct flights from India in view of the Covid-19 situation during second wave.With the consecutive extension of the ban on direct flights, the only way for Indian students who have got admission to Canada varsities is to take a connecting flight to Canada, where they will have to obtain a negative RT-PCR certificate from a third country.That third country has to be on the approved list of Canada.The students and parents are demanding that the issue of Indian RT-PCR tests not being accepted should be taken up by India with the Canadian government, saying the current procedure is not only inconvenient but also highly expensive.While Kumar had her travel sorted by spending over Rs 5 lakh on a trip that would usually cost less than Rs 1.5 lakh, several others like her are still figuring out their way around the possible route to take, the excessive expenditure involved and the uncertainty."I had plans to go with my daughter to help her settle there, but all plans have been hit by the restrictions forced by the pandemic. Not only, my daughter has to travel all alone for the first time but also navigate through four countries with a sword hanging on our heads that the norms can change any time," Lareina's mother Lovely Kumar told PTI."We had a ticket booked for her through Doha, but then the norms changed for the country and the partial refund from the trip is also nowhere in sight. The hotels offering refund policy are offering exorbitant prices, while the affordable ones have no cancellation policy. So a trip that would have cost us around Rs 1.5 lakh has shot upto Rs 5 lakh and the mental anguish it has caused is unimaginable," she added.Lareina is a second year undergraduate student at Emilly Carr University of Art and Design in Canada. While she enrolled last year, so far the classes were online due to the pandemic.At a time when several European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, have relaxed travel restrictions on India because India's Covid-19 situation is improving, Canada has again extended the ban of direct flight from India till September 21.A Gurgaon resident who did not wish to be identified is still figuring out the travel for his twin daughters to Canada, who are supposed to join their university there."First the challenge is to arrange for the unexpected expenditure, to get the travel arrangements sorted for both of them together and then being on pins till they ultimately reach their destination without any hiccups due to travel restrictions," he said."The Indian government should raise this issue with the Canadian government. This is crazy to travel to a third country just to take a RT-PCR test. If the Canadian authorities do not trust the quality of tests here, they can specify particular labs or set up some facilities at the Indian airport. One year of their studies has already passed, and it's a practical course, so if they don't go to university this year, the whole experience of study abroad will be a waste for them," he added.Ajay Bisaria, the High Commissioner of India to Canada, had last month met the Toronto representative of Air India to discuss the resumption of flights between the two countries. Bisaria noted this was a pressing need for many travellers, especially students."Imp to rapidly normalise mobility for economic recovery, for achieving normalcy in biz n educn. Discussed with @airindiain Toronto rep #RachelLawrence plans for resumption of flights in the India-Canada corridor given pressing needs of travellers, particularly students @IndiainToronto," he had tweeted.Arvind, who has also been deferring his plans to join offline classes at his university in Canada, said, "I am unable to understand why RTPCR test done in India is not recognised in Canada. Why there is a discrimination with India. Indian govt should liaise and resolve this. We students now got both doses of vaccine. Why things are still not changing?""Canada has opened its border for the United States which is reporting new Covid cases crossing 1 lakh and here we are still struggling," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indians-with-travel-plans-to-canada-struggling-with-norm-to-take-rtpcr-test-in-third-country-299838
24-08-2021||Hyderabad||Telugu diaspora to install PV Narasimha Rao’s statues in five countries||The Telugu diaspora has announced the setting up of statues of former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao in five countries to acknowledge his contribution to the development of India.The first such statue will be installed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States coming November, as part of celebrations for the birth centenary.Supported by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR), who floated the idea, representatives of various Indian and Telugu organisations have convened coordination and preparatory meeting, according to Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) NRI wing coordinator Mahesh Bigala.He pointed out that the statue of Mahatma Gandhi was also installed in Atlanta, and accordingly, efforts were being made to install the statue of Narasimha Rao in the same state as well.“We will consult TRS Parliamentary Party leader and PV Centenary Celebrations Committee Chairman K Keshava Rao as well as the family members for their advice on the statue installation,” he said.The other locations where the statue of the former prime minister is to be installed would be decided in consultation with the Telugu diaspora.In this regard, a meeting has been held that was attended by the Indian American Cultural Association (IACA) founding member Dr Padi Sharma, who chaired the meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telugu-diaspora-to-install-pv-narasimha-raos-statues-in-five-countries-299434
24-08-2021||London||UK lifts ‘all but essential' travel advice for India as Covid pressure eases||The UK government on Tuesday updated its official travel advisory for India to reflect the country's upgraded status under the Covid-19 based traffic light system, no longer advising against “all but essential travel”.India moved from the UK's red list travel ban to amber on August 8 and now the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) advisory has been updated to coincide with the easing of rules.“Following the peak of India's second Covid-19 wave in May, pressure on the Indian health care system has lifted, as the number of Covid-19 cases has fallen,” reads the FCDO update.“A limited number of flights between India and the UK continue to operate. To book tickets and to see important guidance prior to travel, you should check airline websites,” it notes.“Before you travel, check the ‘Entry Requirements' section for India's current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider,” it adds.The update means travellers are better placed on their travel insurance options.Under the amber list rules, fully vaccinated British nationals returning from India no longer need to quarantine, but must arrange a pre-departure test while still in the country as well as a day two PCR test after returning home to the UK. To qualify as fully vaccinated, only UK, EU and US approved vaccines are recognised and require passengers to have had their second vaccine injection two full weeks before you travel.Other nationals, vaccinated abroad or unvaccinated, are required to self-isolate at their declared address on the compulsory passenger locator form. They are also required to get a pre-departure PCR test and another test on day two and day eight of their entry to the UK.Over the weekend, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid had confirmed a cut in costs of these compulsory tests and also commissioned the country's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to address complaints of steep prices and discrepancies in the administration of these tests. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-lifts-all-but-essential-travel-advice-for-india-as-covid-pressure-eases-298541
24-08-2021||Washington||As Covid situation improves, US eases travel advisory for India||The US eased its travel advisory for India on Monday, lowering it to Level 2: Moderate.The new travel advisory of Level 2 – which is considered safe – came in the wake of the significant improvement in Covid situation in India.Early this year, the US had put India in Level 4, asking its citizens not to travel to India, which at that point of time was experiencing an unprecedented second wave of Covid.The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has now issued a Level 2 Travel Health Notice for India due to Covid, indicating a moderate level of Covid in the country."Your risk of contracting Covid and developing severe symptoms may be lower if you are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorised vaccine. Before planning any international travel, please review the CDC's specific recommendations for vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers,” the State Department said.At the same time, the State Department urged Americans not to travel to Jammu and Kashmir (except the eastern Ladakh region and its capital Leh) due to terrorism and civil unrest.They have also been advised not to travel within 10 km of the India-Pakistan border due to the potential for armed conflict.

24-08-2021||---||Govt sends C17 military aircraft to Kabul to evacuate Indian citizens||New Delhi, August 16India has sent a C17 military aircraft to Kabul to evacuate Indian citizens after the Taliban seized control of the country 20 years after it was ousted by a US-led military coalition.As the authorities declared Afghanistan airspace “uncontrolled” and closed the Kabul Airport, Air India earlier in the day cancelled its Delhi-Kabul-Delhi flight that was scheduled to operate and diverted its two aircrafts coming to Delhi from the US toward Sharjah in the UAE for the same reason.Airlines officials said it was the only commercial flight scheduled to operate between India and Afghanistan on Monday, and Air India is the only carrier that has been operating flights between the two countries.The officials said no flights can operate from Kabul airport now as the airspace has been closed and this means no aircraft can also land there. An Air India aircraft tasked to fly to Afghanistan to bring out people will no longer be able to go there too, they added.The officials said, even a NOTAM or notice to airmen has been issued to say Kabul airspace has been closed. “The airspace is closed. How any airline can operate? We were not able to operate our 12:30 pm flight to Kabul,” said a senior airline official.However, yesterday Air India brought back 129 passengers on a return flight from Kabul to Delhi, as Taliban forces entered the national capital of Afghanistan and had waited for “peaceful transfer” of power.The officials said, the airline’s San Francisco-Delhi flight and Chicago-Delhi flight were diverted towards Sharjah today and both the flights will land in Sharjah for re-fuelling purposes. The flights will then leave for Delhi again while avoiding the Afghan airspace.Officials in the aviation industry also confirmed that a Terra Avia’s flight from Baku in Azerbaijan to Delhi in India had entered the Afghanistan airspace this morning but then it quickly turned around and decided to avoid it.Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 in a Twitter post said, “An Air India flight from Chicago to Delhi had changed course and exited Afghanistan’s airspace shortly after entering, while a Terra Avia flight from Baku to Delhi was also changing course.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-sends-c17-military-aircraft-to-kabul-to-evacuate-indian-citizens-298016
24-08-2021||London||Groups mark India’s Independence Day with vigil, protest in UK||Different organisations, including some separatist groups, marked India’s 75th Independence Day on Sunday with a vigil and protest outside the Indian High Commission in London.Protesters gathered opposite India House in Aldwych area of the city amid a significant presence of Metropolitan Police officers around barricades erected outside the High Commission building for the pre-planned demonstration.They carried placards reading “Kisan Mazdoor Ekta” and chanted slogans in support of Indian farmers. Some pro-Khalistani banners were also visible in the crowd.South Asia Solidarity Group, a diaspora-led anti-racist organisation, held a small vigil overnight on Saturday and then staged a stunt in the early hours of Sunday by unfurling a banner reading “Resign Modi” from Westminster Bridge overlooking the Houses of Parliament in London.“As India’s 75th Independence Day dawns, the country’s secular Constitution lies in tatters. Communal and caste violence stalk the land,” said Mukti Shah from South Asia Solidarity Group, one of the organisers of the stunt.“Thousands of political prisoners languish in Covid-infected prisons, and hundreds of thousands of people are grieving the loss of their loved ones as a result of the callous negligence and mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis,” she said.The group also released a statement identifying its 10-point agenda behind the action, including incidents of mob lynching, cases of rape and murder and “mismanagement” of the Covid-19 pandemic in India.Separately, Indian diaspora-led organisation called The London Story, based in the Netherlands, released the first so-called EU-India People’s Roadmap on Sunday as an assertion of democratic values to mark the Independence Day.“It is of utmost importance that governments are held accountable towards human rights violations in bilateral and multilateral relations in areas. Human rights must not be interpreted narrowly, but must feature centrally in debates all the way from climate change to complex surveillance,” said Amnesty India’s director Aakar Patel.The London Story said it had communicated the roadmap to members of the European Parliament’s delegation with India, including Jakop Dalunde; members of the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, including Alviina Alametsa; members of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, including Maria Arena; Members of the German Parliament, including Omid Nouripour, Deputy Chair of the Germany-India Friendship Group; Members of the Dutch Parliament, including Nilufer Gundogan; and others.The roadmap enumerates specific action points in the areas of digital democracy, human rights, and climate change.It calls upon governments to position respect for human rights and human security at the core by incorporating human rights into every clause and also by regularly engaging with civil society through a comprehensive and continued EU-India Human Rights Dialogue. “Given the persecution of dissenting voices in India, we as members of the diaspora and their friends are doing everything, we can to ensure those with political mandates hear what they have to say,” said Ritumbra Manuvie, co-director of The London Story.The People’s Roadmap is said to be endorsed by representatives of the Indian diaspora resident in the European Union (EU), academics and human rights activists.

24-08-2021||London||UK cuts Covid-19 tests’ cost for global travellers, including from India||The UK on Saturday reduced the cost of Covid-19 tests for international travellers from Amber list countries like India from 88 pounds to 68 pounds (USD 122 to USD 94), after many representations over the high charges of the mandatory testing.Passengers returning from Green list countries or Amber list destinations like India, if they are fully vaccinated, will now pay 20 pounds (USD 27) less per Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.The test must be taken on or before day two after the traveller arrives in England.People who have not had both doses of the coronavirus vaccine and are returning from Amber list countries like India will also see the price of the two tests they need fall from 170 pounds to 136 pounds (USD 235 to USD 188). The tests must be taken on days two and eight of their arrival from abroad.The price reduction does not affect arrivals from Red list countries, or if they purchase a test from a private provider, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.The National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace provide Covid-19 tests for international travel, but unlike normal lateral flow tests (LFT) or PCR ones for people with symptoms, they are paid for.UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid has announced a “rapid internal review” of prices charged by government-approved companies after claims holidaymakers are being exploited over private testing.“I’ve ordered my department to urgently review the list of private providers on gov.uk to ensure pricing is clearer and transparent,” the minister said on Saturday.“Any provider found to be misleading the public will be kicked off. Too many providers are acting like cowboys and that needs to stop. The public should be allowed to enjoy their summer holidays without having to face excessive costs or anxiety,” he said.Javid has also commissioned a wider review by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to address discrepancies in testing prices.Since last weekend, India was moved from the Red List travel ban to Amber — which means travellers coming into the UK can self-isolate at their designated address on a compulsory passenger locator form instead of only at a government-mandated hotel at extra costs.

24-08-2021||---||Government working to ease overseas travel restrictions: Jaishankar||New Delhi, August 12External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said his top priority was to make sure Indians were able to travel abroad with the least number of restrictions and hoped that Covaxin, one of the two vaccines being primarily used in India, would get WHO approval by next month.“As a country whose people look at the world as a global workplace, it is up there in my priority,” Jaishankar said, while responding to Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani’s observation about travel impediments at the CII’s virtual annual session on Thursday.Jaishankar said a lot of talk about travel impediments was “speculation” and “not fact based”. Many countries, including the US, don’t insist on being vaccinated. They want a RT-PCR test done before boarding the plane.“At the moment, it is an India issue. They (the US) are not allowing people who have stayed for a length of time here to go to the US directly. The general practice is testing-based rather than vaccine-based,” he added.He also acknowledged the issue about vaccines at some places, saying Europe started the problem by exempting people only with certain kinds of vaccination from quarantine. “We got Covishield in. Covaxin is still a problem. Maybe in September, we should get some kind of indication,” he added.The solution was a vaccination certificate on the lines of the “Yellow Fever” certificates where there was no insistence on a particular type of injection.“I do see it as a challenge. Some countries try to get across their viewpoint that their vaccine is a must to deal with them. There will be a push and pull out there,” the minister observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-working-to-ease-overseas-travel-restrictions-jaishankar-296849
