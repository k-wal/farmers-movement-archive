But its two discussions on HIV and Ebola over the past two decades had no interest in finger pointing at a particular country.The first time UNSC met on an epidemic was in 2000 when it discussed the impact of HIV on peace and security in Africa. The resolution did specifically mention Sub-Saharan Africa, but that was in the context of focussing efforts on treatment, care and prevention. The second time in 2014, an emergency meeting on Ebola did not pose any problems because it was the leaders of the affected countries have who had sought a global response.There are two big obstacles on getting the UNSC to do the bidding of the three western UNSC permanent members – France, UK and the US – besides their security allies. First is that China as a full member like these three also carries considerable clout and IOUs that can be encashed to forestall a discussion. Among the permanent members it has Russia on its side to wield a veto. Among the non-permanent members – if it ever came to that -- the West can claim full allegiance of Germany, Dominican Republic, Belgium, Estonia, Niger and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines while Indonesia, South Africa, Tunisia and Vietnam may take an independent stance, said the sources.The second obstacle is proving that Covid endangers peace and security in the world, which is the UNSC’s charter. Sources recalled how difficult it was for India to get a relatively simple matter like Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar blacklisted by the UNSC because China was unconvinced that his case fell within the ambit of Resolution 1267 on Al Qaeda and ISIS. Trying to prove that China should take the fall for the spread of Covid is a much steeper mountain, they pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-may-escape-censure-on-coronavirus-at-unsc-65576

But active job card holders are those who have been seeking work and coming to work under MGNREGA over the past two years.The petition contended that the March 24 lockdown order issued under Section 6 and Section 10 of the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 was binding on all Ministries/Instrumentalities of the Central and State Governments and only essential services were exempt from it As it required all citizens to follow bsocial and physical distancing and didn't exempt works performed under MGNREGA, it was not possible for MGNREGA card holders to work and earn livelihood, the petition submitted.It urged the top court to direct that "at least all active job card holders under MGNREGA over the past one year will be deemed to be on duty during the 21-day lockdown period and accordingly direct them to make payment of wages without deductions urgently."The petition is likely to come up for hearing early next week.Describing MGNREGA as a programme meant to be a lifeline to rural workers during this kind of distress circumstances, the petitioners said, "It would be completely unfair to not enable MGNREGA to provide the support that it is designed to give when rural workers are facing the country's worst challenge of unemployment and limited access to money and foodgrains."All active MGNREGA registered households should be deemed to be on duty for the entire duration of the lockdown period starting from March 24 and paid their full wages, the PIL demanded.The petition sought directions to the Centre and states to draw up interim guidelines, and/or an amended scheme under section 4 of the Act, and appropriately amend the schedule of works under schedule 1 of the Act for implementing MGNREGA during the FY 2020-21 once the lockdown period was over, in order to respond to this crisis in a sustainable manner in view of the lasting threat of waves of the virus.Section 22(l)(a) of the MGNREG Act mandated that the Central Government shall pay the entire wage component and the Central Government has called a nationwide lockdown it must be the duty of the Central Government to follow the orders of Ministry of Labour dated March 20, 2020 to pay full wages without any deductions, the PIL said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-demands-full-wages-for-7-6-crore-mgnrega-workers-during-lockdown-65570

This was supposed to be the peak time. The season started with a slump in arrivals and ended with coronavirus,” Manuel Cardozo, president of All Goa Traditional Shack Owners’ Association told PTI.Cardozo owns a shack on Baga-Calangute beach belt, one of the most popular hotspots for tourist activities, but it now wears a deserted look in light of the lockdown.“Shacks are usually removed by May 31. But people got them dismantled in March itself,” he said.Beach shacks are temporary structures, which are removed during monsoon, only to be set up again for the next tourist season.“We don’t expect the next season to bring any cheers."Coronavirus is going to hit the economy. People will avoid travelling for a while,” he deduced.The situation is no different in the more sedate and laidback South Goa district.Cruz Cardozo, president of All Goa Shack Owners Welfare Society, said, “Travel is always secondary in times like this. Under the present circumstances all our livelihoods are in danger,” he said.Foreign travellers would save up for an entire year to holiday in Goa, he recalls.However, the Travel and Tours Association of Goa (TTAG) claimed that the situation will improve post this health crisis.“People are holed up in their homes. Once all this is over, they will want to move out and de-stress. There is no better place than Goa. They can enjoy on the beach and party,” TTAG president Savio Messias said.

If all lights are switched off at one time for nine minutes there is possibility of a grid collapse resulting in blackout in the entire country," Raut said."Due to the lockdown, there is a change in the demand and supply situation. If there is a sudden drop or increase in the demand or supply in the grid, there could be disturbance in the grid frequency," he said.  "Considering the possible situation, citizens and all the electricity generation, distribution and transmission companies should take required precautions," he added.At present, the power demand in the state has come down from 23,000 MW to 13,000 MW, the minister said.Due to the lockdown, the industry load is zero. The 13,000 MW load is on essential services and residential, he said."If the electricity is switched off together, all power stations can go on high frequency and there is possibility of grid tripping. If all power stations are shut, there can be multi-state grid failure," the minister added.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/switching-off-lights-could-lead-to-grid-collapse-minister-65535

We can’t hear everyone,” said a Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao. TNSThe Supreme Court (SC) on Friday asked the Centre to respond to a PIL seeking directions to ensure payments of wages/minimum wages to migrant workers employed by some establishments/contractors or those self-employed as they were unable to work due to the nationwide lockdown in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.A Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao issued notice to the Centre after petitioners’ advocate Prashant Bhushan said the matter needed urgent attention of the court.While dealing with the PIL filed by activist Anjali Bhardwaj and Harsh Mander, the top court expressed concern over the plight of migrant workers in the unorganised sector and asked the Centre to file its response by April 7, the next date of hearing.On behalf of the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta objected to the PIL. “These PIL shops must close down. Genuine persons are helping people on the ground. Sitting in AC rooms and filing PILs does not help,” Mehta told the Bench.He said if the court wanted, the Centre was ready to file a detailed report on migrant workers.During hearing of another PIL, the Centre had earlier told the top court that more than 21,000 temporary shelters had been set up where close to seven lakh migrant workers had been accommodated across India and they were being given food and medical facilities.The petitioners have also sought directions to the Central and state governments to immediately activate National and State Advisory Committees of experts in the field of disaster management and public health and prepare national and state disaster management plans for dealing with Covid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-seeks-wages-for-migrants-65255

What we expected from you today was FAP II, a generous livelihood support package for the poor, including for those categories of poor who were totally ignored by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.”“Every working man and woman, from business person to daily wager, also expected you to announce steps to arrest the economic slide and re-start the engines of economic growth,” wrote Chidambaram.However, BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda, and supporters were all in praise of the PM and asked the people to follow his directive.Some even saw “astrological” reasoning behind the time chosen by the PM. “Under PM Modi’s leadership the country has fought coronavirus bravely and in order to continue the fight we stand in solidarity,” said Nadda, urging all BJP workers to spread the message while following social distancing.But for senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor it was feel-good moment “curated by India’s photo-op Prime Minister”. “Listened to the Pradhan showman. Nothing about how to ease people’s pain, their burdens and their financial anxieties,” Tharoor said, hitting out at the PM.“No vision of the future or sharing issues he is weighing in deciding about the post-lockdown. Just a feel-good moment curated by India’s photo-op PM!” the Thiruvananthapuram MP tweeted.“The government has announced several measures to strengthen the economy,” Nadda added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-draws-oppn-flak-for-call-to-show-solidarity-65254

In that light, in that lustre, in that radiance, let us resolve in our minds that we are not alone, that no one is alone!130 crore Indians are committed, through a common resolve,” he said.The PM underscored that in doing so, citizens should observe the norm of social distancing and not violate the Lakshman Rekha by spilling onto streets or colonies. The reiteration came in the backdrop of crowding at many places at Thanksgiving on March 22, attracting criticism in social media.That event to thank the frontline warriors against Covid19 , he said, attracted attention of the world and many countries were replicating it.Explaining the rationale, PM Modi said when the nation is fighting a huge battle, one should from time to time keep experiencing the collective superpower manifesting itself in the form of the people.“We must end the darkness and uncertainty emanating from the crisis, by progressing towards light and certainty. We must defeat the deep darkness of the crisis, by spreading the glory of light in all four directions”, he said. “This is a Ram Baan (Lord Rama’s arrow to pierce through),” in these times.Today’s message is intended to reinforce that each citizen has taken a pledge to move towards the end of the tunnel and dispel the mood of sombreness and darkness in the country following the 21-day lockdown in force since March 25.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-calls-for-another-show-of-solidarity-65253

They are enemies of humanity. What they have done to female health workers is a heinous crime for which the NSA will be imposed on them. I will not spare them,” said Yogi. The UP Government has also directed that women health workers and women police personnel will no longer be deployed to treat and provide security to Tablighi Jamaat people placed under quarantine after the Ghaziabad incident of the alleged misbehaviour.

Health officials were attacked in Taatpatti Bakhal area on Wednesday while tracing contact of a Covid patient. Seven persons have already been arrested. Besides, six more men have been detained in connection with the incident. PTIIn view of the reported cases of attacks on medical fraternity across the country, who are at the forefront in fight against Covid-19, the government today said it had asked the state governments and the union territories (UTs) to provide extra security to them and also take strictest possible action against attackers.When asked about the concerns put forth by medical professionals and doctors’ body, who wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah asking for protection, Punya Salila Srivastava, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, said the Home Secretary had written to state governments to take strict action in cases of attack on healthcare and frontline workers engage in fight against Covid-19 and ensure their security in the best possible manner.Another senior MHA official said the Home Secretary had been emphasising the issue with state chief secretaries in all his video-conferencing meetings.It is to be noted here that yesterday in a second letter to the Home Minister, the Resident Doctors’ Association of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMs) had highlighted attacks on junior doctors in Hyderabad and demanded action against the perpetrators and safety assurance.However, reports of cases of attacks on doctors and frontline workers poured in from Indore, Hyderabad and Bengaluru when they went to locate people suspected to be infected with Covid.Also a few days ago, doctors in Delhi were threatened by landlords following which they had sought similar protection from the Home Minister by writing to him.Two women doctors were injured in Indore when a five-member health team was pelted with stones in Taatpatti Bakhal area on Wednesday while they were trying to trace a person who had come into contact with a Covid-19 patient, the police had said, while adding that a case was registered and seven people were arrested.Relatives of a 49-year-old coronavirus patient, who died at a hovernment hospital in Hyderabad, assaulted the doctor on duty and the staff alleging negligence, it was reported.

PTIWhile the circle of Covid-19 infections continues to widen at a worrisome pace across India, the government today said it has not yet decided whether to go in for large-scale community testing as some countries such as South Korea and Germany have done. Cases today reached 2,547 and deaths 62, both data points nearly doubling since Monday when the national caseload was 1,071 and mortality figures were 29.The average rate of rise in daily infections for the week starting Monday crossed 26 per cent today after remaining stable at 11 to 16 per cent for a long time through previous weeks. This indicated a reversal of initial gains India had made at flattening the disease curve through lockdown.Meanwhile, although WHO Regional Director for Southeast Asia Poonam Khetarpal, at a virtual meeting with health ministers of the region, today called for active case detection, the government said conducting unnecessary tests for confidence building alone in times of shortage of test kits might not be the right strategy.The Health Ministry didn’t rule out review of test sampling guidelines but said there was no decision on the issue yet.“Under the existing guidelines, we are doing sampling in hotspots and in these hotspots we will also test cases of severe acute respiratory illness and influenza-like illness. If we feel the need, we will revise Covid-19 test sampling criteria but so far there has been no decision in the matter,” said Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal.The Nizamuddin hotspot cluster associated with the Tablighi Jamaat event now contributes a whopping 467 positive cases to the national caseload. This means one in every four confirmed cases in India now is linked to the Jamaat event.On testing, some expansion to existing strategy will be formalised on Saturday when the ICMR issues guidelines to allow states to conduct antibody (blood based) tests for Covid-19 on residents of hotspots such as Nizamuddin.These guidelines will follow US FDA’s approval today to the first antibody Covid test that will look for immunity to the disease in people.“The idea is to see if anyone in the hotspot has developed antibodies to fight the disease which is existing in the cluster,” an official said. Persons with antibodies to the virus causing Covid-19 could prove vital to vaccine research. But experts feel antibody tests would serve a limited purpose and draw government’s attention to WHO’s repeat advice of “more testing”.India has constantly been questioned for low testing since its first case on January 30. While South Korea, which has effectively managed Covid-19, was conducting 80,000 tests a day on an average, India has so far done just 66,000 tests. “The highest single day testing was done only yesterday — 8,000 samples,” said ICMR.Light lamps: PM ModiOn April 5 at 9 pm, turn off the lights, stand in balconies and light candles, torches or mobile flashlights for 9 minutes.

Transmission may also occur by touching surfaces or objects in the immediate environment around the infected person, state-run China Daily quoted the WHO publication as saying.Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission, as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be the smaller particles of less than 5 microns in diameter, and which can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than one metre, it said.According to the publication, no cases of transmission by air were reported in an analysis of 75,465 coronavirus patients in China. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-spreads-by-respiratory-droplets-not-air-65285
04-04-2020||Arun Joshi||Policy revised: All govt jobs for domicile of  Jammu & Kashmir||Tribune News ServiceJammu, April 3The Union Home Ministry late Friday night made a significant amendment to the domicile policy for Jammu & Kashmir, reserving all government jobs for the domicile certificate holders of the Union Territory.In the original policy announced on Tuesday, only Class IV jobs were reserved for the domicile of J&K. Now that clause has been withdrawn.This happened hours after Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari met Union Home Minister Amit Shah and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and aired the disappointment of the people over the March 31 notification. He said people across Jammu and Kashmir were unhappy with the policy.He apprised the two of the staggering consequences of the policy that gravely diminished job opportunities for the youth of J&K, who already had suffered over the past 30 years.Earlier in the day, an informed source had told The Tribune over the phone that Bukhari had got a positive response to his demand that either the policy be kept in abeyance because of the coronavirus threat or it should be amended to help the J&K youth who had absolute claim on jobs of all ranks. The source had said the duo had assured him that all necessary corrective steps would be taken to assuage the hurt that the policy might have caused.Some BJP leaders too are reported to have met Shah with a similar plea seeking amendment to the policy announced early this week.The BJP is worried about the loss of its credibility as anger against it is growing in Jammu region, the bastion of the saffron party.The Apni Party, formed last month, had listed the domicile policy that ensured unaltered demography and the restoration of the statehood to J&K. Its leaders had met the PM and HM in mid-March and had emerged happy after the meetings, as the HM had assured that there would be no demographic change in Jammu and Kashmir.Delhi had announced the domicile policy on Tuesday night, the real content of which came to be known only on Wednesday.It envisaged that all those who had lived in Jammu and Kashmir since its days of erstwhile state, now UT, for the past 15 years, had all the rights.
