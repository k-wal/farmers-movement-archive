28-07-2020||New Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat: Police files charge sheet against 69 foreigners from nine countries||The Delhi Police on Tuesday filed six charge sheets against 69 foreign nationals from nine countries in Delhi Courts for attending Tablighi Jamaat congregation here allegedly in violation of visa norms, indulging in missionary activities illegally and violating government guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, said a lawyer.Three charge sheets were filed at Karkardooma District court and three were filed at Tis Hazari District Court here.The foreigners, who have been booked in the six cases, were earlier allowed to be deported back to their countries by the court after completion of their plea bargain proceedings in the case in which 955 foreigners were charge sheeted by the Crime Branch of the Delhi police.They were allowed to walk free on payment of varying fines after they accepted mild charges related to various violations during the COVID-19 lockdown.The charge sheets were filed on Tuesday in the cases registered at the Seelampur police station, Sadar Bazar, Bara Hindu Rao, Sarai Rohila and Dayalpur police stations, said advocate Ashima Mandla, counsel for some of the foreigners.According to the charge sheets, the foreign nationals have been booked for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic and regulations regarding Epidemic diseases Act and Disaster Management Act.They have also been booked for the offences under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code.At least 70 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members, who were ordered to be deported, have not been able to return to their countries as seven other FIRs are pending against them, their representatives had claimed.These foreigners from different countries including Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, Brazil, Sudan, Afghanistan and Indonesia, who were charge sheeted by the Crime Branch of the Delhi police in the case, have also been booked under the same charges in the seven FIRs filed by the local police, they said.Seven FIRs were lodged at different police stations in the first week of April.The foreigners and their representatives came to know about the seven other FIRs when they reached the airport, a source said.The foreign nationals were earlier booked for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and regulations regarding Epidemic diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.They were also booked under sections 188, 269, 270 and 271 of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act. The Centre had blacklisted them.The punishment for various offences under penal provisions ranges from six months to eight years of imprisonment.In April, COVID-19 cases across the country spiked after hundreds of many Tablighi Jamaat members, who had attended the religious congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz event, tested positive.At least 9,000 people, including the foreign nationals participated in the religious congregation in Nizamuddin. Later, many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country.

28-07-2020||New Delhi||1,056 fresh cases in Delhi as COVID count climbs to 1.32 lakh; no fatality at LNJP on Monday||A day after reporting a noteworthy dip in daily coronavirus cases, the national capital added 1,056 new COVID-19 patients, authorities said on Tuesday while not a single death was reported for the first time in two months at the LNJP hospital, a dedicated COVID-19 facility under the city government.The total number of coronavirus cases climbed to 1,32,275. With 28 fatalities, the death toll stood at 3,881, the health bulletin issued on Tuesday said.According to Monday’s health bulletin, 613 fresh cases were reported, lowest in the last two months. However, only 11,506 tests were conducted. A day later, the tests went up to 18,544 while the fresh cases rose to 1,056.         The recovery rate stands at 88.83 per cent while the positivity rate was 5.69 per cent. The national recovery rate stands at 64 per cent.There are 715 containment zones in the city.In a related development, the LNJP Hospital here did not report any death due to the disease on Monday, for the first time in a couple of months.The 2,000-bed hospital’s medical director attributed the feat to “extensive ICU care, plasma bank facility, top healthcare facilities and dedication of doctors and other healthcare workers”.Taking to Twitter on Tuesday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced, “No death in our biggest COVID hospital LNJP yesterday.”       At least one death due to COVID-19 was recorded daily in the past couple of months, but “yesterday no fatality happened at LNJP”, Medical Director Suresh Kumar said.Last month, the hospital came under fire over alleged mismanagement in handling the coronavirus situation. A team of the National Humans Rights Commission, led by its member Jyotika Kalra, had also visited the hospital in the second week of June for an on-spot inspection of the facility in the wake of the allegations.Till Tuesday evening about 389 of the hospital’s 2,000 beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients, of whom 88 were in ICU and two on ventilators, Kumar said.Meanwhile, with the incidence of coronavirus in the national capital appearing to show a declining trend and many beds remaining empty, several private hospitals are citing mounting losses to urge the Delhi government to reconvert some COVID-19 facilities and allow more non-COVID services.               According to the Delhi Corona app, only 2,783 beds of the 15,438 dedicated beds for coronavirus patients across private and government hospitals in the national capital are occupied.Many hospitals said more than half their dedicated COVID-19 beds are vacant as a large number of coronavirus positive patients are under home isolation.In a related development, the Delhi High Court has sought response from the AAP government on a plea challenging a provision which empowers police officers of sub-inspector rank or above to impose fines on anyone violating COVID-19 regulations.A Bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notice to the Delhi Government seeking its stand on the plea by a lawyer, who has contended that imposing a fine amount or handing down a punishment can only be done by a judge, not a police officer.Under the Delhi Epidemic Diseases (Management of COVID-19) Regulations of 2020, an authorised person is empowered to impose a fine of Rs 500 for the first time and a further fine of Rs 1,000 for repeated violation of quarantine rules—not maintaining social distancing, not wearing masks, spitting in public places and consumption of tobacco products in public places.The petition has sought quashing of the provision in the regulations which empowers police officers to impose fines for these violations.

28-07-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Weddings, funerals increasing COVID case load in Kerala||With weddings and funerals turning out to be COVID-19 spreaders in some places, the Kerala Government on Tuesday said a maximum of 20 people would only be allowed to participate in these events.Taking a serious view of over 70 people being infected after attending a marriage and a funeral in Kozhikode and Wayanaad districts recently, the government has decided to restrict the number of those attending such events, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.Hereafter, only 20 people can participate in marriages and funerals, he told reporters here.Earlier, the cap on attendees at marriages and funerals was 50.In Chekkiad panchayat in Kozhikode, more than 30 people who had participated in a wedding of a doctor on July 9 tested positive later, Vijayan said.The groom was among those who had tested positive.Vadakara MP, K Muraleedharan, had also attended the previous day’s function and was asked by the Kozhikode Collector to go on quarantine.In Wayanad’s Thavinhal panchayat, eight members of a family, who had participated in a funeral, were found positive for the virus on July 19.Following this, authorities tested 210 other people who came in contact with them and totally 43 were found infected, the chief minister said.The tests are continuing and would be held on Wednesday also, district health department sources told PTI.The panchayat has been declared as a containment zone.Vijayan also said three health workers of Kozhikode Medical College Hospital tested positive following which it has been decided to test all workers.Noting that 12 migrant workers who had returned to the state were found infected in Kozhikode district, he said those coming back should give their details to the district labour officer. Instructions had been issued in this regard, he added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/weddings-funerals-increasing-covid-case-load-in-kerala-119149

28-07-2020||Beijing||Indian, Chinese troops complete disengagement at most locations of border, claims Beijing||The frontline troops of China and India have “completed” disengagement at most locations of their border, a senior Chinese official said on Tuesday, adding the situation on the ground is easing.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin made this statement at a briefing here when he was asked whether the border troops from India and China have completed the disengagement from Galwan, Gogra and Hot Spring areas in eastern Ladakh.The reference to Pangong Tso, a major friction point, was conspicuously absent in the question asked by a reporter from China’s official media.During the briefing, the spokesman noted that China and India have recently conducted “intensive communication through military and diplomatic channels”.“Now the frontline border troops have completed disengagement in most locations and the situation on the ground is easing,” Wang said.Indian government sources in New Delhi said this statement is not correct.At the briefing, Wang said, “We have held four rounds of commander level talks and three meetings of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC).”        “Now we are preparing for the fifth round of commander level talks to study the settlement of the remaining issue. We hope India will work with China to implement our consensus and uphold peace and stability along our border areas,” he added.Asked when the next commanders’ level meeting will be held, Wang said the information will be released in due course.The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday said that India and China agreed on “early and complete” disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh and may hold more military talks soon so as to work out further steps to ensure “expeditiously” complete “disengagement and de-escalation” and restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas.India had also asked China to “sincerely implement” the understanding on troop withdrawals reached by senior military commanders of the two sides.National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a nearly two-hour-long telephonic conversation on July 5 to bring down tension between the armies of the two countries in eastern Ladakh.Both China and India commenced the disengagement process from July 6 following talks between Doval and Wang who are Special Representatives for the boundary question.The tension in eastern Ladakh escalated manifold after the violent clashes in the Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. As per US intelligence reports, the Chinese Army suffered 35 casualties. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-chinese-troops-complete-disengagement-at-most-locations-of-border-claims-beijing-119142
28-07-2020||Mukesh Ranjan ||Bhima Koregaon Elgar Parishad case: NIA arrests DU professor Hany Babu||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 28National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday said it had arrested accused Hany Babu Musaliyarveettil Tharayil, an associate professor with the University of Delhi, in connection with the Bhima Koregaon Elgar Parishad case.Hany Babu (54), son of Kunhu Mohammad, is a resident of Gautam Buddha Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, said the probe agency.Officials in the investigative agency said, Hany Babu, a professor in English at the DU, would be produced before the NIA Special Court in Mumbai on Wednesday and police remand would be sought for his custodial interrogation.The NIA officials alleged that Hany Babu was propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology and was a co-conspirator in the case along with the other arrested accused. They said the case pertains to inciting people and giving provocative speeches during Elgar Parishad organised by the activists of Kabir Kala Manch at Shaniwarwada, Pune, on December 31, 2017, which promoted enmity between various caste groups, followed by large scale violence resulting in loss of life and property and state-wide agitation in Maharashtra.During investigation by the state police, it was revealed that senior leaders of CPI (Maoist), an organisation banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, were allegedly in contact with the organisers of Elgar Parishad, the agency said, adding that the accused arrested in the case also allegedly indulged in spreading Maoism or Naxalism and encouraging unlawful activities.The Pune Police filed the chargesheet in the case on November 15, 2018 and supplemented it with another chargesheet on February 21, last year.The NIA took up the investigation in the case on January 24 this year and arrested accused Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha on April 14, the agency officials said, adding that further investigation was on.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhima-koregaon-elgar-parishad-case-nia-arrests-du-professor-hany-babu-119136
28-07-2020||---||China’s health diplomacy to consolidate ‘One Belt One Initiative’ in region||New Delhi, July 28While not much has been heard of India’s SAARC COVID-19 initiative since Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched it in four months back, Chinese inroads on the pretext of a “health silk road” could lead to a further consolidation of its “One Belt One Initiative” (OBOR) around India’s outer peripheries.PM Modi’s SAARC COVID Fund with seed money of about Rs. 1,500 crore was meant to put neighbourhood diplomacy back on rails. The Modi government had given up on the SAARC five years ago owing to Pakistan’s presence and had started showcasing the BIMSTEC combination instead.However, while India focused on bilateral COVID aid with a few select neighbours, China has kick-started a “Health Silk Road” that began with the ASEAN countries and moved on to Central Asia. In both these regions, China has major plans for the OBOR.The “Health Silk Road” endeavour touched the SAARC on Monday at a video conference of the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan, China, Nepal and Pakistan. However, Beijing did not include half of the SAARC, including Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Maldives.The joint statement at the end of the virtual session indicated China’s subsidiary intentions behind including some SAARC countries that are not contiguous and leaving out others were linked to the OBOR.The Chinese railway line from Shigatse to Kathmandu is making progress. The Indian hesitation in taking up the construction of a rail line from Iran to Afghanistan is in contrast with Beijing’s multibillion-dollar plan with Iran that may now be expanded to connect Afghanistan.While the four countries held a video-conference, the Chinese embassy here has indicated that the US had been the instigator in its troubles with India. In a statement, Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong accused the US of seeking “containment, and ideological confrontation” with China while India adhered to strategic independence.However, despite these words, China continues to remain minatory on the issue of India banning 59 mobile apps with the Chinese investments on grounds of data transfer and privacy violations.While China has asked the Indian side to “correct its wrongdoings” in this regard, sources said it might be no coincidence that talks on disengagement and de-escalation from all flashpoints on the LAC were proceeding at a glacial pace.After India began narrowing the scope for Chinese products in government purchases besides banning the apps, Beijing has repeatedly signalled that such interference would force it to take necessary measures. Those measures may mean China pushing for closer ties with Nepal and Afghanistan where India has security stakes as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-health-diplomacy-to-consolidate-one-belt-one-initiative-in-region-119135

Secularism is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. We can’t forget that for over 400 years, Babri stood in Ayodhya and it was demolished by a criminal mob in 1992,” Owaisi tweeted.He said the Supreme Court’s judgement was in fact a “faith over facts” judgement that might encourage some “forces to stake claim over other such places of worship belonging to the minority community”.On the day of the Supreme Court judgement, Owaisi had said: “The Supreme Court may be supreme, but is not infallible.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/owaisi-asks-pm-to-skip-bhumi-pujan-in-ayodhya-119127

They have different ventilation modes, including non-invasive ventilation,” it said.The Yuwell 830 ventilators have bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) — a non-invasive technique to supply oxygen to the lungs without intubation. These high-quality ventilators meet the needs of Indian hospitals, the embassy had said.The donation by France also includes 50,000 high-quality serological IgG/IgM test kits and 50,000 nose and throat swabs and modes of medical transport, the statement said.The equipment was transported on a French Air Force A330 MRTT equipped with a Morpheus kit, which enables the transport of critically ill patients.

28-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Open-door R&D to help bring Covid vaccine early to India||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 27As “vaccine nationalism” grips countries conducting trials, India may be in a happy position of being able to use the developments for its own population as it has adopted a more open policy, sources said.The government has encouraged foreign participation at each of the three stages of infection—preventive (keeping the virus from entering the cells), anti-viral (preventing Covid from replicating) and curative (minimising the internal damage). This, after learning from the experience of the 2009 ‘Swine Flu’ pandemic when rich countries bought up nearly all the stocks and parted with 10 per cent after a global hue and cry, said the sources.It is in line with the approach of partnership with all that the Government approved the entry of Oxford University and AstraZeneca for partnerships in antivirals, it has also enthusiastically welcomed an Israeli initiative to develop a 30-second testing kit.The sources said vaccine trials have several stages, some of them so sophisticated that only a handful of companies can handle it. Besides four major drug MNCs located in the US and EU, India’s Serum Institute can undertake mass manufacture of quality-controlled active ingredients. Panacea Biotech, Shanta Biotech and Biological E Limited also have large production capacities.At present, over 160 vaccines are in various stages of development of which 25 candidate vaccines are undergoing human trials. Of them, Zydus, Gennova Biopharmaceuticals and Bharat Biotech (with Serum Institute) are doing the development in India. This means that Indians will get some piece of the action once the vaccines are declared developed and safe enough for mass production.There are already early signs of countries trying to safeguard supplies for their own populations. The US has announced a $ 10 billion “Operation Warp Speed” that will scale up vaccine production, but only for its citizens.But given India’s large production capacities, bulk of production of a vaccine developed anywhere will most likely happen in India. Sources expect India to leverage this advantage just as it did in being generous in shipping out HCQ, then a wonder drug touted by US President Donald Trump, to over 100 countries.The drug may have not delivered on its promise but India’s decision to open up supplies when there was a worldwide clamour has become a permanent feature of its diplomatic talking points with the beneficiary countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/open-door-rd-to-help-bring-covid-vaccine-early-to-india-119121
28-07-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar claims key cops in state are making money||Firing a fresh salvo at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Tuesday that the state was “police driven”, and police officers holding key positions were making money.“Police in the state have finger in every pie and this does not augur well for democracy. Inputs indicate that governance in the state is Police Driven---a worrisome scenario that leads to Police State. Time to take note of fiscal empowerment of those in police in positions of authority and it will be an eye opener, as many assert,” Governor Dhankhar wrote to Chief Minister Banerjee in a letter on Tuesday.Dhankhar’s letter was in response to Banerjee’s complaint against him to Prime Minister Modi on Monday.Dhankhar and Banerjee have been at loggerheads over a host of issues ever since his taking office in July last year. On Monday, Banerjee raised the issue during an online programme held for inauguration by the Prime Minister of new COVID-19 testing facilities in West Bengal, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.“I would like to thank the Prime Minister for holding several discussions (with chief ministers) on the COVID crisis. And so far, there has been no non-cooperation from his end. I want to thank him for that. But a few people who are holding constitutional posts are regularly disturbing the state government. This is not acceptable,” Banerjee said without naming anyone.Dhankhar wrote to Banerjee on Tuesday that he was “stunned and shocked” by her allegations.“I take strong exception to such uncharitable, unfounded and unmerited stance. These are unbecoming to the position you hold”, Dhankhar wrote.The Governor, who made the letter public by posting a copy on his twitter handle, also tweeted, saying, “Reminded @MamataOfficial that in performance of constitutional duties shall never be daunted. Have confined to constitutional prescriptions while Chief Minister practised ‘constitutional distancing’, and making my role as Governor/Chancellor dysfunctional”.Dhankhar wound up his tweets on the subject saying he was “hopeful of positive response”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-governor-jagdeep-dhankhar-claims-key-cops-in-state-are-making-money-119120
28-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: NIA opposes Sudha Bharadwaj’s bail plea||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) told Bombay High Court on Tuesday it “strongly opposed” the plea filed by activist and lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj seeking interim bail on health grounds.Bharadwaj is an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Koregaon Bhima case and has been lodged in Byculla women’s prison since September 2018.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for NIA, told a Bench led by Justice RD Dhanuka that the agency had ample evidence Bharadwaj had “participated in anti-national activities”, and, thus, did not deserve to be let out on bail.Bharadwaj approached HC seeking bail on health grounds after a special court in the city rejected the same on May 29.She had applied for bail after a Byculla women’s prison inmate tested positive for coronavirus earlier this year.Last month, the NIA filed an affidavit in HC opposing her bail plea saying Bharadwaj (58) was taking “undue advantage” of the pandemic and her pleadings on her having comorbidities and, therefore, being a high risk candidate for COVID-19 were a mere “ruse” to seek bail.On Tuesday, Bharadwaj’s counsel Ragini Ahuja told the court Bharadwaj, a former professor of law, had been in jail for almost two years and she suffered from diabetes that put her at a higher risk for contracting COVID-19.ASG Singh, however, said, “As far as her apprehensions on getting COVID-19 in jail are concerned, today any person can get infected with COVID-19 anywhere. One can get infected with COVID even without going out, or while in office, at home, or going anywhere else.”In fact in jail, the authorities are taking all safety precautions and implementing ICMR guidelines on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, he said.Singh said the state government had, earlier this month, submitted details of precautions and ICMR guidelines being implemented in prisons before a bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta.Besides, Bharadwaj would be provided adequate medical treatment in jail as and when required, Singh told HC.Last week, in compliance with a previous order of the court, Byculla prison authorities had submitted a report in HC saying that while Bharadwaj was diabetic and suffers from ischemic disease, a heart condition, her “vital parameters” were “normal”.The HC has now directed NIA to submit an additional affidavit detailing its contentions opposing Bharadwaj’s bail plea.The same bench also heard a plea filed by activists Vernon Gonsalves and Anand Teltumbde, Bharadwaj’s co-accused in the case, seeking coronavirus tests as the two had been in close contact with another co-accused, poet-activist Varavara Rao, in Taloja prison.Rao tested positive for coronavirus on July 16 and is admitted in Nanavati Hospital in the city.The petitioner’s counsel, Mihir Desai, told the bench while some news reports said Gonsalves had tested negative for coronavirus, he had been unable to confirm the same.Desai said Gonsalves’ wife had been trying to contact him since July 13 but prison authorities were not permitting any telephone calls between her and her husband.The state’s counsel, Deepak Thakare, however, told the court Gonsalves had undergone a swab test in jail and had tested negative for coronavirus.Thakare also said he will ask Taloja jail authorities to permit Gonsalves to contact his wife through video- conferencing.He said he will inform the court of Teltumbde’s health by July 31, the next date of hearing.Bharadwaj’s bail plea will be heard on August 4.

28-07-2020||New Delhi||On way to India, 5 Rafales re-fuelled mid-air by French tanker||On their way to India from France, five Rafale jets were refulled mid-air from a French tanker at a height of 30,000 feet, according to photos released on Tuesday by the Indian Embassy in France.The jets took off from the Merignac airbase in French port city of Bordeaux on Monday, and will be arriving in India on Wednesday afternoon after covering a distance of nearly 7,000 km.“Indian Air Force appreciates the support provided by French Air Force for our Rafale journey back home,” the IAF tweeted.On Monday evening, the Rafales landed at Al Dhafra airbase in the UAE after flying for over seven hours, officials said adding it was the only stopover by the jets while flying from France to India.“Few shots from 30,000 feet! Mid air refuelling of #RafaleJets on their way to #India,” the Indian Embassy in France tweeted along with a number of pictures of the jets being refuelled mid-air.The fleet, comprising three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft, is arriving at Ambala airbase on Wednesday afternoon where they will be officially inducted into the IAF as part of its No 17 Squadron, also known as the ‘Golden Arrows’, said one of the officials.                            The aircraft are expected to significantly boost the IAF’s combat capabilities at a time when India is locked in a tense border row with China in eastern Ladakh.The IAF has already deployed all its frontline fighter jets in key airbases along the Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border between India and China.India had inked a Rs 59,000 crore deal on September 23, 2016 to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation.The first Rafale jet was handed over to the IAF in October last year during a visit to France by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.The first squadron of the Rafale jets will be stationed at Ambala air base.Official sources said the Rafale jets are likely to be deployed in the Ladakh sector as part of IAF’s efforts to enhance its operational capabilities along Line of Actual Control with China in view of the border row with the country.The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.                Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.The Meteor is powered by a unique rocket-ramjet motor that gives it far more engine power for much longer than any other missile, said an official.The second squadron of Rafale will be stationed at Hasimara base in West Bengal. The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop required infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two bases.           Out of 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.

28-07-2020||Lucknow||Babri mosque case: Special CBI court completes recording of statements||A special CBI court here completed on Tuesday the recording of statements of the accused in the 1992 Babri mosque demolition case.Deposing before CBI special judge S K Yadav through video conferencing from Thane in Maharashtra, former Shiv Sena MP Satish Pradhan claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case due to political vendetta and maintained that he was completely innocent.Of the 32 accused in the case, Pradhan was the penultimate on the list.The judge separated the case against the last accused Om Prakash Pandey, who is not traceable as his family told the CBI that he had become a monk 15-16 years ago and did not return home since then.The court has already declared him an absconder and has initiated proceedings to attach his property.It inferred from a CBI report that Pandey was neither traceable nor was there any possibility of him being traced in the near future. The court, however, directed the CBI to produce him if he is nabbed.The court separated Pandey’s file, as otherwise the trial proceedings would have to be halted.Since the court has to conclude the trial by August 31, 2020, in compliance with a Supreme Court order, it took the decision.As the proceedings under Section 313 of CrPC were completed on Tuesday, during which they got an opportunity to record their statement, the court has now fixed July 30 to enable the accused to furnish their defence, including producing witnesses to support their contention.After the exercise is over, final arguments will be held followed by the judgement of the court.The special court has been recording the statements of the accused since July 4 under section 313 of CrPC.The mosque in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992 by ‘kar sevaks’ who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site.Former deputy prime minister LK Advani and BJP veteran MM Joshi, who were among those leading the Ram temple movement at that time, had deposed last week through video conferencing.The court has also recorded statements of BJP stalwarts like Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti, both of whom appeared in person.Advani’s statement was recorded barely days before the groundbreaking event on August 5 for a Ram temple at Ayodhya.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several other political leaders, including Advani, have been invited to attend the event.Last year, a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court had ruled that the 2.77 acre land claimed by both Hindus and Muslims would be handed over to a government-run trust for the building of a temple.The court had also announced allocation of a five-acre plot at another site in Ayodhya to build a mosque. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/babri-mosque-case-special-cbi-court-completes-recording-of-statements-119100
28-07-2020||New Delhi||Air India posted some duplicitous tweets that are misleading: Pilots||Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) and Indian Pilots Guild (IPG) have accused Air India of spreading “deliberate misinformation on social media” and questioned the “duplicitous” tweets by Air India calling them “misleading”.“Air India has recently posted some duplicitous tweets that are misleading the general public,” the pilots associations said.“Recent decisions of Air India Board regarding rationalization of staff cost were reviewed in a meeting at @MoCA_goi this evening. The meeting reiterated that unlike other carriers which have laid off large number of their employees, no employee of Air India will be laid off,” said the Air India tweet.To this the pilots responded in a letter to Air India Executive Director of Corporate Affairs Aruna Gopalakrishnan and said: “A lay off means settlement of arrears, gratuity, PF and retrenchment compensation by law. Management is trying to dodge this by introducing Compulsory Leave without Pay for up to 5 years to send employees on exile.” Another Air India tweet said, “There has been no reduction in the Basic pay, DA and HRA of any category of employees. The rationalization of allowances had to be implemented on account of the difficult financial condition of the airline that were exacerbated by COVID-19”.The pilots have questioned this claim and said that this is a devious plan to ensure a minuscule pay cut for senior AI officials. Basic Pay, HRA and DA constitute 80 per cent of Gross Pay for senior AI officials.“By ‘rationalizing’ the allowances only, pilots and cabin crew are hit worst as it forms 80 per cent of our gross pay. Doesn’t the difficult financial condition of the airline warrant a contribution from the management too, based on their actual cost to company or just flying crew alone?” the pilots said in the letter.“Flying crew will be paid as per the actual number of hours flown. As domestic and international operations expand to reach pre-COVID levels and the financial position of Air India improves, the rationalization of allowances will be reviewed,” the Air India said.The pilots said this should apply to top management as well.“Shouldn’t this also apply to management officials? They should also be paid on actual work done, especially during nationwide lockdown when offices were closed. It is unethical to take 7.5 per cent cut on gross pay while sitting at home while slashing the wages of employees risking their lives in the field by 60 per cent.“Equally preposterous is paying us for actual hours flown at a drastically low rate while handicapping us with ‘three’ COVID19 tests for each VBM flight. All this, while the private carriers are limited to only one test,” the letter said. --- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-india-posted-some-duplicitous-tweets-that-are-misleading-pilots-119098

28-07-2020||Ayodhya||News channels must take permission to hold programmes in Ayodhya district on Aug 5: Administration||The Ayodhya district administration has told news channels that litigants in the Ayodhya land dispute case should not be part of any discussions that they broadcast from here during the ‘Bhumi Pujan’ for the Ram temple on August 5.In an advisory, it also said that if channels are broadcasting a debate or programme from Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh during the ground breaking ceremony, there should be no comments against any person or religion.News channels have to take prior permission to hold any programme and also submit an undertaking to authorities, according to the advisory.“We have issued an advisory to news channels as they have to take prior permission from the magistrate for holding programmes, they will be allowed limited numbers of panellists and no public or viewers will be allowed to attend the broadcast or recording,” Deputy Director, Information, Murli Dhar Singh told PTI.He said that a magistrate and police will be deployed at the programme, and panellists and news channel staff have to strictly follow COVID-19 protocols.News channels have to ensure that no comments are made against any religion or person, and no parties from the Ayodhya dispute case are invited, Singh said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend the August 5 event.The decades old Ram Janmabhooomi- Babri Masjid title dispute case was settled by the Supreme Court last year on November 9.In its verdict, the court said the entire 2.77 acres of the disputed land in Ayodhya should be handed over to the deity Ram Lalla, who was one of the three litigants.It also directed the Centre to allot an alternative 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.Ahead of the ‘Bhumi Pujan’, the Ram Mandir Trust issued an appeal to devotees, asking them not to donate silver bricks.It said the Trust has neither the proper place to store them nor equipment and facilities to check purity of the silver bricks.Devotees in large numbers are donating silver bricks for the Ram Mandir and that has created problems for the Trust, where to store and how to confirm purity, Secretary of Ram Mandir Trust Champat Rai said.He said that till now, more than one quintal of silver bricks and bricks of other metals have been donated to the Trust.                 Rai asked devotees that if they want to donate, they should make money donations through bank deposits.The idol of Ram Lalla will don a new ‘Navratna’ attire on the day of the ‘Bhumi Pujan’. The dress will be fitted with nine gem stones and is being stitched here. Pandit Kalkiram, president of the Ramdal, will present the special costume to the idol.Bhagwat Pahari, the tailor stitching the dress said, it is “good luck for me that I have been given this great work, I will definitely prepare such a costume that will be historical in itself.” “We are stitching dresses for Ram Lalla since generations”, he said.

28-07-2020||Nagpur||Bombay HC rejects bail plea of former DU professor Saibaba||The Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court on Tuesday rejected the bail application of former Delhi University professor GN Saibaba, who is serving life sentence in a prison here for links with Maoists.Saibaba, who is wheelchair-bound with over 90 per cent physical disability, had filed the bail application on medical grounds, saying his weak health along with comorbities make him vulnerable to contract the coronavirus infection in jail.The former university professor, convicted in March 2017 for links with Maoists, is currently lodged in the Nagpur Central Jail.A Division Bench of Justices AS Chandurkar and Amit Borkar here on Tuesday said it was not inclined to grant bail, and rejected the plea.Saibaba, in his plea filed through advocate Nihalsingh Rathod, sought bail for 45 days on medial grounds so that he could get treatment outside and also meet his mother, who is suffering from cancer, in Hyderabad.He submitted that he was suffering from various life threatening ailments and was prone to contracting COVID-19 after the outbreak of the disease in the jail. He also said that he was not getting proper medical treatment in the jail.However, special public prosecutor PK Sathianathan opposed the bail plea, saying the petitioner was lodged in a separate jail wing where inmates were are not in contact with those lodged in other wings of the prison.Also, the prison staff who tested positive for coronavirus were admitted in government hospital, and the staff deployed at the prison had tested negative. All preventive measures are being taken in the prison, he said.Besides, the petitioner’s brother is taking care of his mother, he said.“Hence, on all the grounds, be it medical, the pandemic or his mother’s health, he is not entitled to be released on bail,” Sathianathan said.He also told the court that Saibaba has two attendants round-the-clock and a medical officer is always there to attend to him and provide proper treatment.“If he goes out, he is more likely to contract the disease outside than inside the jail,” he added.Over 200 prisoners and 60 staffers of the Nagpur Central Prison have so far tested positive for coronavirus.The jail houses nearly 1,800 inmates while 265 police personnel are attached to it, according to a prison official.In March 2017, a sessions court in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district convicted Saibaba and four others, including a journalist and a Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student, for Maoist links and engaging in activities amounting to “waging war against the country”.The court held Saibaba and others guilty under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).

28-07-2020||New Delhi||Reconvert some Covid beds to non-Covid, Delhi’s pvt hospitals say as coronavirus cases dip||With the incidence of coronavirus in the national capital appearing to show a declining trend and many beds empty, several private hospitals are citing mounting losses to urge the Delhi government to reconvert some COVID-19 facilities and allow more non-COVID services.According to the Delhi Corona app, only 2,783 beds of the 15,438 dedicated beds for coronavirus patients across private and government hospitals in the national capital are occupied.Many hospitals said more than half their dedicated COVID-19 beds are vacant as a large number of coronavirus positive patients are under home isolation.At the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, which has 650 COVID-19 beds, 551 are unoccupied. The scene is similar in other hospitals too.At the Batra and Venkateshwar hospitals, which have 502 and 439 beds, 465 and 397 beds are vacant. Similarly, the Shalimar Bagh and Saket branches of Max Hospital have 350 and 216 beds, of which 220 and 162 beds are unoccupied. A spokesperson of Fortis Healthcare, which operates in the Delhi-NCR region, said there is a gradual decline in hospitalisation cases and many of its hospitals are presently functioning as full or hybrid COVID facilities.The spokesperson said other surgeries and treatments, barring very critical ones, have largely been put on hold and the occupancy of non-COVID beds is on the lower side.“It is important that hospitals function at the optimum capacity now and we request the Delhi government to allow elective surgeries and non-COVID services to resume at all hospitals,” the spokesperson said.According to K K Sethi, chairperson of the Delhi Heart and Lung Institute (DHLI), an entire floor has been dedicated to COVID-19 but many beds are unoccupied.Moreover, patients with other problems are not coming due to the fear of contracting the virus.“We are a speciality hospital and patients are not coming for angioplasty or specific treatments because of the stigma attached (to COVID-19),” Sethi said.This is leading to losses and operational costs have also shot up considerably, he said.“We are just borrowing from the bank and it’s (loan) coming to crores of rupees now,” he said. Kousar A Shah, chief operating officer, Aakash Healthcare and Super Speciality Hospital, Dwarka, said the hospital had more than 60 COVID-19 patients on July 6. By July 27, the number had gone down to 34. Shah said the hospital is constantly losing patients. “Patients do not come to the hospital and keep waiting at home. Due to this, some patients have landed in dire emergency and it became a matter of life and death. Family members say they were scared to come to the hospital since it’s a COVID facility,” Shah said. Hospitals also blamed capped rates for their losses. The Delhi government last month issued an order fixing the cost of a COVID-19 isolation bed in any private hospital in the city in the range of Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000 and an ICU bed with ventilator at Rs 15,000-Rs 18,000 per day.Chander Prakash, president of the Delhi Voluntary Hospital Forum, claimed hospitals are going bankrupt due to capped rates and absence of non-COVID patients. He said government hospitals have vacant beds and the government should think of improving the facilities there rather than putting pressures on private facilities. Mahesh Verma, the head of a Delhi government panel tasked with strengthening the preparedness of hospitals to battle coronavirus, said, “Only those who require critical care are coming. I have visited private hospitals and many beds are empty. They were actually saying that we should convert earmarked COVID beds into non-COVID beds but we have to wait for some time before we do that.”Last month, Delhi saw a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases and many people succumbed to the infection as they were unable to get a hospital bed.The panel headed by Verma had projected that Delhi would see 5.5 lakh coronavirus cases by the end of July which had necessitated the need for increasing the bed strength.Some private hospitals were either converted to COVID-19 hospitals while a percentage of beds were earmarked for COVID-19 patients.But the situation has seen a significant improvement in the last four weeks.Delhi’s COVID-19 positivity rate has dropped to nearly 5 per cent and its recovery rate, which was around 36 per cent a month back, has improved to 88 per cent. The death rate has also come down.On Monday, the national capital recorded 613 fresh of coronavirus cases, the lowest in the last two months, taking the tally to 1,31,219. However, this decline also coincided with fewer tests at 11,506. As the situation shows an improvement, some suggested the government can have one dedicated COVID hospital in an area.For instance, Dwarka has three big hospitals, so the government can think of naming one as a COVID positive hospital, Shah said.“Since the decline is being seen, instead of all of us putting efforts into dividing patients between COVID and non-COVID, only one hospital can do that. It can also be done by rotation. For one month, one can do it and after five-six days, another hospital can take over,” he added. Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Apollo Hospitals, said the government need not hurry and can assess the situation and then take a decision.After that the hospitals can be given the freedom to decide how they want to go about it, he said.Sethi said even if the government converts COVID facilities into non-COVID ones, it will take at least three months to convince the patients to return. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reconvert-some-covid-beds-to-non-covid-delhis-pvt-hospitals-say-as-coronavirus-cases-dip-119084
28-07-2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka ‘drops’ chapter on Tipu Sultan in Class 7||Karnataka has dropped a chapter on Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan from the history textbook for Class 7 students to reduce their syllabus, as reopening of schools has been delayed due to Covid crisis this academic year, an official said on Tuesday.“The chapter on Tipu Sultan for Class 7 has been dropped to reduce the syllabus by 30 per cent for this academic year due to delay in reopening of schools due to no let-up in coronavirus spread,” Karnataka Text Book Society Director Madde Gowda told reporters here.The society, however, retained the chapter on the ‘Tiger of Mysore’ for Classes 6 and 10.“As Class 7 students would have read Tipu in Class 6 and will read more on him again in Class 10, dropping it for them in this academic year will not be a loss to them,” asserted Gowda.The society has uploaded the reduced syllabus for the state board schools on the Department of State Education Research and Training (DSERT) website for online classes and teaching.“The chapter on Tipu will, however, be taught to Class 7 students as part of the assignment and not as a separate lesson,” said Gowda.The eldest son of Sultan Hyder Ali, Tipu (1750-1799) was the king of then Mysore kingdom in southern India and died in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war in 1799 at Srirangapatna, about 20 km from Mysore, after a series of battle victories against the British.The syllabus in the textbooks has been trimmed to adjust for the shortened academic year.Meanwhile, the opposition Congress protested against the dropping of Tipu’s lesson for Class 7 students and accused the BJP government of “playing communal politics” in education too.An expert committee headed by noted writer Baraguru Ramachandrappa advised the state government in November 2019 against dropping the content on Tipu from history textbooks.Chapter 5 on Tipu in Class 7 is part of the history portion on the “Wodeyars of Mysuru”.In Chapter 4 for Class 10 students, Tipu is mentioned along with Halagali Bedas, Kittur Rani Chenamma and Sangoli Rayanna as those who opposed and fought the British in the 18th century.“We have not deleted study matter on Tipu or Hyder Ali. The changes were made by subject experts in whose work we do not meddle. They have changed it on priority, as the academic year has been reduced to 120 days from 220 working days,” Gowda added.

28-07-2020||New Delhi||Vikas Dubey case: SC asks wife of suspended cop to move Allahabad HC for protection||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a plea seeking protection for a police officer who was suspended and arrested for his alleged role in passing on crucial information about the raid to gangster Vikas Dubey and his aides. A Bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian asked the wife of the suspended police officer to approach the Allahabad High Court with the grievance. Lawyer Ashwani Kumar Dubey appeared for Vinita Sirohi and said that she has the apprehension that her husband Krishn Kumar Sharma, a sub-inspector with Uttar Pradesh Police, may be eliminated through “illegal and unconstitutional means”. The top court asked the counsel to withdraw the plea and approach the high court. Sub-inspector Sharma, along with three others, was suspended on July 5 for his alleged involvement in passing on information to Dubey about police movement towards his house in Kanpur district to arrest him. Dubey was killed in an encounter on July 10 after a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur allegedly met with an accident and he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti area.Eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were ambushed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur when they were going to arrest Dubey and fell to the bullets fired by his men from rooftops shortly after midnight on July 3. Sirohi, in her plea filed before the apex court, said her husband was arrested on the ground that he had informed the accused persons about the police raid at Bikru village. Challenging the claim, the plea said that Sharma, who is currently in jail, was directed by his in-charge Vinay Tiwari, Station Officer of the Chaubeypur police station, to remain at the police station. The plea said Tiwari told Sharma that in the night that he was going in a team to arrest a criminal as per instructions to him on the phone, with further instructions to conduct a cross-checking at the GT crossing road.“It is submitted that the extra judicial killings of accused shows plentiful the conduct and modus operandi of all the investigative agencies responsible for investigation of the present FIR.“It is clearly evident that the institutions tasked with the protection of law and order in the state have taken law into their own hands and have been killing the accused persons as soon as arresting such persons,” the plea said. The petition has sought protection of Sharma’s life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution besides transfer of the investigation to an independent investigative agency.Earlier, five members of Dubey’s gang were killed in separate encounters. On July 3, two of his associates---Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey---were killed by police in an encounter in Kanpur. On July 8 the police killed another aide---Amar Dubey---who carried a reward of Rs 50,000, in an encounter in Maudaha village in Hamirpur district. On July 9, Dubey’s two more aides, wanted in connection with the Kanpur ambush, were killed in separate encounters in Kanpura and Etawah districts.

28-07-2020||Mumbai||Even if Sena and BJP come together, won’t contest jointly: Chandrakant Patil||Senior BJP leader Chandrakant Patil on Tuesday appeared reaching out to the estranged ally Shiv Sena, a day after the party president JP Nadda asked state cadre to endeavour to form a government in Maharashtra on its own strength.Patil also said the BJP, being a national party, could not share the post of Chief Minister with any regional party because if it does so then it would have to replicate the same formula in states like Bihar and Haryana.“If the BJP’s parliamentary body recommends the state unit to forge an alliance with the Shiv Sena to protect the interest of the state...I must make one point clear that even if both the parties (the BJP and the Sena) come together, we will not contest any election jointly in future,” Patil, who heads the state BJP unit, told a Marathi news channel.The BJP and its old ally Sena fell out over sharing the post of Chief Minister in Maharashtra after the 2019 Assembly elections.The Sena then went on to join hands with the NCP and the Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.Patil seemed to underline the compulsions of the BJP vis-a-vis sharing the post of Chief Minister.“We had been liberal with the Shiv Sena in the last five years. We were even ready to share more portfolios after the 2019 Assembly polls, but the BJP, being a national party, can’t share the post of CM with any regional party. If we do so, we will have to replicate the same formula in states like Bihar, Haryana and others,” he said.The BJP shares power with regional allies in these states.In a virtual address from Delhi, Nadda on Monday told the party workers from Maharashtra to get ready to “bring the party to power on its own” in the state.He had also asked the Maharashtra party unit to strengthen its IT cell and expose the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government’s “failure”.

The Governor, in his letter to the cabinet, on Monday had said that normally a 21-day notice was in order to call a session.The Governor wanted Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to specify if he would take a vote of confidence in the proposed assembly session.The Congress, however, said the Governor’s queries were not in accordance with the Constitution and that the house agenda was finalised only after the house is summoned.“All cabinet needs to tell the governor is to summon the session. The governor house should know that agenda is fixed once the session is notified,” Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gehlot-sends-revised-proposal-to-governor-seeking-assembly-session-from-july-31-119068
28-07-2020||New Delhi||179 professional colleges shut down this year, highest in last 9 years||Nearly 180 professional colleges, including engineering institutes and business schools, have shut down during the academic year 2020-21, the highest number of the closure of technical institutions in the last nine years, according to All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) data.Besides the closure of 179 institutes, at least 134 institutes did not seek approval this year in view of a large number of seats lying vacant over the past five years thus making it unviable for continuing the institution.Also, at least 44 institutes could not get approval or their approvals were withdrawn due to punitive action by the technical education regulator.While 92 technical institutes had to close down in the 2019-20 academic session, the figures were 89 (2018-19), 134 (2017-18), 163 (2016-17), 126 (2015-16) and 77 (2014-15).Progressive closure means institute cannot admit the students for the first year during the academic year, however, the existing students will continue till completion of their course and their degrees are treated as valid.In the academic year 2020-21, a total of 1.09 lakh seats approved by the AICTE have been reduced in pharmacy and architecture institutions.“As per recent Supreme Court judgement, for the functioning of existing and setting up of new Architecture and Pharmacy colleges, approval of only ‘Council of Architecture’ and ‘Pharmacy Council of India’, respectively, will be mandatory from the academic year 2020-2021,” a senior AICTE official said.“As a result, the approval of the AICTE has been made non-mandatory. Consequently, many of these colleges have withdrawn their affiliation and approval from AICTE resulting in a bulk reduction of seats. Effectively, the seats of pharmacy and architecture have now been taken over by their respective regulatory bodies,” he added.According to official statistics, over 69,000 seats in 762 colleges have been reduced due to a reduction in intake or closure of a particular course or division.“The approval process for the year 2020-2021 was a considerable departure from the previous years on several counts. Due to the imposition and subsequent extensions of lockdown, the approval process was delayed. It was initiated in the month of May and completed in June end,” an official said.“Moreover, the rigorous scrutiny which was undertaken physically at various regional offices was conducted via an online process. This involved using online video-conferencing for stakeholders to connect, verification of infrastructure and campus facilities virtually and uploading digitally signed documents. Even though new Management and Polytechnic Engineering Institutes have added seats, there has been a reduction in the AICTE-approved seats,” the official said.The AICTE has also granted approval to 164 new institutes for the 2020-21 academic season, adding up to 39,000 seats.

Else, it would proceed to decide the matter, it had said.At the root of the problem is the controversial 1981 water-sharing agreement after Haryana was carved out of Punjab in 1966. For effective allocation of water, the SYL canal was to be constructed and the two states were required to construct their portions within their territories.While Haryana constructed its portion of SYL canal, after the initial phase, Punjab stopped the work, leading to multiple cases.In 2004, the Congress government in Punjab came out with the Punjab Termination of Agreement Act to terminate the 1981 agreement and all other pacts relating to sharing waters of the Ravi and the Beas rivers.In 2002, the Supreme Court had decreed Haryana’s suit and ordered Punjab to honour its commitments on water sharing.Punjab filed an original suit that was rejected in 2004 by the Supreme Court which asked the Centre to take over the remaining infrastructure work of the SYL canal project.In November 2016, the Supreme Court had declared the law passed by the Punjab Assembly in 2004, terminating the SYL canal water-sharing agreement with neighbouring states, as unconstitutional. It had answered in the negative all four questions referred to it in a Presidential Reference.But in early 2017, Punjab returned the land — on which canal was to be constructed — to the landowners.The top court has said repeatedly it didn’t intend to revisit the facts and issues already adjudicated upon. The decree already passed has to be executed and it should not be treated as a paper decree, it had said.Haryana maintains that it cannot be made to wait long for construction of the canal. Any further delay in execution of the top court’s decree passed in 2002 would lead to people losing faith in the judicial system, it has said.On the other hand, Punjab says the decree was not executable and the state required time to argue its case. It has told the Supreme Court that the canal land returned to the landowners could not be recovered.Punjab has contended that there were difficulties in implementation of the court’s decree. The decree was premised on the fact that there was enough water in the river. But now there is not much water flow, making it impossible to give effect to it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/negotiate-syl-issue-at-political-level-sc-tells-cms-of-punjab-and-haryana-119057

If he does not accept this now, then it is clear that there is no Constitution in the country," he said. On the issue of 21-day notice required for calling the session, the minister said that 10 days have already passed and asked why did the governor not give a date if he is talking the notice.He said that if the governor rejects the proposals now, the further course of action will be decided. "We have no competition with the governor, he is the head of our family," Singh said. When asked about the agenda of the session, he said that it is for the Business Advisory Committee of the assembly to decide.Regarding seating arrangement as per social distancing norms in the assembly, the minister said that it was for the speaker to look after. Targeting the BJP, the minister said that the party has made it a prestige issue.  "They want to topple the state government and have made it a prestige issue," he said."The BJP stands exposed. They are changing their statements," he said.After Rajasthan, the minister said the party wants to target West Bengal, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. The Rajasthan governor has returned cabinet recommendations for calling the assembly session twice with some points. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-cabinet-sticks-to-its-demand-for-holding-state-assembly-session-119056

These are our natural wealth. This is our nature. India today has 70 per cent of the world’s tiger population.“We are in a leading position and ready to work with all the 13 tiger-range countries in their training and capacity-building… in their actual management of tiger reserves and their nurturing. India will take a leadership role,” he said.Javadekar said at the same time, this had happened despite India’s physical constrains. “This is not only about tigers, we have more than 30,000 elephants, more than 500 lions, more than 3,000 single-horn rhinos, thousands of crocodiles and dolphins… We have large amount of flora and fauna, which we are proud of, our effort is to improve it further,” he said.The Minister said despite India having only 2.6 per cent of the world landmass and 4 per cent of fresh rainwater resources, 16 per cent of human population and 16 per cent of cattle population, it had 8 per cent of the world’s biodiversity. “This is India’s real strength and soft power. This is because of our ability to coexist and care for it.”India, he said, had also decided to take the ambitious water and fodder augmentation in forests using technology.“It will give complete details of forest area where water conservation can be done so that water base increases through recharge; ample grass and fodder are available, there is good prey base and there are more tigers and all kinds of wildlife. It will also reduce the incidents of man-animal conflict,” he said.The heads of the governments of tiger-range countries had at St0 Petersburg, Russia, in 2010 resolved to double tiger numbers across their global range by 2022 by signing the St Petersburg declaration on tiger conservation. At the meeting, it was also decided to celebrate July 29 as Global Tiger Day to spread and generate awareness on tiger conservation.India now has nearly 70 per cent of the global tiger population and 50 tiger reserves. None of them are of poor quality, according to JavadekarRecently, India’s tiger census of 2018 entered the Guinness Book of World Records for being the largest ever camera-trap wildlife survey conducted anywhere in the world. According to the survey, the country was home to an estimated 2,967 tigers. Of all the big cats, 2,461 (around 83 per cent) have been photo-captured.Apart from setting a new world standard, the results validated India’s efforts in tiger conservation. The country’s tiger population increased by roughly one-third, from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,927 in 2018 following efforts that included better corridors between isolated pockets of tiger territory, reduced poaching and building up prey numbers through habitat restoration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-take-lead-in-capacity-building-management-of-tigers-in-range-nations-119039

I didn't realise the meme also portrayed an image connected to the majestic Hindu faith. As soon as I realised it from comments of our Indian friends, I have removed the tweet. I apologise," Yair said in a tweet.Attorney General Avichai Mandelbit's face was superimposed over that of a tiger accompanying the goddess under a caption that said, "know your place you despicable people".The Twitter users were split in their reaction over the post with some Indians harshly criticising him for the offensive tweet while others giving him the benefit of doubt and attributing it to general ignorance about the Hindu faith in the West.Yair, who has been at the centre of several controversies, was appreciated by some Israelis for "showing courage in apologising for his mistake", but was also condemned in equal measure by others for "being irresponsible".Earlier this month, Yair issued an apology to journalist Dana Weiss for appearing to suggest the top news anchor had attained her position through sexual favours, according to a local media report.Prime Minister Netanyahu's trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes opened in May in a Jerusalem court.He has said that the allegations are baseless and that he is a victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/israeli-pm-netanyahus-son-apologises-as-tweet-offends-indians-didnt-realise-it-portrayed-majestic-hindu-faith-119038
28-07-2020||New Delhi||Mayawati puts Congress, Ashok Gehlot on notice||Amid uncertainty gripping Congress government in Rajasthan, BSP supremo and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on Tuesday put Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on notice, saying her party will move the Supreme Court against his illegal act of breaking away her party's six MLAs and merging them with the Congress."The BSP could have moved the court earlier too, but waited for an opportune time to teach Congress a lesson," Mayawati said, adding her party will also approach the Supreme Court if need be."Ashok Gehlot will be squarely responsible if the Congress government falls during a trust vote."The BSP had earlier moved the Election Commission questioning the legality of the merger of the party MLAs with the Congress. Mayawati said the Commission did not pursue the matter saying that it was out of its jurisdiction.BSP chief's threat to move the Court was not only against the impugned merger of her party MLAs in the Congress but also about the independence of their voting rights after becoming turncoats.She said BSP has issued Whip directing all its six MLAs who have merged with the Congress to vote against the Gehlot government during a trust vote."The BSP had extended unconditional support of its MLAs to the Gehlot government in Rajasthan after the last Assembly election to keep the communal forces at bay.""But with an evil design to harm the BSP, Gelot broke away the MLAs and subsequently merged them with the Congress illegally."The Gelot government is facing an existential crisis following the banner of revolt raised by 19 Congress MLAs under the leadership of Sachin Pilot.The Congress has attributed the rebellion to a conspiracy of the BJP and Pilot camp to topple its government.Mayawati said that it was ironical that Congress was now crying foul that its MLAs have been poached in Rajasthan in violation of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. But it committed the same crime against the BSP in violation of the same Constitutional provisions it was invoking."The Congress stole the mandate of the people because the six BSP MLAs in question had won by defeating the Congress nominees," Mayawati said.The BSP leadership's grouse is also that the Gehlot as Chief Minister had "betrayed" the BSP for then the second time.In 2008, the BSP had similarly extended support of all its six MLAs to his government. Then, too, the MLAs were weaned away and merged with the Congress.Referring to Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati said the law and order have collapsed and suggested to Yogi Adityanath government to take a leaf out from her four governments concerning maintaining law and order."Criminals presently run the show in Uttar Pradesh," Mayawati said.She urged the Centre and the states governments to improve the conditions of the quarantine centres regarding COVID patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-puts-congress-ashok-gehlot-on-notice-119035

There was a man, a medical practitioner, who too was infected with coronavirus and was sharing the ward with her," Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Noida, Ranvijay Singh said.He said the woman alleged molestation and upon being informed the police immediately lodged an FIR and initiated a probe into the matter."There appears to be some irresponsibility on part of the hospital too. We are communication with the medical departments to check whether the patients were being kept in accordance with the guidelines," Singh said.He said the accused is still in isolation but the police will reach out for his statement following due protocols of COVID-19."All necessary action will be taken as per the truth that will emerge after a thorough investigation," Singh added.

There is one vacancy for a peon's post in NADA," Sain told PTI from his Sonepat home.Dinesh's elder brothers have looked after him and his family till now, but he says that time is running out and that is why he is desperate to get the NADA job."The age limit for normal people in this job (peon) is 25 and for the PH category (Physically handicapped), it is 35 years. So, this is my last chance to get a government job," Dinesh, who had earlier appeared for peon's interview at district court, said.His only regret these days is the fact that despite playing for the country, fame and money eluded him."One of my legs has been affected by polio since birth. But my passion for cricket never made me realise I am disabled. In the 2015 edition of a five-nation tournament in Bangladesh (India won the 2019 edition in England), I was highest wicket-taker with 8 wickets from four games. I got two against Pakistan," he recollected.In fact, Dinesh travelled to England in 2019 with the team that emerged champion but as an official.They didn't include me in the squad but asked me to join so that I could guide the new boys. There is so much of talent where physical disadvantage is not an impediment. But then who will look after us?" was his angst filled question.As he concluded, Dinesh said that if he gets the job at NADA, it will help him remain attached to the game, mentoring young players."I will not play cricket anymore but I need to feed my family and I want to remain attached to the game," he said.

28-07-2020||United Nations||Nitrogen dioxide levels fell by more than 70% during COVID-19 lockdown in New Delhi: UN||Levels of nitrogen dioxide fell by more than 70 per cent during the lockdown in New Delhi, a UN policy brief said on Tuesday, warning that the environmental gains could be temporary if the cities re-open without policies to prevent air pollution and promote de-carbonisation.The UN Secretary-General's Policy Brief on 'COVID-19 in an Urban World' said that with an estimated 90 per cent of all reported COVID-19 cases, urban areas have become the epicentre of the pandemic. It also pointed out that several new scientific studies suggest that poor air quality is correlated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates.The size of their populations and their high level of global and local interconnectivity make them particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus.The brief said that while pollution and greenhouse gas emissions have fallen sharply during the pandemic when countries halted their economies to contain the spread of the virus, these environmental gains are expected to be temporary if economies reopen without policies in place that prevent air pollution and promote decarbonisation."Levels of nitrogen dioxide fell by more than 70 per cent during the lockdown in New Delhi (India), 40 per cent in urban areas in China, 20 per cent in Belgium and Germany, and 19–40 per cent in different areas of the US," the brief said.A small increase in fine particulate matter has been associated with an 8 per cent increase and up to 21.4 per cent increase in death rates in the US and the Netherlands, respectively, it said.New evidence also points to impacts on pregnant women and newborn babies as well as maternal mortality, particularly among populations already facing socio-economic stress due to marginalisation.On COVID-19 outbreaks in informal settlements, the brief said that in Mumbai, as of mid-April 2020, 30 per cent of designated containment zones — which are areas with large outbreaks — were in slums, while 60 per cent were within 100 metres of an informal settlement, it said.In his message, UN chief Antonio Guterres said urban areas were ground zero of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 90 per cent of the reported cases."Cities are bearing the brunt of the crisis – many with strained health systems, inadequate water and sanitation services, and other challenges. This is especially the case in poorer areas, where the pandemic has exposed deeply rooted inequalities," he said."We must act with the same urgency and resolve to transform cities and address the climate and pollution crises. Now is the time to rethink and reshape the urban world," he said.The brief said that recognising the differentiated exposure to risks and impacts, some governments have designed tailored measures for vulnerable groups. It cited the example of Pune where a collective of waste-pickers has been distributing gloves and masks to informal waste-pickers."In many cities, informal waste-pickers make an important contribution to waste management but are at heightened risk during the pandemic without adequate protection,” it said.The brief noted that urban density does not inevitably correlate with higher virus transmission. Cities are largely vulnerable as a result of choices about how they are organised and how people live, work and travel in and around them.The pandemic has also exposed deep inequalities in how people live in cities, and how cities serve their residents. The already vulnerable have suffered most - 24 per cent of the world's urban population live in slums and less than half the global population can access open public spaces within 400 metres' walking distance of their homes.The UN chief said the policy brief recommends that there is a need to ensure that all phases of the pandemic response tackle inequalities and long-term development deficits and safeguard social cohesion."We must prioritise those who are the most vulnerable in our cities, including guaranteeing safe shelter for all and emergency housing to those without homes," he said, adding that access to water and sanitation is also vital.He said the inadequate state of public services in many cities requires urgent attention, particularly in informal settlements."Nearly one-quarter of the world's urban population lives in slums. Local governments are already taking action – from prohibiting evictions during the crisis to putting in place new clean water stations in the most vulnerable areas,” the UN chief said.There is a need also to strengthen the capacities of local governments and this requires decisive action – and deeper cooperation between local and national authorities, he said."Stimulus packages and other relief should support tailored responses and boost local government capacity," Guterres said.The brief also recommends that nations must pursue a green, resilient and inclusive economic recovery."By focusing on high ecological transformation and job creation, stimulus packages can steer growth towards a low-carbon, resilient pathway and advance the Sustainable Development Goals," he said.

In 2013, an asteroid heavier than the Eiffel Tower exploded over central Russia, leaving more than 1,000 people injured from its shockwave.The two girls, who hail from the western Indian city of Surat, discovered the object as part of an asteroid search campaign conducted by SPACE India along with the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC), a NASA-affiliated citizen scientist group.IASC Director J. Patrick Miller confirmed the discovery, according to an email from him to the girls seen by Reuters.The girls used specialised software to analyse the images snapped by the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii, and made the discovery in June, SPACE India said.The institute is among the few private space education initiatives in India, a country known for championing low-cost space technology that has spurred missions to the moon and Mars. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/surat-girls-stumble-upon-asteroid-hlv2514-set-to-pass-earth-119017

28-07-2020||United Nations||Young Indian activist named by UN chief to new advisory group on climate change||Archana Soreng, a climate activist from India, has been named by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to his new advisory group comprising young leaders who will provide perspectives and solutions to tackle the worsening climate crisis, as the global body mobilises action as part of the COVID-19 recovery efforts.Soreng joins six other young climate leaders, aged between 18 and 28 years, who have been named by Guterres to his new Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change.Soreng is “experienced in advocacy and research, and she is working to document, preserve, and promote traditional knowledge and cultural practices of indigenous communities”, the UN said in a statement on Monday.“Our ancestors have been protecting the forest and nature over the ages through their traditional knowledge and practices. Now it is on us to be the front runners in combating the climate crisis,” said 24-year-old Soreng, who has studied regulatory governance from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Mumbai and is the former TISS Students Union President.The young activists will advise the UN chief regularly on accelerating global action and ambition to tackle the worsening climate crisis.The announcement marks a new effort by the United Nations to bring more young leaders into decision-making and planning processes, as the UN works to mobilise climate action as part of the COVID-19 recovery efforts.“We are in a climate emergency. We do not have the luxury of time,” Guterres said in a video announcing the establishment of the advisory group.“We need urgent action now – to recover better from COVID-19, to confront injustice and inequality and address climate disruption,” he said.Guterres said young people are on the front lines of climate action, showing nations and leaders what bold leadership looks like.“That is why I am launching my Youth Advisory Group on climate change today – to provide perspectives, ideas and solutions that will help us scale up climate action,” the UN chief said.The members of the Secretary-General’s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change represent the diverse voices of young people from all regions as well as small island states.They will offer perspectives and solutions on climate change, from science to community mobilsation, from entrepreneurship to politics, and from industry to conservation, the UN said.The initial seven members of the group have been chosen to give frank and fearless advice to the Secretary-General, at a time of growing urgency to hold government and corporate leaders to account on climate action.The other selected members of the group are climate activist Nisreen Elsaim of Sudan, Fiji’s Ernest Gibson, the co-coordinator for 350 Fiji, a regional youth-led climate change network, young economist Vladislav Kaim of Moldova who is committed to ensuring green and decent jobs for youth.Sophia Kianni of the United States who has helped organise nationwide strikes and is the founder of international nonprofit Climate Cardinals, founder and coordinator of Generation Climate Europe and spokesperson for Youth and Environment Europe, Nathan Metenier of France and lawyer and human rights defender Paloma Costa of Brazil.The establishment of the group builds on last year’s successful Youth Climate Summit – the first time a Secretary-General has convened a summit for young people entirely devoted to climate action.The summit brought over 1,000 young climate champions together from more than 140 countries to share their solutions on the global stage and deliver a clear message to world leaders: we must act now to confront the climate crisis. The initiative is also aligned with the Secretary-General’s vision for the UN Youth Strategy, launched in September 2018.

Movements of such terrorists had also been seen along the LoC near Samba and Rajouri-Poonch in Jammu, they added.Even as security forces have reasonably been successful in stemming infiltration bids along the LoC in Kupwara and south of Pir Panjal, sources in the security establishment said the armed forces were aware that they couldn’t lower the guard both in Jammu and the Kashmir Valley, particularly when they have been alerted “ISI and terror groups like Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed are waiting for an opportunity to look for gaps in the security grid to disrupt the peace in the Valley”.In view of the heightened threat, the security agencies have been asked to remain on a high vigil, particularly on Eid, Rakshabandhan and Independence Day. Officials in the security establishment said two terrorists were killed at the LoC on July 11 while attempting to infiltrate. Three terrorists were injured on June 30 in a similar attempt. Both attempts were made from Pakistani posts, Chakpatra or Tariq under Mandal sector (Leepa Valley), opposite Tungdhar sector, they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/300-terrorists-waiting-to-cross-over-intel-118767

The deal for 24 copters was announced in February. These will form the front-end of tracking the growing presence of Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean.William L Blair, Vice-President and Chief Executive, Lockheed Martin India, told The Tribune, “The sale is under the foreign military sales route. The US is working to accelerate the delivery timing. We will be able to do it and intend to start deliveries early next year.”On being asked whether India has an urgency to get the copters due to the ongoing tension with China and resultant pressure in the Indian Ocean, Blair said, “I share the same sense of urgency. The contract was signed in February. This will be a record speed for delivery.”US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a joint press conference this year to announce the copter deal.Militarily, an anti-submarine warfare-capable helicopter like MH 60-R, with its sea-dunking sonars, is a preferred platform for detecting a submarine. The Indian requirements comprise spare engines, specific missiles and Mk-54 torpedoes among others.Blair added that his company was looking to move the wing assembly of its famous F-16 fighter jets to Hyderabad. “We have started tooling (at the plant) and later this year we should be on track,” he added.On progress, Kurt Knust, who heads the F-21 fighter jet programme for Lockheed Martin, said, “We have done desktop analysis on 400 companies and on-ground analysis with 200 companies.” The F-21, a single-engine jet, is in the race for the 114 jet tender of the IAF.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-to-deliver-sub-hunting-helicopters-early-next-year-118768
