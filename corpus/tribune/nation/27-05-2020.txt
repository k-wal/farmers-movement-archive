I request all not to believe in this deliberate propaganda. The number of forest fire incidents in the state this year are far lower than even last year,” he tweeted.The Head of Forest Force, Jairaj, also called such pictures misleading. Forest fire incidents this year have been fewer than last year and the situation was well within control, he said.Meanwhile, the DG, Law and Order, Ashok Kumar said stern action will be taken against those who had spread such a propaganda which is “far from truth”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/forest-fire-pictures-from-uttarakhand-false-says-cm-90742

Its beneficiaries ought not to be the extraordinary persons but all deserving individuals,” he said, describing delay in disposal of mercy petition by the President as a “big problem”.The petitioner said in some cases due to prolonged delay in disposal of mercy petitions, convicts had taken the benefit and got death penalty converted into life imprisonment.“The victims and their families feel cheated in such cases. For effective disposal of the mercy petition in a time-bound manner and for transparency therein it is must that specific procedure and guidelines for disposing the mercy petitions within a time bound period, are immediately framed and implemented,” it said.Tripathi has sought a direction to the Centre to fix a time-frame within which a mercy petition has to be decided and “the consequences of not disposing of the mercy petitions within such time frame”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-guidelines-for-time-bound-disposal-of-mercy-pleas-90737

27-05-2020||Hyderabad||TDP sets trend for online political conclaves||COVID-19 has forced politicians and political parties to discover new ways to stay relevant.After being threatened to be quarantined and punished for lockdown violation, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu left nothing to chance and launched his two-day annual party meeting “Mahanadu” from Mangalagiri over videoconference.Over 14,000 party cadres are participating in the meeting through video conferencing.The “Mahanadu” is organised each year to coincide with the birth anniversary of the party’s founder-president NT Rama Rao on May 28 every year.Last year the party kept a low profile and did not organise the annual conference as it suffered a debacle in the general elections winning just 23 seats in the 175-seat Andhra Pradesh Assembly.The TDP has targeted Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for what most participants in the conference termed as “misrule” during the last one year.He alleged that democracy is in danger in the state due to rule of anarchy. He called upon the TDP cadres in both the Telugu states to strengthen the party organisation and continue the struggle for the party’s ideals. Naidu claimed that the TDP’s struggle in Andhra Pradesh is to save democracy.The TDP has adhered to social distancing norms and its tech-savvy Chandrababu Naidu decided to use Zoom, a video conferencing app, to address the participants in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, besides workers settled abroad.Arrangements have been made on a big screen to telecast live so that another 10,000 people can watch the show. This is the first major move by the TDP to hold a conclave this big after a debacle in the 2019 polls.Naidu, the party’s Andhra Pradesh unit president Kala Venkat Rao, some politburo members and key leaders were present at the TDP headquarters in Mangalagiri while all other leaders and workers were taking part in the deliberations from their houses through Zoom.Naidu told the viewers, “Many laid down their lives while others were implicated in false cases. They suffered physically, mentally and financially. Their sacrifices will not go in vain,” he said.Pointing out that TDP was in power for 22 years and in opposition for 16 years, Naidu said whether in power or in opposition, it always worked for the people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tdp-sets-trend-for-online-political-conclaves-90728

However, the goggles confirming to prescribed EN/BIS specifications can be reused after proper disinfection,” the ministry said.The purpose of the “advisory on re-processing and re-use of eye-protection goggles” is to enable individuals to reuse goggles, thus allowing an extended use without the risk of contracting infection, it said.According to the standard operating procedures for reuse detailed in the advisory, the kitting of the PPEs with goggles will be done away with and all goggles that conform to prescribed EN/BIS specifications will be re-used after disinfection.Reprocessing and reuse of goggles must be done only when it is dedicated to each individual (write name over the band) and reprocessing must be done after every use before using it again.Manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfection of goggles should be adhered to.If such instructions are not available, goggles can be cleaned and disinfected while wearing gloves.“Clean goggles with soap/detergent and water and then immerse in 1 per cent freshly prepared sodium hypochlorite for 10 minutes. Wash/wipe the inside and outside of goggles with clean water to remove residue. Air dry completely on a clean flat surface or by hanging in clean place or use clean tissue papers/gauge to dry it,” the SOPs stated.They should be stored in a paper bag/in a clean area to avoid recontamination. Eye protection must be discarded if damaged/rendered optically non-clear on repeated usage.Goggles may be issued to each healthcare worker who will decontaminate them after every use and they should be disinfected by users and re-used at least five times each, whereby one pair of goggles will suffice for six days.   “They may use them rationally till their transparency decreases or they get damaged. The ratio of issue of goggles to coverall is recommended at 1:6,” the advisory said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ppe-goggles-confirming-to-bis-specification-can-be-reused-health-ministry-90726

27-05-2020||New Delhi||Worst locust outbreak seen in a quarter of a century example of global warming, say environmentalists||Like ‘Super Cyclone’ Amphan, the “worst locust outbreak seen in a quarter of a century” in India is yet another example of global warming and climate change, say agricultural and environmental experts.While officials claim otherwise, they are also slamming the government for its unpreparedness or slow response to the situation, despite a timely warning by the FAO. “Climate change is facilitating breeding and movement of locusts. Untimely rains and increased cyclonic activity have helped them breed faster. December had never seen a locust attack but in 2019 there was one. The warning was available well in advance and there was enough time for India to be prepared,” says agricultural policy expert Devinder Sharma.Environmentalist Soumya Dutta says climate change driven disasters, almost all of which were predicted to happen in increasing frequency and intensity, have started “over-topping the predictions”. Starting with the pandemic of the century in the form of COVID-19, the ‘extremely severe cyclone’ Amphan that devastated several parts of south Bengal and north Odisha and the “biggest in a quarter century locust swarm threatening Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh”, are the proofs, he said.“Even though locust swarm had been forewarned by the UN with clear messages to Iran, Pakistan and India preparations by Indian authorities fell far short of needed. What measures they took is not known, or of doubtful authenticity,” says Dutta. Apart from issuing advisories, talking to pesticides producers to start producing more malathion and asking Iran and Pakistan for coordination, Dutta says most essential thing Indian and Rajasthan governments could have done is eliminating them as it entered Indian territories. “There are hundreds of kilometres of desert, arid and semiarid land these swarms crossed before coming into crop fields of Rajasthan. Timely aerial spraying on the swarms, by small aircraft or heavy drones could have drastically cut down these swarms in the desert areas itself,” he said.Several locust waves are expected until early July due to spring breeding in southern Iran and southwest Pakistan.Locusts thrive in wet conditions, and outbreaks often follow floods and cyclones. Heavy rain leads to growth of vegetation in arid areas, providing locusts with conditions needed to develop and reproduce. The 2019 North Indian Ocean Cyclone season was the most active ever recorded. Besides India also had an unusual monsoon season and an unusual number of low pressure systems linked to ocean circulation pattern called Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD).  The positive phase of the IOD in 2019 was the strongest for six decades, say environmentalists.  As greenhouse gases continue to heat the ocean and the atmosphere, extreme events are predicted to become increasingly common.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/worst-locust-outbreak-seen-in-a-quarter-of-a-century-example-of-global%C2%A0warming-say-environmentalists-90723

After an areal tour of the affected area in the company of Banerjee and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, Modi announced an immediate advance relief of one thousand crore.Giving the impression that the bitter exchanges between him and Mamata were a thing of the past, Modi even praised Mamata during the short visit. The PM said Mamata could provide effective leadership to the dual challenge posed by the devastation by the cyclone on the one hand and the Covid-19 pandemic on the other.Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee said that a political game was being played by sending trainloads of migrant workers to the state at a time when the government was busy in relief and rehabilitation work.“Where will we keep these migrant labourers for institutional quarantine? We are facing a very tough situation and we need time to tackle it, Banerjee said.“They (BJP) can disturb me politically, but why are they causing harm to the state? West Bengal is facing such a major disaster. It will lead to a spike in COVID-19 cases. I appeal to the Prime Minister to intervene,” Banerjee added.The West Bengal CM said she was told that Maharashtra government was informed about the trains at two in the morning. It would have been better if the trains had started from Mumbai for West Bengal after consultation with West Bengal government, Banerjee said.Around 25 per cent of those returning to the state are found to be COVID-19 positive. Many of them are coming from hotspot areas in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the Chief Minister said.Eleven trains from Mumbai carrying migrant workers are scheduled to arrive in West Bengal today. Seventeen more Shramik Special trains are slated to arrive in the state tomorrow.Earlier on May 23 West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha wrote to Railway Board chairman VK Yadav to not send any Shramik Special train to the state till May 26 in view of the devastation by the cyclone.Citing the letter, West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said trains had started arriving in West Bengal in accordance with the deadline set by the state government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-cm-mamata-appeals-to-modi-to-go-slow-on-migrant-trains-90720

27-05-2020||Chandigarh||IIT Roorkee launches study to search for anti-virals against COVID-19||As cases of COVID-19 infections in India continue to emerge and a vaccine to treat it is still awaited, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, has launched a study to identify structure-based potential anti-virals against SARS-CoV2.In this study, a computer-based high throughput virtual screening approach will be used to identify anti-viral molecules from different compound libraries that will be experimentally validated for anti-viral potential.The Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, is also collaborating in the research for experimental testing and evaluation of the antiviral efficacy of the identified antiviral molecules. The study, being supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), is being funded under the ‘Intensification of Research in High Priority Areas’ scheme. The task requires investigators to search for small molecule inhibitors targeting some of the most important viral replication enzymes.These enzymes are viral proteases and RNA dependent RNA polymerase which are encoded by the genetic material of viral pathogens. Protease is an enzyme which breaks down proteins while polymerase is an enzyme which brings about the formation of a particular polymer.The investigators have already performed the preliminary work by high-throughput virtual screening approach to examine the binding affinity of FDA approved drugs targeting the viral protease Mpro. Using structure-based approach for drug repurposing, this study would pave the way to identify the molecules that bind to Mpro active site, and their potential can be used as antiviral molecules against COVID-19."The hunt for new drugs, including repurposed drug candidates, is getting a boost by in silico approaches, which allude to identifying the potential antiviral molecules based on computer simulation of their molecular structures. This approach is expected to be much faster and accurate in selection of potential drugs and vaccines for experimental and clinical testing, according to a statement issued by the DST.SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. Across the globe research activities by various agencies are focused towards the identification of clinically effective vaccine or specific anti-viral drugs or drug repurposing strategies to combat the COVID-19 infections either in the form of prevention or treatment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-roorkee-launches-study-to-search-for-anti-virals-against-covid-19-90718

27-05-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses pilot’s plea against allowing AI to fly non-schedule flights with middle seats occupied||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a pilot’s plea seeking modification of its order which allowed Air India to fill the middle seats while operating its non-scheduled flights to bring back Indians stranded abroad up to June 6.An intervention application was filed by Deven Kanani seeking modification of May 25 order on the ground that there has been spike in number of COVID-19 cases and even if a single flight (international /domestic) operates with full occupancy then many other passengers and crew are likely to get infected.The top court said it does not want to add to the confusion after having passed order earlier this week.A Bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishkesh Roy, while refusing to modify its order said that whatever they (Centre and Air India) have done, howsoever bad it might be, let that interim arrangement continue for ten days.Advocate Abhilash Panickar, appearing for the pilot, said that DGCA guidelines on social distancing should be followed and middle seats in the aircraft should be kept vacant.The Bench asked Panickar to approach the Bombay High Court if he wanted to raise any other issue related to the matter.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and Air India, said that an expert committee has been appointed to look into the matter.He said that health of citizens is paramount and government would take every possible step to protect them.The Bench said that it trusts the expert committee and hope that it would take into all relevant considerations.It told the petitioner that the court has asked the Centre and Air India to bring back the stranded Indians and they are doing it.Now, let the High Court decide the issue finally, the top court said and gave the liberty to the pilot to withdraw the application.The counsel for the petitioner then agreed to withdraw the application.The pilot, on whose plea the high court has sought replies from the Centre and Air India, said in his application before the top court that he is seeking modification of May 25 order as it was an ex-parte order obtained by suppression and misrepresentation.On May 25, the top court had allowed Air India to keep the middle seats occupied while operating its non-scheduled flights to bring back Indians stranded abroad up to June 6 while observing that the government should be more worried about the health of citizens rather than the health of commercial airlines.It had said that after June 6, Air India will operate its non-scheduled flights in accordance with the interim order to be passed by the Bombay High Court.The Centre and Air India had moved the apex court challenging the interim order of the High Court by which it had asked the national carrier to operate its non-scheduled flights by keeping the middle seats vacant.“We are of the considered view that the petitioner—Air India should be allowed to operate the non-scheduled flights with the middle seats booking up to June 6, 2020. However, after that the Air India will operate non-scheduled flights in accordance with the interim order to be passed by the Bombay High Court thereafter,” it had said.The top court had said that it would consider it necessary for the High Court to arrive at a prima facie finding regarding the safety and health of the passengers qua the COVID-19 virus, whether the flight is a scheduled flight or a non-scheduled flight.“We make it clear that the Director General of Civil Aviation is free to alter any norms he may consider necessary during the pendency of the matter in the interest of public health and safety of the passengers rather than of commercial considerations,” the apex court had said in its order, while disposing of the appeal.

At least three dozen members of Madhesh parties also sought their pound of flesh forcing the ruling party’s managers to press the issue at some other opportune time.India and Nepal re-opened their differences on a triangle of land bordering China about six months back when New Delhi published a political map to show the change in countours of Jammu & Kashmir from a single state to two UTs of J&K and Ladakh.Nepal felt the new map seemed to have included three areas, which were its territory.The issue again became hot early this month when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a blacktopped road to Lipulekh pass that seemed to traverse areas claimed by Nepal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-puts-on-hold-changes-on-map-does-not-include-three-disputed-areas-with-india-90710
27-05-2020||New Delhi||‘Immunity passports' for COVID-19 may lead to discrimination, intentional infections: Scientists||As countries scramble to stem the spread of COVID-19, the debate over “immunity passports” is gathering steam with some governments pushing for documents that certify a person immune and several experts saying the claim would not just be specious but also lead to discrimination and “intentional” cases.With a vaccine several months, if not a year, away, the proposal for a document to certify that an individual has been infected and therefore immune to SARS-CoV-2, which causes the infection, is centre-stage of discussion as the world navigates its way out of the pandemic.Looking for ways out of the restrictive physical distancing measures imposed to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, several governments, including Chile, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US, have suggested the use of 'immunity passports'.Individuals in possession of an 'immunity passport' could be exempt from physical restrictions and may return to work, school and daily life.“An 'immunity passport' is a certification that would mark an individual immune to SARS-CoV-2 infection,” virologist Upasana Ray told PTI.The rationale behind certifying people immune is the production and presence of antibodies against the virus, Ray, a senior scientist at the Kolkata-based CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), explained.India, however, has been more cautious in its approach.“There is no evidence yet that a person infected with COVID-19 cannot get the infection again. There are reports from South Korea of re-infections, so providing 'immunity passports' on the basis of SARS-COv-2 antibodies in the blood isn't feasible,” Manoh Murhekar, director of ICMR's National Institute of Epidemiology in Chennai, told PTI.However, India allows travel for those who have the Aarogya Setu app installed on their phones—showing a green band declaring the person safe. This is based purely on self-declaration.As cases of the novel coronavirus cross 5.6 million with more than 3,50,000 fatalities, the WHO has said there is no evidence to suggest that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.In addition to the technical complexities, 'immunity passports' also pose regulatory and ethical concerns, said experts.“This idea of 'immunity passports' can lead to great difficulty in administrative implementation, and is likely to be accompanied by widespread abuse in a variety of ways, especially for poor and underprivileged groups,” said immunologist Satyajit Rath.Writing in The Lancet, Alexandra L Phelan from Georgetown University Medical Center in the US noted that “immunity passports” would impose an artificial restriction on who can and can't participate in social, civic, and economic activities.This might also create a perverse incentive for individuals to seek out infection.This will especially apply to people who are unable to afford a period of workforce exclusion, compounding existing gender, race, ethnicity, and nationality inequalities, he said.“Such behaviour would pose a health risk not only to these individuals but also to the people they come into contact with," he wrote.In countries without universal access to healthcare, those most incentivised to seek out infection might also be those unable or understandably hesitant to seek medical care due to cost and discriminatory access, Phelan noted.Adding to the discussion, IICB's Ray asked what would happen to those negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.There is no evidence that herd immunity will develop, she said, adding that the duration it would last is unknown even if it somehow does.Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections."Shall we wait for these people to get infected and attain immunity to be able to get certified? This might also lead to discrimination,” she added.There is no evidence that all individuals would produce good quality antibodies, or that the neutralising antibodies that would protect them from re-infections.She added that antibodies just like other proteins may not persist in the body for long.The IICB scientist explained that SARS-CoV-2 has many variants which differ at the genetic level.Another problem with 'immunity passports', Ray noted, is that mere production of antibodies does not imply they can neutralise or stop the virus from gaining entry in the host.Rath, from the National Institute of Immunology (NII) in New Delhi, agreed with Ray, saying that while the technical idea of 'immunity passports' is feasible in principle, there are many reasons why it is currently difficult in practice.“A major part of the problem is to do with the technical issues involved with measuring the relevant 'immunity',” Rath told PTI.He said there are no validated tests to identify the actual levels of detectable immunity in the form of antibody amounts or the exact kinds of immunity showing strong enough correlations with real protection against infection to be usable as 'immunity passport' thresholds.Finding and validating these thresholds is likely to take time-consuming research, in part because these levels seem to be quite variable, Rath explained.“Such work is ongoing, but I have not yet seen any substantive results. Further, how long these threshold levels are maintained over time will quite possibly differ from person to person, and therefore, there will be yet another problem for these 'immunity passports' in terms of the length of their validity before they will need re-testing and 'renewal',” he said.Another Indian virologist, who did not want to be named, highlighted that not much is known about the false positivity in an antibody test. It may depend on the geographical area and the prevalence of other existing diseases, he added.“This means a person carrying ‘immunity passport' may not have protective immunity. So it may not be a good practice to issue ‘immunity passports' based on some rapid tests,” the virologist noted.Considering the possibility of the novel coronavirus evolving even within a country, Ray said, re-infection with a different variant will not be surprising.“Travelling to a different country or continent would also increase the probability of getting challenged by a different virus type against which the person might not be able to produce neutralising antibodies,” she explained.“Today's asymptomatic might become symptomatic under challenge with a different virus variant later, or if such people travel to a country where some other variant is dominating,” she said.The scientists noted that Instead of depending solely on naturally obtained immunity, it is better to invest time, effort and money to develop carefully designed vaccine candidates that show cross neutralising properties, and are applicable universally.

The current wind direction increases the chances of this happening.Swarms of locusts entered Rajasthan from Pakistan last month and then spread to other western states. Several districts in Rajasthan were affected and recently a swarm was spotted in a residential area in Jaipur.A swarm had earlier attacked some parts of Jhansi district ion May 22 and 24 but an already alert administration, with the help of local people, eliminated over a half of it.As part of preparations for another wave, two fire brigade vehicles with insecticide have been deployed in all four tehsils of the UP district.In addition, six more vehicles are ready at the district headquarter, Katiyar said.Ten municipal employees with two insecticide spraying machines have been posted in every block, Katiyar said.He said the movement of locusts will depend on the wind direction.Going by the present direction, the locusts could enter Jhansi district from Moth and Samthar and then move towards Jalaun and Hamirpur districts in Bundelkhand region.Locusts don’t target animals or humans but can devastate crop fields.On Tuesday, the district administration had asked people to alert it they spot a swarm.“This is an emergency, and we need to remain vigilant. This swarm has come travelling through Iran, Pakistan, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh,” Jhansi DM Andra Vamsi had said.The DM said the administration had arranged sound systems to deter locusts. Farmers too have been advised to play loud music.The DM said a seven-member team from the Centre is touring Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to deal with the locusts.

It is not right to link the death to Corona right away." However, within hours, people in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas were in a state of panic.People have their own reasons for the panic—some logical, some illogical.Ashok Varma, a senior citizen said, "We have experienced heatwaves earlier too and deaths on such a large scale have never taken place earlier. Besides, who keeps water for bats? There is something wrong about this though the officials are trying to downplay the issue. How can 52 bats drop dead within an hour?" Vishesh Kumar Singh, who lives in Sahjanwa, insisted that the incident was linked to the Corona pandemic."I have seen on television that bats are responsible for the Coronavirus. Officials must take this seriously and act accordingly. We are all apprehensive because something like this has never happened before," he said firmly.Pandit Tripurari Mishra, a local pundit, meanwhile, added: "Bats are said to be representatives of Goddess Laxmi. We need to understand that mankind has been facing the fury of nature—be it the extreme cold and now the heatwave conditions, the coronavirus and the locust attack. The deaths of bats in such a large number is another ominous sign."Mishra said that people should organize 'pujas' in their homes to atone for their sins and seek divine intervention.Dhruv Narain Shahi, in whose orchard, the bats were found dead, however, refused to comment on the incident.

27-05-2020||Washington||Trump offers to 'mediate or arbitrate' between India and China||US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he was "ready, willing and able" to "mediate or arbitrate" the raging border dispute between India and China, amid the continuing standoff between the militaries of the two neighbours at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Trump previously offered to mediate between India and Pakistan, a proposal rejected by New Delhi which maintains that there is no role for any third party in bilateral issues."We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!" Trump said in an early morning tweet.We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!  The nearly 3,500-km-long LAC is the de-facto border between India and China.Several areas along the LAC in Ladakh and North Sikkim have witnessed major military build-up by both the Indian and Chinese armies recently, in a clear signal of escalating tension and hardening of respective positions by the two sides even two weeks after they were engaged in two separate face-offs.India has said the Chinese military was hindering normal patrolling by its troops along the LAC in Ladakh and Sikkim and strongly refuted Beijing's contention that the escalating tension between the two armies was triggered by trespassing of Indian forces across the Chinese side.The Ministry of External Affairs said all Indian activities were carried out on its side of the border, asserting that India has always taken a very responsible approach towards border management. At the same time, it said, India was deeply committed to protect its sovereignty and security."Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across the LAC in the Western sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate. Indian troops are fully familiar with the alignment of the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas and abide by it scrupulously," MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at an online media briefing last week. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trump-offers-to-mediate-or-arbitrate-between-india-and-china-90694
27-05-2020||New Delhi||States should come forward with Rs 20 lakh cr to battle COVID-19 disruptions: Gadkari||More liquidity is needed to boost economic activity following the coronavirus pandemic and states should come forward with Rs 20 lakh crore, while another Rs 10 lakh crore can be harnessed from public-private investment to fight the COVID-19 disruptions, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday.Gadkari said the economy is facing serious problems, businesses are being closed and unemployment is growing. All sections of the society, whether migrants, media, business persons or employees, are facing problems, but ultimately “we will win the economic war” and the “corona war”, he said.“More liquidity needs to be pumped in the market to boost the coronavirus-hit economy and states should come forward with Rs 20 lakh crore, while another Rs 10 lakh crore can be harnessed from public-private investment,” Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister Gadkari told PTI.He further noted that “these funds together with the Rs 20 lakh crore package already announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi would result in Rs 50 lakh crore liquidity in the market to battle the adverse impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on the economy”.The Centre had announced Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package, including Rs 8.01 lakh crore of liquidity measures announced by the Reserve Bank since March.The five-part stimulus package comprised Rs 5.94 lakh crore in the first tranche that provided credit line to small businesses, and support to shadow banks and electricity distribution companies, while, the second tranche included free food grain to the stranded migrant workers for two months and credit to farmers, totalling Rs 3.10 lakh crore.Spending on agriculture infrastructure and other measures for agriculture and allied sectors in the third tranche totalled to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, while the fourth and fifth tranches dealt mostly with structural reforms and totalled to Rs 48,100 crore.He further noted that work on national highways has been started on war-footing and the government plans to build highways worth Rs 15 lakh crore in the next two years.He said work has been resumed on almost 80 per cent of the projects.Meanwhile, in order to keep the national highways entrusted to NHAI in patchless and traffic-worthy condition, National Highway Authority of India has directed its regional officers and project directors to undertake maintenance of the national highways on top priority-basis considering ensuing monsoon season.The aim is to facilitate timely action and keep the highway stretches traffic-worthy ahead of the monsoon season, latest by June 30, 2020, he said.

We take the privacy of our users and the integrity of our services extremely seriously, and we are continuously monitoring for suspicious activities," a Truecaller spokesperson said in a statement."We were informed about a similar sale of data in May 2019. What they have here is likely the same dataset as before. It's easy for bad actors to compile multiple phone number databases and put a Truecaller stamp on it."By doing that, it lends some credibility to the data and makes it easier for them to sell. We urge the public and users not to fall prey to such bad actors whose primary motive is to swindle the people of their money," the spokesperson said.Online intelligence firm Cyble in a blog on Tuesday said that its researchers have "identified a reputable seller, who is selling 47.5 Million Indians Truecaller records for $1000. The data is from 2019.""Looking at the information itself, it has over 47.5 million records, and it includes interesting information such as phone number, carrier, name, gender, city, email, Facebook ID and others," said the blog post.On Wednesday, Cyble updated the blog to say that the same hacker has dropped another 600 million records for sale.

27-05-2020||New Delhi||Home delivery of essential medicines can be organised in containment zones: Health Minister||The Centre has suggested states and UTs to organise home delivery of essential medicines like calcium, iron/folic acid and zinc tablets besides contraceptives in containment zones to ensure maternal and child healthcare is not affected due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown.In its 'Guidance note on Provision of Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health Plus Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) services during and post COVID-19 pandemic' released on Wednesday, the ministry stressed that critical services for women, children and adolescent should be provided irrespective of their COVID-19 status."Under no circumstances should there be a denial of essential services," it highlighted."Home deliveries of essential medicines like IFA, Calcium, ORS, Zinc, contraceptives etc. can be organized in containment zones," it said.Campaign mode services like mass vitamin A prophylaxis, campaigns for Intensified Diarrhea Control Fortnight (IDCF), National Deworming Day (NDD) and test treat and talk (T3) camps for Anemia, can be organised on an alternative mechanism like through home delivery of essential services and commodities etc, based on the local situation, it said.In case the number of beneficiaries is more, then additional sessions/clinics could be organised.Community-based activities should have limited participation (5-10) at a time. The procedure site and all equipment should be sanitized properly before and after the clinics/sessions, it said.All COVID-19 suspects and positive cases should preferably be provided services at dedicated COVID-19 facility."COVID-19 testing is not mandatory for RMNCAH+N service. ICMR testing guidelines need to be followed," it said while underlining that teleconsultation services should be promoted at all levels to prevent overcrowding and reduce cross-infection.As far as immunisation services are concerned, birth dose vaccination should be continued at all health facilities as the beneficiaries are already in the facility.In other cases, providing vaccination doses will only be allowed outside the containment and buffer zones, and in green zones.An area enlisted as a ''containment or buffer zone'' should stop health facility-based sessions and outreach sessions, but if a beneficiary walks-into a health facility to get their child vaccinated, he/she should not be turned away."The COVID-19 pandemic has demanded additional attention of our healthcare system and it is vital that during this period the essential RMNCAH+N services are not affected," Union health secretary Preeti Sudan said in a letter to chief secretaries and health secretaries of states and UTs recently."Each state/UT needs to ensure access to these services in order to avert the increased risk of morbidities, unwanted pregnancies and mortalities thereby ensuring the health and well-being of mothers and children," she said.The guidance note issued on Wednesday elaborates that services such as antenatal and newborn care, immunisation, family planning and adolescent health among others are to be provided at different levels in accordance with the zonal categorization of containment zones, buffer zones and beyond these zones."India also has the largest adolescent and youth population. Therefore, in addition to the current priority for COVID-19 for health facilities and health workers, it is also vital that essential health services for a vulnerable population like this segment are continued during the pandemic," it said.

I have written a letter (and) the expectation is that mostly we will get permission,” Yediyurappa told reporters here.“Once we say temples can open, churches and mosques should also open; there will be no restrictions on them.”     “In our country law is same for everyone.... but for all this, the central government’s permission is required, we are waiting for it, our efforts are on in this direction,” he said.Yediyurappa’s statement came in response to questions raised in some sections about government announcement on opening temples but no mention being made about allowing mosques and churches also to reopen.Hindu religious institutions and charitable endowments (Muzrai) Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary on Tuesday had said that temples in the state that were closed for devotees for over two months due to COVID-19 induced lockdown will be opened from June 1.The standard operating procedure (SOP) is likely to be put in place, that needs to be followed at temples once opened for public.However, official sources had said that the decision to open temples for public will be subject to Centre’s guidelines on the next course of lockdown.The national lockdown enforced by the Centre to stem the spread of Coronavirus since March 25, and in its fourth leg now, is slated till May 31.On the lack of food and accommodation facilities for people coming from outside and distant places, without hotels, Yediyurappa said he has written a letter to the Prime Minister.Once permission is received, they will be allowed to open, he added.On the issue of re-opening of malls and cinemas, he said, “all those will depend on Centre’s permission, I cannot take a decision.”Responding to a question about financial package announced by his government not reaching many in distress yet, Yediyurappa merely said  “... we have done what needs to be done for all sections beyond our limits. Our work will please even the gods.”There has been some criticism of the government about the package announced, of the benefits not reaching many beneficiaries yet.The chief minister also said people should live with COVID-19 and steps need to be taken in this connection.

27-05-2020||New Delhi||Identify private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients for free or at nominal cost: SC to Centre||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to identify private hospitals where COVID-19-infected patients could get treatment for free or at a nominal cost.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, hearing the matter via video-conferencing, observed that there are private hospitals which have been given land either free of cost or at nominal rates and they should treat coronavirus-infected patients for free."You identify all those hospitals and find out," the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta."They have been given land either free of cost or at a very nominal rates. These charitable hospitals should treat patients for free," the bench observed and posted the matter for hearing after one week.Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the top court that this being a policy issue was required to be decided by the government.Mehta said he would file a response on the issue.The bench was hearing an application filed in a plea which has sought a direction for regulating the cost of treatment of COVID-19 at private hospitals across the country.The top court had on April 30 issued notice to the Centre and sought its response on the plea, filed by advocate Sachin Jain, which alleged that private hospitals are "commercially exploiting" patients suffering from coronavirus in this hour of crisis.The petition has said that the government should mandate private hospitals which are running on public land allotted at concessional rates or running under the category of charitable institutions to at least for the present, treat COVID-19 patients either pro bono publico (for public good) or on no-profit basis."The issue requires an urgent consideration of this court as many private hospitals are commercially exploiting the patients suffering from COVID-19 to make a fortune out of their miseries in the hour of national crisis," the plea has alleged.It has also sought a direction to the Centre to bear the cost of COVID-19 treatment at private hospitals for the poor and vulnerable, who neither have any insurance cover nor have coverage under government schemes like Ayushman Bharat, and also of those who have the coverage but the cost of treatment surpasses their reimbursement.It has said that given the resource constrains of public health sector in the country, extensive participation of private health care sector would be required particularly in dealing with moderate and severe cases of coronavirus that would require hospitalization.It has said that the Centre, in exercise of powers under the Disaster Management Act, has regulated the cost of tests for COVID-19 in private health sector and on the same analogy, the government can also regulate the cost of treatment in private hospitals to combat the pandemic.

27-05-2020||Satya Prakash||Don't let people instigate and create law and order issues: CJI||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 27The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Central Government and the Press Council of India (PCI) to respond to a petition by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind seeking directions to the media and the authorities not to demonise entire Muslim community over the spread of COVID-19 due to Nizamuddin Markaz congregation of Tablighi Jamat."Don't let people instigate... and create law and order issues. These are things that later become problems," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who represented the Centre.The Bench — which specifically wanted to know about alleged violation of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act by news channels — gave two weeks to the Centre and PCI to respond to the PIL.As senior advocate Dushyant Dave — appearing in a connected matter — said the issue should be taken seriously, the CJI said, "We take all matters seriously. Don't say repeatedly that take these matters seriously."Dave said there were lots of fake news on Markaz incident which have damaged the secular fabric of India."Why is the Government silent?" Dave asked.Contending that these broadcasts amounted to offences under the law, he urged the court to take action against media organisations.The Supreme Court on April 13 refused to restrain the media from reporting on the alleged role of Tablighi Jamaat congregation at its Nizamuddin Markaz in the capital in spreading COVID19 in the country."We will not gag the press," a Bench headed by CJI Bobde had told the counsel for Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind which alleged that a section of the media was spreading bigotry and communal hatred by linking the spread of coronavirus with the recent Nizamuddin Markaz incident.It had asked Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind to make PCI a party to the case.Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind — an Islamic body in India — had on April 6 moved the top court seeking directions to prevent what it termed communalisation of Nizamuddin Markaz issue by certain sections of print and electronic media.The nature of reporting has led to demonizing the entire Muslim community in India, resulting into threat to their right to life and liberty — a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the petitioner contended.It alleged that by not taking action to maintain communal harmony "in such a critically sensitive time", the Centre has failed in discharging its constitutional duty.The petition accused various TV channels and newspapers of presenting the information relating to the incident in a "twisted manner", inciting hatred against the entire Muslim community at large.The TV news channels and social media were replete with phrases such as "Corona Jihad" and "Corona Terrorism" to describe the Nizamuddin Markaz incident, the petition submitted.It said social media platforms were full of misinformation and fake news on the issue with communal tone and conspiracy theories that Tablighi Jamaat deliberately tried to spread Corona virus across India.Contending that it violated Norms of Journalistic Conduct issues by the Press Council of India, the petitioner urged the top court to direct the Centre to stop communalisation of the Nizamuddin Markaz incident and take action against those disseminating fake news on the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-let-people-instigate-and-create-law-and-order-issues-cji-90672

This mother died of hunger and thirst after being on a train for four days. Who is responsible for these deaths on trains? Shouldn't the opposition ask uncomfortable questions?" tweeted Yadav.However, the police had a different story to tell.Ramakant Upadhyay, the Dy SP of the Government Railway Police in Muzaffarpur, said the incident occurred on May 25 when the migrant woman was on the way to Muzaffarpur from Ahmedabad by a Shramik Special train.He told reporters the woman, who was accompanied by her sister and brother-in-law, had died on the Madhubani bound train."My sister-in-law died suddenly on the train. We did not face any problem getting food or water," the officer said, quoting the deceased's brother-in-law who he did not name.He said on getting information, police brought down the body and sent it for postmortem.Citing the brother-in-law of the deceased, Upadhyay said she was aged 35 years and was undergoing treatment for "some disease" for the last one year in Ahmedabad.छोटे बच्चे को नहीं मालूम कि जिस चादर के साथ वह खेल रहा है वह हमेशा के लिए मौत की गहरी नींद सो चुकी माँ का कफ़न है। 4 दिन ट्रेन में भूखे-प्यासे रहने के कारण इस माँ की मौत हो गयी। ट्रेनों में हुई इन मौतों का ज़िम्मेवार कौन? विपक्ष से कड़े सवाल पूछे जाने चाहिए कि नहीं?? pic.twitter.com/pdiaHuS9vf  "She was also mentally unstable," he said.When persistently queried about the cause of death, he said,"Only doctors can tell".A massive exodus of migrant workers is on in several parts of the country, unprecedented in magnitude since Partition.The humanitarian crisis still unfolding on highways and railway platforms have shone a light on disturbing tales of entire families walking hundreds of kilometers with little children on foot in a seemingly endless march to escape hunger.People have been found travelling on trucks and in the hollow of concrete mixing plants, and in many cases, dying from hunger and exhaustion before reaching their destinations.

27-05-2020||---||China says capable of resolving issues with India through dialogue||New Delhi, May 27China sought to dial down tensions on the line of actual control (LAC) and continued quiet diplomacy with India even as US President Donald Trump unexpectedly offered to be the peacemaker.The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing as well as the Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidung underlined the need for constant communication to resolve differences.“Between the two countries, we have good border-related mechanism and communication channels. We are capable of resolving the issues properly through dialogue and consultation,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian while confirming that quiet diplomacy, away from public glare, was on to defuse the border tensions. “This includes the communication between border troops and between our diplomatic missions,” he explained.At the same time, Zhao indicated tough bargaining in the days ahead by reiterating China’s commitment to safeguarding its territorial sovereignty and security.There was a flutter in the strategic community when Trump sought to insert himself as the peacemaker days after Alice Wells, his top diplomat for the region, had done the opposite by accusing China of causing problems from the land border with India to the South China Sea.“We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!” tweeted Trump. There was no response from the Indian and Chinese governments.Speaking in a different context, the Chinese Ambassador said India and China must never let the differences shadow the overall situation of bilateral cooperation. “China and India should be good neighbours of harmonious coexistence and good partners to move forward hand in hand,” he said while addressing a videoconferencing.“We should adhere to the basic judgment that China and India are each other’s opportunities and pose no threat to each other,” he emphasised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-says-capable-of-resolving-issues-with-india-through-dialogue-90665
27-05-2020||New Delhi||BJP not trying to destabilise Maharashtra government, says Ravi Shankar Prasad||Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday said the BJP was “not trying to do politics” or use the Mumbai COVID crisis to topple or destabilise the Uddhav Thackeray-led Aghadi government in Maharashtra.Addressing media persons Prasad said, “Maybe things are not in control” of the Chief Minister and there are “issues” within the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress coalition in the state.“Where is the BJP doing politics? Has Devendra Fadnavis (former CM) not said he is not trying to bring down the government? Has Piyush Goyal (Railway Minister) not offered trains for migrants to the state government? Has the Governor not said there will be no President’s rule in the state,” said Prasad, in response to speculation about the BJP fishing in troubled waters in Maharashtra.“What can the BJP do if Sharad Pawar visits Uddhav Thackeray, if Rahul Gandhi gives contradictory statements,” Prasad said, adding, that it was for the Maharashtra government to deal the crisis more responsibly.“Mumbai is one of the hotspots and it is the responsibility of the state government to deal with it well,” he said, on the day Gandhi tried to make an amendment to his statement about the coalition government Maharashtra on Tuesday.Regarding a similar COVID situation in the BJP-ruled Gujarat, Prasad said the Gujarat government was trying to deal with situation judiciously.“There are many issues (in Gujarat) I know that. Surat has a large number of migrants from Bihar, UP, all of who want to go home. In such trying circumstances the state government is trying to do its best. Despite the challenges the Gujarat government is handling the situation by putting in a lot of hard work,” he saidAlleging that there is no truth in the statement that BJP is working to destabilise the Thackeray government, former CM Fadnavis on Tuesday said the three-party coalition will fall on its own due to sharp internal differences between allies Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.Thackeray’s lack of assertive leadership and inability to take bold decisions has adversely affected Maharashtra, he said, after senior BJP MP Narayan Rane met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, demanding President’s Rule in the state.Fadnavis claimed the theory of BJP trying to dislodge the government was a ploy to divert people’s attention from serious issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-not-trying-to-destabilise-maharashtra-government-says-ravi-shankar-prasad-90662
27-05-2020||New Delhi||Top Army commanders begin deliberations on security challenges facing India||Top commanders of the Indian Army on Wednesday began deliberations on key security challenges facing India, including the tense standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in several areas of eastern Ladakh.The three-day conference is being presided over by Chief of Army Staff Gen M M Naravane.The commanders are also expected to delve into the overall situation in Jammu and Kashmir.However, the main focus will be on the situation in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese troops are locked in an eyeball-to-eyeball face-off in sensitive areas like Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie, government sources said."All aspects of India's security challenges, including along borders with Pakistan and China, will be discussed at length by the commanders," said a senior military official on condition of anonymity.Both India and China have significantly increased their presence in all sensitive areas in the region, in an indication that neither side is ready to back off.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on the evening of May 5 which spilt over to the next day before the two sides agreed to "disengage" following a meeting at the level of local commanders.Over 100 Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in the violence.The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in North Sikkim on May 9.The commanders' conference was originally scheduled to be held from April 13-18, but it was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.The second phase of the conference will take place in the last week of June.On the face-off in eastern Ladakh, India last week said that it has always taken a very responsible approach towards border management but the Chinese military was hindering normal patrolling by its troops.It is learnt that both India and China are looking at a solution to the issue through talks.On May 5, the Indian and the Chinese army personnel clashed with iron rods, sticks, and even resorted to stone-pelting in the Pangong Tso lake area in which soldiers on both sides sustained injuries.In a separate incident, nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector on May 9. At least 10 soldiers from both sides sustained injuries.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

During this period, parts of north India are likely to witness dust storms and thunderstorms.Western disturbance is a cyclonic circulation which originates in the Mediterranean Sea. Traversing Central Asia, it brings rains to the hills and plains when it comes in contact with the Himalayas.On the progress of the southwest monsoon, the national weather forecasting centre of the IMD said it has further advanced into some more parts of the South Bay of Bengal, most parts of Andaman Sea and Andaman and the Nicobar Islands."Conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into some parts of Maldives-Comorin area and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea, remaining parts of the Andaman Sea and some more parts of south and the central Bay of Bengal during next 48 hours," it added.

Chidambaram on Wednesday said on Twitter: “I had tweeted a few days ago that the day is not far off when the Congress’ suggestions will be accepted by the government. A stubborn government has no choice and must listen to experience and wise counsel.”“The government has hinted at taking up cash transfers to the poor,” Chidambaram added citing media reports.“The government has also practically admitted through unnamed sources that it has asked the RBI to be prepared for monetising part of the fiscal deficit,” he further said.The Congress has been demanding cash transfer directly to the people’s account to the tune of Rs 65,000 crore.Rahul Gandhi in his press conference on Tuesday said it is important the Government share concrete plans for how it intends to deal with our migrants crisis? How does it plan to scale up testing which is urgently needed? How does it plan to support our MSMEs? How will our State Governments be funded? There are many critical questions that the Government is not providing us answers to, which need to be addressed urgently, he said.“Earlier this month, the Prime Minister announced an economic stimulus which according to him was equivalent to 10 per cent of the GDP. However, economists in India and around the world have done the maths and come to the sad conclusion that the economic stimulus announced by the Prime Minister is actually less than 1 per cent of our GDP and that too most of it is in terms of loans that could drag our MSMEs into a debt trap from which they will struggle to recover,” Rahul Gandhi had said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-has-no-choice-must-listen-to-wise-counsel-chidambaram-90650

27-05-2020||New Delhi||Video clip claims no arrangements on ground for COVID-19 patients: HC seeks Centre, Delhi govt stand||Taking note of a video clipping on social media of a man who had to run from pillar to post to get his mother hospitalised after testing positive for COVID-19, the Delhi High Court has directed the Centre and the AAP government to place before it arrangements made to deal with such patients.Observing that the video “raises serious issues of public concern in the present day context”, a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar issued several directions, including making effective the helplines for reporting coronavirus cases, assessing their adequacy to deal with the increasing call traffic and providing ambulance facility to pick up patients.It directed the two governments to place before it the status of functional and responsive helpline numbers being operated by them. It also appointed an amicus curiae to look into the grievances raised in the video clipping.“The amicus curiae shall also call the helpline numbers and report with regard to their effectiveness in providing help to the callers,” the bench said.    The court, which took suo motu cognisance of the clipping, also directed the Delhi government and the Centre to respond to the grievances narrated by the man—Dharmendra Bhardwaj—who has alleged in the video that “tall claims” of both the governments regarding arrangements for COVID-19 patients “are far from true on the ground”.He said his mother was admitted in a private hospital on May 19 and she tested positive for COVID-19 on May 21.Thereafter, the private hospital asked him to arrange for a ventilator and bed in some other hospital, he has claimed and added that he went to several hospitals, but to no avail.Even the helpline numbers publicised by the Delhi government and the Centre were non-responsive, Bhardwaj has alleged in the video which has been taken on record by the high court.Taking note of his grievances, the bench observed that a person, who or whose family or friend is found COVID-19 positive, should be able to call the helplines to not only report such occurrence, but to also seek guidance and assistance with regard to the hospitals to which such patient may be taken – if hospitalisation is necessary keeping in view of the condition of the patient. “The helplines should render meaningful and effective help to the callers. If the experience of Dharmendra Bhardwaj is anything to go by, it appears, that this aspect has not been adequately addressed by the respondents (Centre and Delhi government),” the court said.It directed them to “assess the adequacy of the helpline capacity and state whether the same is sufficient to deal with the present call traffic and the traffic expected in the foreseeable future, keeping in view the continuous rise in the number of cases being reported each day”. The bench was also of the view, “the helpline numbers of the GNCTD should also provide guidance and information to the caller as to which hospital has beds available for treatment of serious COVID-19 patients – both in Government and Private Hospitals, particularly in the proximity of the caller patient’s location.          “The capacity created to deal with calls made on the helpline numbers; the nature of assistance rendered, and the log maintained for the same, if any, should also be placed before the Court,” it said.The bench further directed the Delhi government to consider providing ambulance facility for pickup of COVID-19 serious patients for hospitalisation, once a caller reports a serious case which appears to require hospitalisation looking to the condition reported.           During the hearing, Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra told the bench that there were around 10 helpline numbers and admitted that they were “found not to be functioning efficiently and instructions have been issued to set the system in order”. He told the court that the same would be done within the next couple of days.Mehra also informed the bench that a mobile application is under development to give live updates of the hospital beds available in Delhi government hospitals and private hospitals, and other related information.He told the court that the mobile application would be launched in the next couple of days.“We direct the Central Government, as well as the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, to file their status reports on all the aspects mentioned in the said video recording and those taken note of by us, before the next date of hearing,” the court said.It directed the registry to place the matter on June 3 before the bench headed by the Chief Justice as it deals with PILs. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/video-clip-claims-no-arrangements-on-ground-for-covid-19-patients-hc-seeks-centre-delhi-govt-stand-90644

There is a need to enhance provision of safe abortion services besides post-partum and post-abortion contraception, the ministry highlighted."India also has the largest adolescent and youth population. Therefore, in addition to the current priority for COVID-19 for health facilities and health workers, it is also vital that essential health services for vulnerable population like this segment are continued during the pandemic," it said.According to the guidance note, any area exiting a ‘containment/ buffer zone' can start such activities as listed in ‘areas beyond buffer zone' after a minimum gap of 14 days following delisting.Not for profit/private sector hospitals can be involved in provision of non-COVID essential services, wherever public sector capacity needs to be supported, it said.According to the guidance note, practices of physical distancing, hand washing, and respiratory hygiene need to be maintained at all service areas by all beneficiaries and service providers and facilities should follow a staggered approach, wherein adequate seating space for beneficiaries and care-givers with physical distancing is ensured.In case the number of beneficiaries is more, then additional sessions/clinics could be organised. Community-based activities should have limited participation (5-10) at a time.The procedure site and all equipment should be sanitised properly before and after the clinics/sessions, it said.All COVID-19 suspects and positive cases should preferably be provided services at dedicated COVID facility."COVID-19 testing is not mandatory for RMNCAH+N service. ICMR testing guidelines need to be followed," it said, while underlining that tele-consultation services to be promoted at all levels to prevent overcrowding and reduce cross infection.Drugs, commodities needed for continuing such services should be treated as essential commodities and home deliveries of essential medicines like calcium, ORS, zinc, contraceptives etc can be organised in containment zones.

With friends from across Delhi, she arranged the boy’s meals for days and kept a daily watch on his health to check for COVID-19 symptoms.Speaking to The Tribune about how human bonding triumphed in times of tragedy, Sneha, one of the people who helped Vishal, said, “By the time we spotted him, Vishal had become too frail. He told us that his parents live in Delhi but had left him at a relatives’ house before the lockdown to travel to their native village in Bihar’s Samastipur for some work. The relative, he said, refused to keep him which was how he landed in a park. Vishal knew nothing about his parents except that they had gone to Samastipur.”A human chain ensued soon after Sneha shared the boy’s antecedents across social media spaces, catching the eye of a volunteer COVID-19 related organisation run by serving IPS officers.Arun Bothra, the founder of India Cares, which eventually got Vishal home, says digital communication if put to the right use can work magic as it did in the child’s case.Together with his IPS friend Sanjay Kumar, currently serving as IG, Sashastra Seema Bal, Bihar sector, Bothra traced Vishal’s parents, arranged for their train journey to Delhi and ferried them to the Dwarka park where their son had spent close to two months of his life in the company of strays.“We had no idea our son had fallen on such bad days. We had gone to Bihar for four days but could not return due to the lockdown. It’s a miracle that Vishal has survived such tough times and we have finally managed to see our son,” says Vishal’s father Santosh Pathak, who was working as a security guard before the lockdown.The job is long gone but Pathak is thrilled to have his son back. Vishal is happy too now that he is home so is the stray, his friend from the Dwarka park.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/12-year-old-spends-50-days-in-delhi-park-before-strangers-help-reunite-him-with-parents-90625

One is a US vaccine, one Chinese and the third is an Oxford vaccine. I do not know which one will work, may be all will, may be one. But I am very confident that a vaccine will be ready by the next year. So India has to have a plan looking at how much vaccination would be available once it becomes possible. So that’s an area where there has to be a lot of focus starting now,” Jha said to Gandhi, adding that COVID19 would continue for the next 12 to 18 months and the world would not be as we knew it.Jha also said he believed India had the capacity to ramp up testing to higher levels than present.“You should be testing everybody with symptoms. Then you should have a strategy for surveillance of high-risk areas and then you have to sort of think of our high-risk areas. That is where you really have to customize it to individuals,” Jha said.He added, “From everything I know about India and testing, on which I do know something, I am not convinced that India could not do much more testing than it does right now. I don’t know why it couldn’t. It is moving forward, they’ve been doing 80,000-100,000 tests a day now. That is good, that is real progress from where things were. I don’t know what prevents us from doing many times that. If we can get up to that level of capacity, then yes, we can test migrant workers before they get out.”Jha also termed the debate on herd immunity a terrible idea.“Some people who say that in places like India we’ll just let herd immunity happen and let hundreds of millions of people get infected. That is a terrible idea because it will lead to millions dying, including a lot of young people with this condition. We have to take a strategy that tries to protect everybody, particularly older people and younger people with chronic disease,” the global expert said.He did not encourage the weather argument so much and said no one knows enough about the virus to say summers will impact its behaviour.On lockdown, Jha said when India opens up the economy it will have to create a certain level of confidence. “The economy resides on confidence because if people are scared, they will not engage in economic activity. So you have to create some amount of confidence. It is a complicated thing. I haven’t seen any country in the world do it brilliantly.  But everybody is kind of making their way through this,” he added.Jha also warned the young against adopting a cavalier approach.“We are finding more and more that even healthy young people end up getting very sick from this disease. So we should not be too cavalier even for otherwise what looks like healthy young people,” he warned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/confident-of-covid-vaccine-by-next-year-india-must-plan-for-doses-now-says-harvard-health-expert-90623

27-05-2020||Lucknow||Yogi takes U-turn, gives up on permission issue for migrants||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has taken a U-turn, two days after he declared that permission would be needed if other states employed workers from UP.The issue sparked a major controversy and an official spokesman has now said that the government would not include this clause of 'prior permission' in the by-laws of the Migration Commission.The government spokesman said it was working on modalities to set up the commission to provide jobs and social security to migrant workers returning to the state. It has named the migration commission as the Shramik Kalyan Aayog (Workers Welfare Commission).About 26 lakh migrants have already returned to the state and an exercise to map their skills is being carried out to help them get jobs.Yogi Adityanath has discussed the modalities for setting up the commission and told his officers to complete the skill mapping exercise in 15 days.A senior official of Team 11, said, "The chief minister discussed the modalities for setting up the commission, as well. There will be no provision requiring other states to seek the UP government's prior permission for employing our manpower. The commission is being set up to provide jobs and social security to the workers. We will also link the migrants to the government schemes to provide them houses and loans etc."Yogi Adityanath said a letter should be sent to all state governments to find out about migrant workers wanting to come back to Uttar Pradesh.Earlier, the chief minister, while speaking at a webinar on Sunday, had said, "The migration commission will work in the interest of migrant workers. If any other state wants UP's manpower, they cannot take them just like that, but will have to seek permission of the UP government. The way our migrant workers were ill-treated in other states, the UP government will take their insurance, social security in its hands now. The state government will stand by them wherever they work, whether in Uttar Pradesh, other states or other countries."The statement had sparked a row with some political leaders and parties questioning the move.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi sharply criticised Adityanath's stand, saying the workers were not the chief minister's personal property."It is very unfortunate that the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh views India in such a way. These people are not his personal property. They are not the personal property of Uttar Pradesh. These people are Indian citizens and they have the right to decide what they want to do and they have the right to live the life they want to live," he had said.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray had also taken on Adityanath saying if UP insists on "permission" before other states can employ workers from there, "then any migrant entering Maharashtra would need to take permission from us, from the Maharashtra state, our police force too."Meanwhile, the government spokesman said, "The chief minister is deeply moved by the condition of migrants. They have been treated badly by other states. So, when the chief minister spoke about the need for seeking the UP government's permission, he did so as a guardian for workers. It's only his concern for the migrants that came out as a political statement."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-takes-u-turn-gives-up-on-permission-issue-for-migrants-90616

Through their commitment and innovative approaches, they embrace a standard of excellence that is an inspiration to all blue helmets everywhere. As we confront today's challenges, their work has never been more important or relevant," he said.The General Assembly had designated May 29 as the commemoration day because it was the date in 1948 when the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO), the world body's first peacekeeping mission, began its operations in Palestine.The Dag Hammarskjold Medal was established in December 2000 and is awarded posthumously to members of peacekeeping operations who lost their lives during service with a peacekeeping operation under the operational control and authority of the United Nations.The medal is named after the second UN Secretary General, who had died in a mysterious 1961 plane crash.

However, keeping in consideration Covid restrictions, the celebrations will mostly be virtual and digital in nature.Focus on Rs 20L cr packageMajor focus of these virtual rallies, conferences and interactions will be the Rs 20 lakh cr financial packageAccording to a party communication, at least 1,000 virtual rallies and conferences will be organised where national and state leaders and Central ministers will highlight achievements of the government in the past one year like abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, construction of Ram Mandir, passing of triple talaq and Citizenship Amendment Laws and the PM’s latest mantra — Atmanirbhar Bharat.A major focus of these virtual rallies, conferences and interactions will be the Rs 20 lakh crore financial package announced by the government to revive economy and benefit the poor and weaker sections of society. The party will release a video of government’s work to combat corona outbreak and has asked state units to translate and dub it in local languages. The BJP is also expected to distribute a copy of PM’s handwritten letter to 10 crore households across the country. The letter will carry his vision and suggestions about combating coronavirus, the work done by his government and the message of self-reliant India, say sources. Party chief JP Nadda will inaugurate the anniversary functions by going live on a social media platform.Sweeping back to power in 2019 with a majority bigger than in the 2014 General Election, the Modi government 2.0 will complete one year on May 30. The BJP communication, which describes PM Modi as the world’s “most popular leader”, says “all these achievements will be written in golden letters in the history”.However, the government is completing one year in power at a time when the country is passing through its worst economic crisis with declining growth, joblessness and the misery of migrant labourers adding to perceptions against it. While the leadership is aggressively countering with Covid relief measures announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman, political observers say economic losses and sufferings of migrants during the lockdown has dented Modi’s image, turning into “political fallout” for the party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/virtual-rallies-to-mark-modi-2-0-first-anniversary-celebrations-90432

The athletes, ‘locked in’ at the National Institute of Sports (NIS) here for over two months, are getting frustrated.An athlete who did not wish to be named said they had been informed that training activities would start on Monday. “However, we have been asked to wait, and that has left us confused and frustrated,” he said. Training could resume, it is learnt, due to a missing link in the chain of orders from the higher-ups. Sources said there was an environment of fear and no one wanted to take responsibility. Notably, last week the Sports Authority of India (SAI) — a nodal agency of the Sports Ministry — had issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to start sports activities. Sources at the NIS said training could not be resumed due to a delay in getting permission from the Sports Ministry. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/training-fails-to-resume-athletes-frustrated-90467

Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh RK Mathur, who was in Delhi, also called on the Prime Minister, said official sources.Face-offs this monthMay 5-6, Eastern Ladakh50 Chinese, Indian soldiers engaged in violent face-off on May 5 evening north of Pangong Tso. The violence spilled over to the next day too.May 9, Sikkim150 Indian, Chinese military personnel engaged in face-off near Naku La. 10 soldiers from both sides injured.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh was also briefed by the CDS and three service chiefs on Tuesday as he reviewed the ground situation in Ladakh.Singh is learnt to have heard them out, discussing troop numbers and risk to infrastructure. Earlier, the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army held several meetings to resolve the LAC situation in eastern Ladakh.Defence sources said India, for now, had decided that road construction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh must continue and Indian fortifications and troop deployment must match those of the Chinese. The Indian Army has been asked to hold ground while talks to defuse the situation would continue.Meanwhile, reports said China continued to add to its military strength across eastern Ladakh as tensions festered in the Galwan valley and north of the Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake.Some 8,000-10,000 troops along a stretch of 826 km and armoured personal carriers and artillery guns have already been deployed on both sides. Troop build-up on both sides is concentrated at three spots —- one at Galwan and two around Pangong Tso. The cause of the flare-up is apparently the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Baig Oldie road.Opposite the road or eastwards of it is the Aksai Chin plateau, illegally occupied by China.China and India have a string of air bases close to the LAC which can be used to launch an offensive. A senior official explained that fully functional Chinese airfields at Kashgar, Korla, Yarkand, Hotan, Ngari Gunsa and Gardzong virtually form a ‘ring’ around Ladakh.On Friday, General Manoj Mukund Naravane had visited Leh, the headquarters of 14 Corps, and reviewed security deployment of forces along the LAC.India denies trespassingRefutes China’s contention that tension triggered due to trespassing by its forces; says Chinese troops hindering patrollingChina irked by infraIncreased patrollingScale up battle preparedness: XiBeijing: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday ordered the military to scale up the battle preparedness.

27-05-2020||New Delhi||China cites Covid for evacuating its citizens from India||China has said it is organising evacuation for its citizens from India in view of the rising Covid cases in the country. In a notice on the Embassy website, the Chinese Government has asked its citizens staying in India and willing to return, to register by Wednesday.Brazil and Russia have three times more cases than India, but China has so far issued no such advisory linking evacuation of its nationals in those countries to a rise in Covid cases. Embassy sources had earlier denied any link with tension on the Sino-Indian border.“In consideration of the development of the epidemic situation in India, the Chinese side is planning to dispatch temporary flights to India to bring back students, tourists and business inspectors who are facing difficulties,” said Chinese Embassy spokesperson Ji Rong. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-cites-covid-for-evacuating-its-citizens-from-india-90420
27-05-2020||New Delhi||India, China working  on backdoor parleys||The reason for the stand-off between troops of India and China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh remains a subject of conjecture among foreign policy experts in the absence of any authoritative commentary from both governments.At a regular press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson received no queries on the LAC stand-off, an indication that both sides would work out the issue away from public glare and commentary.Quiet diplomacyThe reticence of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Office comments on global issues but the LAC suggest quiet diplomacy is being given a chanceThe Chinese side has generally withheld comments on the issue except for some observations by “The Global Times”. A regular commentator on India, Long Xingchun, wrote that most face-offs were resolved without the media getting to know about them. He, however, saw the face-off at the Galwan valley as having been planned by India in advance and cautioned that it could snowball into a confrontation worse than Doklam. The MEA has commented on the stand-off twice, on May 14 and May 21, and its Chinese Foreign Office once, that too briefly.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi did not touch on India at all during his 90-minute especially convened press conference on Sunday while External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has also adopted a low profile on the issue.Former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran as well as former Ambassadors to China Ashok Kantha and Gautam Bambawale are united in asserting that Chinese aggressiveness on the border is part of its pattern of pushing its advantage on territorial claims while the adversaries are engaged in Covid. This is also an observation made by top US diplomat for the region Alice Wells, who said the LAC stand-off was a reminder that Chinese aggression was not just rhetorical.However with no word coming from the actual policy-making circles except for a few accounts of the stand-off, strategic experts too have been unable to foresee the end game.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-working-on-backdoor-parleys-90421

He expects India to keep Covid-19 deaths at less than 8,000 with strict curbsIndian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) chief Balram Bhargava today said studies on HCQ use for prophylaxis (prevention) among Covid warriors had shown the drug may be working.“There are no major side-effects, though people have reported nausea, vomiting and occasional palpitations. One ECG during the regimen is mandatory,” said Bhargava as India’s disease graph continued to soar with record rise of 7,035 cases over the past 24 hours.The ICMR Director General said several biological plausibility and in-vitro studies in the past had pointed to anti-viral properties in HCQ and chloroquine, both anti-malarial drugs.Meanwhile, the government said lockdowns had ensured recovery rate improved from 7.1 per cent in March to 41.61 per cent today and fatality rate fell from 3.3 per cent to 2.8 per cent.Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said among the 10 most Covid-affected nations, deaths per million in India were 3.08 against 800 in Belgium.“Cases per lakh people in India are 10.7 against 69.9 globally and 486 in the US. The global death rate average is 6.4 per cent against 2.8 per cent in India, 19.9 in France, 16.3 in Belgium and 14.3 per cent in Italy.
