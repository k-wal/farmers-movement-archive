19-09-2020||New Delhi||BJP, Opposition seek to rally support as farm Bills reach Rajya Sabha||Rajya Sabha is likely to take up the contentious farm Bills on Sunday with the Congress and many opposition parties trying to put a united front to oppose these proposed legislations terming them as anti-farmer and pro-corporate, even as the ruling BJP is also reaching out to several regional outfits for support.The numbers, however, appear to be in favour of the ruling dispensation to get these Bills passed from Rajya Sabha, while the lower house has already cleared them despite a key NDA member Shiromani Akali Dal vehemently opposing them.Some key BJP leaders are said to be in touch with various non-Congress opposition parties to seek support from their Rajya Sabha members for these Bills.While the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is yet to have a clear majority of its own in the 245-member Rajya Sabha, many regional parties have backed it for the last several sessions to ensure passage of various legislations proposed by the government.BJP leaders expressed confidence that they will get the support of over 130 members, including nine of the AIADMK and six of the YSR Congress—both of whom are not part of the ruling alliance if a division of votes is sought on these Bills.Another regional party, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) was also being wooed by the BJP, but its chief and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday asked his party MPs to vote against these bills, alleging these would cause great injustice to farmers in the country.The BJP itself has the highest tally with 86 seats, followed by 40 of the Congress.The three members of the SAD are sure to vote against the Bills, but Shiv Sena, a former BJP ally and now in opposition, has expressed it support for these Bills. The Maharashtra party has three members in Rajya Sabha.Several other regional parties, including three-member Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party with eight seats, and BSP with four, have joined the opposition’s ranks in protest against these bills but it may not prove enough to hinder their passage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s forceful defence of the three Bills and blistering criticism of the Opposition for protesting against them on Thursday made it clear that he remains unfazed by the opposition and that his government will press on to get Parliament’s nod for these measures aimed at opening private avenues for farmers to sell their produce.His assertion came amid Congress and several other parties besides the SAD coming out strongly against these Bills, calling them “anti-farmers”.Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against these proposed laws which, their leaders allege, will end up dismantling the existing government-backed support system they have.A number count of parties that have come out against these draft legislations suggests that there are as of now nearly 100 MPs opposing them. There is no clarity about the stand of some small parties which have around a dozen members put together.Since the Modi government assumed office for its second time in 2019, its rivals have not been able to scuttle any of its major bills due to a rise in the ranks of treasury benches and a corresponding fall in the opposition ranks.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday, while the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill was passed on Tuesday.These bills seek to replace ordinances already promulgated by the government.With opposition parties dubbing the three bills as “anti-farmers” and the SAD quitting his government to protest them, Modi refuted their criticism, describing these proposed laws as “historic” and stating that they will unshackle farmers by allowing them to sell their produce anywhere at a better price.A day after resigning from Union Cabinet, senior SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said she feels “saddened” that her voice in support of farmers was not heard and demanded that the government should pause on these legislations by referring them to a parliamentary panel for wider consultations.The government has presented these Bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of ‘mandis’.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said on Thursday in Lok Sabha that farmers will be free to sell their produce to anyone and these bills will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment.However, opposition parties have slammed the Bills as “anti-farmers”, claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests.Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to all non-BJP parties to unite in Rajya Sabha and oppose the three bills that he claimed would leave farmers in the hands of big companies for exploitation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-opposition-seek-to-rally-support-as-farm-bills-reach-rajya-sabha-143554
19-09-2020||New Delhi||Lok Sabha passes Taxation Bill||Lok Sabha on Saturday passed a Taxation Bill that seeks to provide various reliefs in terms of compliance requirements for taxpayers amid the coronavirus pandemic.The reliefs include extending deadlines for filing returns and for linking PAN and Aadhaar.The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020, will replace the Taxation and other Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Ordinance, 2020, promulgated in March.Among others, the Bill seeks to give tax exemption for contributions made to PM-CARES Fund, which was set up in March in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Replying to the debate on the Bill, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the ordinance was necessary to defer various compliance deadlines under GST and Income Tax (I-T) Act during the COVID-19 times.Further, the Bill seeks to make faceless assessment applicable to at least eight processes under the I-T Act, including for collection and recovery of tax and gathering of information."To ensure there is transparency in tax administration, that is why we are putting it (faceless scheme) in law," Sitharaman said.

He further stated that BSF personnel fire with non-lethal weapons only in self-defence when they are surrounded by large numbers of miscreants armed with ‘dah’ (cleaver-shaped knife), sticks etc, and their lives are endangered.“DG BSF assured that the death incidents along the border will be made to reduce significantly in near future,” a BSF spokesperson said in a statement issued in New Delhi.Reiterating the need for joint efforts to uphold human rights and curb violence on the border, both the sides agreed to take extra precautionary measures along the border, including intensifying public awareness programmes, undertaking appropriate socio-economic development programmes and real-time information sharing, he said.The spokesperson said the two sides also decided to frame new standard operating procedures (SOPs) in view of crossing of “significant” number of mentally challenged Indian nationals to Bangladesh.“The BSF DG suggested that an SOP could be drawn up early in mutual consultation to address this humane issue which could expedite the disposal of such cases and alleviate the suffering of such people.“Both sides agreed to look after the humanitarian aspects of the victim first and then verify the nationality of the mentally challenged persons and thereafter, handing or taking over can be expedited with cooperation from one another,” the spokesperson said.The two forces also decided to “share real-time information” with each other expeditiously through formal or informal channels regarding smuggling of narcotics, human trafficking, fake Indian currency notes (FICN), cattle, arms, ammunition, explosives, information related to anti-social elements, activities of IIGs (Indian Insurgent groups) and breaching or damaging of border fence, following commonly agreed specific formats, he said.The spokesperson said both the forces “appreciated the efforts made to improve mutual relations through various confidence building measures (CBMs)”.“All the agreed events undertaken earlier in CBMs will be resumed once COVID-19 pandemic situation becomes normal,” he added.This was the 50th DG-level meeting between the two sides. The next edition is slated to be held in India.According to the BGB, until August this year, as many as 33 Bangladeshis have been killed along the border while rights group Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) said 15 people were killed along the border in 2018 and the number rose to 43 last year.In the first seven months of the current year, 29 people were killed, it said.BGB Director General Islam said that his Indian counterpart has assured me that “he would do his best to ensure that we can avoid the loss of human life.”He said Bangladesh has 4,427 km-long border with India which has many rivers, marshes, hills alongside plain lands. The BGB has set up outposts in every five km of the frontier.They agreed to provide aid to the victims of human trafficking and facilitate their rescue and rehabilitation as per the law of the land.Both the sides also agreed not to undertake any development work within the 150 yards of the border without prior information and to expedite the concurrence of all pending development works, officials said.They agreed to ensure that no unauthorised river bank protection works take place along the common border rivers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-reduce-killings-at-bangladesh-border-fire-only-in-self-defence-bsf-dg-143544

Two minors have been apprehended while the search for the sixth accused—Imran is on, police said.Bhiwadi SP Ram Moorty inspected the spot of the alleged crime on Saturday and interrogated the accused.The incident occurred in a hilly area close to the border under Tijara Police Station in Bhiwadi on September 14 when the woman along with her 25-year-old nephew was returning home after giving some money to her relative in a nearby village.The accused caught hold of them near the hills and while one of them, identified as Aasam, raped the woman, others molested her. The accused also tied the hands of her nephew and later forced him to sexually assault the woman.“They also shot a video clip of the incident and threatened to circulate if they informed anyone about the incident,” the deputy SP said.“Initially, the victims kept quiet but when the accused circulated the video clip, their relatives came to know about it and a police case was registered on September 17,” the deputy SP said.The SP has directed the police team to complete the investigation and file a chargesheet in the case as soon as possible, Singh said.He said that efforts were being made to identify all those who forwarded the video and action against them will also be taken under the IT act.A similar incident had taken place in April last year in Thanagazi area of the district when a woman was gangraped in front of her husband. The couple had kept quiet initially but registered a case after the accused circulated a video clip of the crime. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/45-year-old-woman-raped-in-alwar-5-arrested-143541

19-09-2020||New Delhi||Opposition parties question setting up of PM CARES Fund, allege it lacks transparency||Members of opposition parties like the Congress, DMK and the TMC on Saturday opposed in Lok Sabha the setting up of the PM CARES Fund, alleging that it lacked transparency.They were participating in a debate on the Bill for giving effect to various compliance relief measures for taxpayers, including extending time limits for filing returns, in the wake of the coronavirus crisis and tax benefits for donations to PM CARES Fund.“I can’t understand the logic to have a separate fund. What is the difference between the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund and the PM CARES Fund,” said NK Premachandran (RSP), who initiated the debate on The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020.“Eight different Acts are being modified means substantial changes took place in eight Acts and one of the major Acts is the Income Tax Act of 1961,” he said.He alleged the PM CARES Fund “lacks transparency as it is not audited by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). FurtherI is also not applicable”.“The question of transparency and accountability is the main issue I want to highlight,” he said.Opposing the Bill, Manickam Tagore (Congress) also raised the issue of transparency in the PM CARES Fund.He wondered if a chief minister of any state can say that he will not disclose the spending under the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.But PM CARES Fund is outside the ambit of Parliament and CAG, he said.“What was the need of a private trust with the Council of Ministers as trustee indicating a conflict of interest,” Tagore said.He alleged that just like demonetisation, the Modi government is providing another opportunity “to convert blackmoney into white”.Without naming anyone, he said “AA battery” is running the Modi government which is why “most of the government contracts are going to some particular companies”.Echoing similar views, Gautham Sigamani Pon (DMK) alleged that the PM CARES Fund is “clearly a private trust”.Considering the trying times, Sigamani said, the government should consider reducing tax rather than cutting TDS.Mahua Moitra (TMC) too opposed the Bill. She said the PM CARES Fund is against public interest as it is not answerable to Parliament even though it collects funds from the public.She said that 38 public sector companies contributed Rs 2,100 crore to the Fund.This is 70 per cent of the total corpus, she said, adding it should therefore be answerable to Parliament.She also alleged that the Fund got money from Chinese firms like Tik tok banned by India and wondered why the government did not return the donations from such companies.Moitra questioned the need to institute a new fund (PM Cares Fund) when one already exists?“Prime Ministers will come and go, but the existence of a fund is not up for discussion? What is this need to name everything after one individual.“First, you are raising a fund on the basis of a public office. By saying it is not open toI, you are running away from transparency,” Moitra said.The Bill amends the provisions of the Income Tax Act to provide the same tax treatment to PM-CARES Fund as available to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.“The donation made to the PM CARES Fund shall be eligible for 100 per cent deduction under section 80G of the IT Act. Further, the limit on deduction of 10 per cent of gross income shall also not be applicable for donation made to PM CARES Fund,” an official statement had said.Shriniwas Patil (NCP) also said there should be more transparency in the PM Cares Fund.Backing the fund, Bhartuhari Mahtab (BJD) said he hoped the PM CARES Fund is not only created to tackle COVID-19 but also for different calamities.“Such type of calamity relief funds are nothing new in our country. I doubt in any other country such a clamour has been made to target a philanthropic trust, the manner in which it is being done in the country,” Mahtab said.Arvind Sawant (Shiv Sena) said the way tax relief has been given to those who donate money to the PM CARES Fund, similar relief should be extended to the fund created by the Maharashtra government.Supporting the bill, Subhash Chandra Baheria (BJP) said it proposes faceless assessment which is a big step in the interest of taxpayers.The Bill,  introduced in Lok Sabha on Friday, proposes to extend the faceless assessment scheme to at least eight processes in income tax law.It proposed faceless assessment of income escaping assessment, rectification, amendments and issuance of notice or intimation.Besides, collection and recovery of tax, revision and effect of orders and approval or registration.Baheria further said that the government should take steps to bring down difficulties faced by GST taxpayers.Citing a specific example of GST law being overtaken by Rules with regard to Input Tax Credit, he said the government should take steps to correct this anomaly.

India does not enjoy good diplomatic ties with these countries and would prefer other regional actors like Thailand, Egypt, Uzbekistan or Afghanistan to step in.Anticipating a rise in prices domestically, the government had banned onion exports on September 14 except for cut, sliced and powdered due to excessive rainfall hitting its crop in some southern states.As a result prices have trebled in Bhutan and shown a steady rising trend that threatens to worsen in Bangladesh and Nepal. Sources said a multi-Ministry effort quarterbacked by the Ministry of External Affairs led to the release and transportation of onion consignments that were deemed to have been sold with the opening of LCs.India has emerged as an unreliable exporter for the second year running. It had banned onions exports last year as well, impacting neighbours like Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh that are near-totally dependent on Indian onions.As a result, Bhutan has offered seeds, subsidies, and technical assistance to local farmers to grow onion and tomatoes as an immediate measure.About 25,000 tonnes of onion will cross the border to Bangladesh and smaller quantities are being released for Bhutan and Nepal. Last year, Chinese onions had flooded Nepal’s market as the Indian ban stayed for six months.India is the world’s biggest exporter of onions with most of it consumed in nearby Bangladesh, Nepal, Malaysia and Sri Lanka.Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in fact, rued that India had not informed Dhaka before stopping the exports. “I had to tell my cook I have no other option but to have my food without onions. I would request India to please inform us beforehand while taking such an action. After all, we are neighbours,” Hasina had said at a webinar at which Commerce Minister Piyush Goel was also present.The Bangladesh Foreign Office has also reminded New Delhi that it should consider not imposing export restrictions on exports of essential food items and if it was required, India should inform Dhaka in advance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-releases-onions-to-3-neighbouring-countries-to-stop-pak-china-from-filling-breach-143528
19-09-2020||New Delhi||Mystery deepens: Sushant Singh Rajput's viscera not preserved properly, hints at 'negligence'||In what seems to be sheer negligence on the part of Mumbai Police or the medical board which conducted autopsy on late Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput, the all important viscera extracted from the body was not preserved properly.The viscera received by the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is "of very less quantity and degenerated", highly placed sources in AIIMS revealed to IANS.Till late Friday evening, the viscera, which holds the key in ascertaining the cause of death of Sushant Singh Rajput, was being tested at the forensic department of AIIMS in New Delhi."The viscera has degenerated. It makes chemical and toxicological analysis really difficult," sources added.While several media outlets have questioned the Mumbai Police's stand that the actor had died by suicide, the viscera analysis can now unravel the mystery shrouding the actor's death.To confirm if Sushant died of suspected poisoning or drug overdose, the viscera analysis has become the most crucial test for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its medico-legal investigation into the death of the Bollywood star.After conducting the autopsy on June 15, the medical board comprising five doctors of the Cooper Hospital in Mumbai cited "hanging" as the probable cause of death of Sushant.However, they still preserved the viscera for further investigation. The board included three medical officers of Cooper Postmortem Centre—Sandeep Ingale, Pravin Khandare and Ganesh Patil -- and two associate professors of forensic medicine in Mumbai.The viscera, which usually contains internal parts of the body including liver, pancreas and intestine, was preserved in a bottle and handed over to the police.Later the viscera sample was sent for testing to the forensic science laboratories to rule out poisoning or intoxication in the event of death.Following instructions from the Supreme Court, the investigation of the case was handed over to the CBI.The Mumbai Police had questioned several witnesses, conducted forensic probes but did not test the crucial viscera sample. Subsequently, on the request of the CBI, leading forensic experts of AIIMS were asked to examine the lapses in the initial investigations, primarily the forensic aspects. The experts were also given the viscera sample.The AIIMS team led by one of the top forensic experts of India, Sudhir Gupta, was asked to find out any tampering of evidence on the scene of crime or omission of any forensic sign by the Mumbai Police or the panel of doctors which conducted the post-mortem.The AIIMS experts were flown from Delhi to Mumbai to make on the spot assessment of the sequence of events and scrutinize the documents related to forensics.By early next week, AIIMS forensic experts and CBI officials will hold conclusive discussion on the cause of death of Sushant Singh Rajput, who was reportedly found hanging in the bedroom of his duplex flat in Bandra on June 14.Meanwhile, a senior IPS officer in Mumbai Police said that all possible efforts were made to preserve all forensic samples, documentary evidence and other materials related to the case."We have been investigating several sensitive and high profile cases. Mumbai Police are thoroughly professional as far as quality of investigation is concerned," the officer said.

The rank signifies that the woman member is from the medical stream. Grant of permanent commission is to the aspirants meeting the minimum acceptable medical standards.In February this year, the Supreme Court had ruled that women officers, who had joined the Army through the Short Service Commission (SSC) entry, were entitled to a permanent commission just as their male counterparts were.A number of SSC women officers had sought judicial intervention to their claim for grant of permanent commission. While initially women officers were not entitled for permanent commission and could serve for a maximum of 14 years, a few years ago, permanent commission was allowed in the Judge Advocate General’s Department and the Army Educational Corps.In July, the Ministry of Defence issued a formal sanction letter in this regard. It allowed permanent commission to women officers in 10 more arms and services that include Army Air Defence, Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Military Intelligence, Army Service Corps and Army Ordnance Corps.There are close to 1,700 women officers in the Army and about 600 are eligible to opt for permanent commission. The Supreme Court had also directed the Army to consider women officers for command roles in specified branches.In May the Army had made the Battle Physical Efficiency Test mandatory for all women officers, including those commissioned before 2009 and now over the age of 35 who were earlier exempt. The junior command course at Army War College, Mhow, is now also mandatory for women officers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-women-officers-seeking-permanent-commission-can-witness-selection-board-proceedings-143517
19-09-2020||Lucknow||Coronavirus fear reduces toll of non-Covid illnesses||The battle for human survival during the coronavirus pandemic has been on for the past few months. Data highlighting deaths due to the infection has created fear among people but there is a brighter side to it as well. The pandemic has turned around the way of living as people have stopped needlessly thronging the streets.People have also started paying attention to their food habits and are more concerned about their health and lifestyle.The outcome of the pandemic is marked by gradual reduction of deaths due to other illnesses. The toll due to general illnesses and road accidents has reduced. This is what data from various hospitals and health departments have shown.In Uttar Pradesh, 4,79,383 people died from January 2019  to June 2019 due to illnesses and other reasons as compared to 2,91,387 people in the corresponding period this year. This is evident from data for the last three years.According to data revealed by the government, “The number of non-Covid deaths in government, army and railway hospitals in 2018 was 51,439. In 2019 the number declined to 47,939 but this year it has drastically come down to 24,964. In the same way the decrease in overall toll was also seen. For instance, between January and June last year, there were 4,97,383 deaths in the state. During the same time period this year, the toll stood at 2,91,387. Though there is a deviation in this number every month, the reduction in overall mortality rate was a good sign. This change is visible especially in view of the changing attitude of people towards health.”Gorakhpur chest specialist Dr. V.N. Aggarwal said, “The lowest number of deaths occurred when the lockdown was strictly in force. The absence of road accidents due to traffic closure was also a major factor contributing to it. Deaths due to environmental pollution also declined. Mortality rates for heart patients have also decreased due to the increased awareness towards health.

19-09-2020||New Delhi||Centre rejects study that claims India is world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide||The Environment Ministry on Saturday rejected the findings of a study that claimed that India is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide (SO2) and informed the Rajya Sabha that 18 units for flue-gas desulphurisation were installed in the country.Congress MP Ripun Bora had sought to know whether the government is aware that India is the largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide from coal burning that causes air pollution.In his reply, Union Minister of State for Environment Babul Supriyo said: “No sir, it has been reported in one of the study of environmental NGO Greenpeace that India is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide (SO2) and coal-based thermal power plants are the major contributors. Government facts do not agree to this”.He said the ministry, through its December 2015 notification, stipulated norms for emission of sulphur dioxide from thermal power plants apart from other pollutants.“There was no SO2 emission norms for coal-based thermal power pants prior to this notification and regulated through stipulating the height of discharge/emittance through fixing height of chimney,” Supriyo said in a written response.Asked whether India has flue-gas desulphurisation technology installed in coal plants that will help in reduction of air pollution, the minister said two of the commonly acceptable technology for flue-gas desulphurisation of coal-based thermal power plants---wet scrubbing in alkaline media and dry sorbent injection (DSI)---are installed in India.“As on August 31, 2020, 16 units on wet scrubbing and two units on DSI technology are installed for de-sulphurisation of flue gas from coal-based thermal power plants,” Supriyo said.According to the data, of the 16 wet-scrubbing units, eight are in Maharashtra, three in Gujarat, two each in Haryana and Tamil Nadu and one in Madhya Pradesh. The two DSI units are in Uttar Pradesh.In August last year, a study by environment NGO Greenpeace India had claimed that India is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide, which is produced from coal burning, and greatly contributes to air pollution.The Greenpeace India has released an analysis of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) data saying India has more than 15 per cent of all anthropogenic sulphur dioxide (SO2) hotspots in the world detected by the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite.“The major SO2 emission hotspots in India are Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, Neyveli and Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Talcher and Jharsuguda in Odisha, Korba in Chhattisgarh, Kutch in Gujarat, Ramagundam in Telangana and Chandrapur and Koradi in Maharashtra.“The vast majority of plants in India lack flue-gas desulfurization technology to reduce their air pollution,” it had said.

Besides the Flying Branch, IAF women officers serve in several other branches including air traffic and fighter control, engineering, administration, logistics and legal. Till the IAF opened its doors to women officers in 1991, women had been serving only in the medical branch.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/strength-of-women-fighter-pilots-goes-up-to-10-143501

However, now that new agriculture laws are being made, MSP should be made a legal provision whether a purchase is made inside or outside a ‘mandi’. Those who try to deny farmers this right should be punished as per law,” Mahajan said.Meanwhile, asserting that the three bills are sent to a Select Committee of the Parliament, BKS General Secretary Dinesh Kulkarni said: “The government has agreed to our demand related to the definition of farmers. However, given that the Ordinances are alive till January 2021, it is advisable the legislations are sent to a Select Committee for consultations with all parties and stakeholders.”“Besides, the government should include the MSP in the Act to ensure that farmers are not deprived of the minimum support price and that those who deny the farmers their legal right are punished as per the law. To further protect their interests, private traders should be registered by the State and the Centre with adequate bank security and data made available on a website. Alongside to settle disputes separate farmers/agriculture courts should be set up,” Kulkarni said.Kulkarni added that if the government thinks it is not possible to include MSP in these legislations, it can bring a separate law to ensure that. “The BKS supports free trade and reforms, including creation of alternative mechanisms for farmers. At the same time genuine concerns of farmers also should be addressed. The maximum number of farmers in the country is small and marginal and there should be adequate mechanisms to protect their interests and ensure they get payment when their produce is lifted. An option also is the government becomes a guarantor,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sangh-affiliates-urge-bjp-led-govt-to-send-agri-legislations-to-a-select-committee-143500

A way has to be found to deal with this. Except for talks... As you are talking to China to attempt that it withdraws (from Ladakh border), we should also talk to our (other) neighbour to find a way to get out of this situation," he said in Lok Sabha during the Zero Hour amid protests from treasury benches.The Srinagar MP also expressed his happiness at the findings of an Army inquiry into the killings of three men in Shopian in an encounter. "I am happy that the Army has admitted that three Shopian men were killed mistakenly. I hope the government gives a hefty compensation," he said.Officials had said on Friday the Army has found "prima facie" evidence that its troops "exceeded" powers under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act during the encounter in July and has initiated disciplinary proceedings.Abdullah said Jammu and Kashmir has not seen any progress and spoke about authorities blocking 4G facilities in the Union Territory which, he added, goes against the interest of students and traders.He also conveyed his gratitude to parliamentarians for speaking for him when he was under detention.Abdullah and many other leaders were put under detention by authorities last year after the Union government abrogated Article 370, which had given special powers to the erstwhile state, and split Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. He was released in March this year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-talks-can-happen-with-china-why-not-with-other-neighbour-farooq-abdullah-in-ls-143496

The Session could be adjourned as early as September 24 amid COVID fears.The Lok Sabha has so far passed three Bills to replace agriculture sector related ordinances. Also, both the Houses have cleared an ordinance into law to cut by 30 per cent the salaries of members of Parliament to ramp up funds in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.Sources said amid some Members of Parliament testing positive for COVID-19 during the session, Opposition parties conveyed to the government that conducting the full 18-day session could be a risky affair.Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Prahlad Patel have tested positive for COVID-19. Both had attended the ongoing session which began on September 14.Several MPs had tested positive for COVID-19 around the time the session began and they were advised not to attend proceedings.In order to prevent the spread of coronavirus within the parliament complex, reporters and parliamentary staff entering the premises now have to undergo the rapid antigen test mandatory on a daily basis, according to a new protocol put in place.Members of both Houses are undergoing RT-PCR test on regular intervals on a voluntary basis, said a senior Parliament official.A member of Parliament can undergo RT-PCR test as many times he or she likes.Journalists covering the Monsoon session from the press galleries of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha also have the option to undergo the RT-PCR test which is valid for 72 hours.Since the report of the much reliable RT-PCR takes time, antigen test has been made mandatory on a daily basis.Government officials accompanying their respective ministers during bill discussions also have to show a negative report of RT-PCR test taken within the last 72 hours of their visit to the complex.The session began on September 14 and was slated to end on October 1. Both the Houses are meeting in shifts of four hours each without a customary Saturday-Sunday weekend break.The Budget Session was short-terminated in March after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. — With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-covid-fears-parties-agree-to-curtail-monsoon-session-143491
19-09-2020||---||MeToo: Scribe seeks acquittal in Akbar’s complaint, says freedom of speech intrinsic to democracy||New Delhi, September 19Journalist Priya Ramani on Saturday sought acquittal in a criminal defamation complaint filed against her by former union minister MJ Akbar, saying freedom of speech and expression is intrinsic to a democratic society and her accusations of sexual harassment against him were her truth.In the wake of the #MeToo campaign, Ramani in 2018 accused Akbar of sexual misconduct with her around 20 years ago, when he was a journalist.Akbar resigned as a Union minister on October 17, 2018.Ramani, who concluded her arguments on Saturday in the complaint filed against her by Akbar, told the court through her lawyer that the #MeToo campaign was started to correct the structural wrong, which was continuing for long.“The #MeToo movement gave a platform to thousands of women all across the world to come forward and share their stories of sexual harassment. The #MeToo movement was started to correct the structural wrong.”“Freedom of speech and expression is critical and intrinsic to democracy. Ramani was a small part of a large movement. Hundreds and thousands of women participated in the #MeToo movement. I (Ramani) have proved my case and I deserve to be acquitted,” senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for Ramani, told Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja.What Ramani had said against Akbar was “her truth, said in public good”, the lawyer said.In response to the complainant’s argument as to “why did Ramani not raise her voice before”, John said there was a “culture of silence” when the incident took place.“She could not speak up as there was a culture of silence. Ghazala Wahab (a journalist and a witness in the case, who too have accused Akbar of sexual misconduct while she was working under him) pointed out that there was no mechanism for sexual harassment at the workplace.“The Vishakha guidelines (to prevent sexual harassment at workplace) did not exist in 1993. Even after the guidelines came into place, the judiciary and the media took a long time to implement those,” she said.John added that “silence cannot refute Ramani’s truth. She is not filing any FIR for the court to test the delay of the FIR on the ground of credibility”.“Her silence has been adequately explained by her. There was a long delay in the implementation of the Vishakha guidelines, Ramani cannot be made to bear the brunt of it,” she said.Ramani contested the reputation of Akbar through her own evidence, through that of Wahab and 14 other women, who accused him of sexual harassment at workplace in the wake of the #MeToo movement.The court will again hear the matter on October 13.Ramani had earlier told the court that she was “targeted selectively” through a criminal defamation complaint by Akbar “to halt the avalanche of allegations of sexual misconduct that came out against him” in the wake of the #MeToo movement in 2018.Akbar had told the court that Ramani had defamed him by using adjectives such as “media’s biggest predator” to describe him, which harmed his reputation.The BJP leader has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against him.He had earlier told the court that the allegations levelled against him in an article in the “Vogue” magazine and the tweets that followed were defamatory on the face of it as the complainant had deposed those to be false and imaginary and that an “immediate damage” was caused to him due to the “false” allegations by Ramani.Ramani had earlier told the court that her “disclosure” of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar had come at “a great personal cost” and she had “nothing to gain” from it.She had said her move would empower women to speak up and make them understand their rights at the workplace.Several women came up with accounts of alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.The former Union minister has dismissed the allegations as “false, fabricated and deeply distressing”.

19-09-2020||New Delhi||New Education Policy aims to achieve twin objectives of inclusion, excellence: Prez Kovind||The new National Education Policy (NEP) aims to reorient the education system towards meeting the needs of the 21st century by achieving the twin objectives of inclusion and excellence, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Saturday.Addressing the Visitors’ Conference on ‘Implementation of National Education Policy 2020 in Higher Education’, the President said the policy sets the vision of developing an equitable and vibrant knowledge society by providing quality education to all.“Higher education institutions have a greater responsibility for making India a global knowledge superpower. The quality standards set as a benchmark by these institutions would be followed by other institutions,” the President said.He said the fundamental principles of the new policy included inculcating creativity and critical thinking in order to encourage logical decision-making and innovation.“The NEP also seeks to encourage critical thinking and spirit of enquiry. Effective implementation of the policy is likely to restore India’s glory as a great centre of learning as during the times of Takshashila and Nalanda,” he said.Drawing inspiration from the “Bhagavad Gita” and the Krishna-Arjun dialogue, the President reiterated the concept of free communication and discussion between the teacher and the student.“The National Education Policy aims to reorient the education system towards meeting the needs of the 21st century by achieving the twin objectives of inclusion and excellence. It sets the vision of developing an equitable and vibrant knowledge society by providing quality education to all,” he said.Listing the features of the new policy, Kovind said that it would also introduce the system of the academic bank of credits.“It would digitally store the academic credits earned from various higher education institutions so that degrees can be awarded, taking into account the credits earned by students. This would allow students the freedom to take courses as per their vocational, professional or intellectual requirements in addition to giving flexibility of suitable exit and re-entry points,” he said.“The need for strict monitoring of B.Ed, vocational and distance-learning courses is also being taken care of in this policy,” he added.Noting that the target of the NEP was to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio or GER in higher education to 50 per cent by 2035, the President observed that the online system of education could also be utilised to reach this target, especially in catering to the female students or those who do not have physical access to educational institutions as well as international students.Citing statistics, the President added that according to All India Survey of Higher Education for 2018-19, the GER for females was slightly higher than that for males.“However, the share of female students is extremely low in institutions of national importance and particularly low in technical education. Such gender disparity in higher education should be corrected. It would be the role of head of institutions that would have an impact on the teachers and students and hence the heads of organizations should take an active interest in implementing the policy,” Kovind said.Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ expressed hope that the new education policy would decentralise and strengthen the country’s education system.“The focus is to improve the quality of education standards in our country,” he said, adding the policy has given access to foreign universities to open campuses in India and vice-versa which will be instrumental in the process of making India a soft power.“All hurdles in the process of implementation of NEP should be overcome and dialogue should be established with all stakeholders. The support of all sections is imperative in brainstorming about the implementing process,” he said.Vice Chancellors of all Central Universities and Directors of IITs, NITs and other institutions participated in the conference.The NEP approved by the Union Cabinet in July replaces the National Policy on Education framed in 1986 and is aimed at paving the way for “transformational reforms” in schools and higher education systems to make India a “global knowledge superpower”.

19-09-2020||Mumbai||Sena questions Modi govt's policies, praises Vajpayee-era NDA||The Shiv Sena on Saturday questioned the Modi government's policies on economy, trade and agriculture, and alleged that it was moving towards privatisation of airports, Air India and railways and giving the control of farmers' lives to traders and private players.The party also alleged that the Centre introduced Bills on agriculture "without consulting" its allies,farmers' organisationsor opposition parties, and said the resignation of Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has brought the issue to the fore.In an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Sena said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) during the time of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior BJP leader L K Advani was "different" as they used to "treat the NDA constituents with respect and consult with them"."Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) member Harsimrat Kaur Badal has resigned from the Union Cabinet. The Modi government brought two anti-farmers bills (in Parliament) and she resigned in protest. Her resignation has been accepted. The Shiv Sena has already walked out of the NDA and now comes the SAD's move," it said."During the time of Vajpayee and Advani, the NDA allies used to be treated with respect, affection and trust.There used to be consultations on policy decisions and BJP leaders would hear out the views of the allies. In those times, spoken word had value," the Sena said."Like Maharashtra, Punjab is an agrarian economy.Hence, before introducing the farmers' Bills, the government should have held talks with the representatives of farmers' organisations and agriculture expertsin Maharashtra, Punjab and the rest of the country," it added.The Bills propose to create a system wherein traders can purchase farmers' products even outside 'mandis'. The Congress, DMK and Trinamool Congress opposed this proposal.They think it is anti-farmers, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said."The Centre is pushing for privatisation of airports, Air India, ports, railways, insurance companies, and also giving control of farmers' lives to traders and private players. The Modi government's policies regarding economy, trade, agriculture create doubts," it alleged."The government says that the new system would benefit farmers. Even if one believes it to be true, what was the harm in holding consultations with a few leading farmer leaders in the country? It should have at least held talks with NCP chief Sharad Pawar. But this government has nothing to do with the words 'dialogue' or 'consultation'," the Sena said.The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill.Harsimrat Kaur Badal said her decision to resign from the Union Cabinet to protest the farm sector bills symbolises her "party's vision, its glorious legacy and its commitment to go to any extent to safeguard the interests of farmers".

19-09-2020||Islamabad||Pakistan risks Basmati export as India applies GI tag in EU||Pakistan is facing another potential threat of major damage to its exports as India has applied for an exclusive Geographical Indications (GI) tag to Basmati rice in the European Union (EU).Pakistan on the other hand is still yet to implement the GI law promulgated in March.Despite the fact that Pakistan produces a wide range of Basmati rice in the country and benefits from its export to the EU and other parts of the globe, New Delhi has said that it is an Indian-origin product in its application, published on EU's official journal on September 11.As per the Indian application, Basmati is special long grain aromatic rice grown and produced in a particular geographical region of the Indian sub-continent.It added that this region is a part of northern India, below the foothills of the Himalayas forming part of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP).“The special characteristic of Basmati is grown and produced in all districts of the state of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand as well as in specific districts of western Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir,” the Indian application maintained.Leading Pakistani rice exporters have called on the government to immediately oppose the Indian application.“Indian application at EU must be opposed immediately as it would badly damage Pakistani exports to European countries,” said Taufiq Ahmed, a leading exporter and bearer of Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP).“Despite repeated requests and reminders, concerned authorities in Pakistan have been ignoring this serious issue for years and now if the problem is not handled swiftly then we would be left with no option but to sell Basmati rice with an Indian name or brand,” he added.Ahmed said that Pakistan must come in immediate consultation with international dictionaries to rectify the definition as the same rice is largely produced in the country.“Apart from opposing the GI tag from the EU, Pakistan must also consult international dictionaries to rectify the definition. Unfortunately, India is also regarding Himalayan salt and Multani Mitti with Indian names in the international market,” he said.The official sources from the Federal Ministry of Commerce said that the Indian application in the EU will definitely be opposed.They added that since the GI law has been promulgated, Islamabad would take up the issue of all GI products of Pakistani origin with the EU.“Basmati was already recognized as a product of both India and Pakistan in the European Rice Regime and its Duty-Free Regime, making it illegal for India to claim exclusive rights of Basmati in the EU,” said an official from the Intellectual Property Organisation (IPO), an attached department of the Ministry of Commerce.“The Cambridge dictionary and Wikipedia also show the product as originating from Pakistan and India,” he added.Pakistan enacted the Geographical Indications (Registration and Protection) Act in March this year, which gives it the right to oppose Indian application for registration of Basmati rice exclusive rights.As per the EU’s official journal, any country can oppose the application for registration of a name pursuant to Article 50(2) (a) of Regulations (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs within three months from the date of publication.

19-09-2020||New Delhi||Oppn asks govt for relief to common man on lines of pause in insolvency proceedings against firms||Opposition parties Saturday demanded in the Rajya Sabha that the government waive interest on loans to farmers and individuals for the coronavirus pandemic period on the lines of a pause in insolvency proceedings against defaulting corporates.Participating in a debate, KK Ragesh of CPI (M) said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and other members have told the House that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill has been brought to save businesses and corporates.“Why the same logic is not applied in the case of farmers? Farmers are also bankrupt. Why the government is not taking any responsibility and any initiative in waiving the farmers’ loans?” he asked.Ragesh said the government could have at least considered to “waive the interest on farmers loans during the moratorium period”.Also read: Amid 'Act of God' jibe, RS passes IBC amendment BillGovt to withdraw 3 Labour Ministry Bills in Lok SabhaRajya Sabha passes bill to punish those attacking healthcare workersDMK member P Wilson said: “There is discrimination between the common man and corporate. Why is this discrimination? Is the government here for crony corporates?”        He demanded the government waive off recovery as well as repayment of all bank loans and credit card bills.Wilson asked for a complete waiver of agriculture term loans.Initiating the debate, Congress member Vivek Tankha said the government should protect only those businesses which are affected by COVID-19 pandemic and not all defaulters.He said the Section 10-A in the Bill states that no application for initiation of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) would be filed for any default, whether COVID-19 related or not, arising on or after March 25 for a period of six months or such period not exceeding one year from such date as may be notified.The Congress leader asked the government whether it was sure that the coronavirus pandemic would end in one year.“When you are suspending Section 7,9,10, I think it’s a makeshift solution to a long-standing problem. There is no certainty that the economy will revive in one year.”He pointed out that Gross NPA of banks went up from Rs 2.63 lakh crore in March 2014 to Rs 10.3 lakh crore in March 2018.“The NPA and defaulting problems are pre-pandemic and Section 10-A would only postpone the problem and not solve it,” Tankha said, adding the creditors would be in the worst position with likely erosion in the value of assets.“The entire object of the IBC Code is compromised by this amendment. The Code aims to prevent wilful default by companies. However, the blanket bar on Section 7,9,10 will enable many companies which are already under defaulting categories to use the notification as a shield to protect themselves in future proceedings. Do we want to protect COVID-19 category of industries or all industries irrespective of their performance in the past? Section 10-A does not make a distinction between COVID-19 defaults and other defaults,” he said.About giving relief under the IBC, Arun Singh (BJP) said: “It was very much needed. It was very difficult to find out which transaction is COVID related. If my friends can tell that these are COVID-related transactions and these are not related to that then I will be very happy. But it is simply impossible.”TMC member Dinesh Trivedi said: “The intention of the bill is good. But you are in a hurry to do things without larger consultations. That is why the Bill is hastily drafted and an ill-worded piece of legislation, which would defeat its own purpose.”He said: “We have a record level of food stocks. Oil prices are historically low...The need of the hour is to put, maybe Rs 10,000 or Rs 15,000 or Rs 20,000, into the bank accounts of needy people.”Trivedi said this would help in creating demand, generating more jobs and more tax revenues for the government.SP leader Ravi Verma was of the view that this Bill will support big corporate and also asked the government about the wilful defaulters who have fled the country.Verma alleged insolvency professionals are charging very hefty fees and generally eat up a large chunk of haircut.Amar Patnaik (BJD) asked the government to improve the quality of debt resolution as well as the competence of insolvency professionals.AIADMK leader A Vijaykumar suggested that cooperative societies not be brought under the insolvency code.

It had served in the UK’s Royal Navy as HMS Hermes and named INS Viraat after being inducted in the Indian Navy.There were attempts to convert ‘Viraat’ into a museum or a restaurant but none of the plans fructified.#Viraat Callsign "Romeo Two Two" - End of an era, a glorious chapter in the history of @indiannavy. She departs #Mumbai today for her final journey. Old ships never die, their spirit lives on https://t.co/fRDe7wIfLK  Alang-based Shree Ram group has won the bid for dismantling the ship. The company’s high capacity tugs are towing the vessel to Alang and it would take two days to complete the journey, an official said.Alang, a beach town, houses the world’s biggest ship breaking yard.“#Viraat Callsign ‘Romeo Two Two’ — End of an era, a glorious chapter in the history of @indiannavy.

These are Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, according to the orders issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation on September 18.The Open Sky Policy had been adopted by the central government in 1990 that allowed air taxi-operators to operate flights from any airport, both on a charter and a non-charter basis and to decide their own flight schedules, cargo and passenger fares.The earlier policy on the subject promulgated by the DGCA in May 1992 had stated that cargo flights by scheduled and non-scheduled operators, both Indian and foreign, may be cleared freely from airports where customs and immigration facilities are available. Cargo flights into India were also permitted.In 1993, there were 11 operators in India with a fleet of 27 aircraft holding non-scheduled operators permit. By 2019, this sector had grown to 98 operators and 317 aircraft. DGCA data reveals that while Indian non-scheduled operators carried 4,752 passengers in the international segment in 2018-19, no cargo was carried that year.The fresh limitations on airports that can be used will not apply to all-cargo flights operated under humanitarian and emergency needs through the United Nations and other multilateral bodies of which India is a member.All-cargo flights hired by or carrying cargo belonging to any central and state government ministry, department of public sector undertaking will also be permitted to operate with requisite priority to and from any airport in India where customs and immigration facilities are available.DGCA has also said that Indian operators facing any systemic and non-systemic discriminatory and restrictive practices or regulatory impediments in operating international cargo flights in any of the foreign countries should bring such issues to its knowledge for appropriate action.Foreign carriers will have to apply for clearances for cargo flights to the DGCA which reserves the right to deny permission for operating such flights. Flight operators are required to meet the stipulated operational and safety requirements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-restricts-cargo-flights-by-non-scheduled-foreign-operators-to-6-airports-143439

The Congress’s proposals would have given them that. Once that is accomplished, the Congress manifesto promise on repealing the APMC Act and making trade in agricultural produce free would be a natural sequel in course of time. While our promise is clear, the Modi government has surrendered to the corporates and traders,” said the ex-finance minister.He said the two Farm Bills the Lok Sabha passed do not contain the clause that the price that the farmer will get from the private purchaser shall not be less than the MSP.“Why is such a clause absent? The Bills undermine the only regulated market available to the farmer today, without creating thousands of alternative markets that will be accessible to the farmer. The Bills assume perversely that the farmer and the private purchaserhave equal bargaining power. They do not. The small farmer will be at the mercy of the private purchaser. If a dispute arises between the farmer and the private purchaser, the machinery under the Bills is so bureaucratic and convoluted that no farmer will have the strength or the resources to fight the purchaser. The small and medium farmer will be ruined,” warned Chidambaram.He said the Bills undermined the three pillars of our food security system—MSP, public procurement and PDS.Suspended Congress spokesman Sanjay Jha needles partySanjay Jha, suspended from the Congress, needled his own party saying the Congress had promised abolition of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Act. He tweeted, “Dear Fellow Congress-people, One must oppose PM Modi whenever justified; that's par for the course. But let's not make it a mindless obsession. On #APMC, there is a simple test: Does not APMC abolition end monopoly/cartels & so boost farmer's income? If YES, back the bills.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-bills-chidambaram-says-pm-distorting-congress-manifesto-promise-143429

The remaining three arrested from Kerala also reportedly originally hail from West Bengal. According to an NIA press release, the group was planning to undertake terrorist attacks at vital installations with an aim to kill innocent people and create an atmosphere of fear in the country.The accused are being produced before the concerned courts in Kerala and West Bengal for police custody to facilitate further investigation.Exiled Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen also expressed concern after learning about the incident. “9 Al-Qaeda terrorists were arrested today. 6 from Bengal, and 3 from Kerala.

The General Debate will commence on September 22 and run through September 29.Modi will deliver the national statement on September 26 through a pre-recorded video statement.The vision Modi outlines at these two high-level meetings will be closely watched as it comes ahead of India taking a seat at the powerful UN Security Council as an elected non-permanent member for a two-year term beginning January 1, 2021.An effective response to international terrorism, reforming multilateral systems, comprehensive approach to peace and security, technology with a human touch and inclusive solutions to foster development are India's priorities for its UNSC tenure and these are reflected in the declaration that the UN will adapt to mark 75 years of its founding.Last year, Modi travelled to New York to attend the high-level annual General Assembly session after addressing a mega diaspora event 'Howdy, Modi!' held on September 22. US President Donald Trump also addressed the gathering of over 50,000 Indian-Americans.This year, for the first time in the UN's 75-year history, Heads of State and Government will not be arriving in New York for the General Assembly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and have submitted pre-recorded video statements for the various summits and sessions that will be played in the iconic General Assembly hall.Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar will address the UN Summit on Biodiversity, which will be convened by the President of the General Assembly on September 30 under the theme of ‘Urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development'.India is a leading contributor to “climate action” and over the past few years, it has reduced 38 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually.

19-09-2020||New Delhi||India overtakes US to bag top spot in terms of COVID-19 recoveries||“In a landmark global achievement, India has overtaken the US and become the top country in terms of COVID-19 recoveries,” the Health Ministry said on Saturday.The country has reported the highest number of recoveries with 42,08,431 COVID-19 patients having recovered from the disease so far, pushing the national recovery rate to nearly 80 per cent while the case fatality rate has further dropped to 1.61 per cent, the Ministry said.“India now accounts for close to 19 per cent of the total global recoveries. This has strongly pushed the national recovery rate to 79.28 per cent,” it underlined.Also read: Nation sees more single-day recoveries than new casesThe Centre-led focussed, calibrated, responsive and effective measures of early identification through high and aggressive testing, prompt surveillance and tracking, coupled with standardised high-quality clinical care, had together resulted in this global achievement, the Ministry said.A record 95,880 patients recuperated from COVID-19 in a span of 24 hours, with 90 per cent of the new recoveries reported from 16 states and Union Territories, the Ministry’s data updated at 8 am showed.About 60 per cent of the new recoveries were reported from five states — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh — the Ministry said.Maharashtra accounted for over 22,000 (23 per cent) while Andhra Pradesh accounted for more than 11,000 (12.3 per cent) of the new recoveries.According to the Ministry, 90 per cent of the recoveries were reported from 15 states and Union Territories.The five states with the maximum caseload — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh — have also accounted for a majority of the recoveries, the Ministry highlighted.“India has maintained a sustained path of reporting a very high number of recoveries. This is the result of focussed strategies leading to coordinated effective actions in the states and Union Territories,” it said.The Ministry has issued a comprehensive standard of care, clinical management and treatment protocols.Drawing from emerging global evidence, these have been regularly revised and strengthened. The country has allowed for rational use of “investigational therapies” such as Remdesevir, convalescent plasma and Tocilizumab and adopted measures such as proning, use of high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, use of steroids and anti-coagulants to aid the recovery of COVID patients.Supervised home or facility isolation for mild and moderate cases and improved ambulance services for ferrying patients for a prompt and timely treatment have enabled seamless and efficient patient management.The AIIMS, New Delhi has hand-held the states and Union territories for enhancing the clinical management skills of the doctors in the ICUs through the “National e-ICU on COVID-19 Management” and the centres of excellence.“Held twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays, the sessions have aided in the substantial increase of the total nationwide recovered cases and maintaining a low and steadily declining mortality rate. Nineteen such National e-ICUs have been held, covering 249 hospitals of 28 states and Union territories till date,” the Ministry informed.The Centre has been regularly reviewing the assistance provided to the states and Union Territories.Several high-level, multi-specialist central teams have been deployed, which support the states and Union Territories in strengthening containment, surveillance, testing and efficient clinical management.The Centre has also been regularly reviewing the availability of medical oxygen in hospitals and other health facilities.“These have played a critical intervention role in India’s high recoveries and maintained a low case fatality rate (CFR), which has dropped to 1.61 per cent,” the Ministry said.India’s COVID-19 tally mounted to 53,08,014 on Saturday with 93,337 cases reported in a day, while the death toll due to the disease climbed to 85,619 with 1,247 more people succumbing to it in a span of 24 hours, the ministry said.

19-09-2020||New Delhi||Amid 'Act of God' jibe, RS passes IBC amendment Bill||The Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (2nd amendment) Bill, 2020 even as a opposition member took a jibe at Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 'act of God' statement vis-a-vis the coronavirus pandemic's effect on the economy.The Bill seeks to replace the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, which was promulgated on June 5 to prohibit initiation of insolvency proceedings for defaults arising during the six months from March 25 that is extendable up to one year.Sitharaman strongly defended the proposed amendment and addressed individual concerns of the Rajya Sabha MPs, including those who were extremely critical of the government move.Also read: Oppn asks govt for relief to common man on lines of pause in insolvency proceedings against firmsGovt to withdraw 3 Labour Ministry Bills in Lok SabhaRajya Sabha passes bill to punish those attacking healthcare workers"The situation before us in March was clearly about putting lives before livelihood. When the PM announced the Janata Curfew, he said it was a preventive remedy and did not know how long it will last. Naturally, the lockdown impacted businesses and financial market. But did we just sit and watch? No," Sitharaman said in a prelude to why the government brought forth various ordinances in the first place.But Communist Party of India's Binoy Viswam hit out at Sitharaman for her "act of God' comment in the recent past. "The Indian economy is in bad shape. She is saying these are all acts of God. Don't accuse God; God is not the culprit," he remarked.Sitharaman meanwhile elaborated that the suspension of Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the IBC took place to prevent businesses from getting pushed into insolvency. She highlighted how the IBC had served its purpose as far as the NPAs of scheduled commercial banks were concerned. "The priority is to keep the companies going rather than liquidate them," she said .While discussing the Bill, BJP MP Arun Singh defended it while taking a dig at the Congress, but without naming it, during a mention of the NPAs. He maintained that the bank NPAs have since come down, calling the amendment Bill a remarkable and bold step. The BJP MP also reeled out statistics, including on ease of doing business ranking, to make his point about the success of the Bill.Congress member Vivek Tankha said that the enactment of Section 10 will be counterproductive. He added that there was no certainty as to how long the coronavirus pandemic would continue. He claimed that small traders would be affected while the government was trying to protect big corporates.Nationalist Congress Party's Praful Patel said that his party supported the amendments since the government's goal was temporary and that there might be more amendments required in the future. He also urged the government to "hand-hold" a few businesses.Amar Patnaik of the Biju Janata Dal asked since the IBC had been fairly successful since 2016, what was the need for the three ordinances. CPI-M's KK Ragesh said that since the ordinance prohibited insolvency proceedings for a year it would push the banking sector to a crisis.

19-09-2020||Washington||Concept of Indo-Pacific incorporated India into larger solution: US||The concept of the Indo-Pacific has incorporated India into the larger solution and the Trump administration is developing new arrangements to coordinate with like-minded partners like the Quad countries, a top American diplomat has told lawmakers.In November 2017, India, the US, Australia and Japan gave shape to the long-pending "Quad" Coalition to develop a new strategy with an aim to contain China's growing influence and develop a new strategy for keeping the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.The Indo-Pacific is a bio-geographic region, comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam claim parts of it."You've seen India has come on very strong in this regard. The concept of the Indo-Pacific has incorporated India into the larger solution," David Stilwell, the Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a hearing on 'Engagement With China in the Indo-Pacific', on Thursday.He said the US was reinforcing its security commitments.Security assistance helps partners protect their sovereignty and maritime resources, Stillwell said."We have doubled development assistance to Pacific Island partners through the Pacific pledge. We are developing new arrangements to coordinate with like-minded partners. In September 2013, the first quad ministerial-level meeting of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan marked a new milestone in Indo-Pacific diplomatic engagement," he said.Stillwell said that the resilience of the strength of America's global alliances and partnerships was paramount to addressing strategic competition with China, and in no region is this more true than the Indo-Pacific."Our Indo-Pacific vision is about supporting the sovereignty, autonomy, and pluralism of Indo-Pacific states facing Beijing's attempts to dominate the region. We support a region that is open to trade and investment, free from coercion and security," he said."The United States, in a diverse cohort of allies and partners, now speaks clearly in terms of the Indo-Pacific. Similar concepts have been put forward by Japan, India, Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea, as well as by ASEAN in the ASEAN outlook for the Indo-Pacific, showing remarkable alignment across our partners," Stillwell said.The US has advanced its economic initiatives in lockstep with allies and partners in areas like high standard infrastructure, energy security, investment screening, among others."We are strengthening commercial diplomacy to boost alternatives to PRC (People's Republic of China) predatory economics that leaves countries saddled with unsustainable debt and vulnerable to political and economic pressures," he said.To promote good governance, the US launched the Indo-Pacific Transparency Initiative two years ago, which has programmes focused on particular vectors of Chinese influence, including corruption, disinformation, and information control and coercive financing, he said.Senator James Risch, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that China's primary foreign policy objective was to achieve regional supremacy in the Indo-Pacific and then to use that dominant position to propel itself into becoming a leading world power.Ranking Member Bob Menendez said that China was now displaying global ambitions."I think many on this committee have concerns that the administration's strategies and policies to deal with this new China still fall well short of answering the enormity of the challenge,” he said."China today, led by the Communist Party and propelled by Xi Jinping's hyper-nationalism, is unlike any challenge we have faced as a nation before. As we will have an opportunity to discuss today, China is more active and more assertive around the globe than ever before," Menendez said.He said that 5G is perhaps the best example where the United States did not adequately emphasise European alternatives to Huawei while simply pressuring its allies.Senator Mitt Romney said that geopolitically Chinese are rising, and not the United States. “They are lining up people to support them. People who in the past have not supported them are now coming to their side. That's in part because they see where the power goes. Friends often go where they believe their interest is going to be best protected. As China becomes stronger, we may find that they are able to collect something which they've never had before, which is France,” he said.“I think President Trump was right to confront China and to push back against their trade practices. I think he made a mistake by not doing so in collaboration with our allies and being able to have much more clout pushing against them,” Romney said and praised Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to have spoken so forcefully to awaken allies to the threat posed by China and to encourage collaboration with them.Romney asked if US allies and other nations that follow the rule of law, whether, you know, India, Japan, South Korea, the EU, are poised to combine at some point and to develop a collaborative trade policy which will exert such pressure on China that they will be diverted from the course and move towards comporting with the international order.

19-09-2020||New Delhi||Govt should engage with international media to build pressure on Pakistan: BJD's Sasmit Patra in Rajya Sabha||Demand for the government escalating its engagements with the international media to build a global opinion against Pakistan for sponsoring cross-border terrorism and harbouring fugitives, such as Dawood Ibrahim, was made in the Rajya Sabha on Saturday.Through a Zero Hour mention, Sasmit Patra of the BJD said the government should also engage with the G-8 nations to increase international pressure on Pakistan just like its engagement with the US that reflected in the recent Indo-US joint asking Pakistan to ensure that no territory under its control was used for terrorist activities.With international pressure building, and in an attempt to come out from the Financial Action Task Force’s grey list, Pakistan recently banned 88 terrorists, including Hafiz Saeed, Masood Azhar and Dawood Ibrahim.Patra said while the Indian media had reported on the address and the assets of Dawood Ibrahim in Pakistan, the international media hasn’t done that.The government should “escalate matter through engagement with international media”, he said, adding it should also use Parliamentarian just as the US administration associates with senators.BSP Rajya Sabha member Rajaram raised the issue of only two per cent reservation being provided to the OBCs and eight per cent to the SCs in Jammu.This, despite the OBCs constituting 35 per cent of the population in the region, and the SCs 17 per cent, was unfair, he said.BSP supremo Mayawati had supported the government on the scrapping of Article 370 in August last year in hope that the central policies such as that on reservation would get fully implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, she said.“But even after more than a year, the reservation for OBCs is stuck at two per cent and that for SCs at eight per cent, well below the national average,” she said.Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu asked Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy to find out if the reason for the delay was administrative or due to pending census.Priyanka Chaturvedi of the Shiv Sena sought that relaxation in the age limit for candidates from reserved categories in educational institutions and jobs be also extended to those from the economically weaker sections (EWS).“The EWS is provided 10 per cent reservation but no relaxation in the age limit is given to them,” she said.Derek O’Brien (TMC) wanted the Central government to replicate the West Bengal model of paying cash to artists and artisans to support the informal sector ahead of the festive season.Neeraj Shekhar (BJP) demanded inclusion of the Bhojpuri language in the 8th Schedule as it is spoken by 20 crore people in India and 7-8 crore in countries such as Mauritius, the Maldives, Uganda, Surinam and Nepal.Ahmed Patel of the Congress sought the constitution of a task force to frame rules for conducting online classes for schoolchildren and provide help to those from the weaker sections of society who cannot afford digital education mediums such as computers or smartphones.KJ Alphons (BJP) wanted the government to not slow down the fight against Tuberculosis because of the coronavirus pandemic and instead intensify tracking for Tuberculosis cases.YS Chowdary (BJP) sought measures for water conservation and management to avoid future catastrophe.

19-09-2020||Mukesh Ranjan||NIA arrests 9 suspected Al-Qaeda terrorists from Kerala, West Bengal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 19In a significant breakthrough, the National Investigation Agency, (NIA) conducted searches and raids at Ernakulam (Kerala) and Murshidabad (West Bengal) in the wee hours of Saturday and arrested nine suspected terrorists for their alleged association with Pakistan-sponsored module of the Al-Qaeda in the country.A senior NIA official said the agency got a tip-off about an inter-state module of Al-Qaeda the operatives at various locations in India, including West-Bengal and Kerala, which was allegedly planning to undertake terrorist attacks at vital installations in India with an aim to kill innocent people and strike terror in their minds.“Accordingly, the NIA registered a case and initiated investigation,” the official said, adding that the raids were part of this exercise.Also read: Terrorists’ arrest prompts Guv Dhankhar to fire fresh salvo at MamataThose arrested include six from West-Bengal and three from Kerala, the official said. The six terrorists arrested from Murshidabad are Abu Sufiyan, Mainul Mondal, Leu Yean Ahmed, Al Mamun Kamal and Atitur Rehman, the agency official said. From Kerala, the NIA picked up terrorists from Ernakulam and are Murshid Hasan, Iyakub Biswas and Mosaraf Hossen.Hasan is the leader of the gang and those arrested from Kerala are also originally residents of West Bengal, the NIA spokesperson said.“The operations were conducted in the early morning. Large quantities of incriminating materials, including digital devices, documents, jihadi literature, sharp weapons, country-made firearms, a locally fabricated body armour, articles and literature used for making home-made explosive devices have been seized from their possession,” the official said.The NIA said in its initial investigation that it was found that these individuals were highly radicalised by Pakistan-based Al-Qaeda terrorists on social media and were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places, including the National Capital Region. Some members of the gang were also planning to travel to New Delhi to procure arms and ammunition.A closely-monitored operation of the NIA and other central agencies began on September 11 when the premier investigating agency registered a case to probe the Al-Qaeda module.According to the official, crackers were being attempted to be converted into an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and the NIA recovered switches and batteries from Abu Sufiyan's house during the raids.The group was also planning to go to Kashmir for weapons delivery as it intended to launch terror attacks on vital installations in the country with an aim to kill innocent people, the official said.The arrests of the operatives had pre-empted possible terrorist strikes in various parts of the country, an NIA official said.“For this purpose, the module was actively indulging in fundraising and a few members of the gang were planning to travel to New Delhi to procure arms and ammunition. These arrests have pre-empted possible terrorist attacks in various parts of the country,” the official said, adding that the arrested terrorists will be produced before the concerned special courts in Kerala and West Bengal for police custody and further investigation.The nine accused will be produced before the concerned courts in Kerala and West Bengal for police custody to facilitate further investigation.According to the officials investigating the case, the arrested men are highly radicalised and were getting instructions from foreign handlers, including Pakistan-based al-Qaeda operatives, in cyberspace.The module was planning to target vital installations in India as well as targeted killings.It was in the advanced stage of procuring arms (including automatic rifles and pistols), ammunition and explosives to carry out attacks.Some of its members were trying to develop expertise in IED-making too.Besides, the module was trying to establish a well-organised Al-Qaeda network in different parts of the country, including the northeast and Jammu and Kashmir, on the instructions of the Pakistan-based handlers, the official said. — With inputs from PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-arrests-9-suspected-al-qaeda-terrorists-from-kerala-west-bengal-143395
19-09-2020||Washington||Protesters did not spare even Gandhi’s statue: Trump||US President Donald Trump has said that the protesters, who went violent in the aftermath of the death of African-American George Floyd, did not spare even the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Washington DC, describing the demonstrators as a "bunch of thugs".Floyd died in Minneapolis on May 25 after white police officer Derek Chauvin handcuffed and pinned him to the ground, and knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes while the 46-year-old from Houston gasped for breath.The footage, which went viral, showed Floyd pleading with the officer, saying he can't breathe. His death sparked nationwide violent protests with some protesters resorting to vandalism, looting and rioting across the country, leaving behind a trail of destruction."You know, they started ripping down Abraham Lincoln. When they hit Lincoln, I said wait a minute. This is the man and you can do - then they hit George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. They had everybody,” Trump said at a well-attended election rally in Minnesota, a state that he lost by a little over 44,000 votes in 2016, on Friday.He also mentioned about the statue of Gandhi in Washington DC that was vandalised by miscreants at the peak of the nationwide protests."They even had Gandhi. All Gandhi wanted was one thing, peace. Right? We have peace. Rip down his statue. We don't like him. I don't think they have any idea what they're doing," Trump said."I think they're just a bunch of thugs, okay, you want to know the truth. I think they're a bunch of thugs," he said.The president told his cheering audience that he had signed an executive order that would put such miscreants in jail for 10 years.Now, nobody even talks about taking statues down, he said.The vandalised statue was restored later by the Embassy of India here, with the help of National Park Police and the State Department."We had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments, and I said to my people four months ago, I said this is crazy. These people--and they don't even know," Trump said.Now that he has signed an executive order, Trump said that nobody had showed up in four months to take down a statue."Because you know why? They look and they say I want to take on that statue. I'm going to take down that statue. That statue's coming down. And then somebody says, you know, it's 10 years in jail. They go that's too much. I'm getting out of here. It's true," he said amidst laughter."Ten years is not acceptable. Ten years is a lot to rip down a statue, have a little fun, especially when they have no idea what they're ripping down. But we have an idea what they're ripping down. They're ripping down, in many cases, greatness. They're ripping down our past. They're ripping down our history," he said."That's where these guys begin. The take away your history. You look at the Middle East. You look all over. Look what ISIS did. Look what all of them do. They go down and they go to museums and they break everything and they rip everything. They want to take away your past. They are not taking away the past of the United States of America. Not as long as I'm here," Trump said.

More important than clapping for Covid warriors is ensuring their dignity. Why this insult to warriors?” Gandhi asked tweeting government answer in Parliament that it did not have the entire data on death of Covid warriors since health is a state subject.Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey informed the Rajya Sabha this week that health was a state subject and “such data is not maintained at Central level by Ministry of Health”. This was in response to a question on the number of healthcare staff, including doctors, nurses, support staff and ASHA workers, who have been affected by the virus or died due to it. The IMA has published a list of 382 doctors, who have died of Covid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-insult-covid-warriors-rahul-asks-centre-143336

19-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Farm Bills: Those at odds now jointly opposing Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 18Every story has two sides, but the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three agriculture-related ordinances has more than that with farmers, middlemen (arhtiyas), states and the Centre, adding to various facets.As agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar points out, sides traditionally at odds (farmers and arhtiyas) are now jointly opposing the BJP-led Centre. And, these protesters are aided by Opposition, farmers’ organisations and activists.‘Not a first Stir’The PM is trying to suppress reality with these allegations. Farmers’ ‘virodh’ has not happened for the first time. We have fought several battles against the government. — Yudhvir Singh, BKU general secretary‘Work like bridge’These Bills will ruin the agriculture marketing network created in five decades. Arhtiyas work like a bridge & take the responsibility of quality and quantity of govt stock. — Ravinder Cheema, Arhtiya Assn chief, PunjabPerhaps, the real issue is too technical with apprehensions about the threat of new ecosystem, rendering the MSP structure irrelevant. The Tribune talked to different sides to understand the dynamics of the growing agitation.After the PM accused the Opposition of misleading farmers, BKU general secretary Yudhvir Singh said, “The PM is trying to suppress reality with these allegations. Farmers’ ‘virodh’ has not happened for the first time. We have fought several battles against the government.”“Yes, farmers are exploited by arhtiyas, but the aim should have been to fix that lacuna in the system. Procurement at the MSP is only for a limited period and farmers who are not able to sell during that are forced to sell at lower prices to arhtiyas, but the same group will step if the system changes. The government is acting at the behest of the WTO, World Bank and the IMF,” says the BKU leader.Upset with PM’s attempt to “eliminate middleman”, arhtiyas say they are the and integral part of the foodgrain procurement network system working for benefit of both farmers and government agencies. Ravinder Singh Cheema, president of the Punjab Arhtiya Association, says: “Arhtiyas work like a bridge, take the responsibility of quality and quantity of the government stock up to 45 days in procurement season and protect farmers against officials. If the government does not change the decision, the central agency will not be allowed to purchase a single grain from Punjab and Haryana,” he added.BJP president JP Nadda says: “The UPA in 2013-14 de-notified fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act in its states. The Congress in its 2019 manifesto made it clear that it will repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees Act.” However, Panwar believes implementation of new agriculture legislations will be difficult. There are many reasons, but most important is “lack of consultations with stakeholders”. “Punjab and Haryana will be affected the most because of loss of mandi tax, which a good source of revenue. While arhtiyas will lose their work, farmers are apprehensive about the functioning of the new land contract system,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-bills-those-at-odds-now-jointly-opposing-centre-143329

This study used six components to measure happiness — work and work-related issues such as earnings and growth; relationships, including family and friends; physical and mental health; philanthropy; spiritual orientation; and the impact of COVID-19 on happiness. All these components are found to be significant in the regression analysis and explain the differences in happiness scores,” Pillania, currently teaching at MDI Gurugram, told The Tribune.He also found that India sustained well through the COVID-19 pandemic.“The spirit of India is quite resilient and the impact of COVID-19 varied across states and UTs. Maharashtra, Delhi and Haryana showed the worst possible impact of COVID-19 on happiness; Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir remained neutral while Manipur, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and the Lakshadweep showed the best impact of COVID-19 on happiness,” said the researcher whose report includes signed articles by top happiness experts in the world.Pillania found that while correlations between gender and happiness were not significant, marital status, education, and incomes were positively related to happiness. “Results show married people are happier than unmarried people. A long-term Harvard study that followed people through 70 years also found that those in stable relationships were happier than others. I plan to publish the India Happiness Report every year,” says Pillania.Asked what prompted his project, the academician said though the World Happiness Report Covered India, it was insufficient for a diverse country like ours.Research makes a strong case for supporting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with measures of subjective well-being and happiness.India’s first Happiness Report’s instant objective is to create more interest in the topic and long-term objective is to inform policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mizoram-punjab-happiest-states-andaman-nicobar-happiest-ut-report-143309

West Bengal goes to the Assembly poll in May next year.While for the BJP, West Bengal is the frontier state in eastern India to be won, the ruling TMC wants to return to power for the third consecutive term.The BJP has never been in power in the state. On the contrary, its rivals have ruled it individually on their own in the past.The Congress and the Left parties will in all probability contest the coming Assembly election in alliance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-tmc-led-protest-in-parliament-cong-left-out-143303

The House was adjourned four times between 4 pm and 6 pm.Replying to queries by the Opposition on the need to create PM Cares Fund, Thakur said the earlier Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund was created by “Nehru ji like a royal order”.“From 1948 till today, it has not been registered. How did it get the FCRA (foreign contribution) clearance?” he said.Alleging misuse of funds, he said, “You created a trust for the Gandhi family. Nehru and Sonia Gandhi were its members.This should be investigated.”This led to pandemonium in the House with Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary hitting back: “Have we said (PM Narendra) Modi is stealing from funds? How could he (Anurag) use such words for Nehru.” Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi demanded an apology from Thakur.

It should not be suspended for two years. My suggestion to the govt will be to reduce it for one year and in that one year Rs2.5 crore fund be kept — Ghulam Nabi Azad, Leader of OppositionHowever, MPs cutting across party lines, except for the ruling BJP, asked the government to restore the suspended MPLAD funds.The Lok Sabha had approved the two Bills to reduce for one year the salaries of ministers and MPs by 30 per cent “to meet the exigencies arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic” on Tuesday.The two Bills were taken up together for discussion though it was moved separately by two ministers – Minister of State (MoS) for Home G Kishan Reddy and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi. Reddy moved the Bill on ministers’ salary and Joshi moved the MPs’ salary Bill.Reddy in his replies to the members’ criticism that the House spent two hours addressing these issues said the idea of this Bill was not just to save money, but a matter of principle.The Bills intended to reduce 30 per cent of the government’s outgo on ministers and MPs’ salaries and allowances due to them.Noting that charity should begin at home, Joshi said, “We have to be role models for our country.” He clarified that the saving from the Bills was not Rs 6 crore, as suggested by a member, rather it is at least Rs 53.83 crore.Initiating the debate, Congress MP from Maharashtra Rajeev Satav says he and his party fully support the Bill and was willing to work for Re 1 if that would aid Covid-19 response, but insisted that the attempt to suspend MPLAD was wrong. He also asked that the Central Vista project be suspended until the Covid-19 fight is done with. Echoing Satav’s sentiment, several MPs, including from the BJD, YSRCP, TDP, TRS, SP, BSP and all others, demanded restoration of Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) fund.Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said, “The MPLAD funds are vital and its suspension be modified from two years to one year and 100 per cent to 50 per cent cut.

Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterPresident accepts Harsimrat’s resignationPresident Ram Nath Kovind on Friday accepted the resignation of Food Processing Industries Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has been given additional charge of the Food Processing Ministry.“Farmers have been given new independence. They will now have more options and opportunities to sell their produce. It was necessary to bring these measures to protect them from middlemen,” he said, reiterating the promise to protect the MSP structure while urging farmers to be wary of those who ruled the country for decades and were now “lying to them”.“They are opposing just for the sake of opposition without realising that farmers are aware that these people are standing with middlemen,” he said, speaking at the launch of set of projects for poll-bound Bihar, including long-awaited Kosi Rail Mahasetu connecting Kosi and Mithila regions.The Congress is now trying to play politics over the APMC Act but it had promised to repeal it in its 2019 election manifesto, the PM said in his second statement on the issue in less than 24 hours. He also said the APMC Act had been done away with in Bihar by CM Nitish Kumar, giving farmers freedom of choice in the state.Taking charge of the matter amid a growing war of words, the PM last evening had sent out a series of messages after Akali leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from his Cabinet, labelling the three legislations “anti-farmer”. Seeking to downplay differences with the Akali Dal, BJP leaders said “they are and will continue to talk” with their ally to “address its concerns”.“The PM always wanted to remove the middleman culture from the system. There is no going back,” said BJP sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-blames-middlemen-for-farm-protests-says-opposition-spreading-lies-143224
