If we allow this, it will become a chaotic situation. We have the assistance of the Union Territories and the states,” the Bench told Gupta.Gupta, however, suggested that the entire process of transportation of migrant workers and their registration should be certain streamlined.Moitra — who wanted the Supreme Court to recall its April 13 order — had also sought setting up of an independent court-monitored panel to assess the ground situation and recommend measures to alleviate the condition of migrant workers as the Centre had “utterly failed”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-recall-order-dismissing-mahua-moitras-pil-on-migrant-workers-plight-95482

Gitesh Sarma.While defence cooperation was being stepped up with India and Australia signing Logistics Supply Agreement, the Indian envoy said as trust and understanding grows, New Delhi feels there are specific areas that can reflect new levels. For instance, taking security dimensions Australian companies prefer to give contracts in Information Technology to the US that in turn sub-contract it to Indian companies. This could change with greater understanding.Australia, the High Commissioner said advocates a Free and Open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and for economic prosperity according to rules and not pursuing ‘might is right’ as is being seen. As for Quad, he said it is a useful forum to coordinate in areas in which members agree. On his part, High Commissioner Sarma, said the geo-political situation for Australia is different from India.On access to rare minerals, and High Commissioner O’Farell said India wants to use it to manufacture electric vehicles and Australia could be a reliable source to support it.  On Super Funds, he said, executives connected with these investors have been analyzing the situation and doing their own research stating that post-Covid19 may require recalibration in approach.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-and-strategic-engagement-cornerstone-of-india-australia-ties-95481
06-06-2020||New Delhi||Amid Covid-19 crisis, Madhya Pradesh political scene is sizzling||Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the political scenario in Madhya Pradesh, a state that the BJP managed to snatch from the Congress before the country entered the lockdown, appears to be sizzling. Following the exit of two senior BJP leaders, the day saw huge action over Twitter profile of its latest high-profile entry, Jyotiraditya Scindia. Though BJP leaders insisted it always read "public servant, cricket enthusiast" even while Scindia was in the Congress, the day was rife with speculations that Scindia was “planning to dump the BJP because of internal rife”."Sadly false new travels faster than the truth," Scindia later wrote after claims that he has “dropped” BJP from his bio.Asserting that Scindia had never added ‘BJP’ to the profile, BJP leaders called it a “mischievous handiwork” of the Congress in mind the crucial 24 seats. The Congress claims Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will “see the reality” when the by-elections are held for the crucial seatsInterestingly, the by-polls that will decide the fate of the BJP government are being closely watched by political observers not just in Madhya Pradesh but across the country.The political scene of Madhya Pradesh became more active after two big BJP leaders joined the CongressA week after a former Ujjain MP Premchand Gudda joined Congress, another senior leader and former Minister Balendu Shukla also returned to the Congress on Friday.Shukla, like Scindia, comes from the Gwalior-Chambal region and his exit was seen as a big setback for the BJP.  A close aide of Madhavrao Scindia, Jyotiradiya’s father, Shukla left the Congress apparently due to differences with JyotiradityaThe BJP believes the bye-elections to 24 Assembly seats will be a cake walk. They are also seeing the reported “refusal” of poll strategist Prashant Kishor to work with Congress as “reality check” of the ground situationShrugging off as “irrelevant” Kishor’s “refusal”, Congress leaders say they have an “upper hand because people have not forgiven the ex-MLAs who dumped it for the BJP.  People of Gwalior-Chambal will teach them a lesson.Rubbishing the claim, the BJP leaders say people will vote for “good work and development” and the Congress has lost its opportunity. How it plans to sooth its own leaders who will have to be sidelined to accommodate Congress’ turncoats in the upcoming by-polls remains to be seenThe Election Commission of India is yet to announce dates of the by-elections slated to be held around September. Given the situation they may be delayed, say sourcesThe 230-member MP Assembly currently has 206 members out of which 107 are from the BJP. The Congress has 92 members. Four independents, one Samajwadi Party and three BSP MLAs are supporting the BJP government.The present majority mark is 104.The BJP needs to win at least nine seats to reach the halfway mark- 116- for a majority on its own Congress will have to win at least 16 seats and also convince non-BJP MLAs to support it, in all a tough task.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-covid-19-crisis-madhya-pradesh-political-scene-is-sizzling-95478
06-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 pandemic may be over in India around mid-Sept, claims mathematical model-based analysis||The COVID-19 pandemic may be over in India around mid-September, claim two public health experts from the Health Ministry, who used mathematical model-based analysis to draw this projection.The analysis shows that when the number of infected becomes equal to those removed from circulation by recovery and death, the coefficient will reach the 100 per cent threshold and the epidemic will be “extinguished”.The analysis, published in the online journal Epidemiology International, has been done by Dr Anil Kumar, Deputy Director-General (Public Health) in the DGHS, and Rupali Roy, Deputy Assistant Director (Leprosy) DGHS in the Health Ministry.They used Bailey’s mathematical model to draw the projection. This stochastic mathematical model takes into consideration the distribution of the total size of an epidemic, involving both infection and removal.The model employed was of the ‘continuous infection’ type, according to which infected individuals continue as sources of infection until removed from circulation by recovery or death.In this, the removal rate is worked out after calculating the percentage of removed persons in the infected population. Further, regression analysis has been done, to get the results regarding the relationship between the total infection rate and the total recovery rate.According to the document, the actual epidemic in India started on March 2 and since then the number of confirmed cases has been rising.For doing the analysis, experts used the secondary data for COVID-19 in India from Worldometers.info on the number of cases reported in the country since March 1 to May 19 along with a total of cumulative recovered cases and cumulative deaths.Regression Analysis (Linear) of Bailey’s Relative Removal Rate (BMRRR), COVID-19, in India shows that the linear line was reaching to 100 in the mid of September, the research paper said.“So it may be interpreted that at that point of time the number of infected will be equal to the number of removed patients, and that’s why the coefficient will reach 100 per cent threshold,” it said while cautioning that this was a stochastic model and outcome would depend on variance structure around it.There was two main stochasticities, demographic and environmental, it said.“So, the decision-makers must try to control and modify variables related to these two factors so that Bailey’s Relative Removal Rate (BMRRR) continues to go up,” the research paper stated.This could be an important tool in the hand of Central, state and district authorities in decision-making and taking appropriate action at this time in the virus containment, epidemic situation management and control the pandemic spreading in the country, it said.Pointing out the limitations of the analysis, the paper stated that it was based on the collected secondary data for a specific period of time to fit and estimate the basic case number, infection rate, and recovery rate of COVID-19.“When we apply any mathematical model, we make some assumptions for a certain period of time, the impact of a few factors are being ignored such as population birth rate and natural mortality. Natural calamity, unpredictable population movement and important national or international events may have a significant influence on this model,” it said.“With the continuous release of epidemic data, these important indicators may undergo significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 among the population,” it said.

06-06-2020||New Delhi||Tiger population on road to recovery with annual growth of 6%: Govt||The Union Environment Ministry on Saturday stressed that four surveys since 2006 have shown a healthy annual growth rate of 6 per cent in India's tiger population, offsetting natural losses and keeping their numbers at the habitats-carrying capacity level.The clarification by the ministry came following a PTI report based on an RTI reply that showed India lost 750 tigers in the last eight years due to several causes, including natural deaths, poaching, accidents, conflicts and seizures.The ministry cited details shared by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to emphasise that the tiger population in India has been brought to an assured path of recovery from the brink in the last few years."Due to efforts of the Government of India thorough the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the tiger has been taken from the brink to an assured path of recovery, which is evident in findings of the quadrennial All India Tiger Estimation conducted in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018," the NTCA said."These results have shown a healthy annual growth rate of tigers at 6 per cent, which offsets natural losses and keeps tigers at the habitats carrying capacity level, in the Indian context," it said.The RTI data showed that 369 tigers died of natural causes, 168 due to poaching, 42 due to unnatural causes, like accidents and conflicts, 101 due to seizures of the animal across the country."For the period 2012 to 2019, one can observe that the average tiger deaths per year in the country hover around 94, which is balanced by the annual recruitment as highlighted by this robust growth rate," said the NTCA.The statutory body under the Environment Ministry said it had taken several steps under the ongoing scheme of ‘Project Tiger’ to address poaching, which too, was significantly controlled.Project Tiger is a Centrally-sponsored scheme of the Ministry of Environment and forests, providing assistance to the states having designated tiger reserves."The National Tiger Conservation Authority maintains the highest standards of transparency so far as making tiger death statistics available to the citizen through its website as well as a dedicated portal, www.tigernet.nic.in, so that people can make a logical assessment, if they desire," it said.On the news report, it said the presentation of data over a long time frame would show large numbers, which may cause undue alarm.The NTCA said it had a stringent protocol to ascribe cause to a tiger death, which is treated as unnatural, unless otherwise proved by the state concerned through submission of necropsy reports, histopathological and forensic assessments besides photographs and circumstantial evidence."It is only after a detailed analysis of these documents that the cause is ascribed to a tiger death," it added."While it is appreciated that figures as available on the NTCA's website and as provided in the RTI reply have been used in these reports, the manner in which it has been presented causes alarm and does not take into account the gamut of processes that go into dealing with tiger death in the country and the natural gains that have been made in tiger conservation," it said.

The curriculum reforms are going to be in sync with the learning outcomes," he said during a virtual conference on 'Future of Schools: Overcoming COVID-19 challenge and beyond' organised by Ashoka University."We are rationalising the curriculum. We plan to retain core elements that are necessary in terms of learning outcomes," he added."If something is duplicated in some way or working extra on same concept, we aim to shelve it and thirdly anything that can be done in a more practical manner should be done that way. That's what we are planning and we should be able to finalise within a month's time," he said.Union HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' had announced in April that CBSE will be reducing the curriculum for the next academic calendar for all the classes to make up for the lost time due to the COVID-19 lockdown asserting that the curriculum will be curtailed in proportion to the lost time.The HRD ministry has come up with alternative calendar for different grades detailing the learning plan during the lockdown.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of a slew of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.A 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day.While the government has announced easing of certain restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed.

Thereafter, we went to a hospital in Sector 30 (the Child PGI), from there we went to the Sharda Hospital and then to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida. But all refused to admit her,” the man is seen alleging in a video circulating on social media.He said the family also tried to get admission in the private facility Jaypee, Fortis Hospital in Gautam Buddh Nagar and Max in Vaishali, Ghaziabad, but were allegedly told that no beds were available.“Kul mila ke humari ambulance mein hi death ho gayi (ultimately, she died in the ambulance). Finally, we got to the GIMS where she was put on a ventilator but it was too late,” he said.Gautam Buddh Nagar District Magistrate Suhas L Y ordered a probe into the episode.“Additional DM Munindra Nath Upadhyay and Chief Medical Officer Deepak Ohri will probe the matter. The DM has instructed them to immediately carry out a probe and take action,” an official statement said.This is at least the second instance within a fortnight when a life has been lost in Gautam Buddh Nagar due to unavailability of timely medical treatment. On the night of May 25, a newborn child had died due to lack of medical support as his father kept running from one hospital to another between Greater Noida and Noida.The district administration had carried out a probe in that matter too and pinned the fault on two private hospitals for alleged negligence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pregnant-woman-dies-in-ambulance-after-running-between-hospitals-for-13-hours-in-up-95456

The uniqueness of this test kit is that it functions sans the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction," said Shiv Govind Singh, the professor at IIT-Hyderabad's Electrical Engineering Department."The low-cost test kit is easy to carry around and tests can be done at point of care. The testing method used is an alternative to the currently used method. We identified a unique sequence of conserved regions of COVID-19 genome," said Singh, who led the three-member team.IIT-Hyderabad is the second academic institution in the country to come up with a testing kit for novel coronavirus.Earlier, IIT-Delhi became the first academic institute to have obtained the ICMR approval for a real-time PCR-based diagnostic assay.It had claimed that the current testing methods available were "probe-based" while the one developed by its students was a "probe-free" method, which reduces the testing cost without compromising on accuracy.India on Saturday went past Italy to become the sixth worst-hit nation by COVID-19, with the country registering a record single-day spike of 9,887 cases which pushed the nationwide tally to 2,36,657.The country's death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 6,642, with a record increase of 294 deaths in the last 24 hours till 8 am on Saturday.

It was on June 3 declared a COVID-19 facility by the city government, and told to dedicate 80 per cent beds for COVID-19 patients.The FIR has been filed against the medical superintendent of SGRH under the section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC for allegedly violating directions issued under Epidemic Disease COVID-19, Regulation 2020.According to the complaint, the hospital was allegedly not using RT-PCR app while collecting COVID-19 samples. As per the guidelines, it is “mandatory” for labs to collect samples through RT-PCR app, it said.The official has alleged that the “violation” on part of the hospital is in adhering to COVID-19 regulation norms, as specified under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. The FIR said, “The CDMO cum mission director central has mentioned that Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is still not using RT-PCR app even till June 3, which is a clear violation of directions issued under Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulation 2020 Act”.Delhi recorded 1,330 fresh coronavirus cases on Friday taking the COVID-19 tally in the city to over 26,000-mark, and the death toll due to the disease jumped to 708, authorities said.The highest spike in fresh cases – 1,513-- was recorded on June 3.A total of 2,41,693 COVID-19 tests have been conducted till date, the Delhi health department said in its bulletin on Friday.Seeking to streamline the testing process, the Union Health Ministry had launched a dedicated RT-PCR mobile-based app for labs to fill the data at the point of sample collection.Following the directives, Delhi government had made it mandatory for all lab collection and testing centres to download the app.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a virtual press conference on Saturday said, action has been taken against six of the 42 testing labs in the city for “violating ICMR norms”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fir-against-delhis-ganga-ram-hospital-for-violating-covid-19-norms-95447

Each of us can do something in small ways,” he said.Mukherjee, who is now on the National Health Service (NHS) frontline as she resumed her role as a doctor in the East Midlands region of England at the peak of the pandemic in early April, said she hoped the coronavirus crisis would result in human evolution.“Whenever we are faced with adversities like this, it really does test us and pushes us to evolve. Maybe at the end of this, we will see that humanity has evolved at a very fast pace because of this crisis,” she said, during the fundraiser.The organisers said the event, priced at a 5 pounds per ticket donation, had had an overwhelming response and will, therefore, be broadcast again on June 14.“It was a compelling and compassionate broadcast, aimed at raising vital funds and awareness for the street-connected and slum-dwelling communities in Kolkata,” said Reza Beyad, London-based entrepreneur and HOPE Foundation’s UK ambassador, who hosted the discussion.The foundation, created in 1999 by Irish humanitarian Maureen Forrest to provide protection and safety to young girls in Kolkata who were forced to survive on the streets, said it had already used the funds raised through the initiative to provide 140 families with shelter materials, drinking water and food for a few weeks.Speaking from Kolkata, the director of HOPE Foundation, Geeta Venkadakrishnan, said: “We cannot thank enough, everyone who so generously supported Conversation for HOPE, which has enabled us to continue to provide emergency supplies to those most in need. I can testify first-hand the difference which this has made to the lives of some of the most vulnerable people living on the streets and in the slums of Kolkata.”The foundation says it has been able to support more than 30,000 people whose lives have been devastated by the twin disasters of COVID-19 and cyclone ‘Amphan’, but the work remains ongoing, with further virtual Conversation for HOPE events planned.

06-06-2020||New Delhi||NIA arrests terror funding conspirator in Visakhapatnam espionage case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA), on Saturday, arrested a terror-funding conspirator in the infamous Visakhapatnam espionage case, wherein 11 Naval personnel allegedly leaked sensitive information to Pakistan’s spy agency — Inter-Services Intelligence.Abdul Rehman Abdul Jabbar Sheikh (53), a resident of Mumbai, was involved in the terror funding along with his arrested wife Shaista Qaiser and others, an official spokesman said.During the search of his house, a number of digital devices and incriminating documents were seized by the NIA, which took over the case in December last year, he said.The Indian intelligence agencies had busted the espionage racket linked to Pakistan in December last year.The NIA arrested Mohammed Haroon Haji Abdul Rehman Lakdawala, a resident of Mumbai, last month. A probe found that he was one of the “key conspirators” in the case.With the arrest of Sheikh, a total of 15 accused have so far been arrested, including the 11 Navy personnel, Pakistan-born Indian national Qaiser and her associates.Pakistan-based spies recruit agents in India for collecting sensitive and classified information regarding locations and movements of Indian naval ships and submarines, and other defence establishments.“Investigation revealed that a few Navy personnel came in contact with Pakistani nationals through various social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp, and were involved in sharing classified information in lieu of monetary gains. The money was deposited into the bank accounts of the Navy personnel through Indian associates having business interests in Pakistan,” the NIA said last month.

06-06-2020||Lucknow||Fraud teacher simultaneously teaching in 25 schools arrested||A school teacher was arrested on Saturday at Kasganj for outwitting the Department of Basic Education by simultaneously teaching at 25 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidhayayas (KGBV) residential schools for girls from the weaker sections.An FIR had been lodged against Anamika Shukla at Baghpat on Friday. Cases have also been filed against some other women impersonating her at the different schools where they were teaching on contract basis.She was a full-time science teacher at the Faridpur KGBV in Kasganj where she had collected Rs 4.57 lakh as honorarium since August 2018. However, during the last 13 months, Anamika Shukla had also collected Rs 1 crore as honorarium for teaching in another 25 KGBVs.On Friday, the Kasganj BSA had sent her a notice asking her for an explanation. She was also asked to submit the original copies of all her documents. Her salary for May had also been held up.After receiving the notice on WhatsApp on Friday evening she sent her resignation letter through a youth to the Kasganj BSA office on Saturday.When the youth was questioned about Shukla’s whereabouts he said that she was waiting in a car outside the office. Following this, BSA Anjali Aggarwal informed the police and she was soon placed under custody.Soron police station in-charge Ripudaman Singh said police were questioning Singh.According to BSA Anjali Aggarwal, Shukla’s fraud was exposed when the Department of Basic Education launched its online portal recently.When the information regarding all teachers was uploaded on the Human Resource portal of the Department of Basic Education, Kasganj BSA received a letter from the portal office that on a fake ID Anamika Shukla was working on contract basis at the Faridpur KGBV at Kasganj and living on the campus.On entering the name of Anamika Shukla in Baghpat it became clear that several people with the same name were also teaching at 24 other KGBV schools of Mainpuri, Ambedkarnagar, Ayodhya, Aligarh, Saharanpur and Prayagraj.Director General Basic Education Vijay Kiran Anand told reporters that the matter was being investigated when it became clear that the honorarium was going to the same bank account.The FIR was lodged only after the completion of the investigation in the other districts as well.According to the Kasganj BSA, Anamika Shukla, originally a resident of Kaimganj in Farukhabad, is currently doing her B.Ed from Raghukul Degree College in Gonda. Her other documents are also from the same college. A Mainpuri resident called Raj had helped her acquire these forged documents at the cost of Rs 5 lakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fraud-teacher-simultaneously-teaching-in-25-schools-arrested-95437
06-06-2020|| New Delhi||Cap on number of customers: Restaurateurs say govt SOPs make business unviable||The government, in a long anticipated move, has given restaurants the nod to open their doors but many owners say the cap on the number of customers will make their operations unviable and it may be better to stay closed.Indicating that dining out might still be some distance away and home deliveries will continue to be the order of the day, restaurateurs said the Health Ministry’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) don’t make economic sense as the cash strapped industry ventures out of the extended lockdown and plans its future.The Health Ministry issued a set of SOPs on Thursday, curtailing the seating capacity to 50 per cent when restaurants open next week in accordance with an earlier order of the Home Ministry.Citing social distancing norms, the SOPs also mandate a distance of at least six feet in queues and inside restaurants.Asking restaurants to encourage takeaways instead of dine-ins, it says only asymptomatic staff are allowed to work and entrances to all properties must have sanitiser dispensers and thermal screening provisions.Accepting the need for most of the other restrictions, industry insiders said halving the seating capacity is just not feasible.Restaurant sector may have incurred revenue losses of over Rs 80,000 crore in the two-and-a-half months of lockdown, estimates National Restaurant Association of IndiaThe SOPs are even more detrimental than the extended lockdown, which started on March 25, said Priyank Sukhija, the owner of restaurant chains such as Plum By Bent Chair, Lord of the Drinks and Tamasha in Delhi and Mumbai.   “With a 50 per cent seating limit, about 80 per cent of restaurants will not make money even when they open up later because managing rental costs, staff salaries and electricity bills won’t be possible,” Sukhija told PTI, adding that he is glad his restaurants will remain closed.He pays an average rent of Rs 12 lakh a month for each of his large-scale restaurants.Sukhija said the Delhi government, like in Gurgaon, should allow them to use their terraces and open spaces.“If you want 50 per cent capacity and want people to space out, the government should let the restaurants use their own terraces, or they should provide public land. They need to come out with a policy like that, because this is more detrimental than the lockdown,” Sukhija said.The set of regulations currently applicable have been derived from two government orders — the June 4 SOPs and the Ministry of Home Affairs order of May 30, which allowed restaurants to open from June 8 but limited their operations beyond 9 pm. It also noted that bars were to remain closed. The restaurant sector may have incurred revenue losses of over Rs 80,000 crore in the two-and-a-half months of lockdown, estimates National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) president Anurag Katriar.The Indian restaurant industry employed 7.3 million people in 2018-19, according to the NRAI India Food Services Report 2019.It’s not just about the seating, Katriar said.“As far as seating is concerned, the SOP mentions only two things — 50 per cent capacity and six feet distance. But restaurants are of different shapes and sizes. Now, a restaurant that is 10 ft wide and 15 ft in length, won’t be able to accommodate more than two tables,” he explained.However, he described the new set of guidelines as a “logical move in the right direction”. “It covers most of the concerns that we have, but there are a lot of things that need work,” he said.Zorawar Kalra, founder of Massive Restaurants Pvt Ltd, said he understands the SOPs were released keeping in mind the current scenario when the country is battling rising COVID-19 cases. However, running a restaurant with 50 per cent customer capacity is not feasible.“We are hopeful that very soon in phase two the capacity will be increased. Anything below 75-80 per cent will render most restaurants unfeasible,” Kalra said.The curfew time of 9 pm and the restrictions on the functioning of bars are other worries.Joy Singh, co-partner at Raasta and Yeti-The Himalayan Kitchen, said he does not understand the “discrimination” being meted out to the restaurant industry by the government.“If airlines can deny leaving the middle seats empty to prevent making losses, then why are restaurants and bars being treated like that? They did not consult us before coming up with the regulations, they just announced.“Eighty per cent of restaurants across the country have liquor licences. You can’t say restaurants can open and the bars can’t,” Singh said.He said restaurants do most of their business after 9 pm when people are done with the day’s work, and alcohol is a major draw at the time.Sukhija agreed.“About 85-90 per cent of our business comes after 9 pm. And we are not allowed to sell alcohol, which the government itself is selling. I don’t understand why,” he said.With the dine-in situation stuck in a crisis, most restaurants are relying on deliveries and takeaways to keep the business running.Sukhija, too, is all set to venture into the delivery-takeaway segment  with two of his restaurants — Plum by Bent Chair and Lazeez Affaire—but he will not be delivering cooked food.With an aim to offer a gastronomical experience close to that of the restaurant, he has decided to create DIY kits, which will comprise semi-cooked food along with additional condiments, which can be prepared by the customers at their homes in “less than five minutes”.Singh also took the delivery plunge with Yeti barely a fortnight back, and said the business has been “decent”.  While most of the industry has been crippled during the lockdown, the QSR (quick service restaurants) segment, including eateries such as KFC and Taco Bell, have done better. They have always been active in the home delivery segment and the numbers have shot up in the lockdown. “While deliveries were contributing a small portion of revenue before, it has now become relevant to a far greater audience now, due to restricted movement. Digital/online ordering has doubled during the lockdown and is going to increase in importance in the times ahead,” said Moksh Chopra, chief marketing officer, KFC India.Taco Bell’s delivery services have also grown “exponentially”, said Gaurav Burman, director, Burman Hospitality (Taco Bell’s Master Franchise partner in India).A major challenge for QSR outlets is managing a crowd which gathers in the restaurant for takeaway orders.While KFC has introduced a dedicated counter for takeaway orders, with demarcated waiting spots to ensure social distancing during queuing, Taco Bell has put floor markers in place, and introduced screen guards at the counters to ensure distance between the staff and customers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cap-on-number-of-customers-restaurateurs-say-govt-sops-make-business-unviable-95433
06-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyber-criminals run online black market in COVID-19 drugs||Cyber-criminals are using the darknet---a shady corner of the Internet---to hawk drugs like tocilizumab and remdesivir to kin of patients critically ill from the COVID-19 virus.The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) is yet to clear the use of these drugs to treat the virus even though they have been found to be effective to some extent in foreign countries.According to information available from hackers’ groups online tocilizumab and its generic equivalents that have already disappeared from chemists’ shops in Mumbai are available in the grey market.“Each vial of Tocilizumab that usually costs around Rs 18-20,000 is available for around Rs 90 to 95,000,” says a hacker.Remdesivir manufactured by some Bangladeshi companies under license from Gilead Inc, the patent-holder of the drug, is also being sold in the black-market in Mumbai.Members of hacking groups say the use of the darknet has zoomed during the COCID-19 pandemic as kin of patients search for various drugs apart from blood plasma of those who have recovered from the virus.However, only select Indian hospitals have been allowed to conduct plasma trials on patients suffering from COVID-19 and hence the demand for blood plasma from India is much lower.Sources in the cybercrime cell of the Mumbai Police warn that sharing bank details with dubious dealers on the darknet could result in severe financial losses. Moreover tracing the criminals is not an easy task since most of the servers used by them are based abroad and accessible only by the Tor browser on the encrypted Onion network.Though several Indian companies like Cipla, Jubiliant Pharma, Hetero, etc. have obtained the license from Gilead to manufacture Remdesivir in the country, ICMR has not yet permitted them to sell the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.This has however not stopped doctors of private hospitals in Mumbai from prescribing Remdesivir and Tocilizumab to patients who are critically ill from the virus. According to sources here, doctors of a private hospital in Mumbai managed to save the life of an IAS officer using one of the two drugs. The bureaucrat who was on the verge of being put on a ventilator has recovered and returned home, according to sources here.Mumbai’s doctors treating Covid-19 patients, who are networking with their counterparts around the world on social media, are demanding that ICMR quickly permit the use of Tocilizumab and Remdesivir as treatments.Political leaders in Mumbai too have gotten into the act and have written to the Union Health Ministry demanding that ICMR quickly speed up the process to clear the two drugs. Maharashtra’s Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad, who was critically ill from the virus, and Member of Parliament from Borivli in Mumbai Gopal Shetty were among those who have written to the ministry to speed up the process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyber-criminals-run-online-black-market-in-covid-19-drugs-95432
06-06-2020||New Delhi||Reduce syllabus by 30 pc, reopen schools with reasonable precautions: Sisodia to HRD minister||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia pitched for a 30 per cent reduction in the syllabus for all grades to make up for the loss caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and advocated reopening of schools with reasonable precautions.In a letter written to HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, Sisodia asserted that since people needed to learn to live with COVID-19 now, it would be better if the already existing learning spaces such as schools, take up that role.Noting that online teaching can only complement learning in schools and not replace it, he said it would be a “historical blunder” if the “opportunity” is let to pass by not trusting schools with a bigger and bolder role, which is, to prepare children for better and responsible life and not just for a few lessons of their textbooks.“First of all, we need to assure every child irrespective of age and social class that they are important to us and all of them have an equal right to physical and intellectual space of their respective schools. The clamour of online teaching or older children coming to school first and not the younger ones should be put to rest. Online teaching can only complement learning in school, not replace it,” Sisodia said and cautioned that no measures be suggested which accords any primacy to children of secondary grades onwards vis-a-vis primary because learning across all stage was important, whether it was about preparing for board exams or learning to read and write.Quoting an ICMR study which states that the COVID-19 attack rate (people affected per 1 lakh population) is the lowest among the 0 to 9 years age group, he said: “Since we need to learn to live with coronavirus now, it would be better if the already existing learning space, which is school, take up that role. But before doing that, parents need to be taken in confidence and they should be explained the risk factors with facts.”“In the process of learning to live with coronavirus, there would be major changes in schools across the world. It is for us to decide whether we reorganize our schools based on the need of our country, our society and learnings from our own great history or we wait for other countries or some other societies to do something and then we copy-paste those here. In my view we need to take decisive steps now,” the Deputy Chief Minister said.Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s Education Minister, suggested that distinct approach be followed in early childhood education, elementary grades segment, secondary and senior secondary students.“Syllabus be reduced by at least 30 per cent across all grades and subjects. Emphasis should be on depth in learning and understanding rather than spreading far and wide. Combine this with exam reforms. CBSE should move away from a one-time high-stake exam of Class X and XII to a model of continuous evaluation so that students can take the online exam whenever they want,” he said.For early childhood and elementary grades, Sisodia recommended “establishing the foundation of lifelong learning” with a goal of “learning to learn”.“Instead of continuing the remaining part of schooling with reduced syllabus let us move beyond the tendency to just complete the syllabus. Instead, fluency in reading with understanding and oral expression, writing different genre of the text, number sense, emotional resilience, internalization of healthy and hygienic practice, should be the key areas of engagement between children and their teachers,” he said.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of a slew of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.A 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day. While the government has announced the easing of certain restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed.The government had last week announced that schools, colleges, coaching centres and other educational institutions will be reopened after discussing the coronavirus situation with states and Union territories in July.

The account was restored on June 5.On accessing the account, a message saying “This account is temporarily restricted. You’re seeing this warning because there has been some unusual activity from this account. Do you still want to view it?” was displayed.“Safety and security of the accounts is a key priority for us and to ensure an account has not been compromised sometimes we require the account owner to complete a simple reCAPTCHA process. These challenges are simple for authentic account owners to solve, but difficult (or costly) for spammy or malicious account owners to complete,” a Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Once the account clears this security step, the account regains full access, the statement added.“To protect the accounts, we routinely require them to clear this security key for login verification,” the spokesperson said.Amul Managing Director RS Sodhi said the company’s Twitter account was blocked on the night of June 4, and restored on June 5 morning when the issue was taken up with Twitter.“Our Twitter account was blocked on the night of June 4 and restored on June 5 morning when we again took up process of reactivation with Twitter. We have asked Twitter why it blocked our account. We are waiting for the reply,” he said.Twitter was abuzz with several users expressing shock, while many questioned its move to restrict the account. Twitteratis linked the restriction of Amul’s account with the brand’s campaign, supporting boycott of Chinese products. The brand figured among trending topics in India even on Saturday with over 11,500 tweets.In the campaign, Amul’s iconic girl in white and red polka dots dress is seen fighting a dragon that is carrying a ‘Made in China’ placard. The picture mentions TikTok (a Chinese short video platform).The creative carries a tagline ‘Amul Made In India’ referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for self-reliant India.“As far as the cartoon is concerned, it is not Amul’s comment. Amul butter girl comments on mood of the nation and the topics which are in discussions among the common people,” Sodhi said.

06-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai cops’ order for action against fake news is legal: Maharashtra govt||Justifying the Mumbai Police’s order that stipulates criminal action against anyone spreading false and fake information on social media, the Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court that reasonable restrictions can be imposed to safeguard public order.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Amjad Sayed was on Friday hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) challenging the legality of an order dated May 23, passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Operations).The order said that action would be taken against any person, who spreads incorrect, fake information on social media.It further said that any person who holds the ‘Admin’ position of any social media group, shall be held personally liable for dissemination of any false or incorrect messages circulated in the group.According to the petitions filed by  advocate Sheshanath Mishra and independent journalist and co-founder of NGO ‘Free Speech Collective’ Geeta Seshu, the order violates the rights of citizens guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India (right to freedom of speech and expression).Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, appearing for the government, however, contended that the order is “perfectly” legal in view of Article 19(2) of the Constitution, which authorises the government to impose reasonable restrictions upon freedom of speech and expression in the interest of public order.The court noted that the issue requires to be examined even though a plain reading of the order reveals that its validity is effective only till June 8, 2020 and directed the government to file an affidavit within three weeks.The petition filed by Mishra claimed that the police order aims to muzzle the voice of common citizens and prevent them from criticising the government’s handling of the pandemic.Seshu’s counsel Mihir Desai argued that the police have not followed due procedure prescribed under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

For instance, for India, this could be an opportunity to speed up Ayushman Bharat, especially with a focus on primary health care. I know there is a very strong commitment from the government to speed up the implementation of Ayushman Bharat and with primary health care and community engagement, I think we can really turn the tide,” Ghebreyesus said during a press briefing in Geneva on Friday.Ayushman Bharat is the world's largest health insurance scheme and was launched by the Narendra Modi government in 2018. Last month, Modi had said that the number of people who had benefited from the scheme crossed the one crore-mark.The scheme aims to cover more than 500 million beneficiaries and provide coverage of Rs 500,000 per family per year.Referring to the Ayushman Bharat scheme, Ghebreyesus added that “using and speeding up what has started could actually help in India and that's what WHO was very appreciative by the way when Ayushman Bharat started.

06-06-2020||Washington||Trump says India, China will have more Covid-19 cases with more tests||US President Donald Trump has said that countries like India and China would have much more coronavirus cases than America if they conduct more tests.Trump, in his remarks at Puritan Medical Products in Maine, said the US had carried out 20 million tests.Compared to the US, Germany is at four million and much-talked-about South Korea is about three million tests, he said on Friday.According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, the US has reported nearly 1.9 million cases and over 1,09,000 deaths while the total number of coronavirus cases in India and China stand at 2,36,184 and 84,177, respectively.India has so far conducted over 4 million coronavirus tests, according to the health ministry.Commenting on the COVID-19 tests in the US, Trump said: “We will be well over 20 million tests. Remember this, when you test more, you have more cases.“I say to my people every time we test; you find cases because we do more testing. If we have more cases, if we wanted to do testing in China or in India or other places, I promise you there would be more cases…you are doing a fantastic job in getting out the swabs.”Puritan is one of the only manufacturers in the world producing the high-quality medical swabs that are crucial for rapid testing.“And every swab you make at Puritan is proudly stamped with the beautiful phrase ‘made in the USA’.“Thanks to the testing capacity that you are making possible, our country is reopening and our economy is recovering like nobody would've thought possible,” he said.Referring to the latest monthly employment numbers, Trump said that the economy is now back on track.“We absolutely shattered expectations, and this is the largest monthly jobs increase in American history, think of that; that's a long time.“I think it's more than double or about double of what our highest was before, so this is the largest monthly job increase in American history. And we're going to have a phenomenal next year. We're going to have a tremendous couple of months prior to the election on November 3 very, very important date,” the president said.Seeking re-election for his second consecutive term, Trump is pitted against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in November 3 presidential elections. Most of the opinion polls show that Biden is several points ahead of Trump.“It's going to be a very important election because the only thing that can screw it up is if you get the wrong president and they raise your taxes, and they open up your borders so that everybody pours into our country,” Trump said.Reiterating that he has built a strong economy in the last three years, Trump vowed to bring the economy back on track, which has been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic.Describing the fight against coronavirus as the greatest national and industrial mobilisation since World War II, Trump said that his administration has marshalled the full power of the US government and US industry to defeat the invisible enemy.“It is indeed an enemy. It came from China, should have been stopped in China. They didn't do that,” he alleged.The administration, he said, has delivered over 1.5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment to doctors and nurses on the front lines.“We slashed the red tape to speed up the development of vaccines. And vaccines are coming along incredibly well, wait till you see, and therapeutics. And we partnered at private sector leaders such as Puritan to build the largest and most advanced testing capacity on the face of the earth, like this one,” he said.The Puritan factory in Maine, he said, quickly ramped up the production to produce nearly 20 million foam-tipped swabs each month.“Then in April, my administration invoked the Defence Production Act to help you scale up even more. Under a USD 75 million public-private partnership, Puritan will soon double production to 40 million swabs per month,” Trump added.

Subsequently, an X-ray detected the cable of a mobile charger in his urinary bladder. The man had inserted the mobile charging cord through his penis," the doctor told the media on Friday.He added that the cord was taken out successfully and the patient is recovering."The surgery could have been avoided had the man told the actual fact. The cord could have been removed via the penile urethra through which he had inserted it," the surgeon said.Islam posted his reaction on his Facebook page, saying: "Surprises in Surgery! After 25 years of experience in surgery, I continue to be surprised and shocked by instances like this where my intellectual and surgical skills are challenged... A 30-year-old man came to me with complaints of abdomen pain and history of accidental ingestion of headphones. I operated upon him to find nothing in his gastrointestinal tract... But instead discovered a mobile phone charger cord in his urinary bladder ....all of you must have guessed the entry point and route (it entered through his penile urethra to his urinary bladder)... his mental health remains a question... surgery was successful and the patient is recovering... everything is possible on this earth, indeed!"The man was said to be in the habit of inserting objects through his penis to have sexual enjoyment."The act can be termed as urethral masturbation or urethral sounding. In his case, the cord got lodged in the urinary bladder connected to the urethra. I never found a case like this in my 25-year medical service career," Islam said, refusing to disclose the identity of the patient.The surgery was done at the private hospital since most government hospitals in Guwahati have been notified as Covid-19 treatment centres.

On Thursday, sources in the Forest Department said three persons were under the scanner and a search was on for two more people.Meanwhile, the official website of People for Animals (PFA), an animal rights NGO founded by BJP MP Maneka Gandhi, was hacked on Friday by a group of “ethical hackers” over her remarks made on Malappuram district while referring to the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala.A message on the defaced website read, “Maneka Gandhi dragged the sad death of pregnant elephant for dirty politics,” with the popular “coffin dance” music playing in the background.Maneka has been facing the wrath of Keralites after she tweeted that Malappuram district was known for “its intense criminal activity,” especially with regard to animals. A major political slugfest ensued after Maneka Gandhi yesterday claimed that the elephant died in Malappuram (a district with a majority of Muslims), labelling it “India’s most violent district”. The location set the social media on fire, with rivals accusing the BJP of “communalising” and “using” the heartbreaking incident, “the genesis of which was essentially man-animal conflict”, for “political gains”.The elephant died in the Velliyar river, “which borders Palakkad and Malappuram districts”, they said.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who also condemned the attempts to communalise the issue, said “lies built upon inaccurate descriptions and half-truths were employed to obliterate the truth. Some even tried to import bigotry into the narrative”.(With inputs from PTI).Former union minister bookedMalappurami: The Kerala police have registered a case against BJP MP Maneka Gandhi for her alleged provocative remarks in connection with the death of pregnant elephant in Palakkad .

The journal also apologised.“After the article, several concerns were raised around the veracity of data and analyses conducted by Surgisphere Corporation and its founder and our co-author, Sapan Desai, in our publication. We launched an independent third party peer review of Surgisphere to evaluate the origination of the database elements and confirm the completeness of the database. Our independent peer reviewers informed us that Surgisphere would not transfer the full data set, client contracts and the full ISO audit report to their servers for analysis as such transfer would violate client agreements and confidentiality requirements. Our reviewers were not able to conduct an independent and private peer review and therefore notified us of their withdrawal from the peer-review process,” The Lancet said, adding that it was withdrawing the article as it could no longer vouch for the veracity of primary data.The article was authored by Mandeep R Mehra, Frank Ruschitzka and Amit Patel. Mehra is with the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston.

The memorandum asked all to wear masks, maintain one metre distance and not to loiter around corridors. “Only asymptomatic people will be allowed to enter the office; loitering and crowding of corridors must be avoided and gathering of five and more persons is prohibited. No meeting should be done physically. Only video conferences are permitted. Desks must be arranged in a zigzag manner so that two employees may not sit across,” it said.The ministry also asked its officers to use stairs and avoid lifts and when using lifts, face walls instead of each other. “Not more than four persons are allowed in a lift at a time. The staff should avoid centralised air-conditioning, if possible,” the memorandum said, discouraging officials from having visitors.The nationwide caseload touched 2,26,770 today with a record daily spike of 9,851, the highest so far in 24 hours.

We have always been a voice of reason and a votary of international law. — S Jaishankar, External Affairs MinisterThe minister listed four different challenges that have emerged since India last served on the UNSC from the 54-nation Asia-Pacific Group. India had to persuade Afghanistan to shelve its ambitions and had entered into a quid pro quo with Vietnam to emerge as the sole candidate from the group. While India’s election is all but guaranteed, a senior officer said, “We are not taking chances.”The four challenges to international peace and security are—increasing strains in international governance as frictions have risen; unchecked traditional and non-traditional security challenges; unreformed and under-representative global institutions; and grave economic repercussions from Covid that will test the world like never before.“We have always been a voice of reason and a votary of international law. We advocate dialogue, consultation and fairness in our approach to global issues,’’ said Jaishankar.At its eighth stint at the UNSC where it aspired to be a permanent member, said Jaishankar, India could play a “positive global role” by creating new opportunities for progress, an effective response to international terrorism, reforming the multilateral system, comprehensive approach to international peace and security and promoting technology with a human touch as a driver of solutions.India is in a G-4 grouping with Japan, South Africa and Germany to make a joint bid to enter an expanded UNSC. That attempt is being opposed by each country’s regional rivals under the banner on “United for Consensus”, which is also known as the Coffee Club.India is opposed by Pakistan and China, Japan by South Korea, South Africa by African heavyweights Nigeria and Egypt and Germany by Italy and Spain.5-S approach‘Samman’ (respect), ‘samvad’ (dialogue), ‘sahyog’ (cooperation) and ‘shanti’ (peace) to create universal ‘samriddhi’ (prosperity)India’s objectiveAchieve NORMS (A New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-unsc-india-vows-to-work-for-global-peace-95198

While netizens compared the incident with the killing of George Floyd in the US, senior police officials refuted the charge.The officials said two cops on bike patrol spotted Mukesh Kumar Prajapat without a mask at the bus stand. The video shows Prajapat arguing with cops and punching one of them, prompting retaliation. The cops push Prajapat to the ground as one policeman kneels on his neck. The man subsequently breaks free and assaults the cops.Jodhpur Police Commissioner Praful Kumar said: “Two constables tried to fine the man for not wearing a mask. The accused started arguing and assaulted the cops. He tore their uniform and threatened them. He was restrained with the help of people. The suspect has been arrested and a case of assault on a public servant registered.” The accused was arrested last year for blinding his father with a screwdriver. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/floyd-redux-in-jodhpur-cops-deny-brutality-charge-95203

The Finance Ministry on Friday informed all ministries that schemes which had already been approved in the current financial year would remain suspended till March 31 next year.All ministries have been asked to submit a list of schemes that were given in-principle approval by the month-end. “Till then, no funds should be released nor budgetary provisions made for such schemes,” instructed the Finance Ministry in an Office Memorandum. The intention is to curtail expenditure to avoid further debt. Moody’s has already rung the alarm bells by downgrading India to Baa2—the lowest investment grade.Even this rating is generous since it is 30 percentage points above the median of Baa-range nations. A further downgrade will mean that India will have to borrow funds from abroad at higher interest rates.The only exceptions to the no-new-scheme instructions are the PMO-helmed ones — the PM Garib Kalyan and the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan or any other package that may be announced subsequently. “There is an unprecedented demand on public financial resources and a need to use resources prudently in accordance with emerging and changing priorities,” explained a Finance Ministry note.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fearing-debt-govt-suspends-new-schemes-95204

Also New Delhi’s military officials asked the PLA to demolish all structures that it has built in disputed areas along the un-demarcated LAC. The stress was at the area called ‘finger 4’ north of the Pangong Tso – a 135 km glacial-melt lake.Status quo ante would mean pulling back troops, tanks guns which have been amassed by both sides in the past five weeksStatus quo ante would mean pulling back troops, tanks guns which have been amassed by both sides in the past five weeks.Till writing this report, the Indian Army, the Ministry of Defence or the Ministry of External Affairs have not made an official statement on the outcome of the meeting.The Indian delegation was led by Lt General Harinder Singh, the commander of the Leh based 14 Corps met with South Xinjiang military Commander Maj Gen Lin Liu at Moldo at the designated meeting point at Chushul-Moldo, some 200 km south east of Leh. The meeting started around 11.30 am, it had a break for lunch around 2.30 pm and was resumed after that. Officials in Delhi said the meeting was on till 7 pm.The meeting has come about after almost a dozen meetings between commanders at the level of Major General and Brigadier had not succeeded.News agency PTI cited an unnamed official saying “talks were held in a positive atmosphere. The approach (by both sides) was positive”.Separately sources in the military establishment said it would be incorrect to assume that this matter would be sorted in one meeting. The Military commanders of either side would send their respective reports to New Delhi and Beijing, where an appreciation would be made of the ground situation.The Indian Military report is expected to highlight issues which are absolutely not acceptable on ground.The Ministry of External Affairs had stated last week that the two countries will resolve their differences in keeping with the five frameworks which have been inked since 1993.Agreements in breachDon’t confront patrols in disputed areas, show a banner and both sides retreat.

The observation came during a hearing on a PIL on migrant workers’ plight before a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan. The Bench took note of the submissions of the Centre and the state governments on steps taken to mitigate misery of stranded migrant workers.Last month, the apex court had taken suo motu cognisance of migrant workers’ miseries and ordered states to provide them free food, shelter and travel. The Centre today informed the court that no migrant worker had died on Shramik Special trains due to lack of food, water or medication. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta denied any negligence on part of the Railways and the GRP.All reported deaths had occurred due to pre-existing ailments, Mehta claimed. He said 4,228 trains had ferried home over one crore migrant workers till June 3 and 90 per cent of them had already reached their native places. However, he said 171 more trains were needed.After hearing arguments of advocates representing the Centre, states, UTs and others, the Bench said it would pronounce its verdict on June 9. — TNSPermits NHRC to interveneThe Supreme Court allowed the National Human Rights Commission to intervene in the case regarding the plight of the stranded workers. The NHRC, in its intervention plea, gave “short-term and long-term measures” for consideration of the apex court to alleviate the migrant workers’ plight and to ensure that their rights were not violated. “States should collect the data of migrant workers at the point of departure in the originating state as well on arrival in the destination state,” it said.Centre’s claim||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-wants-all-migrants-moved-in-15-days-95207
