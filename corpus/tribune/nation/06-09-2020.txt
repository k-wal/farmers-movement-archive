We @AdaniFoundation are humbled to arrange for their comfortable return journey to Godda & thankful to the local media for bringing this inspiring story to light,” the Foundation’s chairperson Priti Adani said in a tweet on Saturday.Dhananjay Kumar on Sunday told PTI that Adani Foundation has provided them with air tickets from Gwalior to Ranchi for September 16.Since there is no direct flight from Gwalior to Ranchi, we will reach there via Hyderabad, he said, adding that he will reach his home in Godda district by road from Ranchi.He informed that the foundation will also arrange to send back his scooter, which he used for reaching Gwalior, to his home in Jharkhand.Kumar also said that he has received a phone call from the district administration of Godda (Jharkhand) saying that they will arrange a vehicle for them to reach home from Ranchi.Meanwhile, Gwalior’s district administration has arranged the accommodation for the couple near the examination centre, he informed.So far, the couple was living about 15-km away from the centre on rented accommodation.Kumar said that the district administration has also arranged the health check-up of his pregnant wife and she was found completely healthy.The couple had mortgaged their jewellery to raise Rs 10,000 to meet their expenses to reach Gwalior.Dhananjay said that a Mumbai-based girl also deposited Rs 10,000 in his account to take back jewellery which he had mortgaged.  Some people from Godda also called him promising to arrange a job for him, he said.The couple had arrived here on August 30 for DEd exam being conducted by the MP Board of Secondary Education. The examination will continue till September 11.“We started off on August 28 morning and en route stayed a night each in Muzaffarpur (Bihar) and Lucknow to reach Gwalior on our scooter,” said Kumar, who was working as a cook with a caterer before he lost his job three months ago because of the lockdown.Kumar’s wife Soni earlier said that I thought that it won’t be possible for me to appear in this examination but after seeing my husband’s determination and courage, I got ready for this long journey.“We faced a lot of trouble due to rains. I got a mild fever en route, but now everything is okay.  I will apply for a teaching job in Jharkhand and I am sure I will get selected,” Soni, who got married to Kumar in December last year, said.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||Chandrayaan-3 launch may take place in early 2021; mission will not have orbiter||Chandrayaan-3, India’s mission to Moon, is likely to be launched in early 2021, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Sunday.However, unlike Chandrayaan-2, it will not have an orbiter, but will include a lander and a rover, he added.After the hard landing of Chandrayaan-2 in September last year, space agency ISRO had planned another mission to the Moon later this year.However, the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown have hit several of ISRO’s projects and delayed missions like Chandrayaan-3.“As for Chandrayaan-3, the launch may now take place somewhere in early 2021. Chandrayaan-3 will be a mission repeat of Chandrayaan-2 and will include a Lander and Rover similar to that of Chandrayaan-2, but will not have an orbiter,” a statement quoting Singh said.Planned to land on the South Pole of the Moon, Chandrayaan-2 was launched on July 22 last year. However, the lander Vikram hard-landed on September 7, crashing India’s dream to become the first nation to successfully touch down on the lunar surface in its maiden attempt.The orbiter of the mission is working fine and has been sending data.Singh, who is the Minister of State for the Department of Space,  said Chandrayaan-1, ISRO’s maiden mission to the Moon launched in 2008, has sent images which show that Earth’s satellite may be rusting along the poles.“The sign of this finding is that even though the surface of the Moon is known to have iron-rich rocks, it is not known for the presence of water and oxygen, which are the two elements needed to interact with iron to create rust,” he said.Scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) say that this could be because the Earth’s own atmosphere is lending a helping hand which, in other words, means that the Earth’s atmosphere could be protecting the Moon as well, the statement said.“Thus, the Chandrayaan-1 Moon data indicates that the Moon’s poles are home to water, this is what the scientists are trying to decipher,” the statement added.Meanwhile, preparations are going on for India’s first-ever Human Space mission Gaganyaan, he added.  The training processes and other procedures are also in place.“Constraints due to the COVID pandemic led to some disruptions in the plan for Gaganyaan but efforts are going on to stick to the timeline of around 2022,” the minister said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandrayaan-3-launch-may-take-place-in-early-2021-mission-will-not-have-orbiter-137383

06-09-2020||New Delhi||Indian, Chinese militaries hold Brigade Commander-level talks in eastern Ladakh||Indian and Chinese militaries on Sunday held another round of talks in eastern Ladakh in an attempt to calm tensions even as the situation remained “delicate” with both sides further rushing in additional troops and weapons following last week’s confrontations, government sources said.The nearly four-hour brigade commander-level interaction near Chushul could not produce any tangible outcome, they said.The sources said the Indian Army has been on a very high level of alert and is ready to deal with any eventuality in the area.The overall situation in the region continued to be delicate, they said.Tension escalated in the region after Indian troops foiled attempts by Chinese military to occupy Indian territories in the southern bank of Pangong lake area on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.Following the confrontation, India occupied a number of strategic heights in the Chushul sector overlooking crucial bases of the Chinese military. Since then, China has deployed additional troops, tanks and anti-tank guided missiles in the area.India too has strengthened its combat capabilities following reinforcements by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).The two sides held extensive talks on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, each lasting over six hours, but no concrete result emerged from the negotiations.In talks with his Chinese counterpart Gen. Wei Fenghe on Friday in Moscow, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh conveyed that China’s actions like amassing a large number of troops, its aggressive behaviour and attempts to alter the status quo in Ladakh were in violation of bilateral pacts.He also told Wei that China must strictly respect the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and not make attempts to unilaterally change its status quo.Sources said Singh told Wei firmly that India will not “cede an inch of land” and is determined to protect the integrity and sovereignty of the country at “all cost”.On Monday, the Indian Army said the Chinese military carried out “provocative military movements” to “unilaterally” change the status quo on the southern bank of Pangong lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30 but the attempt was thwarted by the Indian troops.The two sides were earlier engaged in a confrontation on the northern bank of Pangong lake but it was for the first time such an incident occurred on its southern bank.There have been reports that China has deployed J-20 long-range fighter jets and several other key assets in strategically located Hotan airbase which is around 310 km from eastern Ladakh.In the last three months, the IAF deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the LAC.The fresh attempt by China to change the status quo in the Pangong lake area is the first major incident in the area after the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.China also suffered casualties but is yet to make the details public. According to an American intelligence report, it was 35.India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks in the last two-and-half months but no significant headway has been made for a resolution to the border row in eastern Ladakh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-chinese-militaries-hold-brigade-commander-level-talks-in-eastern-ladakh-137373
06-09-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Passengers entitled to full refund for air tickets booked during Lockdown 1 & 2||Passengers are entitled to full refund for air tickets booked during Lockdown 1 and 2 during which air travel was banned due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Centre has told the Supreme Court.“If the tickets have been booked during the first lockdown period, i.e. 25th of March, 2020 to 14th of April, 2020 for the journeys to be undertaken in both first and second lockdown period i.e. from 25th of March, 2020 to 3rd of May, 2020, in all such cases, full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately,” the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said regarding domestic airlines’ tickets booked directly by the passenger with airlines.Similarly, for international travel when the ticket has been booked on an Indian carrier and the booking is ex-India, it said, “If the tickets have been booked during the lockdown period for travel within the lockdown period, in all such cases full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately. This amount shall be passed on immediately by the Agent to the passengers, as the case may be.”This was being mandated as the airlines were not supposed to book such tickets during first and second lockdown, it added.“For all other cases, the airlines shall all endeavor to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days,” it said.The affidavit has been filed in response to a PIL demanding full automatic refund of money for tickets booked for flights during the COVID19 lockdown. The Supreme Court had on June 12 issued notices to the Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on the PIL filed by Pravasi Legal Cell.However, the affidavit said, “If on account of financial distress, if the airlines are not able to do so they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected. This credit shell shall be issued in the name of the passenger who has booked the ticket”.“The passenger shall be able to consume the credit shell up to 31st March, 2021, on any route of his choice. If the passenger wants to buy a ticket of value more than the credit shell, then he can use cash to top it up. If he wants to buy a ticket of value less than the credit shell, he/she can do so and the balance amount of credit shell shall be available to him/her,” the affidavit read.The petitioner NGO had said both domestic and international airlines were violating the Ministry’s order which obliged them to fully refund the amount for tickets cancelled on account of COVID19 lockdown.Pointing out that instead of full refund, airlines were providing a credit shell, valid up to one year, the PIL had submitted that failure to refund full amount collected for tickets owing to cancellation of flights due to restrictions imposed by the government to prevent spread of COVID19 violated DGCA’s Civil Aviation Requirement, 2008.It had referred to the Ministry’s April 16 Office Memorandum (OM) which directed all airline operators to refund the full amount collected for all tickets booked during the first phase of the lockdown between March 25 and April 14 both for domestic and international bookings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-passengers-entitled-to-full-refund-for-air-tickets-booked-during-lockdown-1-2-137370

06-09-2020||---||In Telangana, hundreds of journalists test COVID-19 positive||Naveen S GarewalTribune News ServiceHyderabad, September 6 Journalists have been hit by COVID-19 in Telangana with 822 of them having contracted the deadly virus so far.The state government has released Rs 1.55 crore in financial aid to these journalists. Apart from a large number of recoveries, some journalists have also lost their lives. The spokesperson for the government in an informal interaction with media persons said the state government was extending help to all journalists who have contracted COVID-19 and needed financial assistance for treatment in Telangana. Both the Telugu states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (AP) have touched new highs in the number of COVID-19 infections. AP is now the state with the second-highest number of patients in the country after Maharashtra. State’s Finance Minister Harish Rao, who is also the nephew of Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) has also tested positive for coronavirus.In a tweet, he said that he was now in isolation and recovering well. Rao will be missing the Telangana Vidhan Sabha session that starts tomorrow. He has appealed to all people who came in contact with him to get themselves tested.“There is no distinction being made between the accredited and non-accredited journalists for the purpose of giving financial aid. If any journalist requires financial assistance, they can reach out to us. They need to get a letter from their management stating that they are working there and produce payslips to get financial help,” said spokesperson Laxman Kumar.The fund of Rs 1.55 crore was released by the Information and Public Relations Department (IPRD) over the last five months.“The financial assistance is being provided not just to reporters but also to videographers, photographers, people from the desk of newspapers and also their stringers,” he said. After 23 journalists had tested positive in a single day on June 15 in Telangana, the Telangana Union of Working Journalists (TUWJ) and the Telangana Media Academy came forward to provide some financial help.The first reported cases among journalists, however, was a Delhi-based journalist working for a Telugu channel who tested positive and was admitted to Apollo Hospital for treatment.   Within days a 33-year-old crime reporter with the Telugu channel TV5, who had tested positive, passed away. Manoj Kumar was undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital. The hospital has set up a special ward to exclusively treat working journalists.In June a test was conducted at the Warangal Press Club where many journalists tested positive. Till the end of June, the number of infected journalists was around 100. The number has risen quickly to 822. These are only those journalists who have reported their tests results to the government, seeking financial assistance.  The number of COVID-19 patients in Telangana has risen to 1,40,969 with the last 24 hours reporting 2,574 new cases and has 9 new deaths.

06-09-2020||---||Army takes up missing Arunachal youths’ issue with PLA||Kolkata, September 6The Indian Army has, through its hotline, sent a message to the Chinese PLA regarding the five Arunachal youths taken into custody by the PLA from the border areas. PLA is yet to get back to the Army.“The Indian Army has already sent hotline message to the counterpart PLA establishment at the border point in Arunachal Pradesh. Response is awaited,” Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports and Lok Sabha member from Arunachal (West) constituency, tweeted this evening.Five youths, residents of Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, were caught by the PLA soldiers from the jungle near Nacho. The youths apparently went inside the jungle to carry loads for the Army as hired porters. After their job was over, they were out fishing when the PLA picked them up.While Congress MLA and former Lok Sabha member Ninong Erring and BJP MP from Arunachal (East) constituency Tapir Gao had both expressed concern about the incident, the Army as well as the state administration were initially reluctant to confirm its veracity.Rijiju’s tweet today can be seen as a confirmation from the GoI that the PLA did pick up these boys from near the Indo China border. The incident took place on September 3.In March this year, a 21-year-old man was “abducted” by the PLA in a similar fashion from Asapila sector of Arunachal Pradesh near the McMahon line. While his two friends managed to escape, Togley Sinkam was taken away at gunpoint, his family had said. After 19 days in captivity, the youth was released by the Chinese Army.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-takes-up-missing-arunachal-youths-issue-with-pla-137360
06-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Metro set to resume services from tomorrow after 169-day hiatus||After being closed for over five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Delhi Metro is all set to resume services in three stages from Monday, even as it appealed to people to use the rapid transport only if urgently needed.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) authorities on Sunday reiterated that stations located in containment zones, as per the status on the day of journey, will remain closed.Officials of the urban transporter had earlier cautioned that “trains may not stop at some of the stations” if social distancing norms are not adhered to by passengers.The Delhi Metro services will be resumed in a staggered manner in three stages from September 7-12, with the Yellow Line or Line 2 connecting Samyapur Bali in Delhi to HUDA City Centre in Gurugram and the Rapid Metro to be the first ones to be made operational on September 7.Trains will operate in batches of four-hour each from 7-11 am in the morning and 4-8 pm in the evening in the first stage, officials said.Metro services in Delhi-NCR have been closed since March 22 due to the pandemic. The services will be resumed after a gap of 169 days, the DMRC said in a statement on Sunday.“On this Monday and Tuesday, only the Yellow line (49 km span with 37 stations -- 20 underground and 17 elevated ones) will remain operational for a period of four hours each in the morning (7 AM to 11 AM) and evening (4 PM to 8 PM),” it said “Trains will be available with a headway varying from 2’44” to 5’28” (at different stretches) with 57 trains performing around 462 trips. The same will be further extended in a graded manner from September 9-12 along with other lines,” the DMRC said.Over a period of next five days, rest of the lines will also be made operational with all safety measures in place to check the spread of COVID-19 in the metro premises which requires everyone to follow a new normal of social distancing, face mask use and regular hand sanitisation, the officials said.“However, we appeal to commuters to use metro services only when urgently needed to travel via metro and also avoid using it when they are not feeling healthy. Commuters showing COVID-like symptoms will not be allowed to travel and they will be directed to the nearest healthcare facility,” a senior official said.Meanwhile, in keeping with the new normal, the Delhi Metro has taken a slew of measures to ensure least physical contact for riders when it resumes services, like an automated thermal screening-cum-sanitiser dispenser and lift calling system driven by a foot pedal.On Thursday, a preview was held for mediapersons at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station to give an actual feel of the new normal the commuters will experience, from the point of entering station premises to boarding a coach.A city police official said, wearing of masks inside the premises and inside trains is mandatory, and “challans will be used if they violate this”.Use of Aarogya Setu App by commuters will be advisable, it said.Officials said at all stations, the CISF staff will be doing “contactless frisking” and red lines have been drawn at a gap of 1 ft to ensure social distancing during queuing.At the point of entry at 45 stations, automated thermal screening-cum-sanitiser dispensers have been installed, which can read a commuter’s body temperature once he or she puts the forehead in front of it, and sanitiser will drop from a dispenser below, once hands are kept below the nozzle, the officials said.This facility will be available at 17 metro stations, including Rajiv Chowk, Patel Chowk, Central Secretariat and Vishwavidyalaya stations of the Yellow Line, which resume services on September 7.At other stations, auto-dispenser for sanitiser will be there, but thermal screening will be done manually using a thermal gun, the officials said.Also, at 16 metro stations spanning 50 lifts, including at Kashmere Gate, Rajiv Chowk, IGI Airport, Hauz Khas, and Mandi House, push-button facilities to call a lift has been disabled, and commuters can press a foot pedal to call it, and beyond that the lift will operate automatically, from vertical movement to opening and closing of doors.Also as per the COVID-19 safety norms, a maximum of three passengers will be allowed in a lift at a time at any station, a senior official said.Inside the coaches, commuters will have to sit on alternate seats and maintain prescribed distance even while standing.Stickers have been put up on alternate seats and on platforms to maintain social distancing.On Sunday, the DMRC also appealed to commuters to “talk less inside trains to prevent the possibility of short-range aerosol transmission”.The stoppage duration of trains will be longer, and from 10-15 seconds at each station it will be increased to 20-25 seconds, and at interchange facilities, it will be increased from 35-40 seconds to 55-60 seconds, when services resume.The DMRC has 10 lines spanning 242 stations, and 264 stations including the Rapid Metro in Gurgaon.Delhi Metro will resume services two days after the city recorded 2,973 fresh COVID-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in 71 days, as the tally in the city mounted to over 1.88 lakh.“This is a new normal and an evolving scenario, so we will anyway be assessing the situation once we resume services,” a senior official said.Only smart card users, including QR code users on Airport Express Line, will be allowed to travel, which can be recharged digitally without any human interface, the official said.

"So far, nobody has reported," he said.The woman, who does not have any comorbidities, fell victim to the virus for the first time in July with mild symptoms of cough and fever.Following treatment, she recovered and was discharged."However, in a span of one month, she has developed mild symptoms and has been confirmed to have a Covid infection again," said the official.According to Pratik Patil, consultant for infectious diseases in the hospital, Covid immunoglobulin G antibodies test positive after two to three weeks of infection in normal cases."However, in this patient, the antibody tested negative which means she did not develop immunity after infection. Other possibility is that the IgG antibodies disappeared in nearly one month leaving her susceptible for reinfection," he said.According to the doctor, some reinfection cases may not produce antibodies and even if they develop, they may not last longer, allowing the virus to renter the body for a newer infection.Karnataka has been consistently registering daily Covid infections in the range of 7,000 to 9,000 plus cases.On Saturday, the state registered 9,746 more Covid cases, raising its tally to 3.89 lakh.Majority of the cases in the southern state are concentrated in Bengaluru Urban district, which has 1.44 lakh cases, out of which 41,479 are active.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||Beware of cons using QR codes for online frauds!||Though multiple modes of payments made through various apps on your mobile phones look hassle-free and easy, frauds are using various techniques and mental games to win your trust and later cheat you out of hard-earned money. The latest addition in the tactics of online cons is QR codes widely used by them to commit online frauds.Basically, a QR code (Quick Response Code) consists of a number of black squares and dots which represent certain digital information. When your smartphone scans this code, it translates that information into something that can be easily understood. One of the reasons they have become popular is the social distance norm now in vogue.Customers as well as merchants/shopkeepers can deal with this payment solution without proximity.So, how do frauds take place using the QR code? The con men reach out to prospective victim and engage them in conversation as buyers in case one puts information on an online sale/purchase site. They pose as genuine buyers and share the QR code to pay an advance or token amount.They then create a QR code with a higher amount and share it with the intended victim through WhatsApp or email. Mostly, they use WhatsApp for sharing the code. They may also engage the victim in a conversation to confuse him or her.After sharing the QR code, the cons ask their victims to select “Scan QR code” option on the app and select QR code from the photo gallery. After scanning the QR code from the photo gallery, the victim is urged to proceed with the payment.Once ‘proceed’ option is clicked on, the victim is asked to enter UPI PIN and the moment that is done, money is deducted from the bank account of the victim.When confronted on WhatsApp, the cons plead innocence and request for a re-scan of the code to remedy the situation. But the moment this is done, another amount is debited from the victim’s account. This is done multiple times, till one realises that he or she has been duped.Police and bank authorities have been from time to time advising people not to share their debit/credit card numbers, their expiry dates, PIN, OTP etc with anyone.The police have also urged citizens not to buy any product or do sale/purchase on online platforms unless the genuineness of these deals is verified before payments. They also advise against not scanning QR codes sent by unknown persons. Also, one should remember that QR codes need to be scanned only to make payments and not receive money.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Metro resumption: CISF outlines airport-like ‘touch-free’ security check for commuters||The CISF has planned an airport-like “contact-free” security check for the Delhi Metro and will deploy modified hand-held and doorframe metal detectors for scanning passengers, who will be required to put metallic objects such as belts and pens in their bags.The security drill changes have been outlined in the CISF’s ‘business continuity plan’ for the Delhi Metro which resumes its services from Monday in a “staggered” manner.Before COVID-19 struck, CISF personnel, who guard the metro network, spread over 230 stations, used to scan passengers from proximity and even touch them during security checks. The passengers were also allowed to keep their wallets and belts on the body.          Officials in the paramilitary force, however, said things will change now as social distancing and other public health norms need to be strictly followed to prevent the spread of coronavirus.As per the new ‘business continuity plan’ prepared by the force for resumption of the metro services, the personnel will scan commuters using a hand-held metal detector which has been attached to a lean wooden stick so that there is a safe physical distance between the scanner and the passenger.The plan has been prepared to ensure the health and security of metro staff and the passengers are not compromised, and the rapid rail transport system, often called the ‘life line’ of Delhi-NCR, has a robust counter-terror cover during the COVID-19 pandemic period.“The CISF will provide an airport-like touch-free or contact-free security service at the Delhi Metro from Monday keeping in mind the anti-coronavirus spread guidelines of the government.“Apart from enhancing the length of the hand-held metal detectors, we have also re-calibrated the doorframe metal detectors that are placed just before a commuter climbs on a small stool for their frisking,” a senior officer of the force told PTI.The Central Industrial Security Force also guards the civil airports of the country and as per protocols prevalent here, its personnel do not touch a passenger with their hands or security gadgets unless necessary.Suspect airport passengers, however, are subjected to intense manual frisking and pat-down search.The Delhi Metro services were suspended on March 22 in view of the coronavirus pandemic.The operations on its ‘yellow line’ (Samyapur Badli to HUDA City Centre) will resume from Monday followed by other lines in a phased manner.The CISF officer added that the doorframe detectors have been recalibrated in such a manner that they will beep along that body part where it is suspected that the passenger is carrying a metallic object.As per the new procedures, passengers will be asked to put all the objects on their body including metallic ones like belts and pens in their bags and if someone does not have a bag they are supposed to keep them in their hands, he said.But unlike at airports, no plastic trays will be provided to the passengers to keep their belongings for scanning, he said.“Even after taking out all the objects, if the door-frame detector picks a beep then the passenger will again be asked to clean himself of all the items on their body and if the situation persists they will be minutely frisked by the hand-held scanner albeit from a distance and without any touch,” the officer explained.The business continuity plan of the force, that has been reported earlier, had said that “contactless frisking shall be carried out of the passengers using hand-held metal detectors at a minimum distance of 2.5 cms”.The officer said the passengers will be requested by on-duty CISF personnel to open and show the contents of their bags in case they find it suspicious even after making it pass through the x-ray scanner.All the force personnel on duty would be wearing masks and gloves and those who frisk will also use face shields to ensure that both the jawan and the passengers are safe, he added.Some CISF personnel will be deputed to guide passengers undertake these new drills, the officer said.“The personnel are being provided with re-usable gloves which will be replaced after a certain cycle. All the weapons used by the personnel will also be sanitised regularly,” he said.Mobile and armed quick reaction teams of CISF commandos will patrol the station area and keep an eye on the operations from vantage positions, he said.As per the CISF plan, physical distancing norms will be “strictly” enforced inside the station area and a two-metre distance shall be maintained between the frisking and the line-up points and one-metre between passengers waiting at the security point.“Electronic and manual surveillance will be intensified to have close monitoring on all activities in metro premises,” the plan has said.The CISF has deployed a contingent of about 10,000 men and women personnel to guard the Delhi Metro network, except the Rapid Metro in Gurgaon.

06-09-2020||Mumbai||‘If that girl apologises...’: Sanjay Raut on Kangana Ranaut’s ‘Mumbai-PoK’ comment||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said he would consider tendering an apology only if actress Kangana Ranaut does so for her "insulting" remarks against Mumbai and Maharashtra.In a veiled jibe at the BJP, Raut asked whether the actress had the courage to compare Ahmedabad to Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK).The actress had recently compared Mumbai to PoK in a tweet, evoking ire of leaders of the ruling Sena.Asked if he would apologise for his remark against Ranaut while reacting to her tweet on a news channel, Raut told reporters that "anybody who lives and works here and speaks ill of Mumbai, Maharashtra and Marathi people, I would say (to them to) apologise first, then I will consider apologising"."If that girl apologises to Mumbai and Maharashtra for calling Mumbai a 'mini Pakistan, thenI will think about it. Does she have the courage to say the same about Ahmedabad?" he asked.The trouble started when Ranaut had said that she felt unsafe in Mumbai after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.BJP leader Ram Kadam had recently asked the Sena-led state government to provide the police protection to Ranaut, since "she wanted to expose the Bollywood drug nexus".Responding to Kadam's tweet, the actress had said she feared the Mumbai police more than the "movie mafia", and would prefer security either from Himachal Pradesh or the Centre.Reacting strongly, Raut had purportedly said, "We kindly request her not to come to Mumbai. This is nothing but an insult to Mumbai Police".Hitting back, Ranaut tweeted: "Why is Mumbai feeling like Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir?".She had tagged a September 1 news report on Raut asking her not to return to Mumbai if she was afraid of the city police.Raut had on Friday urged the Maharashtra government to take against people defaming the city police.He had also asked Ranaut to tour the PoK first to see the situation prevailing there.The actress, who is currently in her home state Himachal Pradesh, had also tweeted that she will be returning to Mumbai on September 9 and dared anyone to stop her.Sena MLA Pratap Saranik had hit back with a slap threat and said she should be arrested for sedition.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||Day after filing complaint for stolen car, owner receives challan for breaching speed limit||Within 24 hours of a car being allegedly stolen from east Delhi, its owner received a challan from traffic police for over speeding on NH-10 in the national capital.The vehicle was parked near a hospital in West Vinod Nagar on the night of August 24 and was found missing the next afternoon. A day later, the owner received a text from traffic police asking him to pay a fine as the vehicle was found breaching the speed limit near Mundka.His wife, a theatre artiste, said she had to park the car on the road near a hospital because of an emergency.“Unfortunately, I parked the car on the road because there was a family emergency,” she said. “I recall parking my vehicle around 9.45 pm and the next day, when I returned to check, it was not there. I then checked impound lots but couldn’t find it. I thought my vehicle was towed away but that was not the case either,” she said, requesting anonymity.She had kept a mobile phone, driving licence, debit card, RC document and voter-ID inside the vehicle, according to the FIR filed online on August 25. But in less than 24 hours, her husband received the text message from traffic police informing him about the challan.The message received around 11.21 am stated, “The car was found over-speeding at NH-10 Rohtak Road, Bahadurgarh to Mundka on August 26,” raising their hopes that police would now be able to trace the vehicle as it was very much plying on the roads of the national capital.The FIR, which was registered at Mandawali police station, was transferred to Madhu Vihar police station as the area from where the car was stolen came under it, a police officer said.“We collected details from the traffic challan but it was not of much help. The picture of the driver was not clear. An anti auto-theft squad team of the district is trying to trace the stolen vehicle. We are also trying to find out the gangs involved to get leads,” he added.An officer investigating the case said they checked the footage from a CCTV camera on the opposite side of the road where the vehicle was parked but did not find any lead.The owner said, “The car was challaned for over-speeding but when we checked the photo captured by the camera, neither the registration number of the vehicle appeared clear nor could we identify the driver. But we are trying to trace the vehicle.” In July, the husband of a Delhi court judge received a traffic challan for over speeding two months after their car was stolen from their west Delhi residence.In the same month, a resident of Hari Nagar in West Delhi received a traffic challan more than 20 days after his car was stolen near Vivek Vihar police station in east Delhi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/day-after-filing-complaint-for-stolen-car-owner-receives-challan-for-breaching-speed-limit-137336
06-09-2020||London||Nirav Modi extradition trial to resume in UK court on September 7||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, who has been lodged at a prison in London since his arrest in March last year, is set to appear via videolink for the second leg of his extradition trial at a UK court on Monday.The 49-year-old jeweller is fighting extradition charges related to the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case brought by the Indian government, being represented at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London by the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).In line with the coronavirus lockdown restrictions, District Judge Samuel Goozee has directed Modi’s appearance from a room in Wandsworth Prison in south-west London with social distancing norms in place for the part-remote setting for the five-day hearing scheduled to conclude on Friday.Justice Goozee had presided over the first leg of the extradition in May, during which the CPS sought to establish a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering against Modi. The upcoming hearings are ear-marked to complete those arguments after the Indian government had submitted additional “corroboratory evidence”.It will then go on to deal with the additional extradition request, made by the Indian authorities and certified by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier this year, which add on the charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” against Modi.Goozee has already said that the different extradition requests are inextricably linked, and he would therefore be handing down his judgment at the end of hearing all the arguments.Additional hearings scheduled for November 3, for the judge to rule on the admissibility of the evidence that will be presented before him, and December 1, when both sides will make their final submissions, mean his ruling on whether Modi has a case to answer before the Indian courts is expected only after the final hearing in December.The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by PNB, known as “letters of undertaking” (LoUs).The CPS, appearing on behalf of India, had told the court that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions.Modi’s team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems trade and that the LoUs were standard practice.Modi has made repeated attempts at bail over the past year, each of which were turned down as he is deemed a flight risk. The jeweller was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard.At a case management hearing ahead of the trial last week, Modi’s barrister Clare Montgomery had told the judge that she may be seeking a partial reporting ban on the proceedings following allegations of “party political bias” against one of their expert witnesses from India – retired Indian High Court judge Abhay Thipsay.“We may have to put in an application for reporting restrictions around the reporting of his [Thipsay] evidence to avoid further public commentary on it,” she said.From the legal documents submitted, prison conditions in India will once again play a major part in this extradition case, as in the past with other Indian extradition cases, with Modi’s severe mental health condition being a factor to be raised behind closed doors.

06-09-2020||Kolkata||Jadavpur University professor faces casteist abuse on social media||A professor of Jadavpur University has been subjected to casteist attacks on social media for a post about conducting final semester exams during the COVID-19 pandemic.Jadavpur University Teachers Association (JUTA) and All Bengal University Teachers Association (ABUTA) on Sunday condemned the “vicious casteist trolling” of Maroona Murmu, an associate professor of history of JU for an innocuous post on Facebook.On September 2, Murmu was subjected to a volley of casteist abuse on social media when she wrote in a Facebook post about the need to postpone the final semester exams as “one year cannot be more precious than someone’s entire life”.  This triggered a comment by a third year student of Bethune College on her wall that “such thinking stems from quota-centric state of mind” implying that Murmu had academically benefitted being a tribal.A hurt Murmu, who did her undergraduate studies at Presidency College before doing research at JNU, expressed anguish in her reply how her opinion as an individual was ignored by a female student and wondered if someone can be called incompetent and undeserving if he/she carries a tribal surname.This invited more trolling as many others supported the young third year student of Bethune College while support also poured in for the professor.The Bethune College Students’ Committee posted a statement on social media saying, “it is extremely disheartening and condemnable that a student of our college is still unaware of the caste dynamics in India and the need of reservations for the underprivileged. The incident in question is extremely shameful and has brought the institution into disrepute”.“Therefore on behalf of the students of Bethune College, the students committee unequivocally condemns, the comment by the third year student of the institution and resolves to stand by Dr Murmu and the struggle of all Dalits in our campus, state and country,” the statement said.The JUTA said in a statement on Saturday “an innocuous comment by Professor Murmu regarding the decision to conduct terminal semester exams during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused a torrent of abuse to be unleashed against her on the basis of her ethnic origin”.“Her abusers have challenged among other things her qualifications to teach in one of India’s premier universities. Such an attack questioning the qualifications and integrity of Professor Murmu is an attack on every teacher, not just in Jadavpur University but anywhere in the country,” JUTA general Secretary Partha Pratim Ray said in the statement.“JUTA believes that every individual has the right to express his/her personal opinion on any matter, but never in a manner that vilifies an individual for belonging to a particular community, ethnicity, caste, class or religion,” the statement said.The ABUTA in a similar statement condemned the trolling of Murmu by a college student and 200 others subsequently on social media who are making hate speeches against her and the entire community of dalit students and teachers.“She is the victim of fascist forces who want to vitiate the air of free thinking and crush liberal forces,” the left teacher association said.Murmu in several posts thanked the teachers’ bodies, several rights groups and individuals for expressing solidarity with her.

Therefore, there are no charges against me. I have no connection with this case as I have never been to Bhima-Koregaon. I wasn’t even aware of the incident till I read about it in the newspapers,” he told PTI.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has issued a notice to Ray, who is also the convenor of Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC) West Bengal unit, asking him to appear for questioning in its Mumbai office on September 10 in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon violence.The case pertains to an incident of caste violence that took place near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial on January 1, 2018, following alleged provocative speeches at Elgar Parishad conclave a day earlier.Several vehicles were torched and one person killed in the incident, triggering large-scale Dalit agitation in Maharashtra.“This is nothing but a tactic to harass and intimidate me, as is being done with academics and intellectuals all over India. I am a biomedical scientist who has been involved in the battle against COVID-19. I have also stood consistently on the side of the persecuted and disadvantaged. It is very unfortunate that I’m being harassed in this manner at this critical time,” he said.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||After JEE Main, National Testing Agency gears up for medical entrance NEET||After JEE Main, the National Testing Agency (NTA) is now gearing up for conducting medical entrance exam NEET scheduled to be held on September 13 for which over 15 lakh candidates have registered.The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE Main), which began on September 1 for admission to engineering colleges, will conclude on Sunday.The crucial exams are being conducted in September after being postponed twice in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.According to NTA officials, 15.97 lakh candidates from across the country have registered for NEET, which is a pen-paper based test unlike JEE.In order to maintain social distancing, the NTA has increased the number of centres from 2,546 to 3,843 for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) while the number of candidates per room has been reduced from earlier 24 to 12."For ensuring social distancing outside the examination hall, the entry and exit of candidates has been staggered. Adequate arrangements have also been made outside the examination centres to enable candidates stand with adequate social distancing while waiting," a senior NTA official said."Candidates have also been issued an advisory guiding them about the 'dos and don'ts' for proper social distancing. We have also written to states governments to extend support in local movement of the candidates so that they are able to reach their examination centres on time," the official added.Making hand sanitisers available at the entrance of the examination centre and inside the exam hall at all times, replacing the process of checking the admit cards of candidates with barcode readers, increasing the number of examination centres, alternate seating plans, fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit are among the steps the NTA has taken."While all the candidates will be asked to go to the exam centres with masks and sanitisers, once they enter the centre, they will have to use the masks provided by the examination authority."Each candidate will be offered a three-ply mask at the time of entry and are expected to wear the same during the examination in order to avoid any form of unfair means at the time of examination," the official added.While the governments of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have assured students that they will provide them transportation, a group of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) alumni and students have also launched a portal to provide transport facilities to exam centres for the candidates in need.The Metro Railway in Kolkata is planning to run special services for NEET candidates on September 13 to help them reach their examination centres."As per the plan, candidates along with guardians will be allowed to board the trains on showing their admit cards," according to Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi.There has been a growing chorus for postponing the exams amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases. The Supreme Court had earlier dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams amid a spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases, saying a "precious year" of students cannot be wasted and life has to go on.Several opposition leaders, including Congress' Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik, DMK president M K Stalin and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had also demanded that the exams be postponed.With barely days left for JEE exams to start, the issue had escalated into a full blown political battle with ministers from Rajasthan and Punjab (Congress), West Bengal (Trinamool Congress), Jharkhand (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), Maharashtra (Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena) seeking postponement of the exams "in a manner that achieved the twin objectives of ensuring that the academic year of the students is not wasted and their health and safety is not compromised".They filed a petition in the apex court to review its order of conducting JEE and NEET UG 2020 entrance tests during the novel coronavirus crises.However, the plea was dismissed by the Supreme Court.The NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3, but was pushed to July 26 and then scheduled for September 13.

Raut wrote, responding to Sitharaman's remarks."From demonetisation to lockdown, the economy is completely paralysed. But the Union finance minister directly blamed gods for it. This is an insult of Hindutva. What kind of Hindutva is this?" he asked.Raut said the minister's comments did not suit India which calls itself an emerging economic superpower.He said the country's economy was crumbling even before the COVID-19 pandemic."In the first quarter of the current financial year, the GDP has come down by 23.9 per cent and this is due to human error and careless attitude," he said."Coronavirus pandemic and crumbled economy is god's will. Then what is the need for government and military. God will see to everything," he said.Raut said in legal terms, an act of God is a natural catastrophe which no one can prevent, such as an earthquake, a tidal wave, a volcanic eruption, a hurricane or a tornado, "Acts of god are legal excuse for delay or failure in fulfilling an obligation or to complete a construction project," he said.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||IGI airport’s Covid testing facility can be ramped up to 15,000 samples per day: Genestrings||The COVID-19 testing facility at the Delhi international airport will initially handle up to 2,500 samples per day in mid-September and if required, the capacity can later be ramped up to 15,000 samples per day, a top official of Genestrings Diagnostic Center stated.The Delhi Airport International Limited (DIAL) on Friday had said it had set up a COVID-19 testing facility at the multi-level car parking area of Terminal 3, in collaboration with Genestrings Diagnostic Center, for arriving international passengers who have to take connecting domestic flights.“We’ve equipped the lab to handle up to 2,500 samples per day in the initial days. We’re ready to quickly ramp-up our testing capacity multiple folds of up to 15,000 tests per day in this 3,500-sq ft facility,” said Dr Rajat Arora, director, Genestrings Diagnostic Center.The test will cost a passenger Rs 2,400, as mandated by the Delhi government, he told PTI.“DIAL and GMR management are working closely with the Ministry of Health to establish this standard operating procedure which will be well-defined before commencing the lab operations, mid-September,” Arora noted.GMR group-led DIAL operates and maintains the Delhi international airport.“Unlike quite a few tests on arrival facilities across the globe, there are two key differentiators that we have brought about here at India’s first on-arrival testing lab at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA),” Arora noted.“Firstly, this is not just a collection centre but rather an actual testing facility had been created on-site at the airport. Secondly, we’ve given a time commitment of reporting within six hours of sample collection which is going to be one of the fastest anywhere in the world for RT-PCR tests,” he explained.Arora said the company would be providing passengers with the option of online booking and payment to minimise “touch transactions which may otherwise lead to further transmission of the infection”.The Civil Aviation Ministry had on Wednesday said international passengers, who had to take connecting domestic flights after landing in India, would have the option of getting themselves tested for COVID-19 at the entry airports.If the RT-PCR test result is negative, the international passenger will be allowed to board his or her connecting domestic flight and he or she will not need to undergo any institutional quarantine, the Ministry’s order said.An international passenger who does not have a COVID-negative result certificate from a test done not more than 96 hours prior to the journey, and does not opt for an on-arrival testing facility at the entry airport, will have to compulsorily undergo seven-day institutional quarantine followed by seven-day home quarantine.On August 2, the Union Health Ministry had said if an international passenger has a negative result from an RT-PCR test done 96 hours prior to the journey, he or she will not need to undergo institutional quarantine in India.

We demand a high-level probe into it," he said.BJP state chief K Surendran, who also sought similar action, said the incident showed that the Kerala government was a 'failure.""This shows that the Kerala government is a failure, and we demand the resignation of the health minister.The patient was sent with the driver without following any protocol," Surendran later told reporters.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||Govt mulls installing electric vehicle charging kiosks at 69,000 petrol pumps||The government is mulling setting up at least one electric vehicle (EV) charging kiosk each at nearly 69,000 petrol pumps across the country to induce people to go for electric mobility.Besides, the government is also thinking of making it compulsory to install EV charging kiosks at all Company-Owned, Company-Operated (COCO) petrol pumps of state refiners.In a review meeting on EV charging infrastructure, Power Minister RK Singh suggested oil ministry top officials that “they may issue an order for their oil marketing companies (OMCs) under their administrative control for setting up charging kiosks at all COCO petrol pumps”, a source said.Other franchisee petrol pump operators may also be advised to have at least one charging kiosk at their fuel stations, the source said adding this would help achieve “EV charging facility at all petrol pumps in the country”.Under the new guidelines of the Oil Ministry, new petrol pumps must have an option of one alternative fuel.“Most of the new petrol pumps are opting for electric vehicle charging facility under alternative fuel option. But it will make a huge difference when the existing petrol pumps would also install EV charging kiosks,” the source said.According to the industry estimates, there are around 69,000 petrol pumps in the country. The EV charging facility at all petrol pumps could boost e-mobility in a big way as lack of such infrastructure discourages people from buying EVs.The power ministry has also chalked out a plan to focus on Delhi National Capital Region, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Vadodara and Bhopal for creating EV charging infrastructure in cities as well as on highways to encourage people to switch over to electric mobility.The source said: “The minister is of the view that putting up two or three charging stations in any city would be a waste of funds. Besides, the central government is looking at complete electrification of public transport in Delhi, which can later be followed in other cities.”Earlier in July, the Power Ministry banned the import of equipment (power) from prior reference nations (China and Pakistan).The Power Minister directed officials in the meeting that no chargers shall be imported from prior reference countries as specified by the Ministry of Power, the source added.Earlier, the Power Ministry had also made testing mandatory for power equipment imported from prior reference nations to check for any kind of embedded malware or trojans or cyber threat and for adherence to Indian standards.

He also held bilateral talks with his counterparts from Russia, China and the Central Asian countries.“Had a very fruitful meeting with Iranian defence minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami in Tehran. We discussed regional security issues including Afghanistan and the issues of bilateral cooperation,” Singh said in a tweet.Had a very fruitful meeting with Iranian defence minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami in Tehran. We discussed regional security issues including Afghanistan and the issues of bilateral cooperation . pic.twitter.com/8ZENfAgRPS  “Both the Defence Ministers discussed ways to take forward bilateral cooperation and exchanged views on regional security issues, including peace and stability in Afghanistan,” Singh’s office said in a separate tweet on the meeting held at the request of the Iranian defence minister.The meeting between the two ministers took place in a “cordial and warm atmosphere,” it said, adding that the leaders emphasised upon the age-old cultural, linguistic and civilisational ties between India and Iran.Iranian Defence Minister Hatami and his Indian counterpart Singh held talks in Tehran on international, regional and bilateral issues, Iran's official Irna news agency reported on Sunday.Visit of Singh is the first travel of a top Indian official to Iran since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in December 2019, it noted.Iran and India enjoy traditional friendly ties. Iranian and Indian officials hold regular consultations on close cooperation to ensure regional peace and security, the report added.Singh’s visit to Iran, a major regional player, is considered to be significant as it came after he voiced India's deep concern about the situation in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.India has been keenly following the evolving political situation in the strife-torn Afghanistan after the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington’s 18-year war in the country.In his address at the combined meeting of Defence Ministers of the SCO on Friday, in the Russian capital, Singh said that the security situation in Afghanistan remains a concern.According to a recent UN report, as many as 533 Afghan civilians — including more than 150 children — were killed in war-torn Afghanistan due to fighting.At the SCO meeting, Singh said: “India will continue to support the efforts of the people and government of Afghanistan for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled inclusive peace process.”India has been a key stakeholder in the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan. It has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process. New Delhi has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.There have been global concerns over Pakistan’s support to the Taliban and other terror groups operating in Afghanistan.At the SCO meeting, Singh had also voiced India's concern over the situation in the Gulf region, vital for the country's energy needs.A series of incidents in the Persian Gulf involving Iran and the US in recent months have flared up tension in the region.“We are deeply concerned about the situation in the Persian Gulf,” Singh said in his address at the SCO meeting on Friday.“We call upon countries in the region — all of which are dear and friendly to India, to resolve differences by dialogue based on mutual respect, sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of each other,” Singh said.Iran has threatened to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz if the US, which has already imposed crippling sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme, tries to strangle its economy.India and Iran have strong commercial, energy, cultural and people-to-people links.India-Iran commercial ties were traditionally dominated by Indian import of Iranian crude oil. In 2018-19 India imported $12.11 billion worth of crude oil from Iran.However, following the end of the Significant Reduction Exemption period on May 2, 2019, India has suspended importing crude from Iran, according to the Indian Embassy here.The US had asked countries, including India, to cut oil imports from Iran down to “zero” by November 6, 2019, or face sanctions.The bilateral trade during 2019-20 was $4.77 billion, a decrease of 71.99 per cent as compared to the trade of $17.03 billion 2018-19. What is significant is that Indian exports to Iran between 2011-12 and 2019-20 have grown by 45.60 per cent, according to the website of the mission.

He has appealed to the people to come together and fight the “flawed regime”.“GST is not a tax system. It is an attack on India’s poor. It is an attack on small shopkeepers, small and medium businesses, farmers and labourers. We have to recognise this attack and stand against it together,” he said in a Twitter video today terming the GST a second major attack on the unorganised economy after demonetisation.GDP में ऐतिहासिक गिरावट का एक और बड़ा कारण है- मोदी सरकार का गब्बर सिंह टैक्स (GST)।इससे बहुत कुछ बर्बाद हुआ जैसे-▪️लाखों छोटे व्यापार▪️करोड़ों नौकरियाँ और युवाओं का भविष्य▪️राज्यों की आर्थिक स्थिति।GST मतलब आर्थिक सर्वनाश।अधिक जानने के लिए मेरा वीडियो देखें। pic.twitter.com/QdD3HMEqBy  Rahul said the GST was UPA’s idea conceived as one tax, minimal tax, standard and simple tax.“NDA’s GST is completely different. Four different tax slabs, up to 28 per cent, complicated and difficult to understand. Small and medium businesses cannot pay this tax. The big companies can easily pay it by putting 5-10-15 accountants to do the job,” said the former Congress chief alleging that four slabs were there because the government wanted those who have the means to be able to easily change the GST, and those who don’t have means, cannot do anything about GST.“Who has the means? India’s biggest 15 to 20 industrialists. So, whatever tax law they want to change can easily be done in this GST regime. And what is the result of NDA’s GST? Today, the government of India is unable to provide the GST compensation money to the states,” Gandhi noted adding that states, in turn, couldn’t pay money to employees and teachers.He said the current GST was an absolute failure.“Not only is it unsuccessful but it is also an attack on the poor and on the small and medium businesses,” the Congress leader said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-an-attack-on-poor-a-failure-rahul-gandhi-137265

This is probably the fastest growth of cases in the state since January,” the health official said.One of the reasons for the growth in the number of positive cases was the increased number of tests, he said, adding that last month, the state carried out 20,16,809 tests.“The number of tests conducted till August 1 was 21,94,943, which rose to 42,11,752 on September 1.

The RT-PCR tests, which are more reliable, should be done on a large scale, which will be able to tell the ground reality about the coronavirus,” he said.However, the health official said the antigen tests were comparatively cheaper than the RT-PCR tests and hence, conducted more as a precautionary measure.

Senior IFS (Indian Forest Service) officer Ramesh Pandey said that "Krait hatchlings and common wolf snake often look similar and differentiating them is extremely difficult because their skin patterns are almost the same. Krait hatchlings can claim human life, but wolf snakes are not lethal.

Similarly, in the 2014 Odisha Legislative Assembly elections, the BJP got 18 per cent votes and in 2019 it got 32 per cent votes. The BJP’s vote share has to increase above 50 per cent,” Nadda said, asking the party cadres to take a pledge regarding this.“India not only took the bold and timely step of imposing a lockdown to save the lives of 1.3 billion people from Covid-19, but also took care of the economy to turn the tragedy into an opportunity,” he added.Nadda said while powerful nations were helpless in combating the pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was clear in his mind as he took the decisive action of imposing the lockdown in order to save the lives of the people.He accused the Odisha Government of indulging in “rampant corruption”. “Be large hearted to give credit to the Centre for its welfare schemes,” he advised Patnaik, claiming that they had been “hijacked” by his government as its schemes. He also came down heavily on the state government for not implementing the Ayushman Bharat scheme.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-govt-took-care-of-economy-turned-tragedy-into-opportunity-137031

This case has given us an inkling of the network and the extent of the penetration,” he said.“The whole idea of taking custody remand (of Showik and Miranda) is to make people confront each other to clarify their individual role. So, yes we will be asking her (Rhea) to join investigation and may be some other people because we also need a clarity as to who did what,” Jain added.Showik and Miranda were arrested on Friday night by the NCB under the NDPS Act after questioning them for 10 hours.The NCB produced them in a court here on Saturday.Seeking their custody, it said Showik needs to be confronted with Rajput’s personal staff Dipesh Sawant, and Rhea who is the main accused in the actor’s death case.

Though the BJP blames it on ‘Opposition conspiracy’, the trend is coinciding with outrage among students, appearing for JEE and NEET and also those aspiring for various government jobs, who are upset over delay in results, recruitment notification and issuance of admit cards.It all began last Sunday when PM Modi’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ received a record number of ‘dislikes’ to become one of the most disliked videos on the channel.While students and those aspiring for jobs expected him to address the issue, the PM skipped talking about them. Soon social media trend started with users asking why he did not address the important issues involving lives and career of lakhs across the country. The BJP claims only a fraction of those hitting the ‘dislike’ button is from India, terming it all a ‘Congress game plan’ to pull down PM’s image.Started with ‘Mann ki Baat’ last Sunday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-battles-growing-pm-modi-video-dislikes-137033

This even as both sides, in separate statements, have spoken about their troops being ready to defend their territorial integrity.Heavily armed troops on either side have been locked in a fierce military standoff since May this year. China has, so far, stalled the disengagement process and several rounds of military talks have yielded nothing.Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met his counterpart General Wei Fenghe, State Councillor and Defence Minister of China, in Moscow last night. The meeting ended at 11.50 pm IST. The delegations of India and China were attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting.

The Chinese Defence Minister conveyed that the Chinese side too desired to resolve the issues peacefully.”Rajnath Singh conveyed that the two sides should continue their discussions, including through diplomatic and military channels, to ensure a complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity along the LAC at the earliest. Clearly, all eyes are now on a meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Wang Yi, slated for next week. At the meeting yesterday, it was brought out that peace and tranquility along the LAC was essential for further development of bilateral relations and the two sides should not allow the differences to become disputes.Rajnath “advised” the Chinese delegation that it was important that the Chinese side should work with the Indian side for complete disengagement at the earliest from all friction areas, including Pangong Lake, as well as de-escalation in border areas in accordance with the bilateral agreements and protocols on the maintenance of peace in border areas.He called for a strict respect to observe the LAC and not make attempts to unilaterally change the status quo. He further said the current situation should be handled responsibly and that neither side should take any further action that could either complicate the situation or escalate matters in the border areas. He also conveyed to his Chinese counterpart that “there should be no doubt about our determination to protect the India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dialogue-key-to-peace-rajnath-tells-wei-mea-level-meet-next-137038
