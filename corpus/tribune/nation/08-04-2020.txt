08-04-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: PIL demands nationalisation of health sector||As India faces a national health crisis due to COVID-19, a PIL filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday sought nationalisation of healthcare sector and related services till the pandemic was contained. The fight against the novel coronavirus would require a great deal of reliance on healthcare facilities and the public health sector is not sufficiently equipped to handle this requirement alone, petitioner advocate Amit Dwivedi submitted.He demanded that the private sector must also be roped in and “all healthcare facilities, all 36 institutes, all companies and all entities related to healthcare sector” must be nationalised to defeat the pandemic.Dwivedi contended that right to health was part of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and the Supreme Court the right to receive necessary treatment has been held to be an inalienable part of right to life of a person.  He said it was a well known fact that India’s public healthcare system was not in good shape due to lack of expenditure on the sector.In the Budget of 2020, India chose to allocate only 1.6% of its total estimated budget  expenditure on public health i.e. Rs 67,489 crores, and that is very less even in comparison to the most of the poor/low-income countries of the world, Dwivedi pointed out.“For years expenditure on public health facilities has been low and as a result of which India’s public health infrastructure is substandard and inadequate, more peculiar in the time of pandemics like COVID-19, in comparison to the world and unfortunately we could not see much development in this front,” he submitted.“In this scenario, most of the population is compelled to spend out of their pocket for basic health services and as a result of which 80% of Outside Patient Department (OPD) consultations were in private sector and 60% of Inside Patient Department (IPD) treatments happened in the private sector, a well researched paper titled ‘The private health sector in India is burgeoning but at the cost of public healthcare’ pointed out,” the petition read.“In fact, in a country like India where majority of population is not resourceful considering  the fact that in the ranking list based on purchasing power parity, hereinafter, “PPP”, of  per capita GDP prepared by International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2017 India ranked 126 out  of all the countries with a per capita income of  7,170$ much behind other developing countries like Brazil and South Africa having per capita GDP as 15,500$  and 13,400$  respectively then the lack of public healthcare facilities in the time of pandemic like the present one and its impacts can indeed be disastrous,” Dwivedi submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-pil-demands-nationalisation-of-health-sector-68433
08-04-2020||New Delhi||Brazilian Prez invokes Hanuman while seeking hydroxychloroquine from India||In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking supply of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro invoked ancient Indian epic Ramayana, mentioning the story of how Lord Hanuman brought a holy medicine from the Himalayas to save the life of Lakshmana.India has partially lifted a ban on export of hydroxychloroquine, cited by many as a viable therapeutic solution to fight coronavirus infection. India is supplying the drug to the US and several other countries hit by the pandemic.Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, has recorded close to 14,000 coronavirus cases and over 660 deaths due to the disease. Globally, the virus has killed over 75,000 people and infected more than 13 lakh.Besides the Ramayana, the Brazilian leader also referred to Jesus Christ, while exuding confidence that the two countries will overcome the global crisis by joining hands.“Just as Lord Hanuman brought the holy medicine from the Himalayas to save the life of Lord Rama’s brother Lakshmana, and Jesus healed those who were sick and restored the sight to Bartimeu, India and Brazil will overcome this global crisis by joining forces and sharing blessings for the sake of all peoples,” Bolsonaro said in the letter on Tuesday.According to the Ramayana, Lord Hanuman brought ‘Sanjeevani Booti’ from the Himalayas to save Lord Rama’s brother Lakshmana after he was injured in a battle in Lanka.Bolsonaro said Brazil hopes that use of the hydroxychloroquine will help in treatment of the virus infected people in his country.“Like many other countries, Brazil places hope in the use of hydroxychloroquine as an effective means to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19,” the Brazilian leader wrote in the letter.On March 25, India banned export of hydroxychloroquine in the midst of views in some quarters that the drug could be used to fight COVID-19. India is the largest exporter of the drug. The ban was partially lifted on Tuesday.In the letter, Bolsonaro requested Modi to ensure that Brazil gets supply of the drug ordered prior to imposition of the ban on it.He mentioned that two Brazilian laboratories, EMS and Apsen, import inputs for the production of hydroxychloroquine in Brazil and the country’s internal supply of the drug depends on the production by the two firms, adding the imports have been mainly from India for more than 10 years.“It is for this reason that we would like to stress, once again, the importance of the authorisation for export of the cargos belonging to these two laboratories, which relate to orders placed prior to the imposition of restrictions,” he said.The Brazilian president said the two companies are closely following the results of studies regarding the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to fight COVID-19 cases.“The companies need the inputs to manufacture the medicines not only for COVID-19 patients, but also for those suffering of chronic diseases that are normally treated with the same substance,” he said.The Brazilian leader also referred to the partnership between the two countries in the pharmaceutical sector, adding leading Brazilian pharmaceutical laboratories have a “solid and long” partnership with Indian laboratories.Bolsonaro also said he was convinced that joint efforts by India and Brazil will help both the countries in overcoming these “strenuous moments”.“Brazil and India enjoy a long and friendly relation of great importance to both nations, sharing many similarities and complementarities,” he said.“Without doubt we can refer to India and Brazil as leaders of their respective regions, always acting responsibly towards their neighbours. Our coming together is therefore fundamental to fight this pandemic,” he added.Modi and Bolsonaro had a telephonic conversation on Saturday during which they discussed ways of cooperation in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/brazilian-prez-invokes-hanuman-while-seeking-hydroxychloroquine-from-india-68432

Therefore, it has been decided that facial masks will be compulsory for anyone stepping out of their house. Cloth mask shall be eligible too”.Also on Wednesday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said some 20 of the city’s coronavirus hotspots have been sealed off.These areas include Gali No. 6, L-1ST Sangam Vihar; Gandhi Park, Malviya Nagar; Mandawli Gali No. 1; Pandav Nagar H Block Gali No. 1; Khichdipur Gali No. 1-3; Kishan Kunj Ext Gali No. 4; two apartments in IP Extension -- Vardhaman, Mayur Dhwaj; and Mansara Apartment in Vasundhra Enclave, among others.Speaking to the media, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the decision was taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection."The areas will be completely sealed while the administration will ensure door-to-door delivery of essential items," Sisodia said.He also said that some positive cases have been reported in the Sadar area here. "So the area has been sealed too"."Total 20 hotspots have been identified in Delhi and were sealed. Nobody will be allowed to enter or exit these areas," Sisodia said.According to the Health Ministry, an area with 10 or more cases of an infection is called a cluster and if multiple clusters develop in any region and have the potential to spread the infection further, it is called a hotspot.However, for coronavirus, it is an emerging term and even an area with one positive case can be called a hotspot, depending upon the possibility of the spread in that area, the Health Department said.After an area is declared a hotspot or has the capacity to be a hotspot, the authorities have the right to restrict the movement of the people and seal the area making it a containment zone --- locking down a defined geographic area to contain the outbreak of COVID-19.The containment zones, created to map the local transmission of the disease and prevent the contagion from spreading, are announced by the office of the district magistrate. It completely shuts the movement of the common people with the authorities taking care of the essential supplies.The area and the houses in it are sanitised properly. So far, several pockets in the city have been declared containment zones, including parts of Nizamuddin, Dilshad Garden, Vasundhara Enclave, Kalyanpuri, Pandav Nagar, Krishan Kunj, Khichripur, Malviya Nagar, Sangam Vihar and Patparganj.Delhi has reported close to 600 positive cases since the outbreak of the infection, with more than 50 per cent cases from Nizamuddin Markaz -- where over 2,300 people from different parts of the world and country were staying under one roof without following any social distancing.They were evacuated last week after the lockdown was imposed.The development comes on a day when Uttar Pradesh made a similar announcement, sealing off hotspots in 15 districts of the state.India has more than 5,000 reported cases of coronavirus so far, with 149 recorded deaths. ---- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-delhi-makes-face-masks-compulsory-seals-off-20-hotspots-68424

08-04-2020||New Delhi||Govt helpline receives 92,000 calls on abuse and violence in 11 days||The Childline India helpline received more than 92,000 SOS calls asking for protection from abuse and violence in 11 days, a sombre indication that the lockdown has turned into extended captivity not just for many women but also for a lot of children trapped with their abusers at home.Of the 3.07 lakh calls received by the ‘CHILDLINE 1098’ helpline for children in distress across the country between March 20-31, covering the first week of the lockdown, 30 per cent were about protection against abuse and violence on children, said Harleen Walia, deputy director of Childline India. This comes to 92,105 calls.According to Walia, the number of calls after the lockdown, which started after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on March 24, has increased by 50 per cent.The data was shared on Tuesday during an orientation workshop for district based child protection units and attended by senior Women and Child Development Ministry officials.Discussions at the workshop focused on coronavirus-related issues and ways to reduce stress on children during the ongoing lockdown.Some of the other calls received following the lockdown dealt with physical health (11 per cent of calls), child labour (8 per cent), missing and run away children (8 per cent) and homeless (5 per cent), according to figures shared by Walia in the meeting.Besides, the helpline got 1,677 calls with questions on the coronavirus and 237 seeking help for those who are sick.Walia has suggested the helpline be declared an essential service during the lockdown.Many women who are victims of domestic violence are also more vulnerable during the lockdown.National Commission of Women chairperson Rekha Sharma recently said domestic violence complaints have been increasing by the day since the nationwide lockdown was imposed with 69 complaints received just through email.From March 24 till April 1, 257 complaints related to various offences against women were received.Of the 257, 69 complaints are related to domestic violence, the latest data released by the NCW showed.Sharma said the number of cases of domestic violence must be much higher but women are scared to complain due to the constant presence of their abusers at home.“Women are not approaching police because they think that if they take their husband away, her in-laws will then torture her. And he will, in turn, torture her more when he gets out of the police station. Earlier, women could go to their parents but now they are unable to reach them,” Sharma told PTI, adding that the NCW is in touch with some of the complainants. India is currently under the biggest lockdown with around 1.3 billion people asked to stay home in view of the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 149 lives and infected more than 5,100 people.

08-04-2020||New Delhi||Do not label any community or area for spread of COVID-19: Govt||The government on Wednesday issued an advisory to address the social stigma associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, urging people not to label any community or area for the spread of the novel coronavirus.The advisory comes following a spurt in coronavirus cases after a Tablighi Jamaat meet at the group’s headquarters in Nizamuddin here, and instances of people, especially on social media, blaming the Muslim community for the spread of disease.Public health emergencies during an outbreak of communicable diseases may cause fear and anxiety leading to prejudices against people and communities, social isolation and stigma, said the government advisory posted on the health ministry website.Such behaviour may culminate into increased hostility, chaos and unnecessary social disruptions, the advisory said.The government also listed various dos and don’ts in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.“Do not target healthcare and sanitary workers or police. They are there to help you,” the government urged the people amid cases of harassment and social stigmatisation of healthcare and sanitation workers.Cases have been reported of people affected with COVID-19 as well as healthcare workers, sanitary workers and police, who are in the frontline for management of the outbreak, facing discrimination on account of heightened fear and misinformation about the infection, the advisory said.Even those who have recovered from COVID-19 face such discrimination, it noted.Certain communities and areas are being labelled purely based on false reports floating on social media and elsewhere, the advisory said. There is an urgent need to counter such prejudices and to rise as a community that is empowered with health literacy and responds appropriately in the face of this adversity, it said.“Do not label any community or area for spread of COVID-19,” the advisory said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/do-not-label-any-community-or-area-for-spread-of-covid-19-govt-68414
08-04-2020||New Delhi||Bhima Koregaon: SC gives one more week to Navlakha, Teltumbde to surrender||The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave one more week to activists Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde to surrender in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.A Bench headed by Justice Arun—which had on March 16 rejected their anticipatory bail pleas and directed the duo to surrender in three weeks—made it clear that they would not be given any further extension of time.“Though we  expected  that  the  accused  would  surrender,  honouring the  order  of  this  Court,  they  have  not  done  so.  We are told that in Bombay, the courts are functioning. It would have been appropriate for the accused to surrender as the courts are open and not totally closed,” the top court said.“However,  since the petitioners have enjoyed the protection  for long,  by way of  last  opportunity, we extend  the  time  granted  to surrender  for  one  week. We make it clear that there shall not be any further extension of time. This order shall not be treated as a precedent,” it said.Seeking extension of time to surrender, the counsel for the accused pleaded that sending them to jail during COVID-19 outbreak would be like virtually giving them death sentence.The counsel said the accused were senior citizens having health problems and they should be allowed extension of time to surrender.However, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta opposed their pleas, saying it was just yet another ploy to buy time by the accused who were facing serious charges.In its March 16 order rejecting their anticipatory bail pleas, the top court had said, “We are satisfied that  in  view  of  the  provisions contained  in  Section 43D(4)  of the  Unlawful  Activities  (Prevention) Act,  1967, which exclude the  operation  of  Section  438  of  the CrPC.  No case  is  made out  to  exercise  the  powers  under  Section 438 CrPC.”“We are of the opinion that it cannot be said that no prima facie case is made out. The petitions cannot be said to be maintainable in view of the bar contained in 43D(4) of the Unlawful Activities  (Prevention) Act, 1967,” it had said.The accused duo had challenged the February 14 order of the the Bombay High Court denying them anticipatory bail. The high court, had, however, extended their interim protection from arrest for four weeks to enable them to move the top court.The Pune Police alleged that “inflammatory” speeches and “provocative” statements made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017 triggered caste violence at Koregaon Bhima the next day.Navlakha, Teltumbde and several other activists have been booked by the Pune Police for their alleged Maoist links and several other charges following the violence at Koregaon Bhima village in Pune district on January 1, 2018. The accused have denied the allegations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhima-koregaon-sc-gives-one-more-week-to-navlakha-teltumbde-to-surrender-68412

08-04-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 outbreak: Industry seeks partial relief from lockdown||The industry is displaying impatience over one of the world’s most aggressive lockdowns despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi telling a meeting of parliamentary floor leaders on Wednesday that its relaxation does not seem possible.The only ray of hope is that the PM has spoken about taking on board the views of chief ministers who at present hold different views.FICCI is in favour of phased opening of non-hotspot economic markets and boosting COVID-19 medical support across India.“This will instil confidence and preparation for the industry, and we stand united in extending support to the ‘Business Continuity Plan’,” said FICCI President Sangita Reddy.The CII too is of the view that the shutdown should be lifted as early as feasible, in a safe and calibrated manner.“It is important to safeguard the macro fundamentals to ensure that the country does not suffer significant rating downgrades and potential flight of capital,” said the CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee.With India forecast to log barely one to two per cent GDP growth in the 2020-21 fiscal, the industry is also seeking an ambitious bailout package.The PHD Chamber expects an additional Rs 9 lakh crore stimulus package which its President DK Aggarwal estimates will help GDP growth rate reach five per cent.The government has already provided a stimulus of Rs 2 lakh crore, therefore, “our expectation is for the remaining Rs 9 lakh crore in terms of various relief measures and benefits to India’s trade and industry,” he added.The PHD Chamber has also sought an automatic increase of 25 per cent in working capital which should be allowed to convert into a term-loan with a provision of three-year repayment period.The industry also wants the government to pay 75 per cent of salary of the workers during the lockdown and employer contribution in PPFs be brought down to zero.The CII has suggested a fiscal support package of two per cent of the GDP in addition to the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. It wanted additional support to the people at the bottom of the pyramid and support to industry through the banking system.“Our estimates are that the economy would need a credit expansion of 14-15 per cent. Additionally, support through banks would allow the government a leverage of 5-6 times, mitigating the fiscal impact,” said Banerjee while supporting the PHD Chamber’s pleas for working capital enhancement and support for payment of wages to all industry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-outbreak-industry-seeks-partial-relief-from-lockdown-68410

Officials say the personnel will be trained in around two weeks’ time and deployed on the field.The civic body was in the process of acquiring adequate rapid testing kits to screen people in nearly 300 containment zones across the city where people have tested positive for the virus. Civic officials deny that community transmission has begun in Mumbai though a large number of people in city have no history of foreign travel or in contact withsomeone who does.Mumbai’s Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had earlier in an online interaction told reporters that more than 10,000 samples have been tested in the city alone so far. Private and government laboratories were testing almost a thousand samples a day and their facilities were overburdened, Pardeshi told reporters.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray too said in an online interaction that the Maharashtra government was waiting for ICMR to certify the rapid tests kits.“As soon as the test kits are approved and made availableto us, we will start using them,” Thackeray said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pulse-polio-team-to-carry-out-rapid-coronavirus-tests-in-mumbai-68407

Primarily, since viruses replicate within host cells of the lungs, the first component of the strategy will be to inhibit binding of viruses to host cells. While this is expected to reduce host cell infection, viruses will still remain active, therefore, raising the need to inactivate them.Secondly, biological molecules would be incorporated, which would inactivate the trapped viruses in a manner similar to that of detergents. Upon completion, this approach will lead to development of gels that can be locally applied in the nasal cavity, said the DST“The major challenges of testing for COVID-19 are speed, cost, accuracy and accessibility at the point-of-care or use. Several start-ups have developed rather creative and innovative ways to address these needs. DST is supporting the most promising of these to facilitate their development to commercialization chain if found suitable on technical grounds” said Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST.For early detectionOn lines of existing universal platform “Omni-Sens” for early detection and screening of complex diseases (cancers, liver ailments and neonatal sepsis), FastSense Diagnostics has proposed a technology CovE-Sens specifically for COVID 19. A patent has been filed for CovE-Sens which would provide a rapid, point of care detection along with screening and confirmatory test as well with ease of operation.Disinfected boothScientists at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), an autonomous institute of the DST, have designed and developed a disinfected barrier-examination booth for examining COVID-19 patients. The innovative disinfected examination booth is closed like a telephone booth for examining the patient without direct contact with the doctor to prevent transmission of infection. It is equipped with a lamp, table fan, rack, and Ultraviolet (UV) light, says the DSTGenome sequencingTwo institutes of Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi have started working together on the whole genome sequencing of coronavirus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-dst-approves-funding-for-developing-nasal-passage-gel-68405

China and India too are working together and overcoming the difficult time, she said while terming any expectations of an outcome as “totally wrong calculation and wishful thinking”.The petition, filed by a lawyer who heads both the outfits has accused China of inaction and negligence on spreading the virus worldwide and alleging that it had violated International Health Regulations (IHR), and International Human Rights and as also International Humanitarian Laws and UDHR clauses.The lawyer also urged the UNHRC to investigate and direct the Chinese government to “adequately compensate the international community, particularly India, for surreptitiously developing a biological weapon capable of mass destruction of mankind”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/complaint-to-unhrc-on-covid-an-eyeball-catching-nonsense-china-68402

As all are aware, India faces a significantly higher threat from COVID-19 pandemic. It will be pertinent to take note of the fact that India's first line of workers is already engaged in COVID-19 relief and doing commendable job."However, a larger force will be needed to replace the first line and to tackle the exponential or geometric increase in positive COVID-19 cases in the subsequent stages of the pandemic," according to a Personnel Ministry order.The order, however, did not elaborate in what context the country was facing higher threat.Accordingly, to take care of the training needs of the frontline workers, the launch of the integrated government online training (iGOT) platform has been fast-forwarded, and a version of iGOT fitted to these needs has been launched, it said."The platform will provide the training modules on flexitime and on site basis so that the COVID response can be delivered at scale for the workforce needed to tackle the pandemic," said the order.The courses on iGOT, it said, have been launched for doctors, nurses, paramedics, hygiene workers, technicians, auxiliary nursing midwives (ANMs), state government officers and civil defence officials, among others.The online training modules are also available for various police organisations, National Cadet Corps (NCC), Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS), National Service Scheme (NSS), Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), Bharat Scouts and Guides (BSG) and other volunteers at this stage, said the order, which was issued to all central government departments and state governments.They have been asked to encourage more and more members of the organisations concerned to onboard the iGOT platform and undergo online training so that the pandemic may be handled efficiently, the order said.

08-04-2020||Lucknow||Coronavirus: UP to seal off 15 districts considered hotspots from midnight||Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday decided to seal hotspots of 15 districts from midnight, a top state official said.Among those places sealed is state capital Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary RK Tiwari said.The districts chosen for complete clamp down are the ones where more than six cases have been reported so far.Speaking to reporters, Tiwari said that the decision had been taken due to the high load of cases reported from these hotspots.“In an attempt to avoid community spread of COVID 19 the state government have decided to lock down the hotspots in these 15 districts. Only people related to health and delivery services would be allowed”, he said.These hotspots are to be completely sealed until April 15. During this time, no resident would be allowed to move out on the streets, even go to their rooftops or balconies.Addressing a joint press conference later in the day, Additional Chief Secretary Avanish Awasthi said that all shops, including medical stores, banks, ATMs, milk supply and grocery shops, will remain closed during this time. The state government would supply essential items at people’s doorsteps, he said.The districts and the number of hotspots there are Agra (22), Ghaziabad (13), Gautama Buddha Nagar (12) Kanpur (12), Varanasi 94), Shamli (3), Meerut (7), Bareilly (1), Bulandshahr (3), Basti (3), Firozabd (3), Saharanpur (4), Maharajganj (4), Sitapur (1) and Lucknow (12).Awashti said that all passes issued to media persons, members of NGOs and volunteers will be suspended. Helpline numbers are to be released where residents will call for delivery boys of Municipal Corporation and Department of Food and Civil Supplies to reach essential items, said Awasthi.However, the areas not part of the hotspots in these 15 districts would continue to remain under lockdown, he said.Director General of Police HC Awasthi said that during the sealing of the hotspots the areas will be barricaded and completely sanitised with chemical sprays to contain the spread of infection.While the list of the dozen odd hotspots in Lucknow has not been released so far, people have begun crowding shops to stock up essential supplies.Fourth deathMeanwhile, the infection claimed a fourth life in the state.A 76-year old woman who was undergoing treatment at Agra’s Sarojini Naidu Medical College and Hospital died on Wednesday, officials said in the evening.She got the infection from her grandson who recentky returned from abroad.The doctors attending on her said that her death was due to age-related complications.This is the fourth death because of the virus. The first death was reported at Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical college hospital on March 25 when a 25-year old youth from Basti died. The second victim was a 72-year old man in Meerut on April 1 and the third victim was a 55-year old shopkeeper from Gangapur in Varanasi who had died on April 3.Principal Secretary Health Amit Mohan Prasad said that the total number of cases in UP had increased to 343 of which 187 are Tablighi Jamaat related cases. Twenty-seven cases in UP have since been cured and discharged.Speaking to reporters, he said an analysis of the age group of positive cases revealed that 16 per cent were between the ages of 0 to 20 years, 44 per cent between 21 to 40 years, 27 per cent patients are between 41 to 60 years and barely 13 per cent are above 60 years.“This is contrary to the trend in other countries and shows that in India good care is being taken of the elderly who are very vulnerable elsewhere,” the principal secretary said.He also said that with the availability of more testing kits now 1500 more samples would be tested every day. Any suspect coming to government or private hospitals with respiratory problems even in non-corona virus hit districts would in tested, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-up-to-seal-off-15-districts-considered-hotspots-from-midnight-68396
08-04-2020||New Delhi||Top Army medical post is now like a game of ‘musical chairs’||For nearly the last three years, the post of Director General Medical Services (Army)—the senior-most doctor in-charge of the health of 13 lakh Army personnel—has shifted between officers like a game of ‘musical chairs’.The other two services—the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy—also have similar posts. The three have a common boss—the DG Armed Forces Medical Service (DGAFMS).In the past 34 months—since July 2017—there have been eight Lieut General rank doctors, who have been appointed to the post of DGMS Army. The latest one—Lt Gen AK Hooda—who took over on April 2, became the third incumbent in past 10 months—since June 1, 2019. His predecessor—Lt Gen RS Grewal—started his tenure on November 1, 2019, and handed over the charge five months later. Lt Gen A Banerji started his tenure on June 1, 2019, and got promoted as DGAFMS end October.During 2017-2018—for a period of nine months—the post even had an ‘Officiating’ DGMS Army.Sources said a proposal to have fixed tenure for a minimum of one year as DG is awaiting clearance with the Principal Personnel Officer's Committee (PPOC), a body of the three armed forces.A senior functionary said the problem is due to a policy according to which an officer can be in the rank of Lt General (or equivalent in IAF and Navy) for only two years of his career or till he attains the age of 61—the retirement age for medical officers. There is no such tenure cap in fighting arms as officers are in the Lt General rank for 5-6 years.A doctor in the rank of Lt General works on other posts before becoming the DG. By the time the turn comes only for a few months of his two-year tenure remain. A way out of this situation is to retire doctors at 61 years of age instead of sending them home after being Lt Gen for two years.Meanwhile, the Armed Forces Tribunal directed that the seniority principle be followed to appoint the DGMS. The concept of having a fixed tenure was not be considered and the Army then got down to following the AFT directions while the policy-framing to amend the anomaly is pending at PPOC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-army-medical-post-is-now-like-a-game-of-musical-chairs-68394

Lockdown should not be classified as no-activity phase. It requires more physical activities. Please ensure that every family member also does physical activity. It will keep all of us fit, active and away from stress due to prevailing conditions globally,” he said.The ITBP is providing ration, fuel and medicines besides other items of daily use to people in remote areas. The force is also helping authorities in enforcement of the lockdown and keeping an eye on the supplies being provided to the needy.The focus is on remote border villages of Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh as well as of Chhattisgarh where the force is deployed on anti-Naxal operations. The local administration is also being assisted to reach out to the remotest parts of the Himalayas.In addition, migrant labourers and villagers in others parts of the country such as Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Patna are being provided food and other essential items free of cost at specially set up camps.An ITBP statement said thousands of people have benefited from this gesture. The Force is also running awareness campaigns in the areas and, keeping social distancing in mind, disseminating requisite information to the people of these areas. In these efforts, all possible resources of the Force are being used to support the local administration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/step-up-fitness-be-ready-for-tough-eventualities-itbp-chief-to-men-68393

08-04-2020||New Delhi||Doctors, health care workers are warriors, have to be protected, SC tells Centre||Doctors and health care professionals are "warriors" in fight against coronavirus and have to be protected, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday even as the Centre assured that it is doing its best by providing them personal protective equipment (PPE) and other facilities.The apex court suggested that the government should create a mechanism to solicit suggestions from people about how to go ahead on the issues related to COVID-19, including on providing treatment, regulatory mechanism for people working from home and also on lockdown.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Ravindra Bhat, hearing through video-conferencing three petitions seeking protective kits for doctors and health care workers amid coronavirus pandemic, was informed by the Centre that PPE kits and other requisite things are being arranged and it is taking steps in this regard.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who made it clear that he was not opposing the prayers made in these petitions, told the bench that doctors and health care professionals are "corona warriors" and government is ensuring their protection and safety along with their family members.He also denied reports about salary cut of doctors and staffs of hospitals and said the Centre would write to all the states that no salary should be deducted for purchase of PPEs and masks."If anybody is doing something like this (salary cut of doctors and staffs), we will send police," Mehta told the bench, adding, "as an institutional response, we are doing this"."The government and police will walk extra mile to protect doctors," Mehta said and added that to ensure safety of family members, doctors are being housed in hotels also.During the hearing, the bench observed, "Why do you not create a mechanism at district level where nodal officers can be appointed to get suggestions from all persons?"Responding to the query, Mehta said they have a central control room which has officials from ministries of health, home and Ayush.He said such control rooms are also there at state level and they are dealing with calls having suggestions and complaints."They (doctors and health care professionals) are warriors. They have to be protected," the bench observed, adding, "You have to think how to start production. Service sector is working from home. Their well-being and mental health is also important.”Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for one of the petitioners, told the bench that he appreciated the stand of the Solicitor General but doctors are afraid and if medical professionals would not come forward, things would collapse.Rohatgi also pointed out to the reports about corona positive patients escaping from hospitals.Mehta said police pickets had been placed in all the hospitals to ensure that people, who should not be mixing with others, should not leave the hospital.One of the petitions has highlighted the urgent need to provide WHO-graded protective gear to doctors, nurses and medical staff who are treating coronavirus patients across the country.One of the pleas filed by Nagpur-based Jerryl Banait, who is a doctor by profession, has said that the Centre should ensure that World Health Organisation-graded protective gear, including hazmat suits, PPE, starch apparels, medical masks, goggles, face shield, respirators and head covers, is made available to all health workers like doctors, nurses, ward boys, medical and para-medical professionals who are attending COVID-19 patients.Another petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni has sought a direction to the Centre and state governments to resolve the issue of shortage of PPE kits for health care professionals to combat coronavirus.

I want to give a clear message to people not to come out of their house and stay safe," Sudhakar told IANS.The single-seater car, with a 100cc engine, has six wheels, and a fibre body. "It took 10 days to build this car which can touch a maximum speed of 40 kmph," said Sudhakar.He plans to donate the car to Hyderabad police to help create awareness about COVID-19.Building cars with a social message is not new for Sudhakar, who holds the Guinness World Record for designing the largest tricycle in the world."We have always made cars to give back to the society in our own way, for various occasions and causes," said Sudhakar.In the past, he engineered a cage car to spread the message not to cage birds. Similarly there was a cigarette bike for a stop smoking message and a condom bike to create awareness about AIDS. He also highlighted the message of road safety by making a helmet car.Using junk automobile parts, Sudhakar makes offbeat cars which can be driven at slow speed. They are on display at his museum located near the Nehru Zoological Park.He also developed cars in the shape of a burger, a stiletto, a bag, a camera, a football and a computer.

Also to be condered was the duration this lockdown would continue.The petition filed by advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi challenged the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) advisory to fix maximum Rs 4,500 for corona test by private entities.The petition also sought direction that all such tests be conducted by accredited pathological laboratories, and to strike down the ICMR advisory for allegedly being violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.Suggesting free tests, the petitioner also claimed that capping test charges at private labs violates the ideals and values of the Constitution.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/labs-should-not-overcharge-for-covid-19-tests-observes-sc-68378

These could be further discussed to finalise a concrete plan once the situation of lockdown becomes a bit clearer. In a lockdown many of the measures that the government announced may not yield desired results," the officials quoted earlier said.The next set of stimulus may focus on concerns of India Inc. and the SME segments, and in particular a relief package for the travel and aviation sectors  bearing the maximum brunt of present lockdown. Also, demand side measures could look at tax breaks for taxpayers and relief from duty on major items of consumption. Also, measures to provide more strength to the capital market may  also be considered.There is also a suggestion to involve five to six big corporate houses in the production of key items of consumption for the masses so that the country did not face shortages once demand picked up. This could be done by providing direct linkages of farmers with corporate entities so that key food produce reaches the factories for processing and production.India Inc has been waiting for a package that would address some of the immediate problems and provide to sectors bearing the maximum brunt. Among the suggestions include withdrawal of LTCG temporarily, remove buyback tax while defer payment of corporate tax. The industry has also suggested that timelines for qualifying delays in loan repayment as NPAs should also be extended."While lockdown measures seem to be working in reducing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic globally, the associated loss of income for a large section of the society in India could hurt consumer spends. There is a broad-based expectation from the Indian government to look at additional fiscal measures to counter the effect of the likely slowdown in the economy,"  Kotak institutional equities said in report on consumer spend.While announcing the last package, Sitharaman had indicated that concerns of the India Inc. and SME segments and other segments of the economy impacted by the present lockdown may be looked at and government will come up with a plan later."Our first priority is to reach food to the poor and reach money in their hand. We will think about other things later," Sitharaman had said then.To a specific question on relief for travel and aviation sectors bearing the maximum brunt of present lockdown, the finance minister said : "we  will come back when something is ready." There was meeting of the officials of various ministries on Sunday where the possibility of redesigning some welfare and other government schemes was also discussed. The plan is to tailor-made schemes to suit the post-lockdown situation.One of the group of senior bureaucrats constituted by the prime minister to prepare India's response to COVID-19, is specially tasked to finalise a set of economic measures needed to help the economy stand on its feet post lockdown.The next package would be third in line by the government that has already relaxed a lot of compliance related issues and provided a package for the list vulnerable sections of the society.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bigger-economic-package-to-fight-covid-19-on-cards-announcement-soon-68377

In this situation, there is a possibility of inventory building/hoarding and black marketing, profiteering, and speculative trading, resulting in price rise of essential goods. The states have been asked to take urgent steps to ensure availability of these commodities at fair prices for public at large,” Bhalla said in the letter.Earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), with its orders under the Disaster Management Act, has allowed manufacture/production, transport and other related supply-chain activities in respect of essential goods like foodstuff, medicines and medical equipment.Further, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution is authorising States/UTs to notify orders under the EC Act, 1955 by relaxing the requirement of prior concurrence of the Central Government up to June 30, 2020.Offences under the EC Act are criminal offences and may result in imprisonment of seven years or fine or both.

So there was no need for me to act, for the video. As the virus is spreading at this scale, everyone should wear face mask," the state award winning actor said later.He bagged the 'best actor' title in the state film awards through the movie 'Aalorukkam' in 2018.The 63-year-old actor also lifted the best actor title at the Singapore South Asian International Film Festival recently.

08-04-2020||Washington||Over 29 million hydroxychloroquine doses bought by US have come from India: Trump||A sizeable chunk of the 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine bought by the US to combat the coronavirus pandemic is from India, President Donald Trump has said as he acknowledged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was "great" when he sought his help to allow the sale of the anti-malaria drug to treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients in America.Trump and Prime Minister Modi spoke over the phone last week. During the call, Trump requested Modi to lift the hold on the American order of hydroxychloroquine, of which India is the major producer. Hydroxychloroquine has been identified by the US Food and Drug Administration as a possible treatment for the COVID-19 and it is being tested on more than 1,500 coronavirus patients in New York. Anticipating that it will work, given initial positive results, Trump has bought more than 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine for potential treatment of COVID-19 patients."I bought millions of doses (of hydroxychloroquine). More than 29 million. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi, a lot of it (hydroxychloroquine) comes out of India. I asked him if he would release it? He was Great. He was really good," Trump told Sean Hannity of the Fox News on Monday night."You know they put a stop because they wanted it for India,” Trump said responding to a question on the usage of hydroxychloroquine.India on Tuesday allowed the export of hydroxychloroquine to the US, which has emerged as the global hotspot of COVID-19.By Tuesday night, nearly four lakh Americans tested positive for the novel coronavirus and the fatalities was more than 12,850. During the interview, Trump described hydroxychloroquine as a powerful malaria drug. The drug is being tested on hundreds of coronavirus patients in New York. “But there are a lot of good things coming from that,” Trump said. “Lot of people are looking at it and saying, you know I don't hear bad stories, I hear good stories. And I don't hear anything where it is causing death,” said the US President.Hydroxychloroquine, an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria, is seen as a viable therapeutic solution by President Trump to coronavirus.Last week, Trump said he has sought help from Prime Minister Modi to allow the sale of hydroxychloroquine tablets ordered by the US to treat the growing number of coronavirus patients in his country, hours after India banned the export of the anti-malarial drug.India has received similar requests from several other countries including its immediate neighbours Sri Lanka and Nepal. India has said that it is reviewing its export ban order.Notably, India's decision to ban the exports of hydroxychloroquine is driven by its desire to take stock of the domestic requirements and ensure that the country has enough of the drug."I would be surprised if he would, you know, because India does very well with the United States," Trump told reporters during a press briefing at the White House on Monday.Trump and Modi enjoy a personal friendship as reflected in the president joining the prime minister at the "Howdy, Modi!" event in Houston last September.This February, Trump made a rare India-specific solo trip to Ahmedabad and New Delhi.India on Monday agreed to lift the ban on export of hydroxychloroquine to the US. Three Gujarat-based companies would export these tablets to the US, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said on Tuesday.India manufactures 70 per cent of the world's supply of hydroxychloroquine, according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) secretary-general Sudarshan Jain.The country has a production capacity of 40 tonnes of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) every month, implying 20 crore tablets of 200 mg each. And since the drug is also used to auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, manufacturers have good production capacities that can also be ramped up.

08-04-2020||United Nations||Coronavirus: About 400 million workers in India may sink into poverty: UN report||About 400 million people working in the informal economy in India are at risk of falling deeper into poverty due to the coronavirus crisis which is having "catastrophic consequences", and is expected to wipe out 195 million full-time jobs or 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of this year, the UN's labour body has warned.The International Labour Organisation (ILO) in its report titled 'ILO Monitor 2nd edition: COVID-19 and the world of work', describes coronavirus pandemic as "the worst global crisis since World War II"."Workers and businesses are facing catastrophe, in both developed and developing economies. We have to move fast, decisively, and together. The right, urgent, measures, could make the difference between survival and collapse," ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said on Tuesday.Worldwide, two billion people work in the informal sector (mostly in emerging and developing economies) and are particularly at risk, the report said, adding that the COVID-19 crisis is already affecting tens of millions of informal workers."In India, Nigeria and Brazil, the number of workers in the informal economy affected by the lockdown and other containment measures is substantial," ILO said."In India, with a share of almost 90 per cent of people working in the informal economy, about 400 million workers in the informal economy are at risk of falling deeper into poverty during the crisis. Current lockdown measures in India, which are at the high end of the University of Oxford's COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index, have impacted these workers significantly, forcing many of them to return to rural areas," it said.The report said the disruption to the world's economies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of this year – the equivalent of 195 million jobs worldwide."This is the greatest test for international cooperation in more than 75 years. If one country fails, then we all fail. We must find solutions that help all segments of our global society, particularly those that are most vulnerable or least able to help themselves," said Ryder."The choices we make today will directly affect the way this crisis unfolds and so the lives of billions of people. With the right measures we can limit its impact and the scars it leaves. We must aim to build back better so that our new systems are safer, fairer and more sustainable than those that allowed this crisis to happen," he said.Large reductions are foreseen in the Arab States (8.1 per cent, equivalent to 5 million full-time workers), Europe (7.8 per cent, or 12 million full-time workers) and Asia and the Pacific (7.2 per cent, 125 million full-time workers), it said.Huge losses are expected across different income groups but especially in upper-middle income countries (7 per cent, 100 million full-time workers), far exceeding the effects of the 2008-9 financial crisis, the report warned."The COVID-19 pandemic is having a catastrophic effect on working hours and earnings, globally," it said.The agency said sectors most at risk include accommodation and food services, manufacturing, retail, and business and administrative activities.The eventual increase in global unemployment during 2020 will depend substantially on future developments and policy measures. There is a high risk that the end-of-year figure will be significantly higher than the initial ILO projection of 25 million, it said.More than four out of five people (81 per cent) in the global workforce of 3.3 billion are currently affected by full or partial workplace closures, it said.According to the report, 1.25 billion workers are employed in the sectors identified as being at high risk of "drastic and devastating"  increases in layoffs and reductions in wages and working hours. Many are in low-paid, low-skilled jobs, where a sudden loss of income is devastating.Looked at regionally, the proportion of workers in these "at risk" sectors varies from 43 per cent in the Americas to 26 per cent in Africa.Some regions, particularly Africa, have higher levels of informality, which combined with a lack of social protection, high population density and weak capacity, pose severe health and economic challenges for governments, the report cautions.Large-scale, integrated, policy measures were needed, focusing on four pillars: supporting enterprises, employment and incomes; stimulating the economy and jobs; protecting workers in the workplace; and, using social dialogue between government, workers and employers to find solutions, the study says.

They attributed this to consuming contaminated water. The water, probably, had insecticides used by farmers for agriculture.A veterinarian, Prakash Neer, said that the monkeys may have consumed some poisonous substance. He said that the lungs of the dead monkeys were swollen and their body temperature showed they had high fever.People, however, fear that the deaths could be linked to some virus, probably the coronavirus. this week there was a tiger death in US’ brox zoo due to Covid-19Meanwhile, monkeys in Ayodhya are angry as well as hungry lot these days. While the national lockdown has led to a total absence of tourists in the holy city, the monkeys have no one to feed them. In the past 24 hours, the monkeys have attacked and bitten 39 people.Anil Kumar a doctor at Shri Ram hospital said that 39 people have come to the hospital after being bitten by monkeys. "This is the highest number that I have seen in a matter of few hours," he said.According to Ram Lal Mishra, a resident, there are about 7,000 to 8,000 monkeys in Ayodhya."Since thousands of tourists, in normal times, come to Ayodhya and they feed monkeys with bananas, bread, puris and other eatables. The monkeys in Ayodhya were never as aggressive as the ones in Vrindavan but they made sure that they get their food by walking off with bags and sunglasses which they return only if they are given food."However, after the lockdown, the tourist influx has stopped. Even the local people are not moving out because all temples are shut. Monkeys are getting aggressive because they have been hungry," he explained.Raju, one of the victims who was bitten by a monkey, said, "I was putting out clothes to dry on my terrace when a group of monkeys came and pounced on me. Before I could realise what was happening, one of them bit me on the shoulder. I have never seen  monkeys behave like this."The local people have also stopped offering food to the simians because they are also feeling the pinch of the lockdown."I used to keep 'chana' (gram) and 'roti' on my terrace for the monkeys but now with the uncertainty over the lockdown, I am keeping all the food grains for my family. Besides, my son owns a stationary shop which has been shut since March 22 so the income  has also stopped. In such a situation, most people are unable to feed the monkeys," said Rama Gupta, a senior citizen who stays with her two sons and their families.The local administration claims that it is providing bread and grams for monkey but the local people say that the exercise is 'inadequate'.With all restaurants and eateries completely shut, there is no leftover food for the monkeys either.

In the video, the singer is Asif Khan, Seif Ali Khan is working flawlessly on the tabla, Idris Khan shows expertise in guitar and Zishan supports it with vocals."The current situation that we are in bothers me and I wanted to share my feelings with everyone, this is the main motive of the song. It is a difficult situation for everyone to be in lockdown, so this song is a message for everyone to be involved creatively to beat the boredom and keep one's mind busy. The song signifies my plea to the virus to leave our beloved country," said Asif.To this, Pratap Singh Nirwan, the founder and team coach, added: "We had back-to-back shows, sleepless nights, long working hours between shooting, recording, performing live. In this hustle, suddenly an unnatural circumstance occurs which is COVID 19. And everything comes to a halt. Everything changed over the past few weeks, with artists and promoters having to cancel more than 50,000 (globally) shows due to the pandemic. And there is no telling when it will be deemed safe again to gather in large numbers. As governments ask people across the world to stay home, we all understand it is very necessary to cope with the current situation."Nirwan continued: "To be honest, initially, we were unable to cope with this, but on the other side, we also find it as a vital part of our life now. And the reason being that we were able to spend some quality time with family, practise music from our father, he's our guru as well. A growing number of artists have responded to their newfound confinement by streaming live on the Internet. So yes, we engage with our audience, by performing live.

The five-point plan stands for "testing, tracing, treatment, team work and tracking and monitoring" of the patients.Dedicated hospitalsThe Delhi Government has declared LNJP and GB Pant hospitals as exclusive Covid hospitals. A total of 2,450 beds are there in the government hospitals and 450 in private hospitals for Covid patients. The plan is also ready for up to 30,000 patients — with 8,000 beds in hospitals and 12,000 in hotels, and accommodation of 10,000 patients in banquets and dharamshalas.The government has decided to conduct one lakh tests to identify Covid hotspots in the city. The government has already ordered kits for rapid test and is in the process of procuring PPE kits."The first T is testing. We have observed that the nations where testing was not done, were not able to contain the outbreak of corona. Maximum testing enables us to know the actual statistics of people affected by corona. South Korea, for instance, increased its testing capacity so that it can quarantine and treat infected people, and control further spread of the virus," said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.He said the government had ordered testing kits for around 50,000 persons. The shortage of PPE kits would be overcome with the help of 27,000 PPE kits from the Central Government.The second T is tracing, which involves identifying and self-quarantining people who have come in contact with an infected person in the 14-day period. The police will be tracking infected persons.Explaining the third T, Kejriwal said: "The third T is treatment. We have around 3,000 beds ready for treatment. LNJP and GB Pant hospitals have been declared as primary hospitals for corona treatment with 1,500 beds and 500 beds, respectively, and no other treatments are being carried out there. Rajiv Gandhi hospital has 450 beds and has been declared as corona hospital. We would need 400 ventilators and 1,200 oxygen kits for 30,000 patients.""The 4th T is teamwork. No one can work on containing corona alone. It requires teamwork and a collective effort to do that and I am happy that all state governments and the Centre are fighting together against it. All state governments must learn from each other and work towards eliminating corona," he said.Kejriwal said: "The 5th T is tracking and monitoring. It is my responsibility to ensure that all these measures are in place and all the systems are functioning smoothly. I am tracking and monitoring all these things 24x7."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-readies-5-t-plan-to-tackle-covid-67195

The CPM too held a similar view including that development works done in districts were usually in consonance with state government plans.Another Congress MP, Pratap Bajwa, who supported the move to slash MP’s pay and suspend MPLADS, suggested the government to do away with its pet project of Central Vista development that has been allocated Rs 20,000 crore. The matter was formally flagged by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in her letter to the Prime Minister among the list of suggestions to fight the pandemic.The plan envisages a new Parliament building with office space for MPs, re-developing the Central Vista area into a modern government office block, new residences for the Vice President and Prime Minister in the vicinity of Rashtrapati Bhawan and Parliament House.The format, restricting participation to parties not having five or more MPs, has drawn criticism with CPI general secretary D Raja having raised the matter with the government. “Why should the government keep representatives of political parties with presence in Parliament out on technicalities,” he sought to know.There are 23 parties with three or less representatives in the Lok Sabha while the Rashtriya Janata Dal remains out since its newly-elected MP is yet to take oath. According to the format, one representative from the invited parties will get a limited time to present views.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/voices-differ-ahead-of-pms-interaction-with-parties-67199

In my view, while the concerns of economy can wait for another day, that of health can’t,” he said in a statement as the country enters into the third-week of the 21-day lockdown.Urging people to abide by any decision the leadership takes in this regard, Naidu said the next seven days would be critical in deciding on the exit from the present nationwide restrictions in force from March 25 with data on the extent and rate of spread of virus infection having a bearing on such a strategy.Referring to the consultations between the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers on the exit strategy, he said people should abide by whatever decision follows and cooperate with the same spirit that has so far been demonstrated even if hardships continue after April 14. He expected that governments would ensure smooth functioning of supply chains and adequate relief and support for the vulnerable sections.During his second round of interactions with Chief Ministers last week, the Prime Minister asked the Chief Ministers to offer their suggestions on how the exit strategy should be drawn.Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhara Rao has already advocated extension of the current lockdown as a measure to contain the spread of the pandemic.Alluding to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the national capital and its fallout when the efforts for flattening the coronavirus curve were bearing fruits, Naidu said it was an avoidable aberration and an eye opener for others.The Vice-President urged the global community to draw right lessons from the present crisis to effectively face the next imminent one by addressing the inadequacies in respect of effectiveness of institutions, information sharing, international cooperation and individual actions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/next-7-days-crucial-to-decide-on-lockdown-exit-plan-naidu-67197

India must help all nations in their hour of need but lifesaving medicines should be made available to Indians in ample quantity first. Rahul Gandhi, Congress LeaderThe government today said it would allow the export of the previously contracted shipments of the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) drug to the US. Trump had recently said he wanted to eliminate all barriers to make the drug available for the treatment of Covid patients in the US, where the death toll has crossed 10,000.The US President followed up his request to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow export of HCQ with a hint of retaliation if India dragged its feet, saying he would be surprised in case of a negative outcome as New Delhi has good relations with Washington.India has been preserving HCQ stocks after preliminary findings in the US said it had “significant clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nasopharynx compared with non-treated controls”.India put up a brave front over its decision to reverse the export ban on HCQ and paracetamol as well as a second decision taken on Monday to also reverse a one-month ban on 13 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) due to a comfortable stock position. Another factor that dictated the shifting of HCQ and paracetamol from the restricted to the licensed list (case-by-case clearance) was India’s obligation to supply it to nations badly affected by the pandemic, especially after PM Modi had taken the lead in the matter at SAARC. Not just Trump but several world leaders in phone calls to PM Modi had requested India for reconsideration, especially on releasing shipments previously contracted by US companies. “India has always maintained that the international community must display strong solidarity and cooperation,” said the MEA in this respect.The MEA indicated that India would accord top priority to sending paracetamol and HCQ to neighbouring countries that were “dependent on Indian capabilities”, thus indicating that Pakistan might not make the cut.MEA spokesperson Anurag Shrivastava said the March 3 order banning the export of 13 APIs and formulations and the reversal on Monday was actually a temporary step as part of the obligation of “any responsible government” to ensure that there were adequate domestic stocks of medicines. The curbs were lifted after an assessment confirmed the availability of medicines for all possible contingencies, he said, adding that the issue should not be politicised.Other sources agreed and said that apart from paracetamol and HCQ, the other 13 APIs and formulations were not directly connected with the treatment of Covid. These were primarily made in Hubei province, the Covid-19 epicentre, whose lockdown prompted the government to impose export restrictions. Now the fear of shortages has receded after Chinese pharma companies got back on track.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-trump-hints-at-retaliation-govt-allows-chloroquine-export-67189

A call will have to be taken on reopening of malls and cinema houses.Earlier in the day, co-chairman of the Empowered Committee on Covid-19 Response VK Paul said all options were open and the government was taking into account various factors to determine the timing and nature of a strategy to de-escalate the lockdown.Speaking to The Tribune, he said an important consideration for India’s medium-term strategy against Covid-19 would be the impact of the current lockdown in the form of diminishing number of cases.“We expect to see the results of the lockdown in the next two to three days and also a definitive change in disease trends in the form of diminishing numbers. These trends will be a very important consideration in our medium-term strategy against the virus. A systematic understanding of determinants is being undertaken and the government is examining all aspects to develop a plan for de-escalation of the lockdown,” said Paul, also a member of NITI Aayog.He said a strategy would be framed considering the disease outbreak profile and Covid 19 projections on the one hand and needs of the people, industry, agriculture and labour on the other. “The visible big gain of the lockdown has been that cases have been staggered and we have bought time to strengthen our health system, rope in private resources and plan better for the future,” he noted.On the surge in cases, he replied: “The surge you see today is because of the disease existing in the pre- lockdown stage,” he explained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-mulls-phased-lifting-of-lockdown-67187
