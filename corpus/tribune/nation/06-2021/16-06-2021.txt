16-06-2021||Aligarh (UP)||Covid-hit family starves at home, hospitalised||A Covid widow who lost her job due to the pandemic and her five children have been admitted to a hospital here, apparently after going without food for days.Doctors at the Malkhan Singh District Hospital said the six family members were barely able to talk or stand up when they were admitted on Tuesday by some Good Samaritans.The mother, Guddi (40), told media persons that after having lost her husband, who was the sole breadwinner, to Covid last year, she had been somehow eking out a living by working in a lock factory. That too shut down a few months ago.After the news surfaced, District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh rushed a team of officials to investigate the matter and extend relief, an official release said.After losing her job, Guddi said her eldest son Ajay (20) started working as a daily wage construction worker but due to the lockdown in April during the second wave of coronavirus, he too lost his job and all sources of income dried up.As no one was able to move out of their house located at Mandir ka Nagla under Sasni Gate police station area, Guddi said that for nearly eight weeks, they survived on ‘chapatis’ which their neighbours used to give them.However, 10 days back even such mercies ended and “the entire family went without a single meal”, she said.The DM has sent a team of three officials led by Sub Divisional Magistrate Kunwar Bahadur Singh to investigate the matter and “provide immediate relief including foodgrain, other food items and a sum of Rs 5,000 to the affected family”, the release said.He said that the matter is being investigated and further action will follow soon.Meanwhile, Sunil Kumar who runs a social organisation ‘Hands for Help’ has also come forward to provide ration.Vishnu Kumar Bunty of Manav Upkar Sanstha, which has been helping people hit by the coronavirus pandemic, has demanded a probe into this incident.He said a door-to-door survey should be held to trace those whose livelihoods have been hit by the recent lockdowns. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-hit-family-starves-at-home-hospitalised-269425

But (when I arrived here), I got to know that the Taj Mahal is reopening so I rushed to book a ticket.”            “I came here very early and was the first tourist to have stepped inside. It was magical. Thank you, India for this opportunity,” she said.A couple from Lucknow described their experience as “memorable”.“I’ve visited Taj Mahal many times but today’s visit was memorable. I booked tickets online and was able to see the most beautiful white marble mausoleum in the world,” said Amir.For him, it was a “wah Taj!” moment with birds chirping during the sunrise at the monument that looked “so clean and beautiful” with few visitors.Mamta Tomar, who travelled from Ghaziabad with her family, said they had been waiting for a long time to visit the monument.“I and my other family members clicked photos from the central tank and captured every moment on our phone,” she said. The visitors followed Covid protocol with their masks on. They were thermal screened and sanitised before entering the premises of the monument.One could sense huge enthusiasm among all, including the shopkeepers and vendors outside the tomb complex.Some tourist guides were also spotted at the Shilpgram parking area.Superintending Archaeologist, ASI Agra Circle Vasant Kumar Swarnkar, said that of the 1,919 visitors, 1,850 were adults and 67 children.At Itmad-ud-daulah, 30 tickets were sold, at Mehtab Bagh 59, at Ram Bagh 45 and at Mariam Tomb 19 tickets, he said.

16-06-2021||Chandigarh||Global warming could repeat past instances of heavy floods in Ladakh, calls for serious planning, warns study||Studies have revealed that the cold desert of Ladakh in the Himalayas once experienced heavy floods that rose much above the present-day river level. This implies that in the scenario of global warming, when the higher Himalayan regions are expected to respond dramatically, the frequency of floods in Ladakh may increase, calling for serious urban and rural planning.Large floods that naturally occur in major rivers of India fed by melting snow and glaciers and a continental scale precipitation regime of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) as well as the Westerlies and East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) significantly modify the landscape and impact lives and economy in its geomorphic domain.These floods are of various types and origin such as glacial or landslide lake outbursts, cloudbursts and excessively strong monsoon. These have different forcing factors and frequencies and therefore add large uncertainty in flood prediction models.An instrumental record of these floods is of approximately 100 years, which is not enough to understand the natural ramp of flood occurrences in the Himalayas and therefore data going deep into time is required.A team of students and scientists from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology at Dehradun, travelled through the tough terrain along the Zanskar and Indus rivers and looked minutely into geological signatures of past floods in Ladakh region that date between 3,000 to 15,000 years ago. Their findings have been recently published in the Geological Society of America Bulletin, according to a statement issued today by the Ministry of Science and Technology.Flood leaves a stack of fine sand and silts, called Slack Water Deposits (SWDs), at places along its channel where the flood energy drastically reduces. The SWDs were located at several locations along the Zanskar and Indus rivers, counted vertically for the number of floods and were dated using a technology called Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. The flood deposits were also analysed for their source.This analysis showed that the cold desert once experienced a large flood that rose to more than 30 meters above the present-day river level. The active flood plains nearer to the river were also utilised by humans, possibly as camping sites and for cooking, as indicated by presence of hearths at several locations and levels of flood deposits.The chronology of the flood deposits pointed towards three phases of increased flooding that occurred in Ladakh after the period called Last Glacial Maximum. These phases were between 14,000 years-11,000, 10,000-8,000 years and 7,000-4,000 years ago.These were times when due to warming, the Indian summer monsoon was active in Ladakh as well. The results also suggest that Ladakh floods are chronologically out-of-phase with those occurring in the north-eastern Himalayas and mainland China during the past 15,000 years. This implies that the modern relationship between the ISM and EASM goes back more than 14,000 years.The preliminary study of hearths suggested that there was an inbound migration of people along the mountain corridors of Ladakh after the Last Glacial Maximum when temperatures were relatively warmer and hydrology of the region was supporting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-warming-could-repeat-past-instances-of-heavy-floods-in-ladakh-calls-for-serious-planning-warns-study-269422

16-06-2021||Mumbai||Sena, BJP workers come to blows over Saamana’s comments on Ayodhya land row||Clashes broke out between Shiv Sena and BJP workers in Dadar area here on Wednesday after the youth wing of the BJP took out a protest march against ‘offensive’ remarks in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana about the land deal controversy in Ayodhya.The police used force to disperse the supporters of the two parties which were once allies. Sena workers assaulted a woman member of the BJP, the latter alleged.The trouble started after the Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha took out a protest march towards Shiv Sena Bhavan in Dadar, the Sena’s headquarters, over a Saamana editorial which demanded probe of a “suspicious” land purchase deal by the Ram temple trust in Ayodhya. The trust has denied the allegations.Following the clashes, police took several persons in custody but nobody had been arrested till late in the evening, an officer said.BJP leaders Ashish Shelar, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, Pravin Darekar and others reached the police station and demanded action against Shiv Sena activists.Shelar, an MLA and former Maharashtra minister, warned of strong retaliation in future.“I warn Shiv Sena workers of retaliation if they again attacked our workers,” he said, alleging that Sena workers also attacked a woman supporter of the BJP in the presence of police.“The Sena was once proud of the demolition of the Babri mosque, but now for political reasons it is defaming Lord Ram. Sonia or Vadra (Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra) have now become the Sena’s deities,” he said, in a swipe at the Sena’s alliance with the Congress in Maharashtra.Sena MLA Sada Sarvankar said, “We were first told that BJP workers were coming to protest, later we learnt that they are coming to vandalise the Sena Bhavan. So, we stopped them before they could reach near it.”Akshada Tendulkar, a BJP supporter, alleged that when she was returning to her vehicle after the protest, she was suddenly attacked by Sena workers and “police did nothing to stop them”.The Shiv Sena and BJP broke off their decades-old alliance after the 2019 Assembly elections in Maharashtra.Two offenses were registered at Shivaji Park police station following the incident.One FIR was registered under IPC sections 188 (disobeying lawful order of public servant) and 269 (act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and National Disaster Management Act against 30 persons. Another FIR was registered under IPC sections related to rioting, unlawful assembly and assault against seven persons, police said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sena-bjp-workers-come-to-blows-over-saamanas-comments-on-ayodhya-land-row-269419

Also exempted are small jewellers with less than Rs 40 lakh annual turnover, BIS Director-General Pramod Kumar Tiwari told media persons.What's happeningWomen having traditional/old jewellery can also sell without going through the process. Old jewellery can be hallmarked as it is, if feasible by the jeweller or after melting and making new jewellery, he said. Jewellery for international exhibitions and for government-approved B2B domestic exhibitions will also be exempted from mandatory hallmarking.Amid speculations that the government has decided to “exempt” small jewellers “under pressure”, Tiwari said the assaying facilities are yet not available in many parts of the country, especially remote and villages. Besides, it is a voluntary option, and when customers make such a demand, small jewellers will also have to opt for it. “Consumer is the king, ultimately they will decide the ultimate future course of action,” he said. Meanwhile, to give adequate time to the manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, there will be no penalties till August end.Hallmarking of gold is a “conscious, balanced, positive decision that is good for the country and consumers. We are making a new beginning with this historic decision. It is a positive initiative by the government”, he said. Jewellers are registered for selling hallmarked jewellery and recognised testing and hallmarking centres. Hallmarking will enable consumers/Jewellery buyers to make the right choice and save them from any unnecessary confusion while buying gold. At present, only 30 per cent of Indian Gold Jewellery is hallmarked, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/phased-mandatory-hallmarking-of-gold-jewellery-kicks-in-indias-256-districts-269384

Continued our exchange of perspectives on Afghanistan and the region,” tweeted Jaishankar tweeted. The External Affairs Ministry had not previously announced the meeting.The US has already indicated India’s indispensability in the peace process. In March, the US had said it would take several steps—the first of which would be to ask the UN to convene a meeting of foreign ministers from India, Pakistan, China, Iran, Russia and US to discuss a unified approach to Afghanistan.India’s position was articulated by Jaishankar at the 9th Heart of Asia Ministerial Conference in Tajikistan’s capital, Dushanbe, where he expressed grave concern over violence and bloodshed in Afghanistan and called for genuine double peace. Jaishankar also asked the negotiating parties to engage in good faith, with a serious commitment towards reaching a political solution.The US and the Taliban had signed an agreement in Doha last year on withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan that would end Washington’s two-decade-long occupation of Afghanistan.Last November, Jaishankar and Khalilzad had held talks here on this issue which was preceded by an Indian delegation attending the inaugural ceremony of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha.Jaishankar had a brief stopover in Doha on June 9 during which he met Qatar’s NSA and thanked him for the support and solidarity during India’s second wave.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-state-department-keen-on-indian-say-in-afghan-peace-process-269380
16-06-2021||New Delhi||Has Twitter actually lost its 'legal shield' in India?||With IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad slamming Twitter once again, ironically in a series of tweets, leading experts on Wednesday began a debate on whether the micro-blogging platform has actually lost its "legal shield" in the country from prosecution over posts.There is no doubt that India needs to ensure that the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 do not become a mere paper tiger and are effectively implemented.However, can the country stipulate stringent liabilities against social media firms like Twitter for failing to comply with its directions?Also read:By virtue of Rule 7 of the IT (Intermediary Guidelines) rules 2021, the moment any intermediary including any significant social media intermediary does not comply with the IT rules, they automatically lose their statutory exemption from legal liability."Further, they become liable for being punished for various offences under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In this case, Twitter by not complying with the IT rules 2021 has lost its statutory immunity after the expiry of 90 days from February 25," leading cyberlaw expert Pavan Duggal told IANS.According to him, Twitter no longer has the "suraksha kavach" or statutory exemption from legal liability."This effectively means that they are liable to be sued in civil and criminal actions across the country, and they are liable to defend each one of them for third party data or information made available by them," Duggal added.However, according to non-profit Internet Freedom Foundation, the "intermediary status" is not a registration that is granted by the government."The present concerns arise from Rule 7 of the IT Rules, but Rule 7 only says that the provisions of Section 79 of the IT Act won't apply to intermediaries that fail to observe the IT Rules," the foundation said in a series of tweets."The new IT Rules, as per several digital rights organisations, are unconstitutional. In fact, they have been challenged in several state High Courts (like by TM Krishna, a prominent Carnatic music vocalist and cultural critic in Madras HC)," the foundation added.According to Virag Gupta, the lawyer of former RSS ideologue K.N. Govindacharya, who is arguing the social media Designated Officers' matter before the Delhi High Court, there are three aspects of new IT Rules."However, there is debate only on one aspect of Grievance Officer. Facebook, Google, WhatsApp and other tech giants including Twitter have yet not fully complied with rules related to Nodal Officer and Compliance Officer," Gupta told IANS.Article 14 of the Constitution mandates equality, but the government is "singling out Twitter and not taking action against other social media companies which are not compliant with the law", Gupta argued.According to Minister Prasad, Twitter was given multiple opportunities to comply with the same, but has "deliberately chosen" the path of non-compliance."In certain scenarios, with the amplification of social media, even a small spark can cause a fire, especially with the menace of fake news. This was one of the objectives of bringing the Intermediary Guidelines," he said in a series of tweets."Further, what is perplexing is that Twitter fails to address the grievances of users by refusing to set up process as mandated by the law of the land. Additionally, it chooses a policy of flagging manipulated media, only when it suits, its likes and dislikes," the IT Minister added.Twitter was yet to react to the latest tweets by IT Minister.Experts argued that India needs to come up with effective legal provisions stipulating the consequences to be faced by social media companies in case they do not take effective steps to fight the menace of fake news/misinformation on their platforms.The options for the government are now to start legal proceedings against Twitter for third-party data and information."Further, all affected persons who have been affected by the inactions of the service provider, can sue the service provider, both for legal action and also for criminal liability," said Duggal.Since Twitter, as a service provider, has not complied with the new IT rules, the government can also start initiating action to prevent them from offering their service in "a seamless manner in the Indian context", the experts noted. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/has-twitter-actually-lost-its-legal-shield-in-india-269379

16-06-2021||New Delhi||Facebook begins health fact-check in India||Facebook on Wednesday joined hands with The Healthy Indian Project (THIP)—a health specialised fact-checking site—as part of its third-party fact-checking programme in India to combat Covid-19 and all other health related misinformation on the social media platform.During the pandemic, Facebook removed more than 18 million pieces of harmful misinformation across its platform and Instagram and labelled over 167 million fake news posts on Covid-19 with the help of third-party fact-checkers.The partnership with THIP "will enhance its capabilities to understand and curb health-related misinformation on the platform", the social media giant said in a statement.THIP Media works with verified medical professionals to fact-check misleading news and claims about health, medicines, diet and treatment in English, Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi and Gujarati.Globally, Facebook is working with 80 fact-checking partners that help in content monitoring in more than 60 languages. Facebook's fact-checking partners have been certified through the independent, non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network.In India, Facebook has 10 fact-checking partners, one of the largest after the US. This includes India Today Group, Vishvas News (Dainik Jagran), Factly, Newsmobile, Fact Crescendo, BOOM Live, AFP, NewsChecker and Quint who fact-check in 11 Indian languages along with English.The Indian languages include Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil, Marathi, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, Assamese and Kannada."Third-party fact-checkers evaluate stories, check if the stories are factual, and rate their accuracy. When a fact-checker rates a story as false, Facebook shows it lower in News Feed, significantly reducing its dissemination and reducing the number of people who view it," the company said.Pages and domains that repeatedly share false news will also see their distribution reduced and their ability to monetise and advertise temporarily removed.Community members are presented with a pop-up notice if someone tries to share a fact-checked post so that people can decide for themselves what to read, trust and share.People who share a story that's later debunked are notified, so they know there is additional reporting on that piece of content, the company added.Facebook has also launched a fellowship with 10 fact-checking organisations (including Factly and Quint in India) and will provide virtual training sessions by third party experts to help the participating fact-checkers enhance their capabilities to combat misinformation related to Covid-19. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facebook-begins-health-fact-check-in-india-269375

16-06-2021||  New Delhi||Plea in SC seeking ‘health star rating’ for food items, beverages||A petition has been filed before the Supreme Court seeking direction to the government to frame guidelines on health star rating and impact assessment for food items and beverages.The petition, likely to come up for hearing in the coming days, sought a direction to Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to examine WHO Recommendations on fat, salt and sugar intake, the guidelines on ‘Health Impact Assessment’ and the ‘Health Star Rating System’ used in US, Australia and New Zealand and prepare a detailed report within three months.The PIL, filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, also sought direction to the Centre to frame guidelines to ensure that ‘health rating’ as well as ‘health warning’ is printed on the front side of the packaging and to make ‘Health Impact Assessment’ and ‘Environment Impact Assessment’ mandatory for all the industries producing packed food items and beverages.“Direct the states to take apposite steps for compliance of the guidelines on ‘Health Star Rating’, ‘Health Warning System’, ‘Health Impact Assessment’ and ‘Environment Impact Assessment,” it said.The petition, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, claimed that FSSAI neither conducts ‘Health Impact Assessment’ nor implements ‘Health Star Rating System’.            “The injury to citizens is extremely large because due to inaction of Centre and FSSAI, the ‘Right to Health’ guaranteed under Article 21 is being brazenly offended. Healthy diet is necessary to prevent all forms of malnutrition (wasting, stunting, inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity) as well as diet related non-communicable diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancers) and lowers the risk of infectious diseases like COVID.“FSSAI neither conducts ‘Health Impact Assessment’ nor introduced ‘Health Star Rating System’ so citizens are forced to consume food, high in energy, fats and sugars and less fibre rich food fruits juices vegetables and grains,” the petition said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-seeking-health-star-rating-for-food-items-beverages-269366

16-06-2021||Kolkata||Guv violating constitutional norms, should not return to Bengal: TMC||The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal on Wednesday accused Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who is on a visit to New Delhi, of violating constitutional norms and asked him not to return to the state.The BJP, on the other hand, alleged that it is the TMC that has no respect for the Constitution and asked the Mamata Banerjee-led party to respect constitutional posts.Dhankhar, who shares a strained relationship with the state government, went to the national capital on Wednesday night for a four-day trip. He had not specified any reason for the visit.However, on Wednesday, the governor said he met Union ministers Prahlad Joshi and Prahlad Singh Patel.“Had useful interaction with Union Minister of Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs of India @JoshiPralhad on varied issues,” he tweeted.In another Twitter post, Dhankhar said, “Had useful deliberations with Union Minister for Culture, Tourism @prahladspatel Prahlad Singh Patel @MinOfCultureGoI on issues pertaining Victoria Memorial @victoriamemkol, Indian Museum @IndianMuseumKol @ezcckolkata @asiatic_society aimed at enhancing impact of these bodies.”Senior TMC leader and party spokesperson Sougata Ray lashed out at Dhankhar for allegedly violating constitutional norms and not taking the state government into confidence over various decisions and statements he has made in the recent past.“We have never seen such a governor who has no regard for the Constitution and its norms. He has been violating every constitutional norm.“According to our Constitution, the governor is supposed to act as per the instructions of the council of ministers headed by the chief minister. But he doesnt follow any such norm and acts as per his whims and fancies,” Ray said.He wondered why he has gone to Delhi and is meeting union ministers.Ray’s party colleague and MP, Mahua Moitra, asked Dhankar not to return to the state.“Uncleji going to Delhi on June 15th he says... Do us a favour WB Governor Sahib - don’t come back,” she said in a tweet.The governor went to Delhi a day after a delegation of BJP MLAs petitioned him for alleged deterioration of the law and order situation in the state.Hours before his departure to the national capital, Dhankhar wrote a letter to Chief Minister Mamata accusing her of being silent over post-poll violence in the state and not taking steps to rehabilitate the suffering people”.He shared the letter on Twitter and the state Home Department criticised the move claiming that it was violative of all established norms.West Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu supported Dhankhar and charged the TMC with not respecting the constitutional post.“The governor has done nothing unconstitutional. He has been working as per norms. It is the TMC and the state government which have been doing all sorts of unconstitutional things. Before talking about norms, the TMC should first learn to respect the chair,” Basu said.The TMC has shared an acrimonious relation with Dhankhar since its previous term in the government when he assumed office in July 2019. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/guv-violating-constitutional-norms-should-not-return-to-bengal-tmc-269362

We have also not detained anybody. We are just investigating," Deputy Commissioner of Police, zone 11, Vishal Thakur told PTI.In a complaint submitted to the police, the Hiranandani Heritage Residents Welfare Association (HHRWA) had said that a vaccination camp was arranged by the residential complex on May 30. But later it found that the Co-WIN portal did not have any record of the people who participated, and they received certificates in the name of different hospitals."If the vaccine is found to be spurious, the people who got vaccinated will have a medical emergency to deal with. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the whole episode so that such fraudulent activities are not repeated at other places," the complaint said.The HHRWA had orgainzed the camp through a person who claimed to be a sales representative of a reputed private hospital in suburban Andheri. As many as 390 members received the jabs at the camp at Rs 1,260 per person, it had said in the complaint, which stated that some unscrupulous elements have taken the society for a ride.They were shocked to receive vaccination certificates in the name of Nanavati Hospital, Lifeline Hospital and NESCO Covid Camp, among others, it said.Nanavati Hospital had said in a statement that it had not conducted any such vaccination camp. "We have informed the authorities and are lodging a formal complaint," said its spokesperson on Tuesday.The HHRWA also said that none of the people who got vaccinated had the usual after-effects like fever or body ache.According to the complaint, one Sanjay Gupta was the coordinator for the camp, but he did not give receipts for the payment for vaccines. He had asked the association to make payment to one Mahendra Singh.Local BJP MLA Yogesh Sagar had also demanded that police conduct a thorough probe.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has already made signing a Memorandum of Understanding between private vaccination providers and housing societies mandatory if such camps are organized. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-housing-society-vaccination-fraud-police-begins-probe-269351

People will not forgive you for this,” party spokesperson Sambit Patra said. He also challenged Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to reveal when they have received their first and second shots of Covid vaccinesA Congress leader claimed that Covaxin contains the serum of a newborn calf. “In an RTI response, the Modi Govt has admitted that Covaxin consists newborn calf serum .....which is a portion of clotted blood obtained from less than 20 days young cow-calves, after slaughtering them. THIS IS HEINOUS! This information should have been made public before,” Gaurav Pandhi wrote, sharing an RTI responseRTI reply to applicant Vikas Patni has suggested that newborn calf serum has been used to make the Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin. The “newborn calf serum is used in the revival process of Vero cells, which is further used for the production of coronavirus during the manufacturing of Covaxin,” read the response by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation.The RTI asked, “Does vaccines procedure use FBS in making of corona vaccines in any form, composition and ingredient made by Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute and approved by the Indian government of department?”The answer said, “As per information provided by the firm, newborn calf serum is used in the revival process of vero cells which are used in the production of coronavirus during manufacturing of Covaxin bulk vaccine of M/S Bharat Biotech.”The Union Health Ministry also issued a detailed statement saying that the final vaccine (Covaxin) does not contain newborn calf serum at all and the calf serum is not an ingredient of the final vaccine product.“Facts have been twisted and misrepresented in these posts. Newborn calf serum is used only for the preparation/growth of vero cells. Different kinds of bovine and other animal serum are standard enrichment ingredient used globally for vero cell growth. Vero cells are used to establish cell lives which help in production of vaccines. This technique has been used for decades in polio, rabies, and influenza vaccines,” the Centre said.“These vero cells, after the growth, are washed with water, chemicals (also technically known as buffer), many a times to make it free from the newborn calf serum. Thereafter, these vero cells are infected with coronavirus for viral growth.”The vero cells are completely destroyed in the process of viral growth, the Centre said“Thereafter, this grown virus is also killed (inactivated) and purified. This killed virus is then used to make the final vaccine, and in the final vaccine formulation, no calf serum is used.The makers of Covaxin, Bharat Biotech, have also responded to the allegations levelled by the Congress leader.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-congress-accuses-it-of-derailing-indias-vaccination-programme-269338

My father had even spoken to my uncle about these incidents,” he noted.Chirag said that the people who have created the problem” are those who do not want to struggle and fight for the cause of people, particularly the downtrodden. Five rebel MPs of the LJP—Pashupati Kumar Paras, Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser—on June 14 removed Chirag as the national president of the party.

On the other hand, if it turns out that the current decision is fine, we will continue with it," Arora said.The decision to increase the gap lay in the fundamental scientific reason regarding the behaviour of adenovector vaccines, a Health Ministry statement quoted him as telling DD News.In the last week of April, the data released by Public Health England, United Kingdom's executive agency of the Department of Health, showed that vaccine efficacy varied between 65 and 88 per cent when the interval is 12 weeks."This was the basis on which they overcame their epidemic outbreak due to the Alpha variant. The UK was able to come out of it because the interval they kept was 12 weeks. We also thought that this is a good idea since there are fundamental scientific reasons to show that when the interval is increased, adenovector vaccines give a better response. Hence the decision was taken on May 13, to increase the interval to 12-16 weeks," he said.This also gives flexibility to the community, since everyone cannot come at precisely 12 weeks or so, he added. “We have a very open and transparent system where decisions are taken on a scientific basis. The COVID Working Group took that decision, with no dissenting voice. This issue was then discussed threadbare at an NTAGI meeting, again with no dissenting notes. The recommendation was that the vaccine interval has to be 12-16 weeks," he said.  Dr Arora said the earlier decision of four weeks was based on the bridging trial data available then. He also cited that the increase in the gap between two doses was based on studies that showed higher efficacy with an increase in gap.Initial studies on Covishield were very heterogeneous. Some countries like the UK went for a dose interval of 12 weeks when they introduced the vaccine in December 2020, he said."While we were privy to this data, when we had to decide our interval, we went for four weeks interval based on our bridging trial data which showed good immune response. Later we came across additional scientific and laboratory data, based on which after six weeks or so, we felt we should increase the interval from four weeks to eight weeks, since studies showed that vaccine efficacy is about 57 per cent when it is four weeks and about 60% when it is eight weeks,” he said.  On why the NTAGI did not increase the gap earlier to 12 weeks, he said, “We decided we should wait for ground-level data from the UK (the other biggest user of AstraZeneca vaccine).”  He also said that there were other examples like Canada, Sri Lanka and few other countries which are using 12-16 weeks interval for AstraZeneca vaccine which is the same as Covishield vaccine, the statement said.  On the protection from single-dose versus two doses, Dr Arora explained how emerging evidence and reports regarding efficacy of partial versus full immunization were being considered by NTAGI.“Two-three days after we took the decision to increase the dosage interval, there were reports from UK that single dose of AstraZeneca vaccine gives only 33 per cent protection and two doses give about 60 per cent protection; discussion has been going on since mid-May whether India should revert to four or eight weeks," he said.  He also said that it was decided to establish a tracking platform to assess the impact of the vaccination programme."When NTAGI took this decision, we also decided that India will establish a vaccine tracking platform - to assess not only the impact of vaccination programme, but also type of vaccine and interval between doses, and what happens when someone is fully/ partially immunized. This is very important in India since around 17-18 crore people have received only one dose, while around 4 crore people have received two doses,” he said.  Dr Arora referred to a study by PGI Chandigarh which compared the effectiveness of partial versus full immunisation.A PGI Chandigarh study very clearly shows that vaccine effectiveness was 75 per cent for both partially immunised and fully immunized. So at least in the short run, effectiveness was similar whether you are partially or fully vaccinated. This was in relation to the Alpha variant which had swept Punjab, Northern India and came to Delhi. This also meant that even if you received only one dose, still you are protected.”  Results from the CMC Vellore study are similar, he says. “Few days back, another very important study by CMC Vellore, Tamil Nadu which covers most of the current epidemic wave India experienced in April and May, 2021 shows that if somebody is partially immunised, vaccine effectiveness of Covishield is 61% and with two doses, the effectiveness is 65% - and there is very little difference, especially since there is some degree of uncertainty involved in these calculations,” he said.  Dr Arora said that besides PGI and CMC Vellore studies, two other studies are coming up from two different organizations within Delhi. “And both these studies show that breakthrough infection with one dose is around 4 per cent, and around 5 per cent with two doses, basically hardly any difference. And the other study shows that 1.5- 2 per cent breakthrough infections,” he said.

16-06-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata Police questions actor Mithun Chakraborty over 'inciteful speech'||The Kolkata Police on Wednesday began virtually questioning actor-turned-BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty in connection with a complaint accusing him of inciting post-poll violence in West Bengal through his speeches.Officers of the Manicktala police station in north Kolkata began questioning the actor, who is currently in Pune, at 10.20 am."Till the last information was received, the questioning was still underway," an officer told PTI.An FIR lodged at the police station alleged that the actor had used dialogues like 'Marbo ekhane lash porbe shoshane' (Will hit you here and the body will land in the crematorium) and 'Ek chobole chobi' (A snakebite will turn you into a photograph, meaning will kill you) at a rally here after joining the BJP on March 7.The complainant alleged that these dialogues caused post-poll violence in the state.The Calcutta High Court had directed Chakraborty to provide his email address to the state so that he can make himself available by way of video conference for questioning in connection with the complaint where he has been accused of promoting enmity between different groups, an intentional insult to provoke breach of peace, and making statements conducing to public mischief.Clashes were reported from several parts of the state following the declaration of assembly poll results on May 2, in which the Trinamool Congress returned to power for the third time.On prayers by the lawyers of the petitioner and the prosecution on Friday for taking up the matter on a later date, the court fixed the matter for hearing on June 18.Chakraborty had filed the petition before the high court seeking quashing of the case registered against him for alleged incitement to post-poll violence through his speeches, wherein he had uttered popular dialogues from his films.The actor had claimed that the utterances of such film dialogues were only recreational and that he is innocent and in no way connected with any offence as alleged by the complainant.

The sea lanes of communication are critical for peace, stability, prosperity and development of the Indo-Pacific region," he said."In this regard, developments in the South China Sea have attracted attention in the region and beyond. India supports freedom of navigation, overflight, and unimpeded commerce in these international waterways."India hopes that the Code of Conduct negotiations will lead to outcomes that are in keeping with international law, including the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and do not prejudice the legitimate rights and interests of nations that are not a party to these discussions," he said.China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea, a huge source of hydrocarbons. However, several ASEAN member countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei, have counterclaims.On the coronavirus pandemic, Singh said its disruptive effect is still unfolding."The virus is mutating fast and testing our response as we find new variants that are more infective and potent. India is just emerging from a second wave that pushed our medical response to the limit," he said."But the disruptive effect of the pandemic is still unfolding. The test is therefore to make sure that the world economy moves on the path of recovery and to ensure that the recovery leaves no one behind. I am convinced that this is only possible if the entire humanity is vaccinated," Singh said.The defence minister also talked about India's deep connection with ASEAN and said New Delhi continued to attach importance to the grouping's centrality in ensuring peace and stability in the region.Singh also referred to cyberthreats saying they loom large as demonstrated by incidents of "ransomware, wannacry attacks and cryptocurrency thefts" and are a cause of concern."A multi-stakeholder approach, guided by democratic values, with a governance structure that is open and inclusive and a secure, open and stable internet with due respect to sovereignty of countries would drive the future of cyberspace," he said.The inaugural ADMM-Plus was convened in Hanoi in 2010. The defence ministers then had agreed on five areas of practical cooperation to pursue under the new mechanism, including maritime security, counter-terrorism, humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations.

16-06-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan court adjourns hearing in Kulbhushan Jadhav case till October 5||A Pakistan court has adjourned till October 5 the hearing of a government’s plea to appoint a counsel for Indian death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav on request of the country’s top law officer, according to a media report.Jadhav, the 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.On Tuesday, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) adjourned the hearing of the government’s plea to appoint counsel for Jadhav till October 5 at the request of the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Javed Khan, The Express Tribune reported.The court also issued notice to the counsel of the Indian High Commission to appear before the court on the next date of hearing.At the last hearing of the case on May 7, an IHC larger bench – comprising Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb –gave India another chance to appoint a counsel for Jadhav by June 15.At an earlier hearing, AGP Khan had informed the court that India contends that the appearance of its consul before a Pakistani court to defend Jadhav would amount to submission to the jurisdiction of the court and would violate its “sovereign immunity”.The larger bench had later issued a three-page written order stating that submission to the jurisdiction of any court is “quite distinct” from appearing before a court to assist it in a matter       “At this juncture, the court is conducting proceedings only to work out the way forward to implement the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),” the order had said.The court had said that it was only trying to figure out a way to implement the ICJ order and it needs to be brought to the attention of India so that it may enter the appearance and express its reservations about procedure and methodology for implementation of the judgment.“The present proceedings are being conducted to ensure that Commander Jadhav is provided with a fair opportunity to defend himself in the review proceedings to be carried out as ordered by the ICJ.”         “In view of the foregoing, the government of Pakistan shall make another effort to communicate with the government of India regarding the purpose of the instant proceedings and ensure presence before the court,” the order noted.The Pakistan government last week rushed through the National Assembly a bill to provide the right of appeal to Jadhav, amidst ruckus and boycott by the Opposition. The bill is aimed at allowing Jadhav to have consular access in line with the ICJ verdict.

It said Rs 4 crore each would be given to the kin of two deceased fishermen and boat owner St Antony will get the remaining Rs 2 crore.It requested the Kerala High Court Chief Justice to nominate a judge to pass an appropriate order for disbursement/investment of the amount to be paid to the heirs of each deceased so as to protect their interest and ensure that the compensation was not misappropriated.The two marines — Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone — would now be prosecuted in Italy, it said, adding the case details along with evidence will be provided by the Centre and the Kerala Government to Italy Government.The marines were on board Italian-flagged commercial oil tanker MV Enrica Lexie when they allegedly fired at two Indian fishermen — Valantine @ Jelestine (44) and Ajeesh Pink (20) — off the Kerala coast on February 15, 2012, in India’s Exclusive Economic Zone.The order follows the Centre’s decision to accept the award of an arbitration tribunal under UNCLOS which said Italy had the jurisdiction to prosecute the marines.“We are of the view that this is a fit case to close all proceedings in India, including criminal proceedings, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,” said the top court.Rs 10-cr compensation adequate: Top Court||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-quashes-murder-charge-against-two-italian-marines-269143

Both sides claim themselves to be the “true representative” of the party even as the Lok Sabha Secretariat had yesterday recognised Paras as the LJP leader in the House.While Chirag has been isolated in the parliamentary party as all other MPs have backed Paras, sources said he continued to enjoy the support of other LJP leaders.Sources said the rebel group would now seek to remove Chirag as the leader of the LJP parliamentary board, stripping him of every position he took control of after the death of his father just ahead of Bihar Assembly elections last year.Sources said MP Surajbhan would function as the working president till a new president was elected at an LJP national executive meeting expected to be called soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chirag-paswan-expels-five-rebel-mps-they-oust-him-as-ljp-chief-269115

The Trust is accused of buying land worth Rs 2 crore at an “inflated” rate of Rs 18.5 crore.Alleging misappropriation of Rs 16.5 crore, MP Congress general secretary KK Mishra today lodged a complaint with the Indore police seeking registration of an FIR against the Trust officials.Sultan Ansari, a party to the land deal, claimed that the land agreement with the Trust was “transparent and the financial dealings were accounted for”.Calling it a matter of “serious concern”, political analyst Sudhir Panwar claimed the allegations not only questioned the BJP-RSS rhetoric that Ram Temple was an issue of faith for them, but eroded the confidence of those who had contributed and collected funds for the temple. AAP MP Sanjay Singh, who has sought a probe by the CBI and the ED into the matter, said he won’t let anyone steal the money meant for the Ram Temple.House attacked: AAP MPAAP MP Sanjay Singh on Tuesday claimed his house in Delhi was “attacked” by BJP supporters for highlighting the alleged corruption in the purchase of a piece of land in Ayodhya by the Ram Temple Trust.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-temple-trust-justifies-deal-opposition-wants-fir-269114
16-06-2021||New Delhi||Come clean on LAC clash, says Sonia Gandhi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi today asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come clean on the Galwan incident in which 20 Indian soldiers were martyred a year ago and said the party hoped the government would keep the nation in confidence over what happened.“Having patiently waited for the government to come clean and inform the nation about the circumstances in which the unprecedented incident happened and reassure the people that the sacrifice of our brave jawans was not in vain, the Congress reiterates its concern that no clarity is yet available and the PM’s last word on the subject a year ago was that no transgression had occurred. We have repeatedly sought details of the episode in light of the PM’s statement, as well as details of what progress has been made towards restoring the status quo ante prior to April 2020. The disengagement agreement with China appears to have worked entirely to India’s disadvantage so far,” she said.“As we approach the first anniversary of the tragic loss of 20 brave soldiers of the Bihar Regiment, including their commanding officer, in the confrontation with PLA troops of China on the night of June 15-16, 2020, the Congress also joins a grateful nation in remembrance of their supreme sacrifice,” she said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/come-clean-on-lac-clash-says-sonia-gandhi-269109
16-06-2021||---||Army remembers Galwan heroes||New Delhi, June 15The Army on Tuesday remembered the bravehearts of the Galwan clash with China on June 15 last year, saying their sacrifice and valour would remain etched in memory of the nation.Twenty Indian soldiers had died in a bloody clash in eastern Ladakh. In February, China officially acknowledged that its five military officers and soldiers were killed in the clash with the Indian Army though it is widely believed that the death toll was much higher.The Indian Army tweeted: “General MM Naravane and all ranks of Indian Army pay homage to the bravehearts who made supreme sacrifice in Galwan Valley, Ladakh, while defending the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. Their valour will be eternally etched in memory of the nation.”Today is the first anniversary of the deadly clash. The Army said it was in the face of unprecedented Chinese aggression that 20 Indian soldiers laid down their lives defending our land and inflicted heavy casualties on the PLA. The gallant soldiers fought in the most difficult high-altitude terrain, said the Army. The clash occurred at an altitude of 15,000 feet.At Leh, the headquarters of the 14 Corps, a solemn ceremony was organised where Major General Akash Kaushik, Chief of Staff of the Corps, laid a wreath at the war memorial. Military posturing by India and China continues on either side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-remembers-galwan-heroes-269107

He expressed surprise that the CM did not consider discussing the “grave human tragedy” in the Cabinet.“With a heavy heart, I am constrained to observe your continued silence and inaction over post-poll bloodshed, violation of human rights, assault on women and destruction of property — worst since Independence — and it ill augurs for democracy,” the Governor said in the letter.Dhankhar urged Banerjee to deliberate the issue in the Cabinet and rehabilitate the victims and compensate them for their losses.Recalling his recent visit to camps in Assam where political refugees from Bengal had taken shelter, Dhankhar said the victims told him “heart rendering tales of arson, loot, rape and killings”.He also made a reference to the sit-in by Banerjee at the CBI office last month to protest the arrest of her two Cabinet colleagues in connection with the Narada sting video case. In Delhi for a three-day official tour, Dhankhar is expected to brief top leaders about the situation prevailing in the state. Dhankhar in Delhi to meet top leaders||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-governor-to-didi-post-poll-violence-state-driven-269102
16-06-2021||---||Holding protest not terror act: Delhi High Court||New Delhi, June 15Holding that the right to protest is a fundamental right that can’t be termed as a “terrorist act”, the Delhi High Court today granted bail to JNU student Devangana Kalita in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.By a separate judgment, it also granted bail to another JNU student Natasha Narwal and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha in a case registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.Kalita was arrested along with others in May last year in connection with a case of larger conspiracy related to the riots. A Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said it was constrained to note that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matter may get out of hand, “the state has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’. If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril”.On invoking the UAPA against Kalita, it said the court must be careful in employing the definitional words and phrases used in the anti-terror law “in their absolute, literal sense or use them lightly in a manner that would trivialise the extremely heinous offence of ‘terrorist act’, without understanding how terrorism is different from conventional, heinous crime.”The HC said, “There is absolutely nothing in the subject chargesheet, by way of any specific or particularised allegation, that would show the possible commission of a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of Section 15 of the UAPA; or an act of ‘raising funds’ to commit a terrorist act under Section 17; or an act of ‘conspiracy’ to commit or an ‘act preparatory’ to commit, a terrorist act within the meaning of Section 18 of the UAPA,” the Bench said.Referring to a top court verdict, the HC said “…the effect of terrorist activity must be such that it travels beyond the capacity of the ordinary law enforcement agencies to deal with it under the ordinary penal law.” (With PTI inputs)3 students get bail in Delhi riots case||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/holding-protest-not-terror-act-delhi-high-court-269100

He said the Indian SARS-Cov-2 Genomic Consortium, a network of 28 labs, had been asked to find the presence of Delta Plus in India for future planning.“We are yet to understand the adverse consequences Delta Plus may have. We are told monoclonal antibodies do not work on this variant, but we are still learning,” he said.An analysis by UK government agency, Public Health, England, shows for the first time that two doses of vaccine (either Pfizer-BioNTech or Covishield) are highly effective against hospitalisation from Delta variant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-delta-plus-not-a-concern-yet-269033
16-06-2021||---||85% fall in Covid-19 cases since May peak; micro curbs the key, states told||New Delhi, June 15As the country’s daily new Covid-19 cases fell 85 per cent from the May 7 peak and daily positivity dropped to a three-month low of 3.45 per cent, surging crowds at metros, malls, railway stations and tourist hubs worried the government with the Health Ministry advising people to minimise the use of public transport, avoid crowding and told states to continue focusing on micro-containment.“The gains can be reversed in a day,” Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Health, cautioned, asking people to cycle or walk instead of using public transport and to absolutely avoid rush hours.The second Covid wave has receded significantly from its peak of 4.14 lakh cases on May 7 to 60,471 today signalling localised infections.Active cases that need treatment at home or hospitals are below 10 lakh (9,13,378) after 65 days — a 75.6 per cent fall.“We are seeing drastic reductions in active cases in all states and 20 states now have less than 5,000 active cases. The recovery rate has improved from 81.8 per cent on May 3 to 95.6 per cent today. But these gains can end in a day if we become lax,” Agarwal said.As a warning, the government added that the war on Covid is “not over”.NITI Aayog member VK Paul said transmission was low and latent, and the state governments must adopt aggressive containment to localise the transmission.“We also know the new variants are relatively highly transmissible and that means we have to be very cautious,” he said.Paul, chairman of the Covid vaccination taskforce, also hailed the high efficacy of US biotechnology firm Novavax’s Covid shot as encouraging news for India.“The pace of vaccines will pick up from next week,” Paul said hours after the government assured that adults could walk into the nearest vaccine centre and get inoculated without having to pre-register.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/85-fall-in-covid-19-cases-since-may-peak-micro-curbs-the-key-states-told-269014
16-06-2021||New Delhi||India confirms first death following Covid-19 vaccination||A government panel studying Covid-19 vaccine side effects has confirmed the first death due to anaphylaxis following vaccination.The causality assessment of 31 reported Serious Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) cases following Covid-19 vaccination was carried out by the panel.According to a report by the National AEFI Committee, a 68-year-old man died due to anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) after being vaccinated on March 8, 2021."It is the first death linked to Covid-19 vaccination due to anaphylaxis. It re-emphasises the need to wait for 30 minutes at the inoculation centre after receiving the jab. Most of the anaphylactic reactions occur during this period and prompt treatment prevents deaths,” Dr NK Arora, chairperson, National AEFI committee, told PTI.The Committee examined five such cases that took place on February 5, eight cases on March 9 and 18 cases on March 31. As per data in the first week of April, the reporting rate is 2.7 deaths per million vaccine doses administered and 4.8 hospitalisations per million vaccine doses administered, the report stated.The panel said mere reporting of deaths and hospitalisations as serious adverse events does not automatically imply that the events were caused due to vaccines. Only properly conducted investigations and causality assessments can help in understanding if any causal relationship exists between the event and the vaccine, the report said, adding for causality assessments, priority has been given to death cases. Of the 31 causally assessed cases, 18 were classified as having an inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental - not linked to vaccination), 7 were classified as indeterminate, 3 cases were found to be vaccine product related, 1 was anxiety-related reaction and two cases were found to be unclassifiable, the government panel report said.Vaccine product-related reactions are expected reactions that can be attributed to vaccination based on current scientific evidence, it said.Examples of such reactions are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, etc. Indeterminate reactions are reactions that have occurred soon after vaccination but there is no definitive evidence in current literature or clinical trial data that this event could have been caused due to the vaccine, the report said, adding further observations, analysis and studies are required.In the two other cases of anaphylaxis, two persons were given vaccines on January 19 and 16 and both of them were hospitalised and have since recovered.Unclassifiable events are events that have been investigated but there is not enough evidence for assigning a diagnosis due to missing crucial information. When this relevant information becomes available, the case may be reconsidered for causality assessment. Coincidental events are events that are reported following immunisation but for which a clear cause other than vaccination is found on investigation. The panel said the benefits of vaccination are overwhelmingly greater than the small risk of harm and as a measure of utmost precaution, all emerging signals of harm are being constantly tracked and reviewed periodically.

16-06-2021||Jhajjar||As farmers return to Punjab to sow paddy, elderly, women keep numbers up at Tikri||Farm organisations from Punjab have decided to raise the number of elderly people, including women, at the Tikri border to maintain adequate strength of protesters. The decision had to be taken following the dwindling number of protesters at the border in the past two weeks as many farmers have started returning to Punjab for sowing paddy. The season of paddy cultivation is on these days. Some farm leaders are also busy with work at their native places in Punjab, said sources.Sources maintained the protesters had been asked to ensure the presence of at least one or two persons in their place at the border to keep the momentum going. Consequently, women and elderly persons in large numbers have started coming to Tikri.“As the protest is likely to continue for a long time, a system has been devised so that farmers can cultivate paddy at their native place and the protest too can continue simultaneously with the same strength and spirit. So, we have decided to raise the number of elderly people, including women, at Tikri. Those who are not engaged in paddy sowing work are also being sent to Delhi borders from Punjab,” said Pragat Singh, a senior leader of BKU (Rajewal).Pragat Singh is also busy sowing paddy these days at his native Talwandi Nepalan village in Ferozepur district (Punjab). “Since agriculture is the only source of earning for farmers, farming activity is also necessary to arrange two square meals for the family. The majority of farmers will start going back to Tikri by June 30 to strengthen the agitation. The number of protesters will peak again in July,” he claimed.Denying that the number of protesters is dwindling, Singh said coolers and fans had been installed in all the huts at Tikri. Hence, the majority of farmers avoid roaming outside and take rest in their huts given the scorching heat these days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-farmers-return-to-punjab-to-sow-paddy-elderly-women-keep-numbers-up-at-tikri-268789
