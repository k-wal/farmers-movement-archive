After all, if we are there, we are there for you all, for the people of the country and therefore we have left no stone unturned, we have spared no resources to help out in this hour of need,” he said.Gen Naravane said the Army established various hospitals in the metros and also in other areas, helped local administration in setting up additional beds, in repairing their oxygen plants, and in providing oxygen cylinders.“We have pulled out our own medical staff, our doctors from less affected areas and deployed them in more pressure stations and areas where there were more Covid cases. But I am happy to say that overall, in the country, the number of Covid cases have now seen a downturn.”              The Army, along with other armed forces, have taken several pro-active steps in helping in treating people infected with coronavirus. Besides doctors, nursing attendants, the armed forces have roped in Battlefield Nursing Assistants (BFNA) to help fight the second wave of Covid-19.BFNAs are generally trained in providing basic healthcare facilities in combat situations which include administering injections and helping in breathing exercises.Special Covid hospitals have been set up in various parts of the country including two in Jammu and Kashmir by the armed forces to help state and union territory administrations in tackling the pandemic.

It should be done through proper oversight maintained by the registration and revenue department,” union secretary Ram Mohan Mishra said in his letter.The DM will make efforts that such children are rehabilitated in the following order of preference as per the JJ Act, 2015 – restored with extended family, kith and kin of the child; placed in adoption in case the child is found legally free for adoption by a Child Welfare Committee through the Central Adoption Resource Authority portal; under government approved Child Care Institutions,” the Centre told states.Every DM has been asked to create a district level multi-departmental taskforce to map the needs, monitor progress and ensure that all benefits reach affected children.The Centre has further advised states to identify children in distress through outreach and survey and create a database specifying the needs and requirements of children.Ensure that the data of every child is uploaded on Track Child Portal of Government of India, the letter says.The government also asked states to ensure the local police are alerted to prevent crimes against children including child labour, child marriage, trafficking and illegal adoptions.The WCD Ministry further asked states to ensure all of India’s nearly 7000 child care institutions are in good shape to host vulnerable children.The letter directs states to ensure that all the orphan children are provided free education through government Day schools or residential schools.“Based on the specific need of the child, they can be enrolled in the nearest private schools under Section RTE section 12(1)©. Efforts may be made to include eligible orphan children under existing scholarship schemes of the Centre and states,” the government said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dms-to-be%C2%A0guardians-of-covid-hit-children-centre-to-states-262929

His resignation came soon after political commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta left the Sonepat, Haryana-based university.“Delighted to announce that on July 1, Arvind Subramanian will join @BrownUniversity as a senior fellow @WatsonInstitute, in partnership with @SouthAsianBrown. We greatly look forward to his teaching and intellectual affiliation with us. Welcome @arvindsubraman!,” Ashutosh Varshney, Director, Centre for Contemporary South Asia, Brown University, said in a tweet.Mehta, in his resignation letter to the Ashoka University, had said: “After a meeting with the founders, it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the university may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politics that tries to honour the constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university.”“It is clear it is time for me to leave Ashoka. A liberal university will need a liberal political and social context to flourish. I hope the university will play a role in securing that environment,” he wrote. Subramanian was appointed as the chief economic advisor to the government on October 16, 2014, for a period of three years. He was given an extension in 2017.However, he quit the job with close to one year of his tenure remaining and returned to the US. Subramanian’s official contract was till May 2019.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||CBSE to process requests for change of students’ particulars: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the CBSE to process the applications for correction or change in name on the certificates issued by it, saying it is an intrinsic element of identity even as it quoted William Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’ iconic line—“What’s in a name?”.The top court directed the Central Board of Secondary Education to take immediate steps to amend its relevant Byelaws so as to incorporate the stated mechanism for recording correction or change, as the case may be, in the certificates already issued or to be issued by it.It held that the CBSE cannot impose precondition of applying for correction consistent with the school records only before publication of results as such a condition, would be “unreasonable” and “excessive”.It said that CBSE, despite being packaged as a society, is performing an essential public function for the government since its establishment in 1929 and its byelaws have the force of law and must be regarded as such for all legal purposes.A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari said there is no reason for the CBSE to turn down such requests or attach any precondition except reasonable period of limitation and keeping in mind the period for which the CBSE has to maintain its record under the extant regulations.“In light of the above, in exercise of our plenary jurisdiction, we direct the CBSE to process the applications for correction or change, as the case may be, in the certificate issued by it in the respective cases under consideration,” the bench said, while disposing of a batch of 22 petitions led by a student Jigya Yadav, related to corrections or change of particulars of students in the certificates issued by CBSE.The top court said in doing so, the board can certainly insist for compliance of other conditions by the incumbent (student), such as, to file sworn affidavit making necessary declaration and to indemnify the CBSE from any claim.The bench in 132-page verdict said the CBSE would be justified in insisting for surrender/return of the original certificate (or duplicate original certificate, as the case may be) issued by it for replacing it with the fresh certificate to be issued after carrying out necessary corrections with caption/annotation against the changes carried out and the date of such correction.“It may retain the original entries as it is except in respect of correction of name effected in exercise of right to be forgotten. The fresh certificate may also contain disclaimer that the CBSE cannot be held responsible for the genuineness of the school records produced by the incumbent in support of the request to record correction in the original CBSE certificate,” the bench said. The bench, however, said if the request for recording change is based on changed school records post the publication of results and issue of certificate by the CBSE, the candidate would be entitled to apply for recording such a change within the reasonable limitation period prescribed by the CBSE.“In this situation, the candidate cannot claim that she had no knowledge about the change recorded in the school records because such a change would occur obviously at her instance. If she makes such application for correction of the school records, she is expected to apply to the CBSE immediately after the school records are modified and which ought to be done within a reasonable time,” it said.The top court detailing the modalities for such procedure, said that it would be open to the CBSE rejecting the application in the event the period for preservation of official records under the extant regulations had expired and no record of the candidate concerned is traceable or can be reconstructed. It said request for recording of correction in the certificate issued by the CBSE to bring it in line with the school records of the incumbent need not be limited to application made prior to publication of examination results of the CBSE.Dealing with the request for “change” of particulars in the certificate issued by the CBSE, the bench said that it presupposes that the particulars intended to be recorded in the CBSE certificate are not consistent with the school records.It said change of particulars in the certificate could be in two different scenarios—on the basis of public documents like birth certificate, Aadhaar card/election card and when the request for change is due to the acquired name by choice at a later point of time, which need not be backed by public documents pertaining to the candidate.It said in the first category, such public documents cannot be ignored by the CBSE and by taking note of those documents; the board may entertain the request for recording change in the certificate issued by it. It said in the case of second situation where the change is to be effected on the basis of new acquired name without any supporting school record or public document, that request may be entertained upon insisting for prior permission/ declaration by a Court of law in that regard and publication in the Official Gazette.

I demand an apology from @Google ASAP to Kannada, Kannadigas. Legal action will be taken against Google for maligning the image of our beautiful language!” Limbavali tweeted.When contacted, a Google spokesperson said, “Search isn’t always perfect. Sometimes, the way content is described on the internet can yield surprising results to specific queries.”“We know this is not ideal, but we take swift corrective action when we are made aware of an issue and are continually working to improve our algorithms. Naturally, these are not reflective of the opinions of Google, and we apologise for the misunderstanding and hurting any sentiments.”Former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy denounced Google in a series of tweets for the outrageous answer to the language question. He sought to know why Google “behaves in an irresponsible manner” in terms of language.Others including the BJP’s Bengaluru Central MP, PC Mohan slammed Google and asked it to apologise.Sharing the screenshot of the search on his Twitter handle, Mohan said Karnataka is home to the great Vijayanagara empire and the Kannada language has a rich heritage, a glorious legacy and a unique culture.“One of the worlds oldest languages, Kannada had great scholars who wrote epics much before Geoffrey Chaucer was born in the 14th century.

Over 11.50 lakh doses were wasted by the state; Rajasthan government has blood on its hands,” Thakur said in a statement.Talking about Punjab, the minister said there were many instances of overcharging by private hospitals.He also alleged that the Punjab government is creating a false narrative about vaccine scarcity.“Rahul Gandhi tweets about vaccine shortage, has he ensured Congress ruled states prevent wastage? Will Rahul Gandhi investigate why vaccines have been supplied to Congress Cronies who are charging a ‘pandemic premium’ and indulging in black marketing, instead of saving lives of the poor?” Thakur asked.

Archaeologists have long wondered when, where and how our ancestors began to explore and occupy these landscapes.But evidence of early human presence on the plateau has been scarce — and dating the few remaining traces has proven an ongoing challenge.Using a recently developed dating technique, our research team has now produced the first solid evidence for human presence on the central-southern Tibetan Plateau more than 5,000 years ago. Our findings are published today in Science Advances.The challenge of dating surface artefact scatter The dry highlands of Tibet are considered to be among the last areas on Earth to have been settled by humans. The high altitude of the region, in the shadow of Himalayan peaks more than eight kilometres high, makes for extreme conditions.The question of where and when the peopling of this remote region occurred has been debated among archaeologists. Many studies have come from research conducted at open-air locations, with abundant evidence of stone tool use or manufacture, such as rock flakes found on the ground.These sites are referred to as “lithic artefact scatters”.They are among the most commonly preserved archaeological sites in the world, and hold potential to reconstruct human settlement patterns and explore various aspects of past human behaviour.Yet it has been extremely difficult to interpret the archaeological significance and ages of these sites unambiguously. Most artefacts are made from stone, which makes it difficult to determine when the tools were manufactured, or if they were moved after being discarded.Artefacts on the surface are prone to erosion, and movement by wind and water, over hundreds or even thousands of years since humans first produced them. Consequently, they're often found “out of context”, so a clear relationship can't be drawn between them and their immediate surroundings.Developing new techniquesTo overcome this limitation, our team spent the past several years in the Innsbruck OSL (optically-stimulated luminescence) dating laboratory in Austria led by Michael Meyer at the University of Innsbruck, developing a new technique suitable for dating ancient stone tools.OSL dating has become one of the main dating methods in archaeology and the earth sciences. It's based on the accumulation of energy in the crystal structure of sand grains.When grains are shielded from daylight, such as when they're buried, their crystal accumulates energy due to low-level radiation from surrounding rocks and sediment.This can then be measured in the laboratory, through controlled exposure to blue and green light, which releases the energy as a “luminescence signal”. The longer the grains have been buried, the more luminescence we will measure from them.Instead of looking at sand for our research, we used an approach called “rock surface burial dating”. It's the first ever approach to focus on the signal stored beneath the surface of rock artefacts at a scatter site.The luminescence signal built up within a rock is almost infinitely high, due to the extremely long time that has passed since the rock was formed by geological processes.However, once a rock surface is exposed to daylight, such as when an artefact is first produced and used, the luminescence signal is erased at the surface and just beneath (but not at the centre). The erasure of the signal is strongest at the surface and tapers off towards the centre of the artefact.When the artefact is thrown away and becomes shielded from daylight — either from beneath, or from being covered by sediment — the signal starts to build again.This leads to varying levels of signal intensity found at different depths beneath the artefact's surface. We can measure this signal distribution to determine the overall age and history of a stone artefact.5,000 years in the shadow of Mount Everest The large potential of this new way of using OSL had been shown in previous archaeological and geological contexts, but hadn't been rigorously tested on artefact scatter sites.Accompanied by experienced high-altitude archaeologist Mark Aldenderfer from the University of California at Merced, and supported by mineralogist Peter Tropper from Innsbruck, we set out to test the suitability of this promising method at the lithic artefact scatter site of Su-re, in southern Tibet.At an elevation of 4,450 metres, in a large valley descending from the highest peaks in the world – Mount Everest and Cho'Oyu — Su-re had been known for decades for its dense accumulation of diverse surface artefacts. This suggested a long history of site use by humans. But how long?Using our dating approach, we dated the oldest artefacts found at the Su-re site as being between 5,200 and 5,500 years old. These tools were likely related to quarrying activities at the site.While some older sites have been discovered in central and southeastern Tibet, our dataset has made Su-re the oldest securely dated site in the central-southern Tibetan Plateau near the high Himalaya.This finding is particularly exciting considering the proximity of Su-re to the “Nangpa La” mountain pass. This pass has historically connected local Tibetans in the highlands with Nepali Sherpas in the Himalayan valleys and lowlands.Our new approach to analysing surface artefacts can be considered the beginning of a road to new archaeological perspectives. In the future it could help uncover the secrets of lithic artefact sites around the world. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-first-artefact-dating-method-shows-humans-have-lived-in-the-shadow-of-the-himalayas-for-more-than-5-000-years-262921

Thankfully I did not have to hear the Juhi Chawla matter yesterday. Indeed it was a musical hearing. It had first come up before me but I had recused from hearing it for some reason,” Justice Shankar said with a smile.Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Ramdev, joined the discussion saying he has not shared the court proceedings link with anyone, in an apparent reference to Chawla's act of sharing the web link of virtual hearing on his Twitter account.On Wednesday, while the hearing on Chawla's plea against the 5G wireless network was on, a man started singing some of the hit songs of the actress' movies and caused repeated interruptions in the virtual proceedings.On the directions of Justice J R Midha, who was hearing the case, the person was repeatedly removed from the hearing, but he kept on joining and started singing till the time the proceedings were locked.The man, who kept changing his names every time he logged it, started with Chawla's ‘Ghoonghat ki aad mein dilbar ka didaar adhura' song from her blockbuster movie 'Hum hai rahi pyar ke'.He then sang from her another hit film Naajayaz ‘Lal lal hoton pe gori kiska naam hai… Juhi Chawla' and then ‘Meri banno ki aayegi baraat ke dhol bajao ji' from the movie Aaina after which he was removed, and the proceedings were locked.At the outset, the man was also heard saying “where is Juhi Ma'am I can't see her” and when the judge asked the court master to mute the concerned person, he said “you want to mute me. Oh really!” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/juhi-chawlas-fan-singing-incident-makes-way-in-ramdevs-proceedings-in-delhi-hc-262900
03-06-2021||New Delhi||DU likely to commence registration for admission to UG courses on July 15||Delhi University (DU) is likely to start its registration process for admissions to undergraduate courses on July 15, anticipating the fact that all school boards would have declared results by then, a senior varsity official said on Thursday.Following the cancellation of Class 12 board examinations by the CBSE and the CISCE in view of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said discussions will be held with the admission committee and the academic council of the university to finalise the process of admission to undergraduate courses.“The varsity is likely to commence the registration process by July 15. We anticipate that by that time most of the boards will not only decide what they are going to do but will also declare their results,” said Rajeev Gupta, Chairman, Admissions, DU.Every year, the varsity’s colleges declare cut-offs for courses and students meeting the criteria apply to the respective colleges. A decision from the Education Ministry is also awaited on the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET).“We will follow what the ministry says. We are awaiting their guidelines,” Gupta said.Last year, the admission process was done completely online due to the first wave of the pandemic.

Patra said that now, Kejriwal claims his government is preparing for the third wave, but people have no faith in him.  The BJP spokesperson also questioned if Covid testing was kept "deliberately low" when the pandemic was at its peak during April-May to “protect” the image of the AAP government. “ Why no new hospital was opened in the city during 2015-19,” he said, terming as “ignorant and insensitive” Delhi minister Gopal Rai’s reported comments about planting trees to avoid oxygen crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-questions-aap-govt-if-delhi-covid-death-tally-is-fudged-seeks-white-paper-262885
03-06-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Andhra woman believed dead returns home||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, June 3 It was nothing but shock and disbelief for residents of Jaggaiahpet town in Krishna Districts of Andhra Pradesh when a 75-year-old woman, believed to have been cremated, recovered and walked home. The family has mistakenly cremated another woman and thought their mother was dead. Identified as Girijamma from Christianpet, the woman was admitted to Government Hospital, Vijayawada, on May 12 after she tested positive for Covid-19. Since no family was allowed to stay with the patient, her husband Gaddayya returned home. When Gaddayya went to the hospital three days later, on May 15, Girijamma was not on the bed where he had left her.  He looked everywhere, but his wife was not to be found. Finally, the hospital staff advised him to look in the mortuary. In the morgue, he saw a woman that resembled his wife and informed the hospital staff. The body was given to him along with a death certificate. The family took the body home and cremated it. In the meantime, Girijamma and Gaddayya’s son Ramesh also succumbed to Covid-19 on May 23. A joint pooja and religious ceremonies were organised for the mother and son.  It turned out that Girijamma was still recuperating in hospital while her family had cremated another woman out of a mistake. Once recovered, Girijamma returned home by herself on June 2. The entire neighbourhood was shocked as they had cremated the woman. While the family was delighted to see the woman they thought to be dead, the news of her son Ramesh’s death threw the family into another bout of grief.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-woman-believed-dead-returns-home-262884

The drive is aimed at raising awareness about vaccination.”As these vehicles keep running to different places in urban as well as rural parts, people can easily get to see these messages written on them, she said.A similar drive is already going on in Hoshangabad, and will be carried out in Vidisha and Sehore districts also, Jain added.Bhopal district assistant nodal officer for awareness against Covid-19, Akhilesh Chaturvedi, said, “We have been carrying out this drive in Bhopal since Wednesday and the response of the vehicle owners is encouraging.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Unlock Delhi markets without further delay: Domestic traders body CAIT writes to LG, CM||Domestic traders body CAIT on Thursday wrote a letter to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, urging them to take cognisance of the declining positivity rate in the city and pass an "immediate order" to reopen markets.The 15 lakh city traders, according to the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), have taken a "severe beating" due to the over?-one-month-long lockdown period and are in "dire financial state"."The combined efforts of the government and citizens of Delhi have had a significant impact on the Covid situation in Delhi and as per yesterday's health bulletin the positivity rate in Delhi has slipped around 1 per cent with a positive cases of about 500 only, which is a big relief from almost 35 per cent a month back," read the letter by Praveen Khandelwal, National Secretary General, CAIT."In view of the above, we request you to take immediate steps to unlock Delhi, which is the need of the hour, to ensure that commercial activities should start without any further delay," it added.  Delhi, which has been under strict lockdown since April 19 to combat the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, had started the unlock process from Monday by allowing the construction sector and factories to resume operations.In the letter, the CAIT also suggested several unlock measures, including separate work timings for "wholesale and retail markets", creating "special hawkers and street vendors zone" to ensure social distancing, and "vaccination camps in collaboration with respective trade associations for employees and work force".  Not in favour of the old "odd-even" system of unlocking, which they said has been a "failure" in the past too, they have urged that markets should open every day based on wholesale-retail staggered timing format."The wholesale markets should have work timings from morning 10 am to evening 4 pm, whereas the retail markets should open from afternoon 12 pm to evening 7 pm," the CAIT suggested. "All transport & Logistics also be allowed to function as per these timings rather than following the general rules of ''No Entry''... The Delhi Metro Rail services should be aligned with market opening timings," it said.Further, it also noted that the decision to choose between wholesale and retail for classification of trade under any of the two formats should be left open to the markets. While the night curfew should continue to be imposed from "10 pm to 5 am", in case of any increase in Covid cases post unlocking, according to the CAIT, the government might declare the concerned area as "containment zone" with applicable restrictions."In this way, any possible infection can be controlled. Whereas on the other hand the economic and commercial activities can also take place," it explained.  For Delhi's hawkers and street vendors, which have been struggling for their livelihood due to the ongoing coronavirus-induced lockdown, the body recommended that they be moved into a special ''Hawking Zone'' or be stationed in government school premises, which are empty at the moment.This, besides "avoiding spread of Covid-19", will ensure social distancing and give the hawkers and street vendors "every opportunity" to earn their livelihood, the traders body explained.It also recommended a mass sanitisation drive across Delhi markets by the MCD as markets are shut for over 60 days.Emphasizing on the need and importance of vaccination, they also requested the authorities to set up vaccination camps in markets in collaboration with respective trade associations for the employees and workforce.Lastly, they urged the government to hold a discussion with Delhi traders and take them into confidence before implementing any decision. "It should be a two-way process and participative governance approach if the government wants the traders to cooperate and stand in solidarity with the government in this battle against coronavirus," it noted. Delhi on Wednesday recorded 576 fresh Covid-19 cases, lowest since March 17, at a positivity rate of 0.78 per cent and 103 more fatalities due to the disease. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unlock-delhi-markets-without-further-delay-domestic-traders-body-cait-writes-to-lg-cm-262877

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre asks states to issue ration cards to most vulnerable, poor people||The Centre has issued an advisory to all states and UTs to identify and issue ration cards to the most vulnerable and economically weaker sections of society to ensure their coverage under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The Centre’s directive comes amid various reports that the poorest of the poor are in dire need of foodgrains but they are unable to procure ration card.Addressing a virtual press conference, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said states and Union territories have scope to add coverage of 1.97 crore under the NFSA. As many as 14 states have completed 100 per cent coverage quota.In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Food Ministry said it is important to ensure coverage of all eligible identified persons from the most vulnerable and economically weakest sections of population under the NFSA.On Wednesday, the Food Ministry has issued an advisory to all states and UTs to launch a special drive to reach out, identify and issue NFSA ration cards to the most vulnerable and economically weakest sections of the population in urban and rural areas.States should do this by utilising the available coverage under their respective NFSA limits, the ministry said in a statement.The ministry asked states and UTs to reach out to vulnerable and weakest sections of the society such as street dwellers, rag pickers, hawkers and rickshaw pullers.The operational responsibilities of identification of eligible persons and households under NFSA and issuance of ration cards to them rest with the states and UTs, the statement said.States and UTs may be aware, the advisory said, that during the current pandemic scenario, there are several reports/grievances through media, newspapers, NGOs and individuals stating that the vulnerable and weakest sections of the society, who are in dire need of foodgrains, are unable to procure ration cards.It is felt that some of the poor and needy people, who also may not have address proof, may find it difficult to obtain a ration card, it added.Under the NFSA, the government provides 5 kg of wheat and rice per person every month at highly subsidised rate of Rs 2-3 per kg. Around 80 crore people are currently covered under this law passed in 2013.The government buys wheat and paddy from farmers at minimum support price to meet the foodgrains requirement under the food law.State-owned Food Corporation of India is the nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Vigilance clearance mandatory for officers to get post-retirement jobs: CVC||The Central Vigilance Commission on Thursday said all central government organisations should mandatorily obtain vigilance clearance before offering post-retirement jobs to bureaucrats.In case a retired officer served in more than one organisation, vigilance clearance should be obtained from all the organisations where the officer had served in the previous 10 years, it said in an order.The CVC circular is mandatory for all central government ministries, PSU, banks and the insurance sector.“There is no defined procedure for seeking vigilance inputs before engaging retired government officials from the organisations where such retired officials were employed on full time basis, prior to their retirement,” said the order issued to secretaries of all central government departments, chiefs of banks and public sector undertakings.The commission has observed that the absence of a uniform defined procedure for obtaining vigilance clearance, before engaging retired officials by government organisations, sometimes leads to a situation where officials with tainted past or having cases pending against them are engaged by the government organisations, it  said.“Such a situation not only leads to unnecessary complaints/allegations of favouritism, but is also against the tenets of fairness and probity which is the basic principle governing the functioning of government organisations,” the Commission said.In respect of retired officers belonging to all India services, Group A officers of central government or their equivalent in other organisations owned or controlled by central government, before offering employment to them on contractual/consultancy basis, vigilance clearance from the employer organisation, from which the government officer had retired, should be necessarily obtained, it said.Highlighting the procedure, the CVC said in case, no reply is received from the erstwhile employer(s) within 15 days of sending communication by speed post to them, a reminder may be sent to them for expediting vigilance clearance.However, in case no reply is received from the erstwhile employer within 21 days of sending initial communication to them, it may be considered as ‘deemed vigilance clearance for the person concerned’, the commission said.“Later on, if it is found that the ex-employee was involved in any vigilance related matter or was not clear from vigilance point of view, the erstwhile employer organisation would be responsible for all consequential actions,” it said.“The retired government officer is to be considered for post retirement engagement only on receipt of vigilance clearance/vigilance inputs,” the CVC said.The procedure for engaging retired government officers should be transparent with equal opportunity to all those who are willing to offer their services, it said.The post to be filled up on contractual or consultancy basis should at least be advertised on the website of the organisation concerned at appropriate place and should be available in the public domain, the commission’s order said.The CVC said that government officials taking up private sector jobs without completing mandatory cooling off period will constitute serious misconduct.“It has been observed that on some occasions, immediately after their retirement from government organisations, retired officials are taking up full-time job/contractual assignments in private sector organisations,” it said.Quite often, cooling off period, as prescribed under the rules of organisations concerned, is not observed before taking up such offers, the Commission said.“Post retirement acceptance of offer by retired government officials without observing cooling off period, constitutes a serious misconduct on their part,” the probity watchdog said.All government organisations may, therefore, formulate appropriate rules and guidelines for its employees to ensure that post retirement, the cooling off period is mandatorily observed by them before accepting any offer from private sector entities, the order said.The rules and guidelines should incorporate the procedure for seeking or obtaining permission before accepting offers from private sector entities during the cooling off period if not in existence, it said.The applicable service or conduct rules should also be revised and modified to ensure that, if required, appropriate action can also be initiated in case of violation of such rules by retired employees, the commission said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vigilance-clearance-mandatory-for-officers-to-get-post-retirement-jobs-cvc-262862
03-06-2021||New Delhi||Anti-inflammatory drugs may cause weaker immune response to Covid-19 vaccine: Study||Some people who take the drug methotrexate to treat common immune system disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis may mount a weaker immune response to a Covid-19 vaccine, according to a study.People with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders are typically treated with drugs that reduce inflammation, including methotrexate.The disorders result when the immune system, meant to fight disease and drive healing, is triggered abnormally, which in turn causes inflammation, pain and swelling.The study, published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, looked specifically at patients' responses to the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, which the researchers measured by looking at the antibodies produced in each patient by the vaccine.Vaccine ingredients, once injected into the body, are meant to trigger the production of antibodies, immune proteins that specifically target the viral protein, disabling it and tagging it for removal from the body.However, the researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and NYU Langone Health in the US cautioned that the lower antibody response in patients who take methotrexate does not necessarily mean that these patients are not protected against Covid-19."It is most important to state that patients should not be concerned about our study findings as the majority of patients with immune system disorders are responding well to the mRNA vaccines," study co-first author Rebecca Haberman explained."It is also possible that methotrexate is delaying, rather than preventing, an adequate immune response against Covid-19," she added.Researchers have known that rheumatoid arthritis patients who take methotrexate have a reduced response to seasonal flu vaccines.Since mRNA vaccines use a new mechanism of action that patients with these common immune disorders have not seen before, the team wanted to determine how well these patients are protected.The study enrolled healthy people and patients treated for common immune-mediated disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.The participants received two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.The researchers analysed blood samples to determine the amount of antibodies patients produced after receiving the vaccine.They also measured the activation of key immune system cells, including CD8 killer T cells, which are generated as part of the body's immune response.The study found that over 90 per cent of healthy subjects and patients taking drugs other than methotrexate to control inflammation mounted strong antibody responses.Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders who were taking methotrexate achieved an adequate response in only 62 per cent of cases.Similarly, while healthy patients and those with common immune disorders who were taking anti-inflammatory drugs other than methotrexate produced CD8 T cells, patients taking methotrexate did not show an increase in CD8 T cell activation after vaccination."More research is needed to understand why such a significant proportion of people with common immune disorders who take methotrexate have deficiencies in mounting an antibody and cellular response," says study co-senior author Jose U. Scher, an associate professor at NYU Langone."This may not necessarily mean that the vaccine is not efficacious, but that alternate vaccine strategies need to be investigated," Scher said.These alternate vaccine strategies include potentially discontinuing methotrexate during the time these patients receive the vaccine, changing the dosage of the drug or possibly administering a booster shot to the vaccine, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-cause-weaker-immune-response-to-covid-19-vaccine-study-262858

An investigation is underway," the SP stated.Slamming Thomas, Opposition Congress leader and chairperson of the state Assembly panel for women empowerment, Ampareen Lyngdoh, has written to Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh, seeking the accused MLA's dismissal from all House committees."The allegation of sexual assault is very disappointing...

Officials fear some of them may have died of the same cause and many people have suffered eye damage and vision loss.In Wednesday's incident, the brick kiln workers found the liquor cartons dumped in the canal. They started celebrating but were taken ill shortly after consuming the countrymade brew.An alarm was raised and a police party from the nearby Jawan police station rushed to the spot and took the victims to a hospital.Chief Superintendent of Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College hospital, Dr Harris Manzur said five people have died so far, three of whom were brought dead."Doctors are battling to save the lives of the remaining 22 victims," he said, adding that critically ill patients kept arriving at the hospital throughout the night.Till Thursday morning, 27 patients have arrived, and if some of them were brought in "earlier", more lives could have been saved, Manzur said.The first six hours are crucial in these cases, the doctor added.The police said a case was lodged against unidentified accused and an investigation launched.Since the first death in the other hooch tragedy was reported on May 28, post-mortem examinations have been done on 87 suspected victims, even though the official death toll remains 35.Thirty-four people have been arrested so far.Over the past few days, reports from several hospitals indicated a large number of victims of the previous hooch tragedy suffered severe eye damage and permanent loss of vision.Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Bhanu Pratap Kalyani said at least 13 patients suffered severe eye problems after consuming the spurious liquor last week."Some of them have shown signs of recovery," he said.According to Dr Zia Siddiqui, eye specialist at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College hospital, "Treatment of six patients suffering from acute eye damage is underway. Two have suffered irreversible damage, and the remaining four are recovering." Dr Sanjay Bhargava, owner of a private hospital in the city, told media persons that 18 patients with eye damage were treated at his facility and 16 of them have recovered.According to medical experts, it will take some more time to assess the number of those who have suffered permanent eye damage. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hooch-tragedy-hits-aligarh-again-five-dead-22-hospitalised-262850

The national carrier did not respond to the queries sent by the PTI on this matter on Thursday.IndiGo has given first dose to around 20,000 employees out of total 35,000 eligible employees that work for the carrier and its ground handling subsidiary Agile.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Govt issues guidelines for care of children affected by Covid-19||The government has come out with guidelines for the care and protection of the children affected by Covid-19 and fixed responsibilities for the states, district magistrates, police, Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local bodies.In a letter to the chief secretaries of all the states and Union territories, Women and Child Development Ministry Secretary Ram Mohan Mishra on Wednesday said in order to streamline and facilitate the actions being taken, the major responsibilities of the primary duty holders have been enlisted to ensure the best interest of children during the pandemic.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), in an affidavit to the Supreme Court, said 9,346 children have lost at least one of the parents to the deadly virus, including over 1,700 who have lost both their parents, according to data received from the states.Defining the roles of the states, district magistrates (DMs), police, Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local bodies, Mishra issued detailed guidelines.The states need to identify the children in distress through outreach and surveys and prepare a database with a profile of each child, along with the details of their specific needs and requirements, and ensure that the data is uploaded on the Track Child portal.Mishra told the states and Union territories to temporarily allocate child care institutions (CCIs) to house those children whose parents have been unwell due to Covid-19 and provide the necessary support to them, in case the extended family is not available to take care of them.The Women and Child Development Ministry have asked the states to issue directions to hospitals to collect the contact details of trustworthy persons known to the patients in the admission form, to be contacted for taking care of children in case of any eventuality."Immediate temporary rehabilitation of children through the existing child care facilities supported under the Child Protection Services scheme must be ensured," Mishra said.The states have also been asked to make suitable arrangements for isolation facilities within the CCIs to take care of the children suffering from Covid and prepare a roaster of child psychologists or counsellors to visit the facilities and interact with the children.Mishra further asked the states to launch a local helpline number manned by experts for giving psychosocial care or support to the children in distress.On the role of the DMs, he said they shall be the guardians of the vulnerable children impacted adversely by Covid."The DM shall make efforts that such children are rehabilitated in the following order of preference, in the manner as prescribed under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015," he said.The DMs need to create a district-level multi-departmental task force to map the needs, monitor the progress and ensure that all benefits reach the affected children and all civil society organisations may be asked to positively inform the Child Welfare Committee or the District Child Protection Unit about any vulnerable child noticed by them."The district magistrates need to secure the rights of the children on family assets or ancestral properties to ensure that those are not sold or encroached. It should be done through proper oversight maintained by the registration or revenue department," Mishra said.The WCD secretary said district police teams must stay alert and vigilant to prevent trafficking of children, illegal adoption, child marriage, child labour or any other kind of abuse."All cases of children offered for adoption on social media to be traced and action may be taken against the perpetrators if found guilty. Vigil may be kept on the CCIs and the vulnerable hot spots in the district housing children at risk during the police beats or night rounds in urban and rural areas," he said.The Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local bodies must ensure that the child protection committees at the panchayat level identify and inform the district administration or the District Child Protection Unit about children in distress."District Magistrates to organise orientation and sensitisation of urban local bodies and Panchayati Raj institutions, and inform them regarding measures being taken and schemes announced for such children," Mishra said.In addition, he said it must be ensured that all children orphaned during the pandemic are provided free education through government day schools or residential schools."Based on the specific need of the child, he or she can also be enrolled in the nearest private schools under RTE section 12(1)(c). Efforts may be made to include eligible orphan children under the existing scholarship schemes of the central or state governments," Mishra said.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||2 Covid positive senior citizens get antibody cocktail therapy at private hospital in Delhi||Two Covid positive senior citizens with cardiac complications admitted at a private healthcare facility here have been administered monoclonal antibody therapy which is said to reduce the chance of hospitalisation by 70 per cent in patients with mild to moderate symptoms, the hospital said on Thursday.Sunirmal Ghatak (70) and Suresh Kumar Trehan (65) were on Tuesday administered a cocktail of Casirivimab and Imdevimab at BLK-Max Super Speciality Hospital as part of this single-dose infusion-based treatment.Ghatak, with a known cardiac problem, had undergone angioplasty with stenting in the past, the hospital said in a statement.Trehan reported to the hospital two days ago with severe breathlessness and was unable to lie down. He had no previous history of any ailment. His echocardiography showed a strained heart with an ejection fraction of only 25 per cent, it said in a statement.Both of them had oxygen saturation level above 95 per cent and came to the hospital within three days of developing Covid-19 symptoms.The hospital successfully administered monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy to two of these Covid positive extremely high-risk senior citizen patients on Tuesday, saving them from developing severe complications, it said.This was the first time that monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy was administered at the hospital."Monoclonal antibodies are identical copies of an antibody that targets one specific antigen. This treatment has previously been used to cure infections such as Ebola and HIV."According to studies, this 'Antibody Cocktail Treatment' for Covid-19 can prevent escalation of mild and moderate illness to severe which then requires hospitalisation in 70 per cent of the cases," said Dr Sandeep Nayar, Senior Director, BLK-Max Centre for Chest and Respiratory Diseases.The therapy is most suited for "high-risk Covid-19 patients" within the first 10 days of onset of symptoms and meet any of the listed criteria such as age being 65 years or above.The other criteria include obesity with a body mass index of more than 35, type one or type two diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease including those on dialysis, chronic liver disease, currently receiving immunosuppressive treatment, or if aged above 55 with either heart disease or hypertension or chronic lung disease. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-covid-positive-senior-citizens-get-antibody-cocktail-therapy-at-private-hospital-in-delhi-262842
03-06-2021||New Delhi||Won’t limit functionality, will continue to send reminders: WhatsApp on new privacy policy||WhatsApp on Thursday said it will not limit the functionality of the messaging app for users not agreeing to its new privacy policy, but will continue to send reminders about the update.WhatsApp said its recent policy update does not change the privacy of people’s personal messages, and it has already written to the government seeking to assure them that the privacy of users remains its highest priority.On Thursday, the Centre has told the Delhi High Court that the messaging platform was trying to “force” its users to consent to the new privacy policy before the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill becomes the law by bombarding them with notifications daily to obtain their consent.“We reiterate that we have already responded to the Government of India and assured them that the privacy of users remains our highest priority,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in an emailed statement.A raging debate had ensued earlier this year after WhatsApp said it will update its terms of service and privacy policy around how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products.The Facebook-owned company has insisted that its contentious privacy policy will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works in the coming weeks.“Instead, we will continue to remind users from time to time about the update as well as when people choose to use relevant optional features, like communicating with a business that is receiving support from Facebook,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson further noted that the recent update does not change the privacy of people’s personal messages and that its purpose is to provide additional information about how people can interact with businesses if they choose to do so.“We hope this approach reinforces the choice that all users have whether or not they want to interact with a business. We will maintain this approach until at least the forthcoming PDP law comes into effect,” the spokesperson said.Terming WhatsApp’s bombarding of notifications on its customers as an “anti-user practice” for obtaining “trick consent”, the central government on Thursday urged the court to direct the messaging platform to desist from pushing notifications onto its existing users with regard to the new privacy policy.The Centre’s claim has been made in an additional affidavit filed in response to several pleas challenging the new privacy policy of WhatsApp.WhatsApp—which has 53 crore users in India as per the government data—had faced severe backlash over user concerns that data was being shared with parent company Facebook.Interestingly, the new rules for social media companies have also come into effect from the last month that mandate large platforms like Facebook and Twitter to undertake greater due diligence and make these digital platforms more accountable and responsible for the content hosted by them.The rules also require significant social media intermediaries - providing services primarily in the nature of messaging - to enable identification of the “first originator” of the information that undermines the sovereignty of India, the security of the state, or public order. This could have major ramifications for players like Twitter and WhatsApp.The new IT rules require significant social media intermediaries - those with other 50 lakh users - to appoint a grievance officer, nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel are required to be resident in India.Under the new rules, social media companies will have to take down flagged content within 36 hours, and remove within 24 hours content that is flagged for nudity, pornography etc. The Centre had said the new rules are designed to prevent abuse and misuse of platforms, and offer users a robust forum for grievance redressal.Non-compliance with the rules would result in these platforms losing their intermediary status that provides them immunity from liabilities over any third-party data hosted by them. In other words, they could be liable for criminal action in case of complaints.

We request the CJI to expedite the process of appointment,” a Bench led by Justice LN Rao said.Justice Shiva Kirti Singh would continue as TDSAT chairman since there were no other members and fresh appointment was not made yet, it said.The tenure of Justice Singh—who has got several extensions—would go beyond the four-year limit prescribed under the latest Tribunal Reforms Ordinance—currently under challenge before the top court.The administrative member of TDSAT retired in October 2018, while the technical Member retired in 2019. Justice Singh—who was due to retire on April 20 -- has given several three-month extensions since April 7 last year.The top court had directed the government to ensure that the appointment process for all the members of TDSAT was completed in the next three months.Earlier, he was given extension after the court was informed that the tribunal had no other members except the Chairman and he too was allowed to retire it would become dysfunctional.The tribunal was virtually non-functional as only Chairman—Justice Singh—was there and his original tenure was to end on April 20 last year, it was told.“How can tribunals function like this?” the Bench had wondered.A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had in 2019 quashed the rules for appointment of tribunal chairpersons and members and said they should not be made to depend on government ministries and departments.Thereafter, the government promulgated the Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, which has been challenged before the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/justice-shiva-kirti-singh-to-continue-as-tdsat-chairman-supreme-court-262839

The CM had to turn off the camera in between.In fact, fellow ministers had to intervene looking at the growing confrontation and fierce debate between the two ministers.As the Cabinet meeting was held to decide the status of board exams for Class X and XII at the CMR with Gehlot being virtually connected, Dotasara discussed the vaccination topic at the end of the meeting and said that the Congress launched a social media campaign demanding free vaccination, now a memorandum should be submitted to the collector at every district level.Dhariwal immediately intervened and said, what is the need of this, the work of the ministers is not to submit the memorandum.Dotasara objected to this interference and Dhariwal was left agitated.The matter escalated when both of them indulged in war of words and state ministers had to intervene to calm them down.Dotasara told the CM that action should be taken against such behaviour of the minister who did not allow the party president to speak and was about to leave the meeting but the CM pacified him and asked him to complete his talk.The Chief Minister asked both of them to remain calm but the dispute started again when Dhariwal told Dotasara that he has seen many party presidents and he can do whatever he wants.The Chief Minister turned off the camera after seeing the heated argument between the two ministers.Even after the cabinet meeting was over, Dhariwal and Dotasara clashed outside in a louder tone.Seeing the ministers fighting openly, the security personnel and staff of the CM residence present there were also shocked. The fellow ministers got the two separated, otherwise there could have been a scuffle.Dhariwal openly told Dotasra that he was not bound to obey his orders while Dotasara said that he will have to obey orders as he is the party president.Dotasara told Dhariwal - Being party in charge of Jaipur, you have not even taken a meeting till date in the last two and a half years. This attitude of yours is not good for the party, I will report it to Sonia Gandhi.Dhariwal again retaliated and questioned, "Will you threaten me?

03-06-2021||New Delhi||HC issues summons to Ramdev on DMA plea for making statement against allopathic medicine||The Delhi High Court Thursday issued summons to yoga guru Ramdev on a plea accusing him of making statements against allopathic medicines and claiming Patanjali's Coronil kit is a cure for Covid-19 but refused to restrain him at this stage saying the allopathic profession was not so fragile.The high court however orally asked Ramdev's counsel to tell him not to make any provocative statements.“Mr Rajiv Nayar is a very respectable senior (advocate). I am sure his client will listen to him,” Justice C Hari Shankar said. The high court issued summons to Ramdev on the suit filed by Delhi Medical Association (DMA) and asked him to file response in three weeks and listed the matter for hearing on July 13.“Considerable time has passed since passing of allegedly injurious statements. The counsel says defendant no. 1 (Ramdev) continues to make statement. No injunctive order can be given without giving an opportunity to the plaint, especially in view of the objections. Issue summons on the suit,” Justice Shankar said.The court also issued summons to social media platforms Twitter and Facebook and Astha channel, who are made parties to the petition. DMA, on behalf of its doctor members, submitted before the court that Ramdev's statement affects as Coronil medicine does not cure coronavirus and it is misleading. It has claimed a token damage of Rs 1 from him.On being asked by the court as to how did this statement affect the association, senior advocate Rajiv Dutta, representing DMA, said it affects because this medicine does not cure coronavirus and this was a suit for civil rights of doctors.The court said it cannot say as to whether Coronil is a cure or not and that it was something to be decided by medical experts.The judge said he was "least concerned" with the association's argument that Ramdev was a powerful person having large number of followers.“Ramdev is a person who doesn't have faith is allopathy. He believes everything can be cured by Yoga and Ayurveda. He may be right or wrong," he said.He added that the court can understand it is argued his statements are affecting the public but here “you say oh my God Ramdev has done something. You people should be spending time to find cure for the pandemic instead of wasting the court's time”.On the point of locus of DMA to file the suit, Dutta said it was affecting the public and also the members of the association as the statements made in open affects and that Ramdev was calling this science fake.To this, the judge said, “If I feel some science is fake. Tomorrow I will feel homeopathy is fake. Do you mean they will file a suit against me? I put in on twitter. You will say take down the Twitter account. It is a public opinion. I do not think your allopathic profession is so fragile”, and added that it has to be tested on the touchstone of free speech.The court said someone has a view that it is because of inefficacy of allopathic medicines that so many people have died and it was of the view that it comes under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Ramdev, raised preliminary objection on the maintainability of the plea and argued that prima facie the suit was not maintainable as they are asking for an injunction and raising the ground of public good.Dutta also said that Ayush Ministry had made a statement that Coronil was not a cure for Covid-19 and could not be advertised as such and had also asked Patanjali to give details after which Ramdev had clarified that it was an immunity booster.The court noted that Ramdev has clarified and said with this clarification the entire grievance of DMA should have gone.“If this was mandatory on Patanjali (to give details and not to advertise) and if he acts in violation, it is for the Ayush Ministry to look into, Why are you carrying the torch,”the court said.DMA's counsel further claimed that Patanjali had made Rs 25 crore from Coronil sales, after it was touted as a cure for Covid-19 and that he has a vast following in the country. The court said, "Is he to be blamed for people buying Coronil?" and suggested the association to file a public interest litigation instead of pursuing the suit. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-issues-summons-to-ramdev-on-dma-plea-for-making-statement-against-allopathic-medicine-262816

Four weeks' time is a little longer. We cannot give you 3-4 weeks' time. You please place it before us in two weeks as students will have to take admissions in colleges. Nowadays all communication is happening virtually”.Petitioner in-person Mamta Sharma said that like CBSE and CISCE, there are many state boards that have not taken any decision on class 12 exams. She said that there are about 1.2 crore students in state boards and the court may direct them to take decisions. The bench told Sharma, “You should have patience and not rush things like this. You have only asked for cancellation of board exams by CBSE and now you are saying, state boards. You are asking for heavens. First, let CBSE place on record objective criteria and then we will see about other boards”. The top court then deferred the hearing by two weeks. On June 1, the government has decided to cancel the CBSE Class 12 board exams because of the COVID-19 pandemic with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserting that the decision has been taken in the interest of students and that the anxiety among students, parents and teachers must be put to an end. The call was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Modi in which it was decided that the CBSE will take steps to compile the results of class 12 students as per well-defined objective criteria in a time-bound manner.On May 31, the Centre has informed the top court that it will take a final decision within the next two days on whether to conduct class 12 board exams amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.The top court had then observed that if the Centre decides to depart from the last year's policy, wherein the remaining board exams were cancelled due to the pandemic, then it must give “tangible reasons” for it. Observing that the last year's decision was taken after deliberations, the apex court had said, “If you are departing from that policy, please give us good reasons so that we can examine it.”  The apex court on June 26, 2020, had approved the schemes of the CBSE and CISCE for cancellations of remaining board examinations scheduled from July 1 to 15 last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and also approved their formula for assessment of examinees. Sharma's plea has also sought directions to devise an "objective methodology" to declare the result of class 12 within a specific time frame.  The petition has arrayed the Centre, the CBSE and the CISCE as respondents in the matter. The CBSE had on April 14 announced the cancellation of class 10 exams and postponement of class 12 exams in view of the surge in coronavirus cases. The plea filed in the apex court has contended that due to the unprecedented health emergency and surge in COVID-19 cases in the country, it is not possible to conduct the examination and any further delay would cause irreparable loss to the future of students. “In view of the unprecedented health emergency and rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country, the conduct of examination (either offline/online/blended) in upcoming weeks is not possible and delay in examination will cause irreparable loss to the students as time is the essence in taking admission in higher education courses in foreign universities,” the plea has said.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||SC quashes sedition case against Vinod Dua||The Supreme Court on Thursday quashed an FIR registered by the Himachal Pradesh Police against senior journalist Vinod Dua last year for his comments critical of the government’s handling of COVID-19 lockdown on his YouTube channel.“We have quashed the proceedings and FIR. Every journalist will be entitled to protection under Kedar Nath Singh judgment (on sedition),” said a Bench headed by Justice UU Lalit which had reserved its verdict on October 6 last year.While upholding the validity of Section 124A of IPC (sedition), a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had in Kedarnath Singh’s case (1962) restricted the scope of the law by prescribing certain safeguards.The Bench, however, rejected Dua’s prayer for setting up of a high-level committee in each state for prior vetting of sedition charges against journalists of 10-year standing, saying “It will be directly encroaching upon the legislative domain.”The Shimla FIR was registered at the insistence of Himachal Pradesh BJP leader Ajay Shyam who filed a criminal complaint against Dua accusing him of instigating violence against the government by allegedly spreading fake news.Contending that none of the ingredients of the offences alleged against Dua in the FIR were made out, senior advocate Vikas Singh had urged the court to quash the FIR as what was said by the senior journalist in his show had already been reported by several TV channels.Additional Solicitor General SV Raju had argued that even if one cognizable offence was made out, the FIR could not be quashed.On laying down guidelines on the registration of cases against journalists as was the case with doctors, Raju had contended that journalism wasn’t like the medical profession over which MCI exercised greater control and regulation.“Anyone can become a journalist. There are no qualifications. No expertise is required. A layman can become a journalist. There is no control like how the MCI exercises control for doctors. Journalism is not a profession, it is an activity,” Raju had submitted.The Supreme Court on June 14 last year refused to stay the probe into a sedition case lodged against Dua by Himachal Pradesh Police but protected him from arrest in the case.It had asked Dua to join the probe and co-operate with the police in the process through video conferencing or online mode. Police could interrogate him at his residence in Delhi after giving him a 24-hour prior notice, it had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-quashes-sedition-case-against-vinod-dua-262798
03-06-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19 vaccine: After Pfizer, Serum Institute seeks indemnity, say sources||Amid discussions over possible legal protection to foreign vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna over their Covid-19 jabs in India, the Serum Institute of India (SII) has also sought protection against liabilities, sources said on Thursday.“Not just Serum Institute of India, all the vaccine companies should get indemnity protection against liabilities if foreign companies are granted the same,” sources added.Earlier last year, SII CEO Adar Poonawala had advocated indemnity for all vaccine manufacturers.“We need to have the government indemnify manufacturers, especially vaccine manufacturers, against all lawsuits... Frivolous claims come up and you see in the media something being blown out of proportion. The government needs to step in with the right messaging,” he had said.Amid the nationwide Covid-19 vaccine crunch, US pharma giant Pfizer is seeking an indemnity bond that will exempt it from legal claims in case there are any adverse effects from the vaccine.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul had said on May 27 that the government is still examining the American pharma company’s request for indemnity.“We are examining this request and will make a decision in the larger interest of people and on merit. This is under discussion and there is no decision as of now,” he had said.No company in India’s vaccination history has ever paid indemnity and the government, which is the biggest user of vaccines, has also not done it, Dr Nirmal K Ganguly, former ICMR chief had said on Wednesday.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had earlier exempted specific trials of Covid-19 vaccines that have been approved by some other international regulatory bodies. This is likely to clear the way of foreign Covid-19 vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna.DCGI Chief VG Somani said in a letter that the decision will be applicable for vaccines that have already been approved for restricted use by the US FDA, EMA, UK MHRA, PMDA Japan or listed for Emergency Use by the World Health Organisation.Pfizer said in a statement that it continues to remain engaged with the Indian government towards making its coronavirus vaccine available for use in the government immunisation programme. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-vaccine-after-pfizer-serum-institute-seeks-indemnity-say-sources-262796

Earlier this year, the target for 20 per cent blending was brought forward to 2025.And now, it has been further advanced to April 2023."The Central Government hereby directs that the oil companies shall sell ethanol-blended petrol with a percentage of ethanol up to 20 per cent as per the Bureau of Indian Standards specifications, in the whole of the States and union territories," the Oil Ministry said in a Gazette notification."This Notification shall come into force with effect from the 1st April 2023".India is the world's third-biggest oil importer, relying on foreign suppliers to meet over 85 per cent of its demand.In the current ethanol supply year, which started in October, India plans to have 10 per cent ethanol-blending with gasoline. As much as 4 billion litres of ethanol will be needed for achieving a 10 per cent mixing ratio.For 20 per cent by 2023, 10 billion (1,000 crores) litres will be needed.The sugar industry will divert 6 million tonnes of surplus sugar to produce 7 billion litres of the ethanol needed, while the remaining ethanol will be produced from excess grain.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Why government delayed emergency approval to Covid vax: Chidambaram||Congress leader and former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Thursday accused the central government of needlessly delaying approval to Coronavirus vaccines in the country for many months except in the case of Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik V."Our suspicion that the government had not approved any vaccine other than Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V, has been proved correct," Chidambaram said."Why did government go through the charade of negotiating quantities with Pfizer and Moderna without first giving Emergency Use Approval (EUA) to their vaccines?"Why has it taken 8-9 months for the government to decide to give approval when the US and other countries had granted approval?"Remember, Dr Manmohan Singh had made this specific suggestion in his letter which got a rude reply from the Union  Health Minister!" he added. In mid-April, Singh's letter to the Centre suggested ramping up the vaccination drive as key to battling the pandemic, asking the government to "resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated".The former Prime Minister had also added that India currently has vaccinated only a small fraction of its population, adding that with the right policy design, "We can do much better and very quickly." Experts from the National Institute of Malaria Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research, on Wednesday, slammed the government for poor planning of the home-grown vaccine production and deployment, as a result of which "India doesn't have enough vaccines to go around with", they said.While there are plans to significantly ramp up production of the Covaxin and Covishield vaccines, the target to vaccinate around one billion people may still not be reached in 2021, the experts said in a commentary published in the online journal BMJ Global Health.Only around 3 per cent of the population has been inoculated till now.The experts urged the government to expedite the approval of foreign vaccines already deployed elsewhere around the globe.The Centre on Wednesday took steps to accelerate domestic vaccine production.Mumbai-based Haffkine Biopharma will produce 22.8 crore doses per annum of Covaxin under technology transfer arrangement with Bharat Biotech.With the aim of vaccinating the entire eligible population at the earliest, domestic vaccine production is being steadily ramped up in the country with the help from the Centre.Three public enterprises were being supported by the Department of Biotechnology under Atmanirbhar Bharat 3.0 Mission 'Covid Suraksha'.Apart from Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Mumbai, these enterprises are the Indian Immunologicals Ltd, Hyderabad and Bharat Immunologicals & Biologicals Ltd, Bulandshahr, in Uttar Pradesh.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Mehul Choksi denied bail over illegal entry in Dominica||A Dominica magistrate has denied bail to absconding diamond tycoon Mehul Choksi, who was arrested on May 23 for alleged illegal entry to the Caribbean island country, the local media reported.Choksi, wanted here in connection with a Rs 13,500-crore fraud in the Punjab National Bank (PNB), pleaded before the magistrate that he was abducted and forcibly brought to Dominica from neighbouring Antigua and Barbuda, about 100 nautical miles away, Dominica News Online reported.The 62-year-old wheelchair-bound diamantaire, who has a pending Interpol Red Corner Notice (RCN) against him, arrived before the presiding Roseau Magistrate Court in a black pair of shorts and a blue T-shirt from the Dominica China Friendship Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment.The Dominica High Court, which was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by Choksi, had ordered him to be presented before the magistrate to face charges of illegal entry.A habeas corpus petition is filed for producing before a court a person who is under arrest or in unlawful detention.“Our stand that Mehul Choksi is in illegal detention as he was required to be produced within 72 hours before the magistrate and was not so produced has been vindicated. In order to remedy this, he has been asked to be produced before the magistrate. This establishes the illegal detention of Choksi as pleaded by the defence. Contrary to numerous media reports, there was no discussion regarding the Government of India,” Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said here.During the hearing before Magistrate Candia Carrette-George, the Dominica prosecution cited the ongoing extradition proceedings in the courts of Antigua and Barbuda, where he is staying since 2018 after leaving India, as one of the main arguments to keep Choksi under detention.Prosecutor Sherma Dalrymple told the court that Choksi is a “flight risk” and does not have any ties in Dominica that prevent him from fleeing the country if bail is granted.Defence counsel Wayne Norde said Choksi was not a flight risk considering his health and the pending extradition proceedings in Antigua and Barbuda were also a reason for him not to leave Dominica.Offering to pay a bail amount of ECD 10,000, double the fine amount for illegal entry to Dominica, Norde said Choksi did not have any criminal case in Antigua and Barbuda and the proceedings against him were civil in nature, which shows that he is a a man of good character.The lawyer said the new bail act says a defendant is entitled to the relief as a right unless the offence is of a serious nature.In her order, the magistrate said considering the “severity” of the matter, she is not convinced that Choksi will stay in the country to face legal proceedings and adjourned the matter till June 14.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Mehul Choksi's wife breaks silence on husband's 'rumoured' girlfriend||Diamantaire Mehul Choksi was produced before a magistrate in Dominica to answer charges of his illegal entry into the Caribbean island nation following a high court order on Wednesday, local media reported.He appeared before the magistrate on a wheel chair in a blue T-shirt and black shorts.Earlier in the day, Dominica High Court Judge Bernie Stephenson issued the order for his production before a magistrate after nearly three hours of hearing on a habeas corpus petition filed on behalf of the businessman who had claimed that he was abducted from neighbouring Antigua and Barbuda and forcefully brought to the Caribbean Island nation.She adjourned the habeas corpus matter till Thursday, Dominica News Online reported.Rejecting the submission of Choksi who is wanted in India in an alleged Rs 13,500 crore loan fraud case in Punjab National Bank and has an Interpol Red Notice against him, the prosecution said the habeas corpus petition does not stand as he had illegally entered the country and was subsequently detained.His lawyers, however, alleged that he was kidnapped from Jolly Harbour in Antigua and brought to Dominica on a boat, about 100 nautical miles away."Our stand that Mr Mehul Choksi is in illegal detention as he was required to be produced within 72 hours before the magistrate and was not so produced has been vindicated. In order to remedy this, he has been asked to be produced before the magistrate. This establishes illegal detention of Mr Mehul Choksi as pleaded by the defence," Choksi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said."The matter being heard is of habeas corpus petition...and not of his repatriation to India. His citizenship is not in question before the court....  Contrary to numerous media reports, there was no discussion regarding Government of India," Aggarwal said.The diamantaire, who mysteriously went missing on May 23 from Antigua and Barbuda where he had been staying since 2018 as a citizen, was detained in neighbouring Dominica for illegal entry after a possible romantic escapade with his rumoured girlfriend.Choksi's wife Preeti told reporters that the woman in question was not his girlfriend.She said the woman was known to him and used to go on walks with him.She said Choksi was abducted by people looking like Indian and Antiguan when he had gone to meet the woman.During Wednesday's trial, Choksi was present through video-conferencing from Dominica China Friendship Hospital while his lawyers were present physically in court.The judge asked authorities to share court documents with Choksi who is admitted at the Hospital.His lawyers said that he does not feel safe in police custody and that he should be sent back to Antigua and Barbuda, local media reported.He also said he would pay for his security and raised the issue of injury marks found on his body and him being hospitalised.In case of an adverse order, Choksi has the option of appealing in higher courts.Last week, the Government of Dominica had issued a press statement that it was verifying the status of Choksi's citizenship with Antigua and Barbuda."Once the information is provided by the Antigua authorities, possible arrangements will be made for Mr. Mehul Choksi to be repatriated to Antigua," the statement had said.A team of multi-agency officials led by a CBI DIG has gone to Dominica to bring Choksi to India if court there clears his deportation to India, officials said.Choksi's arrest has created turbulence in the calm political waters of the neighbouring Caribbean Island countries -- Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica --where allegations have been levelled against opposition parties supporting the businessman having an Interpol Red Notice against him.Dominican Leader of Opposition Lennox Linton had to issue a denial on the reports of meeting Chetan Choksi, the brother of Mehul Choksi, or receiving any money from him."I do not know Chetan Choksi. I have never seen him. I have never spoken to him. I have never met with him," Dominica News Online quoted a video message released by Linton.Local media outlet Associate Times had alleged that Choksi arrived on a private jet on May 29 and met Linton at his home in Marigot locality the next day for nearly two hours where he gave token money of USD 2 lakh and promised funding for elections in return for raising the issue in Parliament.The outlet alleged that Linton was quiet on the Mehul Choksi affair till meeting his brother Chetan. After the meeting, he started attacks on the government over the arrest of the fugitive diamantaire.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are wanted for allegedly siphoning Rs 13,500 crore of public money from the state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) using letters of undertaking.While Modi is in a London prison after being repeatedly denied bail and is contesting his extradition to India, Choksi took citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 using the Citizenship by Investment programme before fleeing India in the first week of January 2018. The scam came to light subsequently. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mehul-choksis-wife-breaks-silence-on-husbands-rumoured-girlfriend-262773

The endorsement came after a two-day “review” meeting in Lucknow amid widespread criticism against CM Adityanath over “mismanagement” of the pandemic and speculations of a possible reshuffle in his government and the state BJP.“Remember it’s a state with (a population of) 20 plus crore. When municipality CMs could not manage a city of 1.5 crore population, Yogi managed quite effectively,” said the BJP general secretary (organisation).Though the state leaders have always said the review meeting by central leaders, which included Santhosh and BJP’s state incharge Radha Mohan Singh, was related to preparations for the UP poll scheduled next year, speculations are rife about changes in the Adityanath cabinet and BJP’s state organisation-led by chief Swatantra Dev Singh.Apparently, there are rumblings in the state BJP that Singh “is also not being able to spread the right message”. Observers say “it is obvious that ahead of the UP elections, the BJP does not want to give an impression that there is any issue/problem within the party.

Justice JR Midha said the plaintiffs, Chawla and two others, were required to first approach the government for their rights and if denied, they should come to the court.The court, which reserved order on the suit after hearing the arguments of various parties, also asked as to why as many as 33 parties have been added to the plaint and said it is not permitted under the law.“It is not the sweet will of the plaintiff to join as many parties and cause of action.

The B.1.617 variant was first detected in India and was divided in three lineages — B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3.In the Covid-19 weekly epidemiological update published on Tuesday, the WHO said available findings for lineages B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 were initially used to designate B.1.617 a global Variant of Concern (VOC) on May 11 this year. “Since then, it has become evident that greater public health risks are currently associated with B.1.617.2, while lower rates of transmission of other lineages have been observed,” the WHO said. The UN health agency said in order to reflect this updated information, B.1.617 has been “delineated”.“B.1.617.2 remains a VOC and labelled variant Delta – we continue to observe significantly increased transmissibility and a growing number of countries reporting outbreaks associated with this variant. Further studies into the impact of this variant remain a high priority for WHO. The Delta variant has now been reported in 62 countries around the world as of June 1,” the update said.It added that the B.1.617.1 strain has been reclassified to a Variant of Interest (VOI) and labelled variant “Kappa”.

But criticism also came from Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal, former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh and Tamil Nadu FM Palanivel Thiagarajan (PTR).The minister argued that the Indian economy was not the only one to have faced a GDP contraction and maintained that growth had returned from a contraction of 24.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2020-21 to 1.6 per cent in the year’s last quarter.The NDA government had been much more generous with cash transfers to farmers and the socio-economically challenged as well as in giving good credit to entrepreneurs, Anurag said.He did not touch on Badal’s letter to Sitharaman, where he argued that bureaucrats had taken over the work of political leaders at the GST Council in making rules.Chidambaram also said the “GST Implementation Committee (consisting of officers) became the tail that wagged the dog” and said Sitharaman was treating all FMs who expressed a contrary view “as errant schoolboys”.PTR termed Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot’s tweet that states expressing a contrary view were kept out of the GoM to report on the reduction of GST rates “distressing”.Lockdown didn’t impact economy: Anurag||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-government-fight-it-out-over-gdp-growth-gst-regime-262513

It will enable creation of adequate rental housing stock for all income groups, thereby addressing the issue of homelessness. This will enable institutionalisation of rental housing by gradually shifting it towards the formal market.” It said the Act would facilitate unlocking of vacant houses for rental purposes and is expected to give a fillip “to private participation in rental housing as a business model” for addressing the huge housing shortage.It is a fact that the rental housing market in the country has been struggling to find a balanced position in the real estate space. Apart from demand issues, tenant-landlord conflicts have been rampant, which added to the challenge in the absence of adequate legislative framework.“Some key features of the Act revolve around conflict resolution, security deposit, vacating premises, increase in rent and tenancy agreement.

The top court, which had taken suo motu cognisance of Covid management, had issued a series of directions on May 31, but the order was released on Wednesday.Seeking complete data on the government’s purchase history of all vaccines — Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik V — till date, it ordered the Centre to file an affidavit in two weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on June 30.It sought data on the percentage of population vaccinated (with one and both doses), as against eligible persons in the first three phases.The Centre had submitted that the current policy enabled states/UTs and private hospitals to procure 50 per cent of the monthly CDL approved doses at a prefixed price and that it would spur competition which would attract more manufacturers and eventually prices would come down.Finding fault with the policy, the top court said, “Prima facie, the only room for negotiation with the two vaccine manufacturers was on price and quantity, both of which have been prefixed by the Centre. This casts serious doubts on government’s justification for enabling higher prices as a competitive measure.”594 docs died in second wave, says IMAAs many as 594 doctors have died due to Covid in the ongoing second wave with Delhi recording maximum 107 fatalities, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said.

It also directed all states and union territories to spell out their respective stand on providing free vaccination.It sought data on the percentage of population vaccinated (with one, and both doses), as against eligible persons in the first three phases of the vaccination drive, including rural-urban vaccination figures and an outline as to how and when the government wanted to vaccinate the remaining population in phases 1, 2 and 3.The Centre had submitted that the current Liberalised Vaccination Policy enabled State/UT Governments and private hospitals to procure 50% of the monthly CDL approved doses in the country at a pre-fixed price and that it would spur competition which would attract more private manufacturers that could eventually drive down prices.However, finding fault with the policy, the top court said, “Prima facie, the only room for negotiation with the two vaccine manufacturers was on price and quantity, both of which have been pre-fixed by the Central Government. This casts serious doubts on UoI’s justification for enabling higher prices as a competitive measure.“Furthermore, the Central Government justifying its lower prices on account of its ability to place large purchase orders for vaccines, raises the issue as to why this rationale is not being employed for acquiring 100% of the monthly CDL (Central Drugs Laboratory) doses,” it said.The Centre had on Monday asserted that the entire eligible population would be vaccinated by the end of 2021 even as the Supreme Court sought clarifications of vaccine procurement by states, pricing and the need for mandatory registration on the CoWIN app for people to get vaccinated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-vaccination-policy-prima-facie-arbitrary-and-irrational-sc-262334
03-06-2021||New Delhi||DCGI waiver likely to bring foreign vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has done away with specific trials of Covid vaccines that have been approved by other international regulatory bodies - a big move likely to clear the way for foreign vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna for the country's urgent requirement.In a letter, DCGI Chief VG Somani letter said that this will be applicable for vaccines that have already been approved for restricted use by the US FDA, EMA, UK MHRA, PMDA Japan or listed for Emergency Use by the World Health Organisation.“In light of the huge vaccination requirements and the need for increased availability of imported vaccines,... it has been decided that for approval of Covid Vaccines in India for restricted use in emergency situation which are already approved for restricted use by US FDA, EMA, UK MHRA, PMDA Japan or which are listed in WHO Emergency Use listing," he said.Somani added that for the vaccines that are well established from the standpoint that millions have already been vaccinated with the said vaccines, the requirement for conduction post-approval bridging clinical trials and the requirement of testing of every batch of the vaccine by the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL), Kasauli, can be exempted, if the vaccine batch/lot has been certified and released by the National Control Laboratory of the Country of Origin.Earlier, vaccines that had completed clinical studies outside the country were required to carry out "bridging trials" or limited clinical trials on the Indian population to know how the drug works on people of Indian origin."The scrutiny and review of their Summary Lot Protocol and Certificate of the analysis of Batch/Lot Shall be undertaken by CDL Kasauli for batch release as per standard procedures and the requirement of assessment of the first 100 beneficiaries for 7 days for safety outcomes before the vaccine is rolled out further immunisation programmes, along with other procedures for filing of applications and timeline for processing of the applications, etc, as laid down in the notice dated 15.04.21 shall remain the same."

Govt to ramp up health infra for children||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 1Amid fears that the potential third wave of Covid-19 might impact children more, India is in the process of adopting fresh guidelines on pediatric Covid disease with a group of experts telling the government to prepare for the worst and ramp up hospital infrastructure for children.VK Paul, Member, Health, NITI Aayog, today said though there was no evidence of serious Covid disease in children, the impact could increase if the virus changed its behaviour.“Our focus on pediatric Covid disease is gaining attention.
