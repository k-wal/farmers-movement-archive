14-06-2021||New Delhi||‘A year after Galwan clashes, India better prepared to deal with any eventualities’||A year after the deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese armies in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, India is better prepared to deal with any eventualities along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as the trust deficit between the two sides persists, people in the defence establishment said on Monday.They said the Galwan Valley episode helped Indian security planners crystalise the country’s approach towards China as well as recalibrate the short-term and long-term goals considering the possible security threats.In the first deadly clash in the border area in nearly five decades, 20 Indian soldiers were killed on June 15 last year in the Galwan Valley, triggering a large deployment of troops and heavy weaponry by both armies at the friction points.In February, China officially acknowledged that five Chinese military officers and soldiers were killed in the clashes with the Indian Army though it is widely believed that the death toll was higher.“We are much better prepared militarily. The Galwan Valley clashes helped us prioritise our national security approach towards the northern border,” said one of the persons cited above.It is learnt that the Chinese military has also enhanced its positions in several depth areas in the high-altitude region.The people said the clashes also helped in hastening the “jointness” among the three services and cited the example of a united approach by the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force in dealing with the overall challenge along the LAC.“The clashes brought out a high degree of synergy between the Indian Army and the IAF,” said another person.The people cited above said the “trust deficit” between the two sides still persists and India is fully ready to deal with any situation in eastern Ladakh and other sectors along the LAC.The ties between the two countries came under severe strain following the Galwan Valley clashes that took place over a month after the border standoff began between the Indian and Chinese militaries in multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh.Days after the incident, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar bluntly told his Chinese counterpart that the “unprecedented development will have a serious impact on the bilateral relationship.”India held the neighbouring country accountable for triggering the Ladakh standoff by violating rules of engagement on border management and conveyed that peace and tranquillity along the LAC is the basis for the progress of the rest of the relationship and they cannot be separated.Months later, Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi agreed on a five-point pact to resolve the row at a meeting in Moscow on September 10.The two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.They are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach on it at the 11th round of military talks.Last month, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane said there can be no de-escalation without complete disengagement at all friction points in eastern Ladakh and that the Indian Army is prepared for all contingencies in the region.Gen Naravane also said that India is dealing with China in a “firm” and “non-escalatory” manner to ensure the sanctity of its claims in eastern Ladakh, and that it was even open to initiating confidence-building measures.India has been insisting on complete disengagement in remaining friction points to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ladakh.

14-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre’s notification seeking application from Non-Muslim refugees not related to CAA: MHA to SC||The Centre Monday told the Supreme Court that its notification inviting non-Muslims residing in 13 districts in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Punjab to apply for Indian citizenship does not relate to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) and is a “mere delegation of power vested with the Central Government to local authorities”.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said that similar delegation of power has been permitted by Central Government in 2004, 2005, 206, 2016, and 2018 also and no relaxation whatsoever has been made in respect of the eligibility criteria between different foreign nationals which are laid down in the Citizenship Act, 1955 and rules made thereunder.                               “It is submitted that the notification dated May 28, 2021, does not relate to the CAA which has been inserted into the Act as section 6B,” the MHA said in affidavit and added that it seeks to merely delegate the power of the Central Government to the local authorities in particular cases.The affidavit said it is “about extending the delegation of power to grant citizenship to collectors of more districts and Home Secretaries of more Sates”.“The said notification does not provide for any relaxations to the foreigners and applies only to foreigners who have entered the country legally as the Central Government used its authority under Section 16 of the Citizenship Act and delegated its powers to grant citizenship by Registration or Naturalisation to District Collectors,” the MHA said.The affidavit filed in response to a plea filed by Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) said that the notification is merely an administrative delegation of power without any specific classification or relaxation.The MHA submitted that the notification dated May 28, 2021 is merely a process of decentralisation of decision making aimed at speedy disposal of the citizenship applications of such foreigners as the decision will now be taken at the District or State level itself after examining each case.“It is submitted that no relaxation whatsoever has been made in respect of the eligibility criteria between different foreign nationals which are laid down in the Citizenship Act, 1955 and rules made thereunder. Hence, the question of violation of Article 14 in making the certain classification does not arise,” it said.          It further submitted the existing law and procedure for acquiring citizenship of India is in no way sought to be amended through the impugned notification.“ It is submitted that any foreigner of any faith can apply for citizenship of India at any time. The Central Government shall decide that application as per law and rules.“It is submitted that the delegation of power vide notification dated May 28, 2021 is in respect of those foreign applicants who fulfil the eligibility criteria and who are in possession of valid documents like passports and Indian visa,” the affidavit said adding that similar notifications has been issued earlier also.“The present notification is similar to above notifications which have been already brought out by this Ministry in the counter affidavit which is available with the petitioner since March 2020,” it said.The IUML had on June 1 moved the top court challenging the Centre”s notification inviting non-Muslims belonging to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan and residing in 13 districts in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Punjab to apply for Indian citizenship.The application argued that the Centre is trying to circumvent the assurance given to the apex court in this regard in the pending petition filed by the IUML challenging the constitutional validity of the provisions of the CAA.It said that the Centre provided assurance that staying of the Amendment Act was not necessary since the rules of the Amendment Act had not been framed.The CAA grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities – Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian – who migrated to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014, following persecution over their faith.The plea said the Union home ministry ssued a notification to this effect for immediate implementation of the order under the Citizenship Act 1955 and Rules framed under the law in 2009 even though the rules under the CAA enacted in 2019 are yet to be framed by the MHA is manifestly illegal and runs counter to the provisions of the Act.IUML in its plea said that the Centre had during the course of the hearing of its plea challenging the constitutional validity of CAA submitted before the apex court and provided assurance that staying of the Amendment Act was not necessary since the rules of the Amendment Act had not been framed.“However, the respondent Union, in a roundabout way, and in an attempt to circumvent the assurance given to this court, have sought to implement their malafide designs envisaged under the Amendment Act through the recently issued order dated May 28,” the plea said.IUML submitted that if the Centre’s notification is implemented and citizenship is given to persons on the basis of their religion, and, thereafter, if this court strikes down the Amendment Act and Rules, whereby the act of providing citizenship on the basis of religion is declared void, “Then, to pursuant to the present order, will be a herculean task and would be near impossible to implement. In the event the said exercise is conducted, it would render the entire batch of writ petitions (challenging CAA) as infructuous,” the plea said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-notification-seeking-application-from-non-muslim-refugees-not-related-to-caa-mha-to-sc-268412

He also referred to claims that more death certificates were being issued during the second wave compared to the first.The AIMIM president alleged that the government has not done proper preparation for the second wave and that it delayed orders for vaccination. These failures have led to a large number of deaths, he claimed.BJP is not ready to accept the reality to hide its failures, he alleged.Separately, referring to media reports about Muslim men allegedly being attacked, he tweeted: “In Hindutva ideology bravery is always attacking frail elderly men or little teenagers. And always as a mob (never alone).” “https://twitter.com/India_NHRC” \n@India_NHRC will you react? These men are from same ideology. Muslims right to dignity is being snatched by Hindutvadi goons,” Owaisi alleged. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-covid-19-deaths-than-what-modi-govt-acknowledges-owaisi-268404

Family members, however, insisted that his body was warm and his pulse still beating.Zaitinkhuma, the secretary of Lalpa Kohhran thar, said Zion-a regained pulse beat after he was brought home from the hospital."His (Zion-a) body is still warm. His family members and people of Chhuanthar in Baktawng village can't bury him under such circumstances," he said.According to Chhuanthar village council president Ramzuava, over 2,500 members belonging to 433 families form part of the sect, which was founded by the Zion-a's uncle around 70 years ago. Most members of the sect practise carpentry for a living."All of them hold the septuagenarian in high regard, and would not want to perform his last rites until they are convinced that he is gone," Ramzuava added.Chief Minister Zoramthanga had extended his condolences on Sunday, upon hearing about the septuagenarian's death, and tweeted, "With heavy heart, Mizoram bid farewell to Mr Zion-a (76), believed to head the world's largest family...Rest in Peace Sir."State congress president Lal Thanhawla and Zoram Peoples Movement (ZPM) leader Lalduhoma among others also mourned his demise.Zion-a's four-storey mansion at Baktawng is a major tourist attraction. His family was featured twice by 'Ripley's Believe it or not' in 2011 and 2013. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kin-claim-head-of-worlds-largest-family-still-alive-refuse-to-perform-last-rites-268403

14-06-2021||New Delhi||Assam students move SC, seek cancellation of Class X, XII board exams of state boards due to Covid||A fresh plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking direction to the Assam government and state examination boards for the cancellation of Class X and XII exams due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation.The plea, seeking to intervene as parties in a pending PIL on the issue of cancellation of 12th Board examinations of CBSE and CISCE, has been filed by some students of Assam state boards and they seek similar relief on the ground of the prevailing pandemic situation.A bench headed by Justice A KM Khanwilkar, on June 3, had expressed satisfaction over the development that the central government cancelled the class 12 board exams.The top court had directed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) to place on record the well-defined objective criteria for assessment of students in two weeks.Four Assam-based students have moved the intervention plea in the top court through advocates including Abhishek Choudhary and Manju Jetley and said that the state government, which earlier postponed the board exams due to the Covid situation, is now saying that it may conduct these tests in physical mode in July and August.The plea has referred to the statement of ministers and the chief minister that it has been indicated that the postponed Board exams may be held between July 15 and 20 for two to three papers if Covid positivity rate by July 1 comes down to below 2 per cent.“It is humbly submitted that the …statements made by the Chief Minister of Assam has created a situation of havoc and panic among the students and therefore, almost all the students, their parents and family members have been pushed into a state of dilemma and their mental condition has been devastated.“Thus, the present applicant is before this Court seeking immediate intervention in the matter in the interest of safety, health (both physical and mental) and well being of all the students, their parents and family members,” the plea said.The positivity rate in Assam in July would have no relevance in mid-July-August, when the examinations are proposed to be conducted and moreover, the positivity rate data is very dynamic in nature which has the potential to increase or decrease exponentially within a short span, the plea said.The classification sought to be made in the present case between the students of central examination boards and the students of Assam board students is “prima facie irrational, unreasonable” and is violative of right to equality, the plea said.The plea has made Assam, its Department of Secondary Education and its two boards—Assam Higher Secondary Education Council (AHSEC) and Board of Secondary Education, Assam (SEBA) as parties.The Assam boards had postponed the board examinations by issuing notifications on May 4 citing the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation as the reason.The students referred to the decisions to cancel the board examinations by the central boards and various state boards as grounds for seeking the same relief.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-students-move-sc-seek-cancellation-of-class-x-xii-board-exams-of-state-boards-due-to-covid-268399
14-06-2021||---||PM Modi for global unity to tackle land degradation||New Delhi, June 14Terming land as the fundamental building block for supporting all lives and livelihoods, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for reduction of the tremendous pressure on land and its resources.“Clearly, a lot of work lies ahead of us. But we can do it. We can do it together,” the Prime Minister said while addressing the UN “High-Level Dialogue on Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought” on Monday.The Prime Minister listed steps taken by India to deal with the land degradation issue. The Delhi Declaration of 2019 called for better access and stewardship over land, and emphasised gender-sensitive transformative projects. In India, over the last 10 years, around 3 million hectares of forest cover has been added. This has enhanced the combined forest cover to almost one-fourths of the country’s total area, the PM informed.India is on track to achieve its national commitment of Land degradation neutrality, he said. “We are also working towards restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. This would contribute to India’s commitment to achieve an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent,” said the PM.The Prime Minister gave the example of the Banni region in Rann of Kutch in Gujarat to illustrate how restoration of land can start a virtuous cycle. In Banni region, land restoration by developing grasslands helped achieve land degradation neutrality.  It today supports pastoral activities and livelihood by promoting animal husbandry.In the spirit of South-South cooperation, India is assisting fellow developing countries to develop land restoration strategies. A Centre of Excellence is being set up in India to promote a scientific approach towards land degradation issues. “It is mankind’s collective responsibility to reverse the damage to land caused by human activity. It is our sacred duty to leave a healthy planet for our future generations,” the Prime Minister concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-for-global-unity-to-tackle-land-degradation-268398

The order was delivered on Monday.The HC, in separate orders, said, “If we see the face value of the FIR, no offence under Sections 504, 505(1)(b) and 505(1)(c) of IPC is made out as the averments of the FIR reflect that by the tweet of the petitioner, Congress men are aggravated which clearly indicates that no public peace or tranquillity is being adversely affected and it is purely political rivalry between two political parties.”“This, prima facie, establishes that present FIR has been registered with political motives,” the orders said, adding that “considering the facts of the case and from perusal of FIR, prima facie, no case is made out against the petitioner and criminal proceedings is manifestly attended against the petitioner with malafides or with political grudge”.The HC said considering the facts and circumstances of the case, “continuation of investigation on basis of FIR will be nothing but an abuse of process of law”.The HC said further investigation on the FIR shall remain stayed till the next hearing.

In 2020, the pandemic situation started. We have begun the process now”.                      The notice read: “This kind of activity dangerous in nature and falls under Item Category of the Statute 25 of the Statutes of the University which states—All acts of violence and all forms of coercion such as gheraos, sit-ins or any variation of the same which disrupts the normal academic and administrative functioning of the university and or any act which incites or leads to violence”.Calling her protest “an act of indiscipline and misconduct”, the notice sought an explanation on “why disciplinary action should not be initiated” against her.Ghosh has been given time till June 21 to reply to the notice, “failing which it will be presumed that you have nothing to say in your defense and this office will be free to take appropriate action against you”, it said.In a Facebook post, the Jawaharlal Nehru University Student’ Union president said: “In JNU, several administrative office are not functioning citing pandemic situation, scholarships are not getting disbursed, hostel allotment for first years are not happening, water crisis is going on in the campus, vaccination for students are not happening”. “But the chief proctor’s office has been regularly functioning to intimidate and punish students.”Questioning the priority of the varsity administration, she said, “While thousands of students in our campus are suffering, a huge section everyday is being pushed out of university due to discrimination. The JNU administration is in glee to further fulfil its anti-student policies”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jnu-issues-show-cause-notice-to-aishe-ghosh-another-student-for-2018-protest-268392
14-06-2021||New Delhi||’84 riots case life convict seeks sentence suspension on medical grounds||The Delhi High Court on Monday called for a status report from the police regarding the health of a life convict in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case who has sought interim suspension of sentence for 90 days on medical grounds.A bench of Justices Navin Chawla and Asha Menon directed the police to file the fresh status report regarding the medical condition of convict Naresh Sehrawat before the next date of hearing on July 5.Advocate Dharam Raj Ohlan, representing Sehrawat, told the court that he was seeking interim suspension of sentence or parole of 90 days in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the High Powered Committee (HPC) set up for decongesting jails to prevent spread of Covid-19 among prisoners.Ohlan contended that his client was suffering from stage 4 kidney and liver ailments for which transplants were the only option and till he gets a transplant he has to be on a special diet which would not be possible while in prison.The lawyer also told the bench that in view of Sehrawat’s medical condition he was susceptible to Covid-19 infection.Opposing the plea, senior advocate R S Cheema, representing the Special Investigation Team (SIT), told the bench that Sehrawat has already received two doses of Covid vaccine and he was being well looked after.To this, Ohlan said vaccination was not a 100 per cent guarantee or protection against Covid-19 infection.Cheema also told the court that the convict was being provided all the requisite medical treatment and there was no emergency right now for grant of any relief to him.An SIT was earlier set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs to reinvestigate the riot cases.The trial court had awarded death penalty to convict Yashpal Singh and life term to Naresh Sehrawat in the case relating to the killing of two men in New Delhi during the 1984 riots—the first convictions in the cases reopened by the SIT.Sherawat has also appealed against his conviction and the sentence before the high court which is pending.The death reference as well as appeal of Singh against the capital punishment awarded to him is also pending in the high court.

These are modular hospitals, we call it flying hospitals, and these have been made in a way that the virus does not go out of hospitals,” he said.“If there is any third wave, all the hospitals will be taking the load, and the government is discussing these aspects with various stakeholders,” Reddy said.During the peak of the second wave of coronavirus in April and May, India reported a severe medical oxygen supply crisis with hospitals in several parts of the country running short of gas due to heightened demand.“A total of 850 oxygen plants are being set up in various districts of the country from PM Cares Fund for catering to the needs of the country to fight the pandemic Covid-19,” said Reddy, according to the DST statement.He also underlined how the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) is primarily carrying out research in advanced technology in defence, while also concentrating on developing low cost but high-quality technology for the benefit of people.DST Secretary Ashutosh Sharma talked about various steps taken by the Centre and the DST to fight the coronavirus pandemic and how to keep vaccines safe and to ensure they reach every nook and corner of the country.He also spoke about ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) could play a greater role in fighting the pandemic.“Technologies have been developed for storing and transporting vaccines to every nook and corner of the country. New ways of storing vaccines have been developed as per the Indian conditions. “Convergence of technologies is the future, and AI can play a great role in diagnostics, telemedicine and will have tremendous importance in remote monitoring, diagnostics and decision-making in fighting pandemic,” Sharma said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/850-oxygen-plants-being-set-up-in-various-districts-from-pm-cares-drdo-chief-268372

14-06-2021||New Delhi||Controversy on purchase of land for Ram temple snowballs||The controversy regarding the purchase of additional land allegedly at an inflated rate in Ayodhya regarding construction of precinct of Ram Temple snowballed on Monday with Opposition parties stepping up their charge of corruption, while the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust and the BJP hitting back.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took a jibe, saying that donations by devotees were misused, which was a sin.“Crores of people made their offerings at the feet of God stemming from their faith and devotion. Misuse of those donations is ‘adharma’, a sin, and denigration of their faith,” Gandhi said in a crisp tweet in Hindi.Trust’s general secretary Champat Rai debunked the insinuations of corruption in purchase of the piece of land.“A few people are running propaganda regarding the purchase of the  land by the Trust is misleading,” Rai said, and added that the people who are indulging in it are political persons.“They are doing so with the motivation of political grudge to mislead people.”He said the prices of land in Ayodhya have shot up after Supreme Court allowed construction of the temple. People from all over the country have started purchasing land.The Uttar Pradesh government is also making large scale purchase of land for development of Ayodhya in view of the proposed temple.“The Trust is also purchasing land from open market with regard to the temple,” Rai said.Samajwadi Party leaders of Uttar Pradesh and AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh had alleged that the land which was worth rupees two crore was purchased by Trust at Rs 18.5 crore. The BJP has hit back cautioning the Opposition parties to desist from politicking.Its Uttar Pradesh leaders taunted the Opposition leaders, saying they were the same people who opposed construction of the temple and questioned the veracity and sanctity of the birthplace of Lord Ram.Former national convenor of Bajrang Dal Prakash Sharma hit out at Sanjay Singh, saying his party has the old habit of making sensational allegations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/controversy-on-purchase-of-land-for-ram-temple-snowballs-268366
14-06-2021||London||Rishi Sunak drawn into in-law Narayana Murthy, Amazon tax dispute||Cloudtail India Pvt Ltd—the online retailing joint venture of Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy’s firm and Amazon.com—faced a 5.5 million pounds demand, including interest and penalties, from tax authorities after it paid “meagre” taxes over the past four years, a media report said on Monday.Amazon reportedly developed independent sellers such as Cloudtail, as ‘special merchant’ which enjoyed over 35 per cent of total sales on the platform until 2019.While Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures indirectly holds 76 per cent in Cloudtail and Amazon the remaining 24 per cent, the firm’s two top posts - chief executive and finance director - were with the US retailer. Cloudtail’s holding company, Prione is also run by a former Amazon manager, the report in ‘The Guardian’ newspaper said.It said it is not known precisely what the tax dispute is about and the company said it was contesting the bill, adding that since the “matter is sub judice, we are unable to comment any further”.Following the report, the office of UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who is son-in-law of Murthy, was forced to comment.The revelations come just days after Sunak led the G7 finance ministers’ charge to agree to a global deal designed to make tech companies pay more tax.“Reaching an international agreement on how large digital companies are taxed has been a priority for the chancellor since he took office,” said a spokesperson for his UK Treasury office.“The Chancellor’s consistent position has been that it matters where tax is paid, and any agreement must ensure digital businesses pay tax in the UK that reflects their economic activities. That is what our taxpayers would expect and is the right thing,” the spokesperson said.Sunak has been dubbed the UK’s richest minister, largely as a result of his wife Akshata Murty’s family wealth. The latest ‘Guardian’ report claims that an analysis of Cloudtail’s accounts and activities shows that it is one of the largest sellers on Amazon.in, as part of a 76-24 per cent joint venture with Amazon.“The company has received a show cause notice in the current year from Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence amounting to INR 5,455 lakhs [£5.5m] along with interest and penalties for service tax-related matters,” it quotes Cloudtail’s most recent accounts as saying.It claims that the annual report further reveals that Cloudtail – which only sells via the Amazon platform – paid Amazon fees of 95 million pounds last year, almost 10 times more than the Indian business reported in profit.According to its analysis, Murthy created the venture capital firm Catamaran, a trustee of the Hober Mallow Trust, which ultimately owns the stake in Cloudtail and whose beneficiaries are the Murthy family.“The whole structure raises questions if Cloudtail is really an asset of Amazon – and if the Murthys are the name lenders. The exact detail of the deal will only be known if the investigation agencies seek details of their shareholder agreements,” Rashmi Das, an author specialising in Indian e-commerce, is quoted as saying by the newspaper.The questions around the control of Cloudtail also recently prompted the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) to ask the Indian minister of commerce, Piyush Goyal, in February to investigate the joint venture to discover why its key personnel have typically joined from Amazon.In a letter to Goyal, found on CAIT’s Twitter account, it notes: “Even though Murthy holds the majority of shares, he has allowed the (so-called) former employees of Amazon on the driver’s seat of both Cloudtail and Prione… The role of Murthy requires appropriate investigation.”Amazon maintains that it is operating in full compliance with local laws. However, last week the Indian competition commission got the go-ahead to relaunch an investigation into Amazon’s selling practices in India.After a court ruling, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) will examine complaints by a traders’ group that small sellers are being driven out of business because the big US platforms are giving preferential treatment to “preferred sellers”.A spokesperson for Prione – Cloudtail’s holding company, Catamaran and the Murthys told the ‘Guardian’: “Cloudtail has not violated any law and is in full compliance with the law of the land in letter and in spirit. The Murthy family has put in the required equity capital in Prione [parent company of Cloudtail], commensurate with its shareholding. The allegations are baseless and incorrect.“Cloudtail is an independent company that makes business decisions to protect its interests. Cloudtail is governed by a board of directors. Catamaran has [a] majority of the directors and therefore controls the board. The members on the board from Catamaran are high-quality professionals with extensive business experience. The details of the decisions and deliberations of the board of Cloudtail are minuted and available for inspection by the relevant Indian authorities.” A spokesperson for Amazon said: “Amazon in India has always been fully compliant with all Indian laws.“Specifically, our joint venture with Catamaran, as well as our marketplace operations, are in compliance with Indian [foreign direct investment] laws, and that includes Cloudtail as a seller.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rishi-sunak-drawn-into-in-law-narayana-murthy-amazon-tax-dispute-268362
14-06-2021||New Delhi||Ayodhya land deal: Sisodia alleges ‘scam’ by Ram temple trust||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia on Monday sought a clarification from the Ram temple trust over the purchase of a piece of land for the proposed shrine in Ayodhya by it at an alleged inflated price.Terming it a “scam”, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said the temple is being built using donations made by people and their hard-earned money should not be misused.His remarks came a day after AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh alleged that Champat Rai, general secretary of Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, purchased 1.208 hectares of land worth Rs 2 crore in Ayodhya’s Bag Bjaisi village for Rs 18.5 crore with the help of trust member Anil Mishra.Terming it a case of money laundering, Singh and Samajwadi Party leader Pawan Pandey sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate into the matter.Addressing a press conference here, Sisodia urged the trust to not play with people’s sentiments.“The Ram Janmabhoomi Trust has purchased a piece of land in Ayodhya for Rs 18.5 crore. It was sold for just Rs 2 crore five minutes before it was bought by the Ram temple trust. There has been a scam in purchasing this land for the pious work of building the Ram temple. The Ram Janmabhoomi Trust must clarify why the land was bought at such a high price,” he said.“The temple is being built using donations made by people and their sentiments are attached to it. My request to them (Ram temple trust) is only that they should not play with the sentiments of the people who donated their hard-earned money for the temple,” he said.Singh, who was also present at the press conference, claimed Anil Mishra, trustee of the Ram temple trust, and Rishikesh Upadhyay, mayor of Ayodhya, were present during the finalisation of both the sale agreements.Trust general secretary Rai has strongly refuted the allegations.In a statement issued on Sunday, Rai had said, “Allegations of assassinating Mahatma Gandhi were also levelled against us. We do not fear allegations. I will study the allegations levelled against us and probe them.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ayodhya-land-deal-sisodia-alleges-scam-by-ram-temple-trust-268361

The BJP government in this case should constitute a high-level probe, and tell the family members and the public that despite the apprehension of murder by the liquor mafia expressed by the reporter, why he was not provided security," SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi.Srivastava had recently run a news story against the liquor mafia in the region.

14-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC sets aside bail granted by trial court to Shivinder Singh in EOW case||The Delhi High Court on Monday set aside an order granting bail to former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh in a case of allegedly misappropriating funds of Religare Finvest Ltd, saying his detention was necessary to unearth the “conspiracy hatched by him” and trace the siphoned off money.The decision by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait came on the plea of RFL challenging the March 3 order of the trial court granting bail to Shivinder in the case registered against him by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust.Allowing RFL’s plea, the high court said that in the present case, the “nature and gravity of the accusation against respondent No.2 (Shivinder) is serious”.“The grant of bail in a case involving cheating, criminal breach of interest by an agent of such a large magnitude of money, affecting a very large number of people would also have an adverse impact not only on the progress of the case but also on the trust of the criminal justice system that people repose.“Keeping in mind the factual matrix of the present case as also the pertinent observations of the Supreme Court in various decisions, I have no hesitation to hold that the impugned order suffers from serious infirmities, resulting in miscarriage of justice.“Moreover, continued detention of respondent No.2 in this FIR case is necessary not only to unearth the conspiracy hatched by him, but also to derive out/ trace the siphoned money which he has credited for his personal benefit,” Justice Kait said in the 29 page judgement setting aside the bail granted to Shivinder by the trial court.The EOW of Delhi Police registered an FIR in March 2019 after it received a complaint from RFL’s Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, former CMD of Religare Enterprises Limited (REL) Sunil Godhwani and former CEO of RFL Kavi Arora and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies.According to the prosecution, RFL’s authorised representative Manpreet Suri alleged that these accused put RFL in poor financial condition by disbursing loans to entities having no financial standings and willfully defaulted in repayments thereby caused wrongful loss to RFL to the tune of Rs 2,397 crore.

14-06-2021||Ahmedabad||AAP to contest all seats in Gujarat in 2022 Assembly polls: Kejriwal||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will contest all seats in Gujarat in the 2022 Assembly polls, the party’s national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said here on Monday as he visited a Vaishnavite temple in the city and blamed the ruling BJP and opposition Congress for the “plight” of people but avoided a direct attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on their home turf.Addressing a press conference on the campus of the Vallabh Sadan temple after taking darshan of the deity, Kejriwal, who was on a one-day visit to the city, said his party was a credible alternative to the BJP and the Congress in Gujarat who he said had a tacit alliance between them.“The AAP will contest each and every seat in the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections. The AAP is a credible alternative to the BJP and Congress. Gujarat will change soon,” he said.The Gujarat House has 182 seats.“Gujarat is suffering because of this friendship and alliance between the BJP and the Congress. The BJP ruled this state for the last 27 years. I heard people saying that Congress is in the pocket of the BJP. Both the BJP and Congress are the same. This must stop,” he said.Kejriwal said the Congress and the BJP have been in power for most of the period after Independence but “people are witness to what they have done. Farmers are committing suicide even after 75 years”.During the press conference, the former head of a Gujarati news channel, Isudan Gadhvi, joined the AAP in the presence of Kejriwal.Blaming the BJP and the Congress for the “current situation” of Gujarat, Kejriwal said the common people were left to fend for themselves during the coronavirus pandemic.Irrespective of tall claims, farmers in Gujarat are committing suicide, government-run schools and hospitals are in shambles and traders are living under fear, he alleged.“People want to know why the electricity costs are so high in Gujarat when it’s free in Delhi? If government-run schools and hospitals are top-class in Delhi then why are they in a bad shape here? Now, the time has come to change Gujarat,” the AAP leader said.When asked if he was proposing to implement the “Delhi model” in Gujarat, Kejriwal said the model of development will be decided by the six crore people of Gujarat.Queried about his strategy to take on PM Modi and Amit Shah on their home turf of Gujarat, Kejriwal said the AAP will fight for the people of Gujarat and bring a change “instead of fighting against any party or an individual”.After the presser, Kejriwal formally inaugurated the AAP’s office also located on Ashram Road.Monday’s is the second visit of Kejriwal to Gujarat. He had last visited Surat in February after his party emerged as the main opposition after the civic body elections in its maiden fight.The AAP had made inroads into Gujarat politics recently by winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) where it is the main opposition party.The Kejriwal-led party had fielded candidates across all the local bodies- municipal corporations, municipalities, and district and taluka panchayats—which went to polls earlier this year and won several seats.

Misuse of those donations is unrighteous and is a sin and an insult to their faith," she said in a tweet in Hindi.The Congress on Sunday alleged that scams are happening by taking donations in the name of Lord Ram after two opposition leaders accused Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary Champat Rai of buying a piece of land at an inflated price for the Ram temple premises.The allegation that the land worth Rs 2 crore was brought at an inflated price of Rs 18.5 crore was made by AAP's Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh and a former minister in the Samajwadi Party government, Pawan Pandey.करोड़ों लोगों ने आस्था और भक्ति के चलते भगवान के चरणों में चढ़ावा चढ़ाया। उस चंदे का दुरुपयोग अधर्म है, पाप है, उनकी आस्था का अपमान है।  The allegation was strongly refuted by Rai.Tagging a tweet on Rai refuting the allegation, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had said on Sunday, "Lord Ram, what kind of days are these? Scams are happening by taking donations in your name. Shameless robbers are intoxicated with arrogance like Ravana and are selling faith." "The question is how the land bought for Rs 2 crore was sold after 10 minutes to 'Ram Janmabhoomi' for Rs 18.50 crores?" he asked."Now it seems… Kans are ruling, Ravana is everywhere!" Surjewala had said in a tweet in Hindi.Terming it a case of money laundering, Singh and Pandey had sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.

We urge the government to earmark at least 10 per cent of the adult Covid ICU beds for children, 20 per cent in Covid wards, with sufficient isolation rooms so that healthy parents can stay with their children as needed,” said the commission based on recommendations of top experts from India.It has suggested cautious reopening of schools saying the reopening should be dependent on the transmission rates in the local community and compliance to the mitigation measures, especially in older children.Mortality rate low in below-10 age groupMost patients asymptomaticAs of early June 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has caused 175 million cases and 3.7 million deaths across 220 countries.

14-06-2021||New Delhi||India natural ally of G7: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that India is a natural ally for the G7 countries in defending the shared values from a host of threats stemming from authoritarianism, terrorism and violent extremism, disinformation and economic coercion.In a virtual address at a session on ‘open societies and open economies’ at the G7 summit, the prime minister highlighted India’s civilisational commitment to democracy, freedom of thought and liberty, according to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).Modi also highlighted the revolutionary impact of digital technologies on social inclusion and empowerment in India through application such as Aadhaar, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar- Mobile) trinity.In his remarks, the prime minister underscored the vulnerabilities inherent in open societies and called on tech companies and social media platforms to ensure a safe cyber environment for their users, additional secretary (economic relations) in the MEA P Harish said at a press conference.“The prime minister’s views were appreciated by other leaders in the gathering,” he said.Harish said the G7 leaders underlined their commitment to a free, open and a rules-based Indo-Pacific and resolved to collaborate with partners in the region.India’s participation at the G7 sessions reflected understanding within the bloc that resolution to “the biggest global crisis of our time” is not possible without India’s involvement and support, he said, in a reference to the coronavirus pandemic.He said India will remain deeply engaged with the G7 and guest partners on all major issues, including health governance, access to vaccines and climate action.The senior MEA official also said that there was widespread support at the G7 deliberations for text-based negotiations on a proposal by India and South Africa for patent waiver on Covid vaccines.The Group of Seven (G7) comprises the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.As chair of G7, the UK invited India, Australia, South Korea, South Africa to the summit as guest countries.The leaders of the world’s advanced economies held a summit in Cornwall in the UK from June 11-13. It is for the first time the leaders of the grouping met in person since the coronavirus pandemic began. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-natural-ally-of-g7-pm-modi-267915
14-06-2021||New Delhi||Cong needs reforms to show it’s no longer in inertia: Kapil Sibal||The Congress must bring widespread reforms across all levels of the organisation to show it is no longer in a state of inertia and to present itself as a viable political alternative to the BJP, party veteran Kapil Sibal said on Sunday.Sibal, who was among the G-23 leaders whose letter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi last year demanding a meaningful overhaul of the party had triggered a storm, hoped the organisational polls, recently postponed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, will “happen sooner than later”.In an exclusive interview to PTI, the former union minister acknowledged that at present there is no strong political alternative to the BJP but said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lost the moral authority to rule and the Congress can present an alternative due to the current mood in the country.Amid defections of young leaders – Jyotiraditya Scindia and now Jitin Prasada – to the BJP, the former minister says 'there is an urgent need to strike a balance between experience and youth'He also noted that while forming committees to review election losses is good, it will have no impact unless remedies suggested are implemented.Noting that the party’s alliances with the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam and Indian Secular Front (ISF) in West Bengal were “not thought through”, Sibal said the Congress has failed to drive home the point that minority and majority communalism are equally dangerous for the country.He cited this as one of the reasons for the poor performance of the party in recent assembly polls.Amid defections of young leaders – Jyotiraditya Scindia and now Jitin Prasada – to the BJP, the former minister said “there is an urgent need to strike a balance between experience and youth.”He has earlier said from “aaya ram, gaya ram politics”, it has come to “prasada politics now” and asked whether Jitin will get the ‘prasada’ from the BJP, suggesting that leaders were moving out of the party to serve their political interests.“At present, there is definitely a void in terms of a strong political alternative. It is exactly in this context, that I had given suggestions for some reforms in my party so that the country has a strong and credible opposition.“But what comes out of it is not something for me to foretell. But I am sure, a time will come when the people of this country will decide what is good for them,” Sibal told PTI.The veteran added that India needs a resurgent Congress and the party needs to rope in the right people to drive its poll strategy so that it can build upon the failures of the government.“Victory of non-BJP parties in recent assembly elections has shown the chinks in the BJP’s armour in terms of its vulnerability to losing when faced with a stronger opposition,” he said.“India needs a resurgent Congress. But for that, the party needs to show that it is active, present, aware and is in the mood to engage meaningfully.“For this to happen, we will need to have widespread reforms at the organisational hierarchy both at the central and state levels to show that the party is still a force to reckon with and is no longer in a state of inertia,” he said.Exuding hope in the grand old party’s resurgence at a time of newly emerging political equations across India, Sibal said that despite a poor showing of the Congress electorally, the current mood in the country provides an opportunity for it to emerge as a viable alternative, owing to the party’s pan-India presence.“The Modi government’s inept handling of the pandemic and the resultant anguish among people across the country needs to be channelised.“The Congress has to take it upon itself to provide an alternative roadmap in the nation’s interest and I am sure, we will emerge victorious in this enterprise,” he said just two days after strategist Prashant Kishor met NCP chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai, triggering speculation of a potential third front.Asked if the Congress had learnt its lessons from the Antony committee report after the 2014 Lok Sabha debacle, Sibal said the party had not been able to stress that all forms of communalism were dangerous.“The Antony committee set up by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi soon after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections had rightly pointed out that fighting the polls on secularism versus communalism plank hurt the Congress that was identified as pro-minority, resulting in substantial electoral gains for the BJP.“More importantly the Congress also failed to drive home the point that minority and majority communalism were equally dangerous for the country. In my view, the decision to ally with All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam and Indian Secular Front (ISF) in Bengal was not thought through,” said Sibal.When pointed out that he had sought urgent party elections in the letter to Sonia Gandhi and if he agreed with the postponement of the exercise, Sibal said, “On January 22, the CWC had met to discuss the schedule for electing the new party chief in May. It was deferred by a month owing to the Assembly polls.“The exercise is on hold at the moment because of the pandemic. I do hope it happens sooner rather than later.” The former union minister welcomed the constitution of a committee to review the party’s recent losses in West Bengal, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry, but added a caveat, “Setting up committees to analyse the reasons for any electoral debacle is welcome but unless the remedies suggested are accepted and acted upon, it will have no impact on the ground.” The panel headed by former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan has handed over its report to Sonia Gandhi with its recommendations, which the party will discuss internally.

14-06-2021||New Delhi||Pradhan says Cong-ruled states should cut tax on petrol, diesel; mum on high taxes in BJP-ruled states||With petrol and diesel prices climbing to record high, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday asked Congress governments in Rajasthan and Maharashtra to cut sales tax if the party was concerned about fuel price burden on common man, but did not say if BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, where petrol has crossed Rs 100 mark, would do the same.Petrol and diesel have risen to an all-time high across the country after fuel rates rose by Rs 5.72 to Rs 6.25 per litre in less than six weeks. This is due to a combination of rising international oil prices and record-high central and state taxes.Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an event organised to inaugurate the oxygen plant set up by Indraprastha Gas Ltd at Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, he said central and state governments need additional money from the taxes on petrol and diesel to meet expenses for fighting pandemic as well as development work."I accept that fuel prices are pinching consumers," he said, adding the government is spending Rs 1 lakh crore on providing free food grains to poor this year alone besides spending money on vaccines and healthcare infrastructure.Asked about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's repeated attacks on the Modi government for skyrocketing fuel prices, Pradhan said, "Why is fuel expensive in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab (which are ruled by the party)?""If Rahul Gandhi is concerned about the poor being hit by fuel prices, he should ask chief ministers of Congress-ruled states to cut taxes. He should ask (Maharashtra Chief Minister) Uddhav Thackeray to reduce taxes," he said.He, however, did not say if BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which too have seen petrol price cross Rs 100 a litre mark due to local taxes, would follow suit.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. And because of this, petrol retails at over Rs 100 per litre mark in seven states and union territories -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Ladakh.Of these states, Congress is in power in Rajasthan and is a coalition partner with Shiv Sena and NCP in Maharashtra. BJP rules Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka and Ladakh too is under central rule. Andhra Pradesh has YSR-Congress in power while TRS rules in Telangana.Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT or sales tax) on petrol and diesel in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka.While international oil prices have crossed USD 72 per barrel in anticipation of demand recovery following the rollout of vaccination programme by various countries.Last year when rates collapsed to a two-decade low, the union government instead of passing on the benefit to consumers raised excise duty to record high. The excise tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014, and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.Excise duty on petrol now is Rs 32.90 per litre and makes up for 34 per cent of the retail selling price. The duty of Rs 31.80 a litre makes up for 36.5 per cent of retail diesel rates.Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan near the India-Pakistan border was the first place in the country to see petrol hit Rs 100 a litre mark in mid-February and on Saturday it also earned the distinction of diesel crossing that psychological mark.Petrol in the city is sold at Rs 107.22 a litre - the highest rate in the country, and diesel comes for Rs 100.05. Premium or additive laced petrol in the town sells for Rs 110.50 a litre and same grade diesel at Rs 103.72.In Delhi, petrol has hit an all-time high of Rs 96.12 a litre, while diesel is now priced at Rs 86.98 per litre.Mumbai on May 29 became the first metro in the country where petrol was being sold at over Rs 100 a litre. Petrol now costs Rs 102.30 a litre in the city and diesel comes for Rs 94.39.Petrol and diesel prices have been raised on 23 occasions since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 23 increases, petrol price has risen by Rs 5.72 per litre and diesel by Rs 6.25 a litre.

It will have to be set up at suitable grounds where precautions against Covid-19 could be maintained.There will be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods, and no separate permission or e-pass will be required for such movements, the order said.The partly allowed activities announced last week and earlier, including opening of government and private offices with 50 per cent staff, marriages at home or in the court, operation of Delhi Metro trains and public transport buses with 50 per cent seating capacity, permission for a gathering of 20 persons during funerals, running of autos, e-rickshaws and other last-mile vehicles, will continue up to June 21 morning, it added. “I hope our lives will be back on tracks if the Covid cases continue to decline. It is a massive calamity and we have to tackle it together, and hope the cases do not increase now,” Kejriwal added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-eases-curbs-from-monday-restaurants-shops-malls-to-reopen-267824
