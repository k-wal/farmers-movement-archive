15-06-2021||New Delhi||Mandatory gold hallmarking to come into force from Wednesday, initially in 256 districts: Govt||The Centre on Tuesday said mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery and artefacts will come into force from June 16 in a phased manner and initially will be implemented in 256 districts of the country.A decision in this regard was taken after a meeting chaired by Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal with industry stakeholders.In November 2019, the government had announced that hallmarking of gold jewellery and artefacts would be made mandatory across the country from January 15, 2021. But the deadline was extended for four months till June 1 and later till June 15 after the jewellers sought more time in view of the pandemic.  Gold hallmarking is a purity certification of the precious metal and has been voluntary in nature so far."Continuing our government's endeavour for better protection & satisfaction of customers, mandatory hallmarking in 256 districts will be implemented from June 16, 2021. No penalty will be imposed till August 2021," Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted after the meeting.Speaking to PTI, Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan said gold hallmarking will be implemented in a phased manner and initially in 256 districts that have Assaying marking centres. The industry concerns were addressed and clarified in great detail in the meeting, she added.After extensive consultation with stakeholders, the government relaxed mandatory hallmarking of gold for certain players in the jewellery sector.For instance, the government has exempted jewellers with annual turnover of up to Rs 40 lakh from mandatory hallmarking, said an official statement issued after the meeting.It has also been exempted on those who export and re-import jewellery as per the government's trade policy, jewellery meant for international exhibitions as well as for government-approved B2B domestic exhibitions.From June 16, jewellers in 256 districts will be allowed to sell only 14, 18 and 22 carats of gold jewellery. Gold of additional 20, 23 and 24 carats will also be allowed for hallmarking, it added.That apart, the government said it has exempted mandatory hallmarking gold on watches, fountain pens and special types of jewellery like Kundan, Polki and Jadau."Jewellers can continue to buy back old gold jewellery without a hallmark from consumers," it said, adding that old jewellery can be hallmarked, if feasible by the jeweller after melting and making new jewellery.  The government has decided to set up a committee constituting all stakeholders, revenue officials and legal experts to look into the issue.The mandatory hallmarking will protect the public against lower caratage and ensure consumers do not get cheated while buying gold ornaments and get the purity as marked on the ornaments.  The government said the hallmarking of jewellery/artefacts is required to enhance the credibility of gold jewellery and customer satisfaction through third party assurance for the marked purity/fineness of gold, and consumer protection.The BIS has been running a hallmarking scheme for gold jewellery since April 2000. Around 40 per cent of gold jewellery is being hallmarked currently.  The government said there has been a 25 per cent increase in assaying and hallmarking centres to 945 from 454 in the last five years. Presently, 940 assaying and hallmarking centres are operative. Out of this 84 centres have been set up under the government subsidy scheme in various districts.  About 14 crore articles can be hallmarked in a year with the existing capacity of these centres, it added.  India has around 4 lakh jewellers, out of this only 35,879 have been BIS certified. According to the World Gold Council, India imports 700-800 tonne of gold annually.

Even during the present times of pandemic, when physical and mental fitness has been stressed upon, many people have turned to Yoga for the same,” Vardhan was quoted as saying in a statement by the health ministry.On the importance of the central message of Yoga Day this year, 'Be with Yoga, Be at Home', he said, congregational activities in the run-up to International Yoga Day have been muted in light of the global health emergency."This message is most relevant in times of COVID-19, when it is necessary for all of us to maintain all possible precautions while also looking out for our overall wellness."Considering the immense and well- documented rewards of Yoga for the holistic health and well-being of the population, it is our government's objective to take Yoga to every citizen,” he said.The event was organised by 'Mokshayatan Yog Sansthan' along with the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India and Indian Council for Cultural Relations to mark the occasion of 7th International Day of Yoga which falls on June 21.“It is indeed a matter of pride for every Indian that this precious inheritance of our country has found global acceptance. The benefits of Yoga in immunity building and management of stress are well documented with evidence," Vardhan said.With programmes like this Global Yoga Conference, more people shall be drawn into the fold of practicing Yoga and related activities. Since the onset of the pandemic last year, many people have been working from home and the impact of being quarantined has been felt by many, Vardhan said.With several restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, other popular methods of maintaining physical fitness, such as public places, parks, sports and gyms have shut down, he said."A spike in stress levels has also been observed with increased time being spent in confined spaces along with added workload as people adapt to new realities. Yoga offers a solution for maintaining physical fitness as well as contributing towards one's mental peace, even in the midst of such restrictions,” he said.Vardhan noted that there is a widespread realisation today that health is of foremost importance for everyone. Countries around the globe have recognised the potential benefits that humankind can enjoy by embracing Yoga.He extended his sincere gratitude to Swami Dr Bharat Bhushan and Mokshyatan Sansthan for organising this conference and spreading awareness of healthy living among common people.Swami Dr Bharat Bhushan has over decades put in untiring efforts in promoting Yoga and Indian culture, the statement said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yoga-helped-people-during-pandemic-has-increasing-global-acceptance-harsh-vardhan-268886

15-06-2021||New Delhi||Ayodhya land deal row set to become major political issue ahead of UP elections||With Opposition parties, including the Samajwadi Party, the Congress, and the Aam Aadmi Party cornering the ruling BJP over allegations of “corruption in the acquisition of the piece of land by the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra”, the issue has the potential to become a major political issue in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh elections, next year.Former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday asked members of the Trust overseeing the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya to resign until cleared of the allegations. Yadav said the allegations involve “crores of rupees and required a ‘nishpaksh’ (neutral) investigation”.“If question marks are being put on those assigned with overseeing the work for Lord Ram, they should resign till the investigation is on,” he said.Sources, meanwhile, say Chief Minister Adityanath had sought information from functionaries and is “satisfied with the response/ report”. General Secretary of the trust, Champat Rai, too called as “politically motivated” all the allegations, and gave a detailed response on the deal and other projects. The Trust is accused of buying land worth Rs 2 crore for Rs 18.5 crore amid allegations that “no permission for the acquisition was also taken in any meeting”.Meanwhile, Sultan Ansari, a party to the final deal of the land, also claimed that the land agreement with the Trust was “transparent and that the financial dealings were closed using banking methods”.However, with the state set for Assembly polls, the controversy has assumed political significance. Calling it a “serious matter”, political analyst Sudhir Panwar says the allegations “not only questioned the rhetoric of BJP-RSS that Ram temple is an issue of faith for them but eroded the confidence of those who contributed and collected funds for the temple in Ayodhya”. “There also needs to be better explanations than the arrogant reply by Mr Champat Rai yesterday,” says Panwar who is also associated with the SP. “Mentioning of Mahatma Gandhi's murder without any reference by him was not only diversionary tactics but indicative of arrogance. It is the duty of individuals and organisations associated with the construction of Shri Ram Temple to prove their innocence before the public to uphold the public faith on cultural and religious organisations,” he said.Meanwhile, AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, who has sought a probe by the CBI and the ED into the matter, today claimed his residence in high-security North Avenue was vandalised because of his stance. Blaming the “BJP” for the  “attack ” , Singh said he will “not allow anyone to steal the money meant for the construction of the temple for Shri Ram”. “I will not be intimidated. I will continue to expose this scam being done in the name of prabhu Shri Ram,” said Singh, who belongs to Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ayodhya-land-deal-row-set-to-become-major-political-issue-ahead-of-up-elections-268867

15-06-2021||New Delhi||IT department revokes charitable org tax exemption of PFI||The Income Tax Department has revoked the tax exemption benefit given to Islamic organisation PFI after it found that its activities were allegedly “not genuine” as required to be undertaken by a legally notified charitable organisation.The department recently cancelled the registration of the Popular Front of India (PFI) granted under section 12AA (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This was granted to the organisation in August 2012.An order issued by the department in March said the tax benefit for the PFI is being “cancelled/withdrawn” with effect from assessment year 2016-17.The order effectively means that the PFI will now have to pay income tax and those who donate to it will not enjoy income tax exemption.It can also go in for an appeal against the order before a higher authority of the department followed by the courts.The PFI, formed in 2006 in Kerala and headquartered in Delhi, has been under the probe scanner of various state police departments as well central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and the National Investigation Agency on alleged charges of its and its members’ involvement in money laundering crimes and terrorist activities.The department has taken away the tag of the PFI being a charitable institution as defined under section 12A read with section 12AA of the Income Tax Act and also under section 80G under the same law.While section 12A/12AA specifies the scheme of taxation exemption in respect of income of charitable or religious trusts or institution, section 80G allows income tax deduction to an individual who donates to such a notified charitable or religious institution.The department, the order said, found that the PFI “was not carrying out its activities as per objects of memorandum of association (MoA) of the assessee trust or institution” and that it allegedly violated provisions of section 13(1)(b) on “account of beneficiaries of assessee belonging to one particular religious community”.               The order also alleged that the activities of the organisation were “not genuine.” The PFI, while reacting to income-tax proceedings, had earlier told PTI in a statement that it was “a registered organisation with lawful and transparent financial dealings and it abides by all statutory requirements, and annual income tax returns have been regularly filed before the authorities.”      It had said the contents of the tax department show-cause notice earlier issued to it in this context were “highly prejudiced and indicative of the well-orchestrated agenda of the central government against the religious minority groups that refuse to dance to the tune of authoritarianism and communal fascism.” The tax department order said that the PFI filed its income tax returns regularly between assessment year 2013-14 to 2020-21 and its MoA stated that it will undertake and promote “national integration, communal amity, and social harmony and uphold the democratic setup, secular order and the rule of law in the country.”Another of its notified MoAs states that it will “identify and check the menace or casteism, communalism and fascism”.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-department-revokes-charitable-org-tax-exemption-of-pfi-268860

The last 24 hours saw 2,726 persons succumbing to the virus, as per the data released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Tuesday."Our Covid-19 peak was in the second week of May 2021. During the peak, admissions to MICU (medical intensive care unit) were the highest. Most of the deaths which are happening now are cases that were admitted to MICU two to three weeks earlier (third week of May)," Aravinda G.M., Consultant Physician (internal medicine) at the Manipal Hospital, Jayanagar, Bengaluru, told IANS."This time the severity of the disease was also very high, i.e., lung involvement was very severe. These severe cases were in ICU for a longer period of time. Now even the number of cases is low, but the mortality rate among these cases are very high," said Vikas Maurya, Director and HOD, Pulmonology, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.In terms of infection, India has witnessed a decline in daily Covid cases by up to 85 per cent since the highest daily tally was registered on May 7 at 4,14,188.The country's overall tally of Covid-19 cases now stands at 2,95,70,871, with 3,77,031 deaths so far.Presently, Karnataka has the highest number of active cases in the country at 1,80,856, followed by Maharashtra at 1,58,617 and Tamil Nadu at 1,49,927.

Any information in this regard leading to identification and arrest of the suspected individuals will be rewarded with cash of Rs. 10,00,000  (Rupees Ten Lakhs) on each,” the statement read, adding: “If you see someone you recognise submit tip at email ID - do.nia@gov.in, info.nia@gov.in, phone - 011-24368800, mob – 9654447345.”According to the Delhi police, the low-intensity improvised device went off around 5 pm near 5, APJ Abdul Kalam Road adjoining Jindal House.

15-06-2021||New Delhi||Inflammatory speeches, road blockades not uncommon when there is widespread opposition: HC||The making of inflammatory speeches, organising chakkajams (road blockades), and such like actions are not uncommon when there is widespread opposition to Governmental or Parliamentary actions, the Delhi High Court said on Tuesday.The high court said that protests against Governmental and Parliamentary actions are legitimate; and though such protests are expected to be peaceful and non-violent, it is not uncommon for protesters to push the limits permissible in law.“Even if we assume for the sake of argument, without expressing any view thereon, that in the present case inflammatory speeches, chakkajams, instigation of women protesters and other actions, to which the appellant is alleged to have been party, crossed the line of peaceful protests permissible under our Constitutional guarantee, that however would yet not amount to commission of a ‘terrorist act’ or a ‘conspiracy’ or an ‘act preparatory’ to the commission of a terrorist act as understood under the UAPA,” a bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani said.The High Court made the observations while granting bail to JNU student and Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) activist Devangana Kalita, who was arrested last May under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with a case of larger conspiracy related to the communal violence in north east Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.“In our reading of the subject charge-sheet and the material included in it, therefore, prima-facie the allegations made against the appellant are not even borne-out from the material on which they are based.”“We are afraid, that in our opinion, shorn-off superfluous verbiage, hyperbole and the stretched inferences drawn from them by the prosecuting agency, the factual allegations made against the appellant do not prima facie disclose the commission of any offence under sections 15, 17 and/or 18 of the UAPA,” the bench said.It said that on a reading of the portions of the subject charge-sheet it found that the appellant’s name appears along with that of several other alleged co-conspirators and even the instructions and directions allegedly issued by the main accused persons are not directed to the appellant.The high court debunked the “misconception” that merely because section 45 of the UAPA mandates an independent review of the evidence gathered by an independent authority appointed by the central government that legal requirement in itself obviates the need for the court to apply its own independent mind.“Where court finds that an act or omission is adequately addressed and dealt with by the ordinary penal law of the land, the court must not countenance a State agency ‘crying wolf’,” the bench said.“Since courts often tend to fall into this error, it is extremely important to bear in mind the words of the Supreme Court that grant of bail cannot be thwarted merely by asserting that an offence is grave, since the gravity of the offence can only beget the length of the sentence, which may be awarded upon conclusion of the trial,” it said.The high court said that as a member of certain women’s rights organisations and other groups, the appellant did participate and help organise protests against the CAA and the NRC in Delhi.“Considering however, that the right to protest is a fundamental right that flows from the constitutionally guaranteed right to assemble peaceably and without arms enshrined in Article 19(1)(b) of our Constitution, surely the right to protest is not outlawed and cannot be termed as a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of the UAPA,” the bench said.While granting bail to Kalita, the bench said considering the educational background, profile and appellant’s position in life, “we also see no reason to suspect or apprehend that the appellant is either a flight risk or that she will indulge in evidence tampering, or witness intimidation, or will otherwise impede the trial in any way”.          “Due notice is also taken of the fact that the appellant was not arrested in the subject FIR for nearly three months after the date of its registration. In the circumstances, we see no reason, basis or justification to detain the appellant in judicial custody in the subject FIR any longer,” the bench said.Imposing several conditions on her, the bench directed Kalita to furnish personal bond of Rs 50,000 with two local sureties in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the trial court.It directed Kalita, an activist of Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage), which was founded in 2015 with an aim to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students, to furnish to the Investigating Officer/SHO a cellphone number on which the appellant may be contacted at any time and should ensure that the number is kept active and switched on at all times.The bench also imposed a condition that Kalita should not contact, nor visit, nor offer any inducement, threat or promise to any of the prosecution witnesses or other persons acquainted with the facts of case.It said charges are yet to be framed and there are around 740 prosecution witnesses who would have to be examined during trial and there is hardly any doubt that the process will take a very long time as none of the witnesses have so far been examined. The prevailing pandemic and the consequent truncated functioning of courts, will only add to the delay, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/inflammatory-speeches-road-blockades-not-uncommon-when-there-is-widespread-opposition-hc-268852

15-06-2021||New Delhi||Amid unlock, doctors warn of 'worse than second wave' situation if norms not followed||With close gathering of shoppers in markets and restaurants resuming business amid phased unlock in the national capital, doctors on Tuesday cautioned that Delhi could face a "worse than second wave situation" of Covid-19 if people do not adhere to safety norms or lower their guards.The remarks from many doctors at leading government or private facilities here come after visuals of various crowded markets surfaced in reports and on social media, showing Covid-appropriate behaviour not being followed by many people, like wearing of masks or maintaining social distance.Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals here, warned that if safety norms are not followed by people and if there is no strict enforcement in case of violations, then "we are in for trouble again"."The way cases have come down from over 28,000 at peak in April to 131 cases reported yesterday, it is such a dramatic fall in numbers. And, if lockdown was the primary reason for it, then we have to tread very cautiously now with the restrictions being slowly eased," he told PTI."But, if people show laxity by not wearing masks or wearing it inappropriately or violate social distancing norms, and if law enforcement agencies do not penalise and ensure violations do not increase in quantum, then we are certainly in for trouble. And, the next wave could be worse than the second wave situation," he said.Medical experts in mid-May had concurred that it was lockdown majorly that had brought down the count of daily cases, while cautioning that the severity of cases was still the same.Dr Richa Sareen, consultant of pulmonology at Fortis hospital here, who recently lost her immediate family member to Covid, said, "The threat of the third wave hitting is quite real and not a hypothesis." "And, we had similar threat in February when everyone had started going on a vacation or doing house parties or socialising in public places. Now, that the second wave has done so much damage and claimed so many lives, we need to realise that we have to be disciplined and tread with caution, " she said.The pulmonologist emphasised that in the second wave, at least one member in every household here was either infected by Covid, or the families knew of someone who had been."We hoped that people will learn lessons from the second wave, but seems we are not being wise as common people. The situation will be worse than during the second wave if we do not wise up. A government cannot keep a lockdown forever, but, we can choose to be disciplined and go out only when needed," she said.Chatterjee, Sareen and many doctors of government hospitals, also underlined that unlike in the UK and Italy, where third wave indications are coming from despite a significant portion of the adult population vaccinated, in India, the vaccination figure is "very miniscule", and, therefore the "threat of the next wave becomes imminent".Delhi had been reeling under a brutal second wave of the pandemic that is sweeping the country, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with the recent oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals, adding to the woes.Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling up.A lockdown was imposed by the government on April 19, however, in the last two weeks, several restrictions have been eased, like metro services with 50 per cent seating capacity from June 7, restaurants with 50 per cent capacity from June 14, besides the market and the malls resuming business.Since the imposition of the lockdown, a large number of people have been penalised for violating Covid safety norms, and the Delhi government while announcing phased lockdown easing had said that the restrictions will be imposed again if cases begin to rise.According to a data shared by Additional PRO (Delhi Police) Anil Mittal, a total of 1,33,143 challans have been issued from April 19 to June 14.Out of these, 1,12,265 challans were issued for mask-related violations, 19,153 for violating social distancing norms, 1,532 challans for holding large public gatherings and congregations, 72 for spitting in public and 121 for consumption of liquor, pan, gutkha, tobacco, etc, according to police."We have directed the market welfare associations to ensure compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour in their respective areas. This is not a full opening. Anyone violating Covid norms will be liable to be prosecuted by the Delhi Police," said Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police's Public Relations Officer.Market association representatives and management staff at malls claimed, all precautions were being taken and Covid safety rules being adhered to.Major markets which draw bug crowds on regular days, include, Connaught Place, Khan Market, Sarojini Nagar Market, Lajpat Nagar Market and Rajouri Garden market."In a market like ours, it is feasible to maintain social distancing and traders are ready to abide by all norms. There is a definitely a problem with the hawkers, which we have raised with authorities too, but the stores in Connaught Place can follow Covid protocols smoothly," said Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders Association.Sanjeev Mehra of Khan Market Traders Association, echoed his views saying the markets cannot be kept closed the whole year.“In such markets, the rents are high and there is no relief in tax, and other bills charged by the civic bodies. They have no option other than abiding by norms and going ahead with life,” he said.A mall management staff at DLF Emporio in south Delhi, said, "We are checking temperature of all customers, and wearing of mask is mandatory. We have also ensured that all our staff here are vaccinated. The entire mall management crew is working, but the restaurants at the mall are functioning at 50 per cent capacity as per the norms." —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-unlock-doctors-warn-of-worse-than-second-wave-situation-if-norms-not-followed-268847

Thermal screening of tourists would be done at gates, and they would be sanitised before entering the monument premises," he added."The visitors will not be allowed to touch any object in the monument premises, and they would have to follow social distancing norms," said Swarnakar."Tickets will only be booked online and no ticket counter will be open," he said, while also advising tourists to bring their own water bottles and carry sanitisers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taj-mahal-to-reopen-from-wednesday-650-visitors-allowed-at-a-time-268842
15-06-2021||New Delhi||Maize could help India increase ethanol distillation capacity: Centre||The Centre today said food grain maize will play an equal role as sugarcane in helping India increase its ethanol distillation capacity and achieve the 20 per cent blending target by 2025. The Ethanol Blending Programme is expected to save foreign exchange of more than Rs 30,000 crore on account of crude oil import bill, reduce dependence on imported fossil fuel, and help in achieving the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat in the petroleum sector, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey today said, briefing on the future course of the green fuel.  Pandey said the road map for ethanol blending has already been shared with automobile manufacturers. “Technology for flexi fuel vehicles is very common, both Indian and international manufacturers have the access to it,” he said.Meanwhile, in 2021-22, about 35 LMT of sugar is estimated to be diverted to ethanol which will increase to 60 LMT by 2025. This will solve the problem of excess sugarcane/ sugar and help sugar mills in clearing cane price dues of farmers, the Food Secretary said, adding that about 5 crore sugarcane farmers, their families and 5 lakh workers associated with sugar mills and ancillary activities will benefit from this intervention.The government is also encouraging distilleries to produce ethanol from rice available with the FCI and maize. In the past 6 years, the capacity of molasses-based distilleries has doubled to 445 crore litres and is presently about 258 crore litres in grain-based distilleries. “Maize will become equally important feedstock like sugarcane. The share of rice will be minuscule and transitory to provide continuity if required. Production of ethanol using maize as the base is more profitable plus distilleries will also have plants to produce protein-rich diet for poultry,” Pandey said.To produce ethanol/alcohol from food grains, more than 165 LMT of additional food grains will be utilised, which will ultimately benefit farmers as they will get a better price for their produce and assured buyers, he added. Using this as an incentive the government is expecting farmers to shift to environment-friendly maize from a water-guzzler like paddy. Pandey said when the industry uses it as stock, maize’ prices will increase and so will production.India is also facing the problem of plenty so far as sugar is concerned and the Government is encouraging sugar mills to divert excess sugarcane to ethanol. In the past three sugar seasons about Rs 22,000 crore was generated by sugar mills/ distilleries from the sale of ethanol to OMCs, he said.Reduction in oil imports is also expected to benefit consumers in monetary terms along with associated health and environmental benefits, he said. “The taxation structure (of blended fuel) will be decided by the government of the day. The GST on ethanol has been cut down to reduce the tax burden. When it is 100 pc (blending) the green, less-polluting fuel will majorly reduce the health burden,” he said. The Government is also encouraging sugar mills and distilleries to enhance capacities with loans and interest subvention up to 6 per cent. Installed capacity for hand sanitisers increasesAs of May 31, 2021, India is producing around 3.9 crore litre of hand sanitisers. Prior to Covid-19, its annual production was about 10 lakh litre and mainly used in hospitals. Pandey said with the collective efforts of Centre and States more than 900 distilleries/independent units have been accorded permissions.  Benefits of green fuel ethanol *Reduce dependence on imported fossil fuel.*Positive impact on country’s economy*Indigenous, non-polluting, will improve environment and eco-system*E-20 fuel reduces carbon monoxide emission by 30-50% and hydrocarbon by 20%.*In ESY 2020-21, more than 300 crore litre expected to be supplied to OMCs to achieve 8 to 8.5 % blending.*India likely to achieve a 10% blending target by 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maize-could-help-india-increase-ethanol-distillation-capacity-centre-268835
15-06-2021||New Delhi||INSACOG sequencing helped in detection of variants of concerns in real time: Govt||The genome sequencing by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genetics Consortium helped in detection of ‘variants of concern’ in real-time and it was also shared with states, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, highlighting that the turnaround time was 10 to 15 days.The ministry said that the effect of known ‘variants of concern’ (VoCs) on disease transmission and severity is already established.But for new mutations or variants under investigation, and for correlation of genomic mutations with epidemiological scenarios and clinical perspective, it is important to monitor epidemiological trends of cases, clinical severity and proportions of samples with genomic variants, it said.These have to be done over a few weeks to generate scientifically valid evidence, the ministry said. The health ministry also referred to some media reports which alleged low quantum of sequencing in the country and significant lag between sample collection and sequence submission into the database for pattern detection and actionable alerts to governments.“It is clarified that a sampling strategy is based on the country’s objectives, scientific principles and WHO (World Health Organisation) guidance documents. Accordingly, the strategy has been reviewed and revised from time to time,” it said.The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genetics Consortium (INSACOG) was set up by the government on December 25 last year to study and monitor genome sequencing and virus variation of circulating strains of Covid-19 in India.In the initial phase, sampling was done with the objective of identifying international travellers who could be carrying the variant strains and to find out if the variant or variants are already present in the population.Accordingly, a two-pronged strategy was adopted—international passengers arriving from selected countries and their contacts were targeted for whole genome sequencing (WGS), and community-based sampling of five per cent of the RT-PCR positive cases was done from each state.It is important to note that the 5 per cent norm was selected based on the then daily caseload (approximately 10,000–15,000 per day) and the sequencing capacity of the Regional Genome Sequencing Laboratories (RGSLs) at that time, the ministry said.Both the objectives were met when it was conclusively established that international passengers were carrying variants and the transmission of these had also been established in the community in a few states, it said.Subsequently, in line with the global sequencing strategy and WHO guidance document, the sampling strategy has been revised by INSACOG with the objective to detect emerging genomic variants or mutations by prospective sampling and to detect the VoCs and genomic variants in special and unusual events like large clusters, unusual clinical presentation, vaccine breakthrough, suspected reinfections, among others, the ministry said.It said that accordingly, a strategy has been adopted in view of the increase in the number of new Covid-19 cases, existing capacity of RGSLs and timely detection of VoCs, including other genomic variants being detected in the country and elsewhere. The strategy was revised on April 12 to the ‘Sentinel Surveillance’, the ministry said.This was also endorsed by the WHO which had issued similar guidance, it said.Under the present sentinel surveillance strategy, states have identified five laboratories and five tertiary care hospitals each as sentinel sites for sending samples to designated RGSLs and each of the sentinel sites is sending 15 samples routinely for WGS to the designated laboratories, the ministry said.In addition to the sentinel surveillance, an additional event-based surveillance for special and unusual events to detect, investigate and respond to these was also approved,it said.The details of the epidemiological investigations, study methodology, number of samples to be collected for WGS depends on the situation or event.“As far as the turnaround time is concerned, INSACOG sequencing has helped in detection of VOCs in real time and this was also shared with the relevant states. The present turnaround time for VOCs is only 10 to 15 days,” the ministry said.Regarding enhancing the number and capacity of existing genome sequencing labs, it is informed that in addition to existing 10 labs, 18 other labs have also been approved for incorporation in the INSACOG network, the ministry added.

Apart from them, Polly, Arif, Mushahid and Parvesh Gurjar were also involved in the incident, Senior Superintendent of Police Amit Pathak said.The Ghaziabad police had earlier arrested Gurjar, who owns the house where the alleged incident took place.An FIR was lodged two days after the incident which took place on June 5 under IPC section 342, section 323, section 504, section 506.In his complaint, Samad did not mention that his beard was cut and he was compelled to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'.Police is raiding the possible hideouts of other accused and they will be nabbed soon, Superintendent of Police rural Iraj Raja said.Samad also practised occultism and had sold some amulet to Gurjar, purportedly to free one of his family members from some "evil effect" but a dispute arose between the two as there was no desired result of the amulet, he said.The purported video which went viral on social media shows four men beating Samad up, chopping his beard and asking him to chant “Jai Shri Ram” in the Loni area of Ghaziabad.Showing his injuries in the video, Samad has said he was abducted from Gokulpuri area when he took an auto for Loni in Ghaziabad.The autorickshaw already had two people in it when he hired it while two more boarded it a little distance ahead, said Samad in the video, adding the four suddenly pounced upon him inside the auto, covered his head with a piece of cloth and began beating him up."They eventually drove me to a secluded house in a field in Behta Hazipur village of Loni where they further beat me up while asking me to chant Jai Shri Ram," alleged Samad in the video."Every time I cried in pain and uttered Allah they beat me up again asking me to chant Jai Shri Ram instead," said Samad."They even chopped my beard, calling me a Pakistani spy," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-more-held-for-thrashing-elderly-muslim-man-police-deny-communal-angle-268833

15-06-2021||Allahabad||HC refuses to give custody of minor 'husband' to 'wife'||The Allahabad High Court has refused to give custody of a minor ‘husband' to his ‘wife', holding that their marriage was voidable and doing so would amount to sanctioning cohabitation between a major and a minor.As the 16-year-old is unwilling to live with his mother, the court did not give his custody to her either. It directed authorities to arrange for the boy's stay in a state facility like a shelter home till February 4, 2022, when he attains the age of ‘majority'.It clarified that he can stay with whomever he likes, including his 'wife', after that.The judgment, given on May 31, was uploaded on the court's website on Monday.Justice J J Munir passed the order while allowing the petition filed by the boy's mother, a native of Azamgarh, who had claimed her son's custody.The petitioner mother's plea was that the minor boy did not have the legal competence to marry the girl and the marriage was void, according to law.The teen had earlier been produced before the court on September 18, 2020. The court, while recording his statement, had then observed, “No doubt that the boy was never under any kind of coercion to stay with his wife or the other respondents, who are claimed to be detaining him illegally. He also does not appear to have been enticed away.” However, the court went on to refuse the request of the minor boy to allow him to remain in the custody of his wife. The 'wife' has also given birth to the child of the minor boy.The court said, “The POCSO Act makes cohabitation of a minor boy with a major girl an offence, which would certainly be committed, if the boy is in the custody of his wife.”“The custody or care of a minor, that inherently makes or has the potential of making the minor the victim of an offence and his adult guardian an offender under the Act of 2012 (POCSO Act), cannot be regarded as a custody or arrangement made to ensure the welfare of the minor,” it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-refuses-to-give-custody-of-minor-husband-to-wife-268830
15-06-2021||---||Bharat Biotech defends higher private cost of Covaxin||New Delhi, June 15Bharat Biotech on Tuesday defended higher private cost of Covaxin saying the differential between government and private pricing is needed to offset massive costs the company is undertaking to produce the jab based on the inactivated virus technology which required massive investment in safety and infrastructure.Arguing for freedom to have dual pricing policy — Rs 150 a dose for the Centre and a higher cost for the private sector Bharat Biotech said low product price realisation dispirits domestic R&D.“Companies such as Bharat Biotech, which are innovators with specialised expertise in product development, and large scale manufacturing, should be allowed to maintain a differential pricing strategy for Governments and private hospitals. It is distressing to see that a large country like India has a very basic level of innovation in vaccines and pharmaceutical products.  It may well be argued that the low-price realisation for home-grown innovators constraints innovation and product development in India. In the absence of a dual pricing system, Indian vaccine and pharmaceutical companies risk being reduced to mere contract manufacturers with intellectual property licensed from other nations,” a company statement said amid a debate on Covaxin being the costliest vaccine in the Indian market with price capped at Rs 1,410 a dose as against Rs 780 and Rs 1,145 a dose for Covishield and Sputnik V.Explaining why Covaxin was more expensive for the private sector and free for the government, Bharat Biotech said, “This is purely due to fundamental business reasons, ranging from low procurement volumes, high distribution costs and retail margins among few others as explained above. As directed by the Government less than 10 pc of our total production of Covaxin to date has been supplied to private hospitals, while most of the remaining quantity was supplied to State and Central Governments. In such a scenario the weighted average price of Covaxin for all supplies realised by Bharat Biotech is less than Rs 250 a dose. Going forward, 75 pc of the capacity will be supplied to State and Central Governments with only 25 pc going to private hospitals,” said the firm.The supply price of Covaxin to the government of India at Rs 150 a dose, a non-competitive price and clearly not sustainable in the long run, the company states adding that a higher price in private markets is required to offset part of the costs. Higher private pricing of vaccines has been happening in the past. Human Papilloma virus vaccine is priced for GAVI supplies at $ 4.5 a dose (Rs 320), but is also available in the private market at Rs 3500 a dose. Rotavirus vaccines are supplied to the Govt of India at Rs 60 a dose, but is also available in the private market at Rs 1,700 a dose.The prices for COVID-19 vaccines internationally have varied between $10 to $37 a dose, (Rs 730 - Rs 2,700 a dose).   Biotech said private procurement is discretionary. “The procurement of vaccines by private hospitals is optional and not mandatory, though it gives a choice to citizens who are willing to pay for better convenience,” said the company.It said Bharat Biotech has so far invested over Rs 500 crore at risk from its own resources for product development, clinical trials and setting up of manufacturing facilities for Covaxin and the support from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was with respect to provision of the SARS CoV2 virus, animal studies, virus characterisation, test kits and partial funding for clinical trial sites.“In return for this valuable support, Bharat Biotech will pay royalties to ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), based on product sales. Royalties are also payable to Virovax towards the licensure of IMDG agonist molecules.We are investing in new facilities and repurposing existing ones across several states for enhancing the production of Covaxin. The urgent need to set up a significant number of manufacturing facilities and to divert existing ones for Covaxin, has resulted in reduced production of other vaccines at our facilities, leading to loss in revenues. We have been extremely diligent in selecting manufacturing facilities and partners, with the required levels of containment, capabilities and expertise. Product development activities towards the development of vaccines against newer variants is also underway at our facilities,” the firm said adding that the whole-virion Inactivated Vero Cell vaccines (Covaxin derives from this technology platform) are highly complex to manufacture since the critical ingredient is based on live viruses which require highly sophisticated, multiple level containment and purification methods and involve investments.“Such high standards of purification automatically lead to significant process losses and low yields save the outcome of a highly purified and safe vaccine.The sheer complexity of the Covaxin manufacturing process is manifested by the fact that it requires about 10,000 sq metres of area to manufacture around 200 million doses of the vaccine annually. In comparison, the same quantity of live virus vaccines can be manufactured from mere 1,500 sq metres. Due to the highly contagious nature of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus, more stringent Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) containment facilities are required for the manufacturing of Covaxin. Every batch of manufactured product is subjected to more than 200 quality control tests, prior to its release,” said the company.The statement added that it is exactly this complexity that has kept away other companies from developing vaccines, especially whole virion inactivated vaccines.The SARS CoV2 virus provided by ICMR-NIV is also equally available to other manufacturers who wish to develop and manufacture such a vaccine, Bharat Biotech said adding that companies would need access to cell lines, BSL3 manufacturing quality control facilities, and several well trained technical teams, to manufacture Covaxin.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-biotech-defends-higher-private-cost-of-covaxin-268829

He was produced before a Thane court, which sent him to judicial custody.The ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi has been criticised over Kotkar's arrest by several prominent personalities on social media.The posts pertained to the proposal for the naming of the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport after the Shiv Sena founder-patriarch, Balasaheb Thackeray, who passed away in 2012.Local villagers, comprising the Agri community, are strongly opposed to the proposal and have demanded that the airport should be named after a prominent local leader, Peasants & Workers Party (PWP) senior functionary and parliamentarian, Dinkar B. Patil, who had passed away in 2012.Last week, the villagers protested by forming a 12-km-long human chain and have now threatened to lay a siege of the Konkan Bhavan on June 24 if their demand is not conceded.Kotkar had joined the Agri protests and had also made several posts on social media networks, but after the Sena complaint, police deleted some of the objectionable content. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/marathi-actor-nabbed-for-vile-posts-against-maharashtra%C2%A0minister-268825

We have repeatedly sought details of the episode in light of the PM’s statement, as well as details of what progress has been made towards restoring the status quo ante before April 2020. The disengagement agreement with China appears to have worked entirely to India’s disadvantage so far,” Gandhi said on the first anniversary of the tragedy.The Congress urged the government to take the nation into confidence and ensure that their performance is worthy of the commitment of our soldiers, who are standing bravely and resolutely at the borders.“As we approach the first anniversary of the tragic loss of 20 brave soldiers of the Bihar Regiment, including their commanding officer, in the confrontation with PLA troops of China on the night of 15-16 June 2020, the Congress also joins a grateful nation in remembrance of their supreme sacrifice,” added Gandhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/come-clean-on-the-galwan-incident-sonia-gandhi-to-pm-modi-268803

15-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi defies social distancing norms, doctors say brace for Covid 'explosion'||In Delhi, thousands of commuters crowded into underground train stations and shopping malls on Tuesday, prompting some doctors to warn it could lead to a resurgence in Covid-19 infections.Major Indian cities have begun lifting strict lockdowns as the nationwide tally of new infections has dropped to its lowest level in more than two months.But disease experts and doctors have cautioned that a race towards resuming business as usual would compromise vaccination efforts as only about 5 per cent of all 950 million eligible adults have been inoculated.Doctors say Delhi's near-complete re-opening is concerning.

Suburban rail networks can run at 50 per cent capacity, and offices have been partially reopened.Vaccinations have slowed, however; the city government said inoculation centres for people ages 18-44 would start shutting down on Tuesday, as doses were scarce."Delhi ought to have unlocked far more scientifically.

This is a fit case to close all proceedings in India," the top court said using its powers under Article 142.The Marines were on board Italian-flagged commercial oil tanker MV Enrica Lexie when they allegedly fired at two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast on February 15, 2012 in India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).The Supreme Court had in 2014 stayed the criminal proceedings against the two Italian marines before a Special Court at Kollam in Kerala.In 2015, it halted all proceedings before courts in India in view of an ITLOS (International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea) order calling upon India and Italy to suspend all criminal proceedings against the two duo.The Hague-based tribunal on July 2 last year ruled that the two marines should be tried in Italy and asked the Indian authorities to close the criminal case against them.The tribunal, however, had agreed with India's contention that the Italian marines broke the freedom of navigation aspect of UNCLOS and, therefore, the killed fishermen's kin were entitled to compensation.A day after an International tribunal ruled that India didn't have jurisdiction to try two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen in Kerala, the Centre had on July 3, 2020 moved the Supreme Court seeking disposal of the case pending before it.The Centre said it had accepted the award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-closes-murder-case-against-two-italian-marines-268765
15-06-2021||New Delhi||Right to protest fundamental right, cannot be termed as ‘terrorist act’: Delhi HC||Right to protest is a fundamental right and cannot be termed as a ‘terrorist act’, the Delhi High Court Tuesday said while granting bail to JNU student Devangana Kalita in a case related to the communal violence in north east Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.A Division Bench said the court must be careful in employing the definitional words and phrases used in the anti-terror law UAPA “in their absolute, literal sense or use them lightly in a manner that would trivialise the extremely heinous offence of ‘terrorist act’, without understanding how terrorism is different even from conventional, heinous crime.” It said it was constrained to say that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters may get out of hand, “the State has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’.“If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril,” a bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani said in its 83-page judgement while deliberating with the case and imposition of anti-terror law against Kalita.It said right to protest peacefully without arms is a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(b) of the Constitution and has not been outlawed yet.“Considering however, that the right to protest is a fundamental right that flows from the constitutionally guaranteed right to assemble peaceably and without arms enshrined in Article 19(1)(b) of our Constitution, surely the right to protest is not outlawed and cannot be termed as a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of the UAPA, unless of course the ingredients of the offences under sections 15, 17 and/or 18 of the UAPA are clearly discernible from the factual allegations contained in charge sheet and the material filed therewith,” it said.Kalita was arrested along with others in May last year under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with a case of larger conspiracy related to riots.The high court, by separate judgements, also granted bail to another JNU student Natasha Narwal and Jamial Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha in the UAPA case.While dealing with Kalita’s case, the division bench referred to its judgement in Tanha’s case and said the phrase ‘terrorist act’ has been given a very wide and detailed definition in section 15 of the UAPA.Referring to a Supreme Court verdict, the high court said that the extent and reach of a terrorist activity must travel beyond the effect of an ordinary crime and must not arise merely by causing disturbance of law and order or even public order.“The Supreme Court says that the effect of terrorist activity must be such that it travels beyond the capacity of the ordinary law enforcement agencies to deal with it under the ordinary penal law,” it said.The high court said the intent and purpose of Parliament in enacting the UAPA and in amending it in 2004 and 2008 to bring terrorist activity within its scope, was and could only have been, to deal with matters of profound impact on the ‘Defence of India’, nothing more and nothing less.“It was not the intent, nor purpose of enacting UAPA that other offences of the usual and ordinary kind, however grave, egregious or heinous in their nature and extent, should also be covered by UAPA, since such conventional matters would have fallen within Entry 1 of List-II (State List) and/or Entry 1  of List-III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule of our Constitution,” the bench said.The high court clarified that in the present case, it was not deciding if the protests, in which Kalita is alleged to have been involved, were within the constitutionally guaranteed right to assembly, or whether they crossed the limit of what is permissible under Article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(b) and became non-peaceful protests.“However, what we find is that, for one there is nothing to say that the Government had prohibited the protest in the first instance. What we know is that offences, if any, that are alleged to have been committed by reason of the protests having been turned non-peaceful, are subject matter of FIR Nos. 48/2020 and 50/2020, in which the appellant is one of the accused and in which the appellant has been admitted to bail and will face trial in due course.“There is absolutely nothing in the subject charge-sheet, by way of any specific or particularised allegation, that would show the possible commission of a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of section 15 UAPA; or an act of ‘raising funds’ to commit a terrorist act under section 17; or an act of ‘conspiracy’ to commit or an ‘act preparatory’ to commit, a terrorist act within the meaning of section 18 UAPA,” the bench said.It said, prima-facie, the high court was unable to discern in the subject charge-sheet the elemental factual ingredients that are a must to found any of the offences defined under section 15, 17 or 18 UAPA.“In our view, the subject charge-sheet and the material filed therewith does not contain any specific, particularised, factual allegations that would make-out the ingredients of the offences under sections 15, 17 or 18 UAPA.The bench said that no offence under sections 15, 17 or 18 UAPA is made-out against the appellant on a prima facie appreciation of the subject charge-sheet and the material collected and cited by the prosecution.

In this report is an 80-page detailed reference on nuclear weapons.“A key finding is that despite an overall decrease in the number of nuclear warheads in 2020, more have been deployed with operational forces,” the report said.The world has nine declared nuclear-armed states — the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and the North Korea — which together possess an estimated 13,080 nuclear weapons at the start of 2021. This marked a decrease from the 13,400 that SIPRI estimated these states possessed at the beginning of 2020.Despite this overall decrease, the estimated number of nuclear weapons currently deployed with operational forces increased to 3,825 from 3,720 last year.Around 2,000 of these — nearly all of which belonged to Russia or the USA — were kept in a state of high operational alert. The UK and France are the other two who have deployed warheads. China, India and Pakistan are not listed in the report as having “deployed” such weapons with operational forces.“The overall number of warheads in global military stockpiles now appears to be increasing, a worrisome sign that the declining trend that has characterised global nuclear arsenals since the end of the cold war has stalled,” said Hans M Kristensen, Associate Senior Fellow with SIPRI’s nuclear disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation programme.Russia and the US together possess over 90 per cent of global nuclear weapons. Both have extensive programmes under way to modernise their nuclear warheads, missile and aircraft delivery systems and production facilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-india-pak-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-says-report-268665

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the court that West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Assam governments had not implemented the ONORC scheme.The Centre maintained that the ONORC enables migratory NFSA beneficiaries to access the public distribution system (PDS).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/misleading-centre-counters-delhi-on-ration-card-scheme-268669

The development augurs well for India, which will procure 20 crore doses of Covovax (SII to produce and market Novavax vaccine by this name), a recombinant nanoparticle protein-based jab.A step closerToday, Novavax is one step closer to addressing the critical and persistent global public health need for additional Covid-19 vaccines. -  Stanley C Erck, Novavax ChiefThe SII is already producing the Covishield vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.The Government of India has already factored in 20 crore Covovax doses in the larger pool of 2 billion it expects to make available for the national inoculation drive between August and December.The Covovax stock would be key to the overall Indian vaccine plan as the government gears to inoculate the entire 95 crore adult population requiring 1.9 billion doses.The Novavax study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the US and Mexico to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. It laid an emphasis on recruiting a representative population of communities and demographic groups most impacted by the disease.“Today, Novavax is one step closer to addressing the critical and persistent global public health need for additional Covid-19 vaccines,” said Novavax president Stanley C. Erck. The company intends to file for regulatory authorisations in the third quarter of 2021.Upon regulatory approvals, Novavax will reach a manufacturing capacity of 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million doses per month by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.The availability of a new, efficacious vaccine would mean easier availability of doses for the developing and other low income countries. Importantly, Novavax jabs can be stored at 2 to 8°Celsius and would not need ultra low temperatures like Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. That would make it easy to use and transport.The development coincided with India recording daily Covid cases of 70,421, the lowest in 74 days, and the active cases falling below 10 lakh to 9,73,158 (3.30 per cent of the total infections) after 66 days.Daily Covid deaths today were 3,921, taking the toll to 3,74,305.

But there was no reaction from Sebi and National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) that would have set the matter to rest.The Adani Group stocks dived in the morning to hit the lower circuit after reports claimed that the NSDL had frozen the accounts of three Mauritius-based funds, which owned over Rs 43,500 crore in four Adani Group firms. The reports triggered a selloff in shares of six Adani companies before the group came out with the denial.The report claiming freezing of accounts emerged days after a sharp rally in his group stocks made Gautam Adani the second-richest person in Asia. Several analysts had then flagged the quick rise in share prices held mostly by overseas funds with very little public float.Adani Total Gas shares have jumped three times this year, Adani Enterprises has risen 213 per cent, Adani Transmission nearly 250 per cent and Adani Power 183 per cent. Last week, the BSE had sought a clarification from Adani Power after its shares rose 20 per cent in two consecutive sessions.

A senior leader said Nitish was unhappy with Chirag for having fielded candidates only against the JD(U) during the 2020 Assembly polls, which cost the party 30 seats.Addressing the media, Paras lauded Nitish Kumar as “vikas purush”. He claimed that most LJP workers were unhappy with the turn of events in Bihar during the Assembly elections. He also said the LJP would continue to be part of the BJP-led NDA and that “Chirag can remain a part of the party.”Paras, who has the backing of Chirag’s cousin Prince Raj (Samastipur), Mehboob Ali Kaiser (Khagaria), Veena Devi (Vaishali) and Chandan Singh (Nawada), said “wrong decisions” had led to the LJP being marginalised in Bihar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chirag-paswan-ousted-uncle-pashupati-paras-ljp-party-leader-268652

Incidentally, the late Ajit Singh of the Rashtriya Lok Dal was also in favour of carving out ‘Harit Pradesh’ in western UP, the current hub of farm politics.Whether such an exercise was possible, or plausible, remains to be seen, the speculation has also stemmed from reports of alleged differences between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adityanath over various issues. The decision to divide UP is being seen as a way to “limit” Adityanath to Purvanchal, his key support region.Apparently, the central leadership is upset over the manner the CM has been managing the BJP’s affairs in the state and the way he has been doing his public outreach “without giving due prominence to the PM”.Much was read into the PM not wishing Adityanath publicly on his birthday a couple of days ago, the colour of ‘kurta’ (green) that Home Minister Amit Shah wore when the CM called on him in Delhi and a relatively under-toned or muted response by senior leaders to his Delhi visit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talk-of-splitting-up-amid-bjp-image-makeover-bid-268656

The protest strategy adopted in Punjab and Haryana will be replicated in UP and Uttarakhand. - Darshan Pal, SKM LeaderThough the Centre is yet to respond to the request of the farmers’ organisations to resume talks, those leading the agitation are in no rush and looking at spreading the agitation to states going to the polls next year.“The West Bengal results have proved the dent we can make. If you think the BJP is not rattled in Punjab and Haryana and the Centre is indifferent to our protest, it is not so. We are firming up our plans for the poll-bound states and will fan out in every village and colony. The government will not be able to ignore our presence. The 200 days of protest has already proved to them that the farmers are going nowhere,” says Haryana BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni.While the protests against BJP leaders will continue in Haryana and laying of foundation stones will not be allowed, the farmers are focusing on the June 26 programme to submit a memorandum to Governors against the laws. The programme is being organised to mark seven months of the protest and also the day Emergency was declared in India in 1975.“We are in a state of undeclared emergency under the present government at the Centre. Our protests will grow in the coming days,” Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader Darshan Pal explains, adding that the protest strategy of Punjab and Haryana will be replicated in UP and Uttarakhand to “expose” the BJP.Though the numbers at Tikri and Singhu have dropped as compared to the initial months, the farmers maintain that they have no more reason to use these protest sites as a show of strength.“Farmers of every village from Punjab and Haryana visit the protest site on a rotation basis. We have shown our strength to the government. Everyone will come back to the protest sites when the programme to campaign against the BJP in election-bound states is finalised,” says BKU (Rajewal) leader Pargat Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/200-days-into-stir-farmers-eye-poll-bound-states-268659

15-06-2021||Ajay Banerjee||Year after Galwan clash, friction points remain||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 14A clash between Indian and Chinese troops on the intervening night of June 15 and 16 at Galwan in eastern Ladakh last year has set a new template for military readiness along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).No breakthroughAll agreements stitched for maintaining peace along the LAC since 1993 now stand breached. The two nuclear-armed acrimonious neighbours maintain a deployment of armed troops within cannon-shot range of each other and talks to disengage and de-escalate broke down on April 9.The matters don’t look to get sorted out in the next few months, in an assessment within the Indian security establishment.India has made it clear that pulling back troops from friction points along the LAC could be done only after the Chinese army “disengaged” from areas like Gogra, Hot Springs and the Depsang plains. So far, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China has been inflexible to this suggestion. As of now, the “disengagement” has happened only at one sector — Pangong Tso.Both sides have fighter jets, armed helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, air defence missiles, UAVs and thousands of troops lined up on either side of the 823-km LAC in eastern Ladakh.The clash at Galwan was the first fatal event since 1975 when a team of Assam Rifles was ambushed by the PLA in Arunachal Pradesh. Before that, a fully armed class had ensued in 1967 at Nathu La in Sikkim.At Galwan, 20 Indian Army soldiers, including an officer, were killed in action. More than 900 troops on each side were involved in a physical clash, which started on the night of June 15 last year. It lasted several hours — in three phases — and ended in the early hours of June 16. Most of the deaths occurred as soldiers fell off the cliffs into a narrow valley and the Galwan river at an altitude of 15,000 ft. Some died due to hypothermia and others due to injuries.Stones, steel poles and bamboo poles with nails embed on them were used by the Chinese to attack the Indian troops. The PLA also suffered fatal casualties even as no bullets were fired in the clash. The casualties would have been manifold had bullets been fired.The incident had occurred after a round of talks to withdraw from the stand-off. The PLA had build a fresh post and set up arctic tents at vantage position on the south bank of the Galwan river. The post gave the Chinese better position to target the vital 255-km Darbuk Shayok Daulat Baig Oldie (DSDBO), India’s only link to Depsang, Murgo and Karakoram Pass.The post, some 5 km from the DSDBO road, has been removed but the movement backwards has only been by a couple of kms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/year-after-galwan-clash-friction-points-remain-268663

But we can do it. We can do it together,” the Prime Minister said while addressing the UN High-Level Dialogue on Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought on Monday.The PM listed steps taken to deal with the land degradation. The Delhi Declaration of 2019 called for better access and stewardship over land and emphasised gender-sensitive transformative projects. In India, over the last 10 years, around 3 million hectares of forest cover have been added. This has enhanced the combined forest cover to almost one-fourth of the country’s total area, the PM informed.India is on track to achieve its national commitment of land degradation neutrality, he said. “We are also working towards restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. This would contribute to India’s commitment to achieve an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent,”said the PM.The PM gave the example of the Banni region in Rann of Kutch in Gujarat to illustrate how restoration of land could start a virtuous cycle. In Banni region, land restoration by developing grasslands helped achieve land degradation neutrality. In the spirit of South-South cooperation, India is assisting fellow developing countries to develop land restoration strategies. A Centre of Excellence is being set up in India to promote a scientific approach towards land degradation issues. “It is mankind’s collective responsibility to reverse land damage caused by human activity,” he concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-for-global-unity-to-tackle-land-degradation-268664

A pilot project has been started in Odisha, he added.“Malaria No More, a non-governmental organisation, collaborates with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in creating a multi-disciplinary India Interagency Expert Committee on Malaria and Climate (IEC) to explore and advance climate-based solutions for accelerating malaria elimination in India,” a statement issued by the NGO said.“Malaria is one of India’s most pressing health concerns. By combining meteorological information with the information from the health sector, we can examine micro-trends and predict malaria patterns, and accelerate our national progress towards its elimination. The Interagency Expert Committee announced today will function as a highly effective platform to accomplish this objective,” it added.The NGO’s weather-based forecasting model is designed to produce data-driven solutions to guide the planning of national malaria prevention campaigns, test and treatment interventions, advanced positioning of medical products, and the deployment of community health workers.The forecasting model uses advanced weather data, health information and deep-learning algorithms, and produces practical visualisation outputs for local decision-making in the pilot districts of Koraput and Malkangiri in Odisha, the statement added.Manju Rahi, Deputy Director General of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, ICMR, said the impact of climate change has emerged as a major threat to the very existence of the human race.Vector-borne diseases such as malaria are priority targets for action in the health-climate agenda. The relations between these diseases and the climate variables have been extensively studied in the past and it is time to apply this evidence to design programmatic solutions to accelerate the country’s progress against these diseases, she said.The IEC brings together some of the leading experts and researchers from the fields of health, climate and technology, and would serve as an effective platform to co-design the most feasible and useful applications of climate-based forecasting of diseases such as malaria in the Indian context.It will focus on improving models like the one Malaria No More has developed in Odisha, which uses a multi-stakeholders and interdisciplinary approach to identify and prioritise areas of scalable and sustainable impact to improve malaria control and prevention. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imd-to-give-weather-data-for-forecasting-malaria-268386

The sources say the panel consulted principals of several schools to devise a fair criterion for alternate assessment. One of the suggestions was that students should be awarded grades on basis of marks from earlier exams. “Since the results will have to be calculated on the basis of a student’s past performance, awarding marks may not be a fair procedure,” the sources said.In other words, the CBSE may award grades like A1, A, B1, B, C1, C, D, and E. However, one will have to wait for the final decision, which the CBSE is expected to announce this week. “The expert committee set up by the CBSE has discussed giving grades as an option. The broad consensus is to factor in marks scored in Class X boards, Class XI school exams, and Class 12 pre-boards. Though the time is running out ‘viva voce’ is also an option for giving weightage to each component.“The final decision will be communicated to students soon. They will be able to check the updated criteria on the official website,” sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-may-evaluate-class-12-students-on-pre-boards-classes-11-and-10-results-268378

After a grand official welcome, the PM was embraced by Netanyahu who said in Hindi, “Aapka swagat hai mere dost.”Modi’s visit was a high diplomatic watermark in Netanyahu’s eyes who once visited India eight days before a general election in Israel as if to demonstrate to the audience back home his close rapport with world leaders despite his hardline approach to Palestinians. In the run up to the polls, PM Modi along with then US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were part of Netanyahu’s election campaign. The three leaders also featured in a campaign video that showed Netanyahu meeting them.Bennett, a long-time Netanyahu’s Cabinet colleague, became Prime Minister after a Parliamentary vote he won 60-59 in the 120-seat chamber.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-doesnt-forget-friend-netanyahu-268371
15-06-2021||New Delhi||Delta plus: New Covid variant identified, experts say no cause of concern for now||The highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has mutated further to form the ‘Delta plus’ or ‘AY.1’ variant but there is no immediate cause for concern in India as its incidence in the country is still low, scientists here said.The new Delta plus variant has been formed due to a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and one of the drivers of the deadly second wave. Though there is no indication yet of the severity of the disease due to the new variant, Delta plus is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for Covid-19 recently authorised in India.Read also: India logs 70K Covid cases, lowest since March 31, 3,921 deaths“One of the emerging variants is B.1.617.2.1 also known as AY.1 characterised by the acquisition of K417N mutation,” Vinod Scaria, clinician and scientist at Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), tweeted on Sunday.The mutation, he said, is in the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, which helps the virus enter and infect the human cells.According to Public Health England, 63 genomes of Delta (B.1.617.2) with the new K417N mutation have been identified so far on the global science initiative GISAID.In its latest report on coronavirus variants, updated till last Friday, the health agency said Delta plus was present in six genomes from India as of June 7.“The variant frequency for K417N is not much in India at this point in time. The sequences are mostly from Europe, Asia and America,” Scaria wrote on Twitter.The earliest sequence of this genome was found in Europe in late March this year.Noting that the travel histories for the variant are not readily available to make assumptions, Scaria said an important point to consider regarding K417N is the “evidence suggesting resistance to monoclonal antibodies Casirivimab and Imdevimab”.This cocktail recently received emergency-use authorization in the country from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. Drug majors Roche India and Ciplas have priced the antibody cocktail at a steep Rs 59,750 per dose.Similar to antibodies which are proteins that the body naturally produces to defend itself against the disease, monoclonal antibodies are artificially created in a lab and tailor-made to fight the disease they treat.Casirivimab and Imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells.Scaria also indicated the mutation may be associated with the ability to escape the immune response against the virus.Allaying fears, immunologist Vineeta Bal noted that while there may be some setback in the use of commercial antibody cocktail due to the new variant, resistance to the therapy is not an indication of higher virulence or severity of a disease.“How transmissible this new variant is will be a crucial factor to determine its rapid spread or otherwise,” Bal, guest faculty at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, told PTI.She also noted that the quality and quantity of neutralising antibodies, responsible for defending cells from pathogens, generated in the individual infected with the new variant is unlikely to be affected because of the mutation.“Thus in individuals catching infection with the new variant, it may not be a matter worth worrying,” she added.Pulmonologist and medical researcher Anurag Agrawal concurred.“There is no cause of concern due to the new variant in India as of now,” Agrawal, the director of CSIR-IGIB, told PTI.The scientist said the blood plasma from many fully vaccinated individuals will have to be tested against this variant to determine whether it shows any significant immune escape.As the Delta variant continues to evolve and acquire new mutations, there is a lot of interest in understanding its evolution. He said SARS-CoV-2 has a nearly constant rate of acquiring genetic variants, and each variant has acquired additional variants in a stepwise fashion.“Understanding this continued evolution is of great importance in mapping the evolutionary landscape of emerging variants. Largely the virus has tried to optimise for transmission and immune escape by step-wise acquisition of new mutations,” he added.

Though Adityanath has on an earlier occasion rejected any such plan to divide the state, saying that his government believes in “uniting and not dividing”, rumours are that a message on similar lines was conveyed to him by the leadership during his recent two-day visit to Delhi.       While Mayawati’s proposal was dismissed by most parties, including the BJP, as “political gimmick”, the saffron party is said to be “always in favour of small states formed after following proper procedure, groundwork and discussions on economic and developmental issues” for their better management and progress. Incidentally, late Ajit Singh of the Rashtriya Lok Dal was also in favour of a ‘Harit Pradesh’ being carved out in western UP, which is now the hub of farm politics in the state.Whether such an exercise is possible, or plausible, remains to be seen, the interesting part is that this speculation has also stemmed out of reports of “differences between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adityanath on various issues”. The bifurcation of the state is being seen as a way to “limit Adityanath to Purvanchal”, his key support region. Apparently the central leadership is upset over the way the high-profile Chief Minister had been managing the BJP affairs in the state and the way he has been doing his public outreach “without giving due prominence to the PM”. Much was read into PM not wishing Adityanath publicly on his birthday a couple of days back, the colour of ‘kurta’ (green) that Home Minister Amit Shah wore when Adityanath called on him in Delhi and a relatively under-toned/muted response by senior leaders to his Delhi visit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-rumours-of-ups-division-to-limit-yogi-adityanath-to-purvanchal-268349

This is not a political issue. It transcends the perimeters of politics. This is not an ordinary matter. We hope the SC will take suo motu notice of the issue and get the matter investigated,” Congress media chief Randeep Singh Surjewala said.Noting that the allegations raised are serious and pertain to purchase of Rs 2 crore land at a price of Rs 18.4 crore by functionaries of the temple.Asked if the Congress wanted temple construction to be halted till the matter was cleared, Surjewala said, “No question of halting the temple construction but any unfairness in deals must be investigated in the interest of propriety. This is a matter that concerns our faith.”The temple trust is facing allegations that within minutes it purchased a land at a much inflated price as compared to the price the original owners paid.Trust general secretary Champat Rai has already rejected the charges saying “charges have been levelled against us for years. It does not affect us.”The trust today also issued a detailed statement refuting allegations by SP, AAP and Congress and terming these allegations politically motivated.Rai said all purchases and transactions in respect of the land are being made online and are transparent and verifiable.“After the SC judgment on the temple on November 9, 2019, UP government has been buying land all over Ayodhya because of which cost of land has gone up. The piece of land under debate is located closed to the railway station. The original owners of this land signed a sale agreement with the temple trust on March 18, 2021. The original owners had registered the land at years older price,” Rai said indication current escalation of price and the purchase at a higher price.Rai said allegations in respect of the land purchase are misleading and people making these allegations are politically motivated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-temple-land-purchase-cong-seeks-sc-monitored-probe-temple-trust-rejects-charges-268326

15-06-2021||New Delhi||Chirag Paswan's uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras elected LJP's floor leader in LS||Pashupati Kumar Paras recognised as LJP floor leader in Lok Sabha, an official notification from the house said—a development that comes after five of the six Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) MPs in the Lok Sabha on Monday elected the Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras to replace Chirag Paswan as head of the party the lower house.Pashupati Kumar Paras is the brother of the late LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan.The five MPs had met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Sunday and given him a written request for appointing Paras as their leader in place of Chirag.The Lok Sabha Secretariat Monday issued a revised list of floor leaders of parties in a notification in which Paras has been listed as the leader of Lok Janshakti Party.This development, which comes less than a year after the death of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan,  marks a major shift in Bihar politics and follows the party’s big debacle in the Bihar elections, which it fought outside the NDA.Sources, meanwhile, say that “Paras or someone else from LJP” may be accommodated in the Narendra Modi cabinet in a reshuffle expected “any time soon”.   “The BJP/JD (U) leadership was not in favour of Chirag Paswan. Though he said he was not well, he was in fact told to stay away from the NDA meeting ahead of the Budget session,” sources said.While those close to Chirag are blaming the JD (U) for the split, sources say the BJP also wanted to accommodate someone other than Chirag from the party in the Central cabinet from the caste/vote base it represents.Chirag has always been a fierce critic of the JD (U) president. However, Paras on Monday lauded Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as a good leader and “vikas purush”, underlining the deep divisions within the LJP and isolation of Chirag in the party founded by his father.Paras said his group will continue to be part of the BJP-led NDA and that Chirag can remain part of the organisation. The Hajipur MP also said that he has “not broken, rather saved the party”. He said that 99 per cent of LJP workers were unhappy with Chirag’s decision to contest against JD (U)-led NDA in the 2020 Assembly polls.Meanwhile, another party MP, Veena Devi, also said that the people of Bihar wanted LJP to stay with the NDA, which is why they voted for it in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“People are angry because they voted for LJP considering it to be an ally of the NDA,” she said, adding that the party wants to be a part of the NDA both in Bihar and the Centre. “The doors are not closed for Chirag, LJP is his family’s party,” she also added.       Meanwhile, the five LJP MPs have conveyed their decision to elect Paras as their leader in the Lok Sabha to the Speaker.Interestingly, soon after Paras spoke to reporters, Chirag drove to his residence to meet him. Paswan’s cousin and MP Prince Raj also stay at the same address. However, after spending close to 90 minutes at their residence Chirag left, without speaking to the waiting media persons.  In fact, it is said, they were not even at home. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chirag-paswans-uncle-pashupati-kumar-paras-elected-ljps-floor-leader-in-ls-268306
