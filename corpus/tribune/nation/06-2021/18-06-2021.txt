18-06-2021||New Delhi||Narada case: SC agrees to hear Bengal CM, Law Minister on affidavits||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear the appeals against the Calcutta High Court order denying West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Law Minister Moloy Ghatak from filing affidavits on their role on the day of the arrest of four Trinamool Congress leaders on May 17 by the CBI in Narada case.A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian, in its order, said: “Tushar Mehta, SG has put appearance on behalf of the respondents. Let a copy of these petitions be served upon the office of the Solicitor General. At the joint request of the parties, list the matters on June 22. We hope that the High Court will not take up the matter on June 21 and June 22.” The top court asked the High Court to consider the matter after the apex court considers the appeals of the state and Ghatak against the order.A five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court on June 9, hearing the CBI’s application for transfer of the Narada sting tape case from the special CBI court to the High Court, had said it will consider later the affidavits by Banerjee and Ghatak.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for Ghatak, had said that the minister was attending the cabinet meeting and was not on the court premises at the time of the hearing. He emphasised the CBI had addressed the court virtually.The allegations levelled are that Trinamool leaders played key role in stopping the CBI from performing its legal duty after arresting four party leaders on May 17 in the case.Solicitor General Mehta had contended before the court that the affidavits cannot be accepted on the ground of delay as they were filed after the completion of his arguments. On June 9, the High Court had decided to consider later the affidavits filed by Banerjee and Ghatak.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narada-case-sc-agrees-to-hear-bengal-cm-law-minister-on-affidavits-270447

18-06-2021||Mumbai||People's laxity may bring about third wave, says Maharashtra minister||A possible third wave of the coronavirus infection could take place if people do not follow outbreak norms like maintaining hygiene and wearing masks, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said on Friday.The minister also said there may be as many as 5,000 unreported Covid-19 deaths in the state, and these would be reconciled with the overall tally after all information about them is verified.He told a regional news channel that it was not the crowd on the street that could trigger off a Covid-19 third wave, but "people not wearing masks and not following hygiene"."Nobody can exactly predict a third wave. But by wearing masks and maintaining appropriate behaviour, we can postpone its arrival and keep the impact to a minimum," Tope said.On the issue of Covid-19 deaths and the updating of unreported cases on later days, Tope said the Maharashtra government would never hide such figures, but, in some cases, private hospitals are delaying in informing local civic authorities about fatalities in their facilities."I have come to know that in some cases, the patient's death information was reported after 15 days. Sometimes, death of patients who have been shifted from one district to another gets uploaded on the system multiple times. Hence, the state government carries out a reconciliation exercise to arrive at the exact figure," Tope said."The second wave hit very hard, and all health systems came under stress. There may be some 5,000 unreported deaths in the state, which would be included in the overall report as soon as information verification is completed," Tope said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/peoples-laxity-may-bring-about-third-wave-says-maharashtra%C2%A0minister-270438
18-06-2021||New Delhi||Monuments reopen, but people not too keen to visit iconic sites||Two days after monuments across the country reopened their doors to visitors following a gap of around two months due to the coronavirus pandemic, only a handful of people have visited these sites.The iconic Taj Mahal in Uttar Pradesh’s Agra still held on to the top spot in the list of monuments with most footfall with 1,919 visitors, including 67 children, on June 16, the day of reopening, and 2,379 visitors, including 106 children, on Thursday, according to official figures.The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which reopened the over 3,000 monuments under its control in the country to the public from June 16, has not capped the number of visitors and has allowed only online booking of tickets.However, officials say the local authorities in Agra have capped the daily number to 15,000 as a precaution.Delhi’s iconic structures, which received around 8,000-10,000 visitors per day in the pre-Covid times, also saw a handful of visitors. According to the data, popular sites like the Red Fort, which was closed for five months since January, first due to a bird-flu scare and then due to the pandemic, received 112 visitors on Wednesday and 65 on Thursday.The 13th-century brick minaret, Qutub Minar, received 420 visitors on Wednesday and 527 on Thursday. Humayun’s Tomb saw 454 visitors on Wednesday and 400 on Thursday. The Safdarjung Tomb saw 32 visitors on Wednesday and 41 on Thursday.Officials in the national capital said these numbers are “encouraging” given that the country is still in the recovery mode.Other popular sites such as the twin forts in Rajasthan—Chittorgarh Fort and Kumbhalgarh Fort—received 69 and 28 visitors respectively on Wednesday. The data for Thursday for the two forts is not available.The world heritage sites of Ajanta and Ellora caves, along with three other historical monuments in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district, reopened for tourists but the footfall was far from the pre-Covid days. While the Ajanta caves and the Daulatabad Fort received just 10 visitors each, the Ellora caves had only six visitors.Unheard of during normal times, some of these sites had even less than 10 visitors combined over the two days, reflecting the sluggish mood of the country dealing with the pandemic, which has claimed over 3.8 lakh lives in India. These include the Aurangabad caves (four), the Palace of Tipu Sultan in Bengaluru (nine) and the ruined Buddhist Stupa in Amaravati (five).ASI officials say they are hopeful that things will normalise soon and as the days pass, the footfall will increase. Some states like Karnataka have held off the opening of around 500 ASI monuments till June 21, while Tamil Nadu is yet to take a call on reopening the 411 such sites in the state.

18-06-2021||New Delhi||SC stays proceedings on multiple FIRs against actress Munmun Dutta for using casteist slur in video||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed criminal proceedings in multiple FIRs lodged against actress Munmun Dutta, featuring in the TV serial ‘Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’, for allegedly using a casteist slur in a video.                            A Bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian sought response from Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra among others on the plea of actor, seeking clubbing of all the FIRs lodged in different states with the first FIR lodged at Hansi City police station at Hisar district of Haryana. The top court sought response from all the respondent states and others within six weeks. The Bench directed, “In the meantime, proceedings in the FIRs lodged in the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, New Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh shall remain stayed”.At the outset, senior advocate Puneet Bali, appearing for the actress, said that she has not used the casteist word intentionally and there was no motive of her to use the word.He said that the actress has even apologised for the word and has removed the video after realising the meaning of the word. Bali said that due to the language barrier, being a Bengali, she was unaware of the true meaning of the word.The Bench said, “Everyone knows the meaning of the word. Same word is used in Bengali and moreover she was in Kolkata when she had said this”.“Do women have better rights than men or they have equal rights,” the Bench asked.Bali said the actress was a woman who had recently lost her father and she has agreed that she has used the word but the context was different and urged the court to direct for clubbing of all the FIRs and restrain the authorities from registering similar FIRs on the same incident.The Bench, however, did not pass any order restraining the authorities from registering similar FIRs saying the petitioner can approach the court in case any fresh case is registered.                             On May 13, the Haryana Police had booked the actress, despite her issuing an apology to “every single person” who, she said, has been “unintentionally hurt” by her due to the wrong usage of the word.Dutta had claimed she used the wrong word “because of her language barrier” and added she was genuinely misinformed about its meaning. The FIR against Dutta was registered in Haryana’s Hansi town on a complaint by National Alliance for Dalit Human Rights convenor Rajat Kalsan. The Hansi police lodged the FIR against Dutta under various provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The complainant has alleged that Dutta made derogatory remarks against people belonging to the scheduled caste. Police said Kalsan had submitted a written complaint and a CD containing Dutta’s purported video to the Hansi police superintendent on May 11. Acting on the complaint, Hansi Superintendent of Police Nikita Gehlot had ordered the registration of an FIR against her. Dutta had taken to Twitter to put her side of the story.“This is in reference to a video that I posted yesterday wherein one word used by me has been misinterpreted. It was never said with the intent of insult, intimidate, humiliate or hurt anyone’s feelings. Because of my language barrier, I was genuinely misinformed about the meaning of the word,” she had said in a statement, which she also shared in Hindi.“Once I was made aware of its meaning, I immediately took the part down. I have the utmost respect for every single person from every caste, creed or gender and acknowledge their immense contribution to our society or nation,” she wrote.

18-06-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: IIT study finds traces of coronavirus in Sabarmati river, two lakes||A recent study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar has established the presence of coronavirus in water samples from the Sabarmati river and two lakes in Ahmedabad, city of Gujarat.While the study, funded by the UNICEF, did not reveal if the genes of coronavirus found in the water samples were dead or alive, Professor Manish Kumar, who led the research, has emphasised the need for further probe on the subject to avert any future tragedy.Following the revelation, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided to send samples from these water bodies to the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC)."The GBRC is the authorised agency of the AMC for water analysis. We have been sending samples to them since the last one year and they submit their report to the state government. We have no idea about the IIT's research. However, we will now send samples of these water bodies to the GBRC for a similar analysis," said Harpalsinh Zala, the AMC's city engineer for Water Resources.The study was conducted between September and December 2020 and water samples were collected from the Sabarmati river, Chandola and Kankaria lakes of the city."Our aim was to detect the presence of N, S and ORF lab genes of SARS-CoV-2, also called as coronavirus, through RNA isolation. We found N-gene copies in the waters of the Sabarmati river, Chandola and Kankaria lakes. The ORF lab-gene was not found in Chandola, while S-gene copies were present in all the three water bodies," said Kumar, who teaches in the IIT's Earth Sciences department."Although genes of coronavirus were detected, our methodology does not tell us if they were alive or dead. However, we can't just presume that they all were dead. Although virus transmission through water is not proven yet, institutions need to come together and conduct further research on this. Monitoring is needed," the professor said.He further claimed that if coronavirus genes reached the surface water through urine or excreta of Covid-19 patients, then the genes would have been dead.However, the genes might have been alive if they came from the mouth of a Covid-19 patient, such as through gargled water, he said."We do not know if genes found by us were alive or not. Further research is needed to understand the implications of our findings. Governments should also focus on better solid waste management," said Kumar, adding that the report has been submitted to the UNICEF. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-iit-study-finds-traces-of-coronavirus-in-sabarmati-river-two-lakes-270431

This was mainly due to a rise in prices of wheat atta, meat goat, fish fresh, mustard oil, groundnut oil, pulses, and vegetables and fruits.The rise and fall in the index varied from state to state.In the case of agricultural labourers, it recorded an increase of 1-17 points in 18 states and a decrease of 2-3 points in Jammu & Kashmir and Tripura, respectively. Tamil Nadu, with 1,247 points, topped the index table; whereas Himachal Pradesh, with 815 points, stood at the bottom.In the case of rural labourers, it recorded an increase of 1-14 points in 18 states and a decrease of two points each in Tamil Nadu and Tripura.

For CPI-RL, the highest rise was experienced by Maharashtra and Jammu & Kashmir (+14 points each).The rise was mainly due to a rise in the prices of rice, wheat-atta, jowar, pulses, mustard oil, groundnut oil, vegetables and fruits, fish fresh/dry, meat goat, milk, sugar, gur, shirting cloth cotton (mill), and kerosene oil.On the contrary, the highest decrease in the CPI-AL was experienced by Tripura (-3 points); and for CPI-RL, it was experienced by Tamil Nadu and Tripura (-2 points each). The fall was mainly due to a decrease in the prices of rice, onion, fish fresh, chillies green and turmeric.Labour Mininster Santosh Gangwar said in the statement: “The increase in CPI-AL and CPI-RL will have a positive impact on the income of the workers engaged in agricultural and rural sector by way of increased wages”.Labour Bureau Director General DPS Negi stated: “The increase in general index of agricultural labourers and rural labourers is mainly on account of an increase in the prices of wheat atta, meat goat, fish fresh, mustard oil, groundnut oil, pulses, vegetables and fruits, medicine, firewood and kerosene.”            Negi further elaborated that “like other price indices, CPI-AL and CPI-RL also observed an increase in inflation during the month”.

18-06-2021||---||PM has lost moral authority to rule: Kapil Sibal||New Delhi, June 18Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said on Friday Prime Minister Narendra Modi has “without doubt” lost the moral authority to rule for not standing with people in need of medical aid during the second wave of Covid-19 and for doing playing political one-upmanship in polls instead. In an interview with PTI, the former union minister launched a hard-hitting attack on the prime minister saying the lack of a credible political alternative did not mean that he should stop discharging his duties believing that his political fortunes are secure. Sibal also attacked the government for what he called its ineptness to strategise the Covid-19 vaccination, saying it borders on criminal negligence and its priorities in tackling the pandemic are “misplaced and faulty and lack sincerity”.He also said that the toolkit issue is nothing but an attempt to “deploy forgery” to divert public attention from his government’s failures. “A prime minister who should have stood with the people while they were languishing outside hospitals in need of medical aid during the pandemic, was busy playing political one-upmanship during Assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam etc, has, without doubt, lost the moral authority to rule. “There may or may not be a credible alternative but does it mean that he should stop discharging his responsibilities believing that his political fortunes are secure,” Sibal told PTI while blaming the prime minister for inaction in saving precious lives during the second wave of the pandemic. Sibal said he agreed that at present “there is definitely a void in terms of a strong political alternative” and that is why he has suggested reforms in his own party so that the country has strong and credible opposition. The senior Congress leader, who was one of the 23 leaders who had written to Sonia Gandhi suggesting the party’s overhaul, said when the whole world was doing its best to tide over the pandemic and save precious human lives, our Prime Minister was busy addressing election rallies in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Covid-19 protocols that the government under him had itself put in place were openly flouted, he alleged, saying, “I believe that is what defamed India”. He said it is so convenient for this government to pin blame on others for its “monumental failures” rather than to introspect and do the course correction in order to provide succour to those affected. “The toolkit issue is nothing but an attempt to deploy forgery to divert public attention from the Modi government’s failures in managing the coronavirus pandemic,” he said referring to the issue that has been marked as ‘manipulative media’ by Twitter leading to a tiff with the government. Sibal also alleged multiple flip-flops in the government’s vaccine policy and said India was hugely embarrassed within a short span of time from a vaccine supplier to a country that was gasping for oxygen. He also blamed the government for doing nothing to ramp up medical infrastructure between the first and the second wave that cost the country heavily and many precious lives were lost for want of medical aid including oxygen, ICU beds and medicines. The Congress leader also accused the government of doing nothing to ramp up vaccine production and said it was shocking that the first order for procurement of vaccine from foreign manufacturers was placed as late as January 2021. “Our ineptness to strategise the Covid-19 vaccination drive borders on criminal negligence. Globally, mass immunization is key to managing the pandemic. The two pillars of immunising a large population quickly and efficiently are procurement and delivery. In India, we have struggled on both fronts,” he said.Sibal alleged that the people of this country know that the priorities of this government in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic were “misplaced, faulty and lacked sincerity and that it was completely clueless and unprepared to deal with the enormity of the challenge despite expert advice and warning”. He also accused the government of cleverly shifting the burden of procurement to state governments, after having failed to timely procure vaccines and said both the decentralised model for vaccination and the new liberalized pricing model were “deeply flawed”. “Public anger resulting from vaccine shortage was deflected by the government by blaming state governments,” he said, adding the reality was that the states only wanted flexibility in vaccine distribution and not in vaccine procurement. “People dying for as basic a medical aid as oxygen was a bigger embarrassment and that actually defamed the country,” the former union minister said. He said since the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, was in force, the Union Government is solely charged with the responsibility to deal with such disasters and it cannot wash its hands off by putting forward the oft-repeated rant of health being a state subject. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-has-lost-moral-authority-to-rule-kapil-sibal-270424
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Retired ITBP canines find new role as therapy dogs near Chandigarh||After spending the prime of their lives sniffing out explosives and undertaking guard duties, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force’s (ITBP) retired K-9s are undertaking a new, compassionate role. They are being used as ‘therapy dogs’ for patients as well as for children with special needs.The dogs, settled at a specially established retirement home at the ITBP’s Basic Training Center at Bhanu, near Chandigarh, started visiting ITBP hospitals a few days ago to lend emotional support to personnel admitted there.At present, there are 10 retired ITBP dogs at the home, which was set up last year. Another 20 dogs are expected to be moved there shortly for their post-retirement life.“Trained and affectionate dogs have a strong emotional and therapeutic impact and provide patients with a welcome break from the otherwise monotonous hospital routine,” an ITBP officer said.“The playful connect established between the dogs and the special children have also been remarkable,” he added.The ITBP is now planning the dogs’ visit to a local school for special children after tying up with an NGO.Though the concept of therapy dogs is old, it is a novel venture in India. The role of a therapy dog is vastly different and at most times at odds with the combat duties, the K-9 is trained for.From being ferocious and aggressive, they now need to be docile, affectionate and playful.“Our dogs are well trained and do not attack unless ordered to by their handlers,” an ITBP veterinary officer said. “If their handler is friendly with someone, it filters down to the animal which also has its own instinct to sense the situation and behave accordingly,” he added.The ITBP is studying the psychological and medical aspects of the man-dog engagement, based upon which the role of therapy dogs could be expanded and extended to other forces as well as a handling policy and standard operating procedures would be worked out.The Central Armed Police Forces, which function under the Ministry of Home Affairs, deploy about 3,500 dogs for internal security duties. In addition, the Armed Forces also have their own dogs for security-related tasks.Recently, the ITBP raised a new unit of assault dogs, comprising Belgian Malinois and the German Shepherd breeds, which have been trained to work in packs of four to pin down enemy troopers if the force’s patrol teams are attacked.The lead dog in this group is trained to attack the neck area or the jugular vein of the prime attacker, and the remaining three dogs neutralize other members of the adversary group.They are also trained to leap into vehicles or enter buildings and disarm persons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/retired-itbp-canines-find-new-role-as-therapy-dogs-near-chandigarh-270423
18-06-2021||New Delhi||Ensure safety of healthcare workers, strictly implement Epidemic Disease Act: Centre to states||The Union Health Ministry has urged all states and Union Territories to review in detail and ensure prompt steps for the safety and wellbeing of healthcare workers while strictly implementing the amended Epidemic Disease Act.Healthcare workers are the most crucial resources in Covid-19 management on all fronts, said Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry Lav Agarwal in a letter to additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and health secretaries of all states and Union Territories.On multiple occasions, the Health Ministry has highlighted the need to ensure the safety and security of healthcare workers at their living and working premises, he said.“Our endeavours to manage Covid-19 are replete with examples of commitment by our healthcare workers at all levels. While the country at large has applauded the efforts of the health fraternity, there were examples of them being stigmatized and even violence resorted to against healthcare workers,” the officer pointed out.Recently, there have been reports of physical violence against doctors, healthcare workers and other professionals particularly from Assam, West Bengal and Karnataka, the letter by Agarwal stated.“Such incidents impact the morale of our healthcare workforce who have shown exemplary commitment against all odds in Covid-19 management.“Considering the importance of the issue, it is requested that all states may undertake a detailed review and ensure that prompt and necessary steps are taken for healthcare workers safety and wellbeing besides strict implementation of the amended Epidemic Disease Act,” he said.The joint secretary in the Health Ministry said the Centre had brought an ordinance and later notified it as an act, under which violence against healthcare personnel is a non-bailable and cognizable offence.On April 22 last year, the Health Ministry had issued an ordinance to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, providing protection to healthcare personnel and their property against violence during epidemics. It was notified as an act on September 29, 2020.The amended Act states that “whoever commits or abets the commission of an act of violence against healthcare service personnel, or causes damage or loss to any property” shall be punished with imprisonment and with a fine. Such offences are also cognizable and non-bailable, the letter highlighted.

18-06-2021||New Delhi||Karnataka: BJP in quandary over Yeddiyurappa||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddiyurappa is no stranger to controversies and allegations. In 2011, he was forced to resign as CM and also spend time in prison after being indicted in a scam, though later he was acquitted of all charges. But as he battles yet another bout of dissent and charges of corruption, this time this fight could be the toughest ever.While state BJP chief Nalin Kumar Kateel has again ruled out the possibility of a leadership change, senior Minister KS Eshwarappa was quoted as saying that a section believes Yediyurappa should be replaced. All this while general secretary in-charge Arun Singh is visiting the state, his second visit in the past 10 days amid speculations about a leadership change.  Singh has ruled out any discussions on the change of leadership and asked also leaders to refrain from commenting on the party affairs in open after an MLC and some others levelled allegations against the CM. H Vishwanath, a member of the state legislative council (MLC), said everyone respects the leadership and contribution of Yeddiyurappa but he does not have the “spirit and strength to run the government because of the age and health factor”.“All ministers are unhappy with the Yediyurappa government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is constantly telling us dynastic rule is dangerous. What is going on in Karnataka is the same thing,” he was quoted as saying.  Amid open dissent, corruption charges, and demand to remove the 78-year-old BJP stalwart, sources say Singh is “assessing the extent of the crisis/damage in the state unit” and will present his report to the central leadership.   Notably, much of the anger against the CM stems from alleged interference in administration by his son, BY Vijayendra, who has termed the charges “politically motivated”.A section believes he is hurting the party’s chances of expanding and grooming new faces. While Yediyurappa is batting for his son, the BJP, which has made dynasty politics the centrepiece of its politics against Congress, may not be conducive to the idea of promoting him despite the all-powerful Lingayat community backing.Sources say the BJP leadership understands that continued restiveness may damage its prospects in the 2023 elections but to remove Yeddiyurappa is not so easy even though he has already passed the unofficial 75-year age policy for ministers.  Credited with the first-ever saffron government in the south, the BJP stalwart belongs to the Lingayat community which accounts for 17 per cent of the state population. He also enjoys strong links with RSS and any attempt to antagonise him may jeopardise the party. In 2012, he split the state unit and formed the Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP). Though KJP won only six seats in 2013 elections, Yeddiyurappa managed to get a vote share of 9.8 per cent and restrict BJP to 40 seats in the 224-member Assembly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-bjp-in-quandary-over-yeddiyurappa-270418
18-06-2021||London||Indian murder accused Jaysukh Ranpariya extradition trial set for May 2022||Jaysukh Ranpariya, wanted in India for murder and around 50 criminal offences, is set to face an extradition trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London in May next year.The 41-year-old, also known as Jayesh Patel, has not made a bail application and remains in custody at Belmarsh prison in south-east London.His next appearance in court via video link is scheduled for July 14, with a case management hearing set for January next year, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said this week."Mr Ranpariya's extradition hearing has been fixed for three weeks starting on 26 May 2022. Mr Ranpariya did not make a bail application and remains remanded in custody,” the CPS said.“There will be a call over hearing on 14 July 2021. There is also a further case management hearing on 25 January [2022] when further directions will be considered,” it said.According to the Metropolitan Police in London, Ranpariya was arrested on March 16 in Sutton, south London, under an international arrest warrant issued the same day on behalf of the Indian authorities.The UK received a provisional extradition request from the Indian authorities for Ranpariya on charges of conspiracy to murder dating back to April 2018.The Interpol had issued a Red Corner Notice against Ranpariya to alert countries to take him into custody as the Gujarat police sought to trace and arrest the fugitive as part of its inquiries into crimes dating back over three years.At a previous hearing in the case, the CPS, appearing on behalf of the Indian authorities, told District Judge Timothy Godfrey that the accused is wanted in India for a “pre-planned conspiracy” to hire a contract killer for Rs 3 crore for the murder of prosecuting lawyer Kirit Joshi in April 2018.The court also heard that at the time of Ranpariya's arrest in March in London, he was found in possession of “several fraudulent identity documents and bank cards”.While he made no application for bail, the CPS had said it will be opposing bail on the grounds that he would fail to surrender and that he has no community ties in Britain – where he has been living by himself, as his wife remains in India.A more detailed warrant of charges against Ranpariya is expected to cover his alleged links to organised crime groups in India.He is contesting his extradition and will remain in judicial custody and produced via videolink every 28 days until the full hearing in May next year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-murder-accused-jaysukh-ranpariya-extradition-trial-set-for-may-2022-270415
18-06-2021||Kolkata||Suvendu Adhikari submits petition to speaker seeking Mukul Roy’s disqualification as MLA||Leader of the opposition in Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari on Friday submitted a petition to Speaker Biman Banerjee seeking disqualification of Mukul Roy’s membership in the House under the anti-defection law as he has recently crossed over from the BJP to the TMC, a senior leader in the saffron party said.The TMC, in response, insisted that the opposition leader should request his father and parliamentarian Sisir Adhikari to lead by example, as he, too, switched over to the BJP from the Mamata Banerjee camp ahead of the assembly polls.The speaker, when contacted, however, said he won’t be able to say anything about the petition for now as he was yet to visit the Assembly.“We have submitted a letter to the Speaker seeking disqualification of MLA Mukul Roy’s membership in the House.He had won the election on a BJP ticket, but joined the TMC subsequently. Therefore, as per law, he should resign. We have requested the Speaker to look into the matter,” saffron party MLA Manoj Tigga said.Earlier this month, Roy rejoined the TMC, of which he was once the second-in-command, following his three-and-a-half year-long stint in the BJP.He had contested the March-April assembly polls on a BJP ticket and bagged the Krishnanagar Uttar seat.Adhikari, a few days ago, had met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to complain about Roy.Takiing to Twitter, Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta, who had unsuccessfully contested the assembly election on a BJP ticket, said the law demands that he resign as MLA as he was elected on the BJP symbol.“Last week Mukul Roy joined AITC in presence of @MamataOfficial. There was no ambiguity over his defection.Politics will take its course, but law demands he resign as MLA elected on BJP symbol. Let him follow his own course of resigning from Rajya Sabha in 2017 before joining BJP,” Dasgupta tweeted.Making light of BJP’s assertions, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh, said the leader of opposition should ask his father Sisir Adhikari, who joined the saffron camp in March, to “resign as our party MP before lecturing others”.Sharing a similar view, TMC Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said the BJP, which has formed government in other states by “poaching MLAs” from others parties, shouldn’t be the one giving sermons on the anti-defection law.“The TMC has not forced anyone to join the party, unlike the BJP. The BJP in other states have used every trick—from threats to intimidation—to poach MLAs of other parties,” he added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suvendu-adhikari-submits-petition-to-speaker-seeking-mukul-roys-disqualification-as-mla-270412
18-06-2021||Mumbai||Four held for fraudulent Covid-19 vaccination camp at Mumbai housing society||Mumbai police have arrested four persons for allegedly duping a housing society in suburban Kandivali by organising a Covid-19 vaccination camp fraudulently in the name of a private hospital, an official said on Friday.In a complaint submitted to the police, the Hiranandani Heritage Residents Welfare Association (HHRWA) had said that a vaccination camp was arranged by the residential complex on May 30.But later it found that the Co-WIN portal did not have any record of the people who participated and they received certificates in the name of different hospitals.The members had also expressed fears that the vaccine administered could be spurious.“Police have arrested four persons, who were involved in organising the Covid-19 vaccination camp at the housing society. Besides them, one more person, who had procured vaccines for the camp has been detained at a railway station in Madhya Pradesh and a team of Mumbai police bringing him to the city,” Additional Commissioner of Police (North) Dilip Sawant said.It has also come to light that the members of the racket had organised vaccination camps at nine other places, he said, adding that the investigation into it is on.According to another official, the incident had come to light after around 390 residents of the housing society located on SV Road got the certificates of three different organisations for getting the jabs through Co-WIN app.The vaccination camp was organised at the club house of the society on May 30 and each member had paid Rs 1,260 per vaccine, he said, adding that the society had collectively paid a total of Rs 4.56 lakh to the camp organisers.When the vaccinated members asked for vaccination certificate, the organiser sought details of the members.However, after getting certificates of three different organisations, a society member, who was one of the participants of the drive, approached Kandivali police station and filed a complaint against the organisers, the official said.“The complaint said that the organisers gave vaccines to the members from the vials whose seals were already removed,” he said.Based on the complaint, an FIR under sections 268 (public nuisance), 270 (malignant act which is likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life), 274 (adulteration of drugs), 275 (sale of adulterated drugs), 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery) and others, as well as relevant sections of IT Act and Epidemic Diseases Act, was registered, he said.During the investigation, it came to light that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had not given permission to organise such a camp and no medical officer was present during the drive, the official said.“It also seems that the vaccine used in the camp was not sourced from authorised persons and no Covid-19 related norms were followed,” he said.After a detailed investigation, police arrested four persons in the case, he said, adding that the arrested accused includes a male organiser of the vaccination camp, and other persons, who had issued fake vaccination certificates after obtaining personal data of the vaccinated members.

18-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre taking pro-active steps to help woman for son’s medical treatment in Australia: HC||The Delhi High Court on Friday noted that the Centre was taking pro-active steps in providing all possible help to a mother who has sought direction to provide medical assistance and supervise the treatment of her son suffering from a life-threatening health condition in Australia.The court was informed by the Centre that visa and travel exemption approval form, required due to the Covid-19 global pandemic, has been granted by the Australian embassy to the mother.“In view of the above, I find the government is taking pro-active steps in the matter. The writ petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to file a fresh petition in case the need arises,” Justice Navin Chawla said.Centre government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul informed the court that though visa and travel exemption has been granted to the woman, they have now received a fresh application from the family seeking to arrange for repatriation of the son to India.He said the government is looking into the issue and extending all possible help to the family.Advocate Gurinder Pal Singh, representing the woman, said repatriation of the son is an alternate prayer considering that there are no flights to Australia and even after visa clearance, the mother will be unable to go there.The Centre had earlier also told the court that the Indian Consulate was looking in the matter and three officers have been dedicated for it to provide best possible help and that an Indian origin doctor has also been asked to visit the patient in the hospital in Australia.The woman, a widow, has sought direction to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to provide all medical assistance and supervise the treatment of her son who is hospitalised in Melbourne with end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis and is in a critical situation.The woman, Inderjeet Kaur, said her son Arshdeep Singh had gone to Australia in 2018 to pursue higher studies on a student visa and on June 9, 2021, she came to know that he has been admitted to a hospital there.She submitted that she along with a relative has already applied for an urgent visa and sought direction to the MEA to extend help and facilitate them in getting tourist visa from the Australian High Commission, so that she can reach there as soon as possible to look after her son.The plea said they have also submitted their travel exemption approval form required due to the Covid-19 global pandemic.It said despite there being extreme urgency, the petitioners have not heard anything on their visa applications nor there has been any response either from the Australian High Commission in India or from the MEA.

18-06-2021||New Delhi||SC judge recuses from hearing plea by kin of two BJP workers killed in WB in poll-related violence||Supreme Court Judge Justice Indira Banerjee on Friday recused from hearing a plea field by kin of two Bharatiya Janata Party workers, who were killed in poll-related violence on May 2 in West Bengal, seeking court-monitored probe and transfer of cases to CBI or Special Investigation Team (SIT).As soon as the matter was taken up Justice Indira Banerjee said: “I have some difficulty in hearing this matter. Let this matter be listed before another bench”.The vacation bench also comprising Justice MR Shah ordered, “List the matter before another bench in which Justice Banerjee is not part”.The top court on May 18 had agreed to hear the matter and sought responses from Centre and West Bengal government on the plea filed by Biswajit Sarkar, whose elder brother was killed and co-petitioner Swaranalata Adhikari, whose husband was killed in poll related violence.They have contended that this is a very serious case and state has not been taking any action into the brutal killing of two BJP workers, which happened on the day of counting of votes for assembly elections in the state. They have said that this is a matter which requires probe by an agency like CBI or a SIT under court’s supervision, as the state police has not been taking any action despite a complaint being made. The plea filed by advocate Sarad Kumar Singhania alleged that Abhijit Sarkar, was killed on May 2, by a mob comprising 20 supporters of the All India Trinamool Congress party.It said that the mob entered the house of Biswajit Sarkar, dragged his elder brother (Abhijit) and killed him in front of his mother and other family members.“Petitioner No.1 (Biswajit Sarkar), his mother who was also molested are the eye witnesses of this gruesome murder, while Petitioner No.2 (Swaranalata Adhikari)  is the widow of Haran Adhikari, who was a local booth worker at Booth No.199A at Sonarpur Dakshin Vidhan Sabha.He was attacked with bricks, sticks, spades, and shovels at his home and brutally killed in the presence of his 80 year old father, who was also kicked”, the plea said. It said that the Petitioners, who are both victims and eye witnesses have been constrained to invoke the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking fair investigation by a Court appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) into the murders and large scale incidents of violence unleashed at the behest of a particular political party. The plea said that the court should also examine “the failure of the State administration which while identifying itself with this vengeful cause of the ruling political party in the State has chosen to turn a blind eye leaving victims of these crimes remediless as the entire genocidal attacks are part of a well thought of political design of the party in power to take political revenge after declaration of results of assembly elections on May 2, 2021”.It further said that there are series of such well planned attacks with the active connivance, knowledge, support and at times participation of the local police under the instructions of the State Government. The plea also sought direction to monitor the investigation, trial and the progress of criminal cases emanating from the incident and attacks occurring in the aftermath of the assembly elections in the state of West Bengal. It also sought transfer of two murder cases registered in police station Narkeldanga and Sonarpur to be transferred to CBI or such another SIT as may be appointed by this court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-judge-recuses-from-hearing-plea-by-kin-of-two-bjp-workers-killed-in-wb-in-poll-related-violence-270399

The accused started blackmailing her using her objectionable photos and forced her to marry him. He even forced her to undergo an abortion during their courtship,” he told reporters.The girl, who was under the impression that Qureshi is a Christian, learnt about the accused and his faith around a year ago when a “nikah” ceremony was organised instead of a Christian wedding after she agreed to marry him, the official said.After marriage, the accused first changed her name and then started forcing her to convert, Vala said, adding that the accused also verbally abused the victim using casteist slurs.

We deny any such incident having taken place,” the High Commission said."The Indian Navy is a highly disciplined and professional force which discharges its responsibilities in an impeccable manner,” it said in a statement.India is firmly committed to addressing all fishermen-related issues between India and Sri Lanka in a humanitarian manner through established bilateral mechanisms and understandings, it added.After the media reports, Secretary to the Fisheries Ministry Indu Rathnayake told the local media here that a discussion will be held with India after the report is investigated.Indian fishermen have also alleged in the past that the Sri Lanka Navy attacked them.In October last year, a leader of the fishermen claimed that groups of Indian fishermen were attacked by the Sri Lankan Navy personnel using bottles and stones while fishing near Dhanushkodi, resulting in injuries to some and damage to their gear.Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each other's waters. The fishermen issue has become a major irritant in the bilateral ties.In January, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visited Sri Lanka and met with Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda. He raised the fishermen issue and reviewed bilateral cooperation in fisheries.Later, a three-member committee was appointed by the Sri Lankan government which will make recommendations on measures to stop alleged poaching by Indian fishermen inside the country's waters after four people were killed when an Indian trawler capsized after colliding with a Sri Lankan Navy vessel. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blatantly-false-india-denies-attack-claim-on-sri-lankan-fishermen-by-indian-navy-270381

18-06-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||20-year-old Gujarat-origin woman part of Israel’s defence forces team that attacked Gaza||Israeli aircraft in the early hours of Wednesday struck Hamas sites in Gaza after incendiary balloons were launched from the Palestinian enclave in the first such attacks since a ceasefire ended 11 days of deadly fighting last month.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) team involved in carrying out the strikes includes a woman of Gujarati origin, Nitsha Muliyasha.According to Ahmedabad Mirror, the 20-year-old Nitsha belongs to a Gujarati family which originally hails from Kothari, a small village near Rajkot in Gujarat. Her family has been settled in Tel Aviv for years now. Nitsha is the first person of Gujarati origin to be inducted into the army. There are 45 Gujarati families in total residing in Israel, most of them are involved in the diamond trade.Speaking about his daughter, Nitsha’s father Zeevabhai Muliyasha credited the Israeli education system. “The schooling prepares them for a series of tests to gauge their aptitude and skills, thus helping them choose an appropriate course and career,” Zeevabhai was quoted as saying.According to the report, Nitsha is trained in the use of modern weapons and multidimensional manoeuvres on the battlefield. “Once her 2.4 years tenure with the army ends, she will be required to sign an agreement for a five-year or 10-year period, during which she can pursue engineering, medicine or a course of her choice as per merit. The army will bear the full cost of her education,” her father said.“She has been posted along the border with Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt in the past two years. At present, she is posted in Gush Dan as the Israeli forces have been conducting counterattacks,” her father said.He said while they are proud of Nitsha, they miss her a lot.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/20-year-old-gujarat-origin-woman-part-of-israels-defence-forces-team-that-attacked-gaza-270371
18-06-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court refuses to cancel, postpone postgraduate final-year medical exams||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to direct the medical universities to cancel or postpone the final year Post Graduate exams on the grounds that the examinee-doctors have been engaged in Covid duty.A vacation bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah said it could not pass any general order to all the universities not to conduct or postpone the final year postgraduate medical examination.The top court noted that the National Medical Council (NMC) had already issued an advisory in April asking the universities in the country to take the Covid situation into consideration while announcing the dates for final-year examination.“We have interfered where it was possible like postponing by one month the INI CET examination conducted by AIIMS, New Delhi, where we have found that there was no justification in fixing the date for the examination without giving appropriate time to students to prepare,” the bench said.It rejected the submission of senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for 29 doctors, who have filed the writ petition that NMC be directed to issue directions to all the universities to give reasonable time to students for preparing for the examination.“We don't know what could be the reasonable time for preparing for the examination. How can the court decide the reasonable time? Everyone may have their reasonable time. Let the university decide on the basis of the advisory of NMC as per the pandemic situation prevailing in their area,” the bench said.The top court said, “In a vast country like India, the pandemic situation cannot be the same. In April-May the situation in Delhi was very bad but now it is hardly 200 cases per day. In Karnataka, however, the situation is not that good even now. Therefore, we cannot pass any general order without hearing the universities.”Advocate Gaurav Sharma, appearing for NMC, said that not all doctors were engaged in Covid duty and the council had issued an advisory in April to all the universities to hold the examination after taking into consideration the Covid situation in their respective areas.Hegde said that since the doctors were engaged in Covid duty, they were not able to prepare for the examination which would enable them to become senior resident doctors.At the outset, the bench clarified that it is not allowing the doctors to be promoted without appearing for the examination.

Petrol in the city is now priced at Rs 100.17 per litre and diesel at Rs 92.97.Bengaluru is the third metro city to see Rs 100 per litre petrol price. Mumbai on May 29 became the first metro in the country where petrol was being sold at over Rs 100 a litre.

Also, the rupee has weakened against the US dollar, making imports costlier.Below are the rates:Delhi:  Petrol Rs 96.93 per litre; diesel Rs 87.69 per litrePunjab: Petrol Rs 98.6 per litre; diesel:  Rs 90.22 per litreHimachal: Petrol Rs 94.64 per litre; diesel:  Rs 87.2 per litreHaryana: Petrol Rs 92.78 per litre; diesel:  Rs 88.13 per litreJ-K:  Petrol Rs 97.95 per litre; diesel:  Rs 88.41 per litreChandigarh: Petrol Rs 93.22 per litre; diesel Rs 87.34 per litreKolkata: Petrol Rs 96.84 per litre; diesel Rs 90.54 per litreChennai: Petrol Rs 98.14 per litre; diesel Rs 92.31 per litreBengaluru: Petrol Rs 100.17 per litre; diesel Rs 92.97 per litreJaipur: Petrol Rs 103.57 per litre; diesel Rs 96.69 per litrePatna: Petrol Rs 99 per litre; diesel Rs 93.01 per litreThe difference in prices in states and cities are on account of local taxes like VAT or freight charges.with inputs from PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petrol-crosses-rs-103-in-mumbai-rs-100-in-8-other-states-check-latest-rates-in-your-city-270337

18-06-2021||New Delhi||55.7% kids, 63.5% adults with antibodies: AIIMS||In the first national evidence that a probable third wave of Covid-19 may not affect children more, AIIMS, New Delhi, researchers have found antibodies against SARS-Cov2 virus in more than 55 per cent of the children and over 60 per cent adults surveyed during the second wave.The findingsExperts have reported large-scale Covid spread through the ferocious second wave finding antibodies to the virus in three out of five rural people surveyed. “Hopefully high levels of infections in parts may ward off a potential third wave,” they say. Set for publication in peer reviewed journals, the study, in a first, also reveals that children and adults are equally susceptible to Covid-19.Data for the ongoing study was collected from urban and rural areas of Delhi, Faridabad, Gorakhpur, Bhubaneshwar and Agartala between March 15 and June 10.It revealed SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity rate of 55.7 per cent among children (under 18 years), 63.5 per cent among adults (over 18 years) and 62.3 per cent in the rural population.“SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity rate among children was high as comparable to adults. It is unlikely that any future third wave by prevailing Covid-19 variant will disproportionately affect children two years or older,” said AIIMS New Delhi’s Puneet Misra, lead author of the paper which reported Covid prevalence in children under 10 for the first time.The ICMR’s December 2020 survey had covered 10 to 17 year olds finding 25 per cent infection rate, similar to adults.The AIIMS research shows that during the second wave, Faridabad (rural) had a seroprevalence of 59.3 per cent across children and adults.The school going age group in south Delhi had a high seroprevalence rate of 73.9 per cent as against 74.8 per cent in adults. “Gorakhpur rural has a very high seroprevalence of 87.9 per cent (80.6 per cent in 2 to 18 year olds and 90.3 per cent in adults). Hopefully these levels of infection should ward off any third wave,” researchers say as the proportion of people susceptible to infection narrows.Importantly, among children, while 2-4 year olds and 5-9 year segment had identical sero-positivity (42.4 per cent and 43.8 per cent), those aged 10 to 17 had 60.3 p per cent prevalence. The study found a slightly higher sero-positivity rate in female children and a wide Covid spread in kids.Where the second national survey in August 2020 had reported 9 per cent Covid prevalence in 10-17 year olds, AIIMS has reported 60.3 per cent — multifold rise. The study covered 4,509 persons (700 children; 3,809 adults).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/55-7-kids-63-5-adults-with-antibodies-aiims-270024

Dhankhar also met President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday morning, but none of them said what was discussed during the meeting.Banerjee claimed there had been no incident of political violence in the state after the Assembly poll.

Some universities want incoming foreign students to be re-vaccinated by versions of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Some others want students to be pre-vaccinated only by WHO-approved vaccines.US universities are citing lack of data on efficacy and safety of these vaccines as the reason for insisting on students being asked to re-vaccinate before the start of the autumn semester. Pointing out that there is no uniformity in the requirements by universities, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “Everyone concerned is interested in ensuring that the students are able to reach the universities and undertake regular classes.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-in-talks-with-american-varsities-over-vaccine-precondition-270026

The Ghazipur district authorities say there were many bystanders along the banks who also heard the infant’s whimpers. But it was Gullu who jumped into the Ganga and brought the child to safety.Geeta Shrivastava, convener of the district child welfare committee, today said the child had now been placed for care at the sick newborn care unit in the Ghazipur district hospital and would now be under the protection of the state.Gullu, meanwhile, said he would have liked to adopt the girl. “I have a daughter and two sons.

18-06-2021||New Delhi||CBSE goes with 30:30:40 formula||Ending uncertainty over the method of calculating marks or grades of Class XII students following cancellation of their examinations due to Covid, the Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the CBSE and the CISCE formulae to evaluate pupils and publish their results next month.“After perusing the scheme presented by the Boards, prima facie, we have no hesitation in accepting the same and permit them to proceed on that basis,” a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar said. According to the scheme presented to the court, Class X, XI and XII marks will be considered in 30:30:40 ratio to prepare the final CBSE Class XII results, which would be declared by July 31.Reappear chancePresenting a set of “objective criteria” of evaluation of Class XII students, Attorney General KK Venugopal said marks in best of three subjects would be considered for the purpose for Class X, XI and XII. While 30 per cent weightage would be given for Class X and XII, it would be 40 per cent for Class XII, he said. For Class XII, the marks obtained in unit test or mid-term or pre-board examinations will be considered while 20 marks will be given for practical exams.CISCE’s 6-yr assessmentThere will be a moderation committee to examine the difference in marking mechanism adopted by schools, Venugopal told the court. Schools are required to form a result committee to consider the marks of a student in the three examinations, and it would be vetted by the CBSE moderation committee, he explained.The CBSE said the historical performance of the school, in terms of the best overall performance in the previous three years’ board examination, would be taken as the reference for moderating the marks assessed by the schools for 2020-21. The CBSE said if a student wasn’t able to meet the qualifying criterion, he/she would be placed in “essential repeat” or “compartment” category.However, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) proposed a different set of criteria to compute marks based on performance of students in the last six years and declare results by July 20.The CISCE evaluation formula takes into account marks percentage in Class X board examinations, the project and practical work in subjects, performance of candidates in the school examinations in the subjects in Class XI and XII, measured through their best marks obtained in the two years (referred to as raw marks) and the best performance of the school in the last six years.It has said that assessment of students would be done based on their marks obtained in Class X examination, performance in school examinations in Class XI and XII along with practical and performance of school in the last six years. The CISCE said among the factors used in the computation include best year for school (from 2015 to 2020); the best year for a school is the year when the school achieved the best average percentage in terms of the total scores (out of 500).The SC said it would hear petitions seeking cancellation of state board examinations for Class XII in Punjab, Assam, Tripura and AP on June 21.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-goes-with-303040-formula-269973
18-06-2021||New Delhi||CBSE: Schools’ past performance to count||The CBSE today said marks in Class X, XI and XII will be considered in 30:30:40 ratio to compute the final result of Class XII students. More importantly, however, the final assessment will also depend on a school’s past performance in Board examinations. The CBSE said institutions will be required to “moderate the marks” to account for school-level variation by using a reliable reference standard based on “historical performance”. The total marks awarded should be in consonance with the past performance of the school in Class XII board examination, it said.Crucial components for evaluationAccording to the CBSE, since marks of Class XI and XII component will be awarded at the school level, they will strictly not be comparable across schools due to the variations in the quality of question papers, evaluation standards, mode of conduct, etc. Therefore, to ensure standardisation, each school will have to internally “moderate the marks to account for school-level variation by using a reliable reference standard”. For this, “historical performance” of the school, in terms of the best overall performance in the previous three years’ Board examination, will be taken as the reference for moderating the marks assessed by the school for 2020-21. Subject-wise marks assessed should be “within a range of plus/minus 5 marks obtained by a student in the school in a particular subject in the reference year. “However, the overall average marks of the school assessed in 2020-21 should not exceed the overall average marks obtained by the school by 2 marks in the specific reference year,” it said. Computation of theory marks would be based on performance in one or more unit tests, mid-term or pre-Board exams.Mixed response||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-schools-past-performance-to-count-269974

Further, the “murderers” called up Vaze and Sharma right after killing Hiren on March 4, it said.The case was originally registered on February 15 under various sections of the IPC and Explosive Substances Act related to recovery of explosives in a Scorpio car at Carmichael Road in Mumbai.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-encounter-specialist-arrested-in-antilia-case-269988
18-06-2021||New Delhi/Zurich||Indians' funds in Swiss banks rise to over Rs 20,000 crore||Funds parked by Indian individuals and firms in Swiss banks, including through India-based branches and other financial institutions, jumped to 2.55 billion Swiss francs (over Rs 20,700 crore) in 2020 on a sharp surge in holdings via securities and similar instruments, though customer deposits fell, annual data from Switzerland's central bank showed on Thursday.The increase in aggregate funds of Indian clients with Swiss banks, from 899 million Swiss francs (Rs 6,625 crore) at the end of 2019, reverses a two-year declining trend and has taken the figure to the highest level in 13 years.It stood at a record high of nearly 6.5 billion Swiss francs in 2006, after which it has been mostly on a downward path, except for a few years including in 2011, 2013 and 2017, as per the Swiss National Bank (SNB) data.The total amount of CHF 2,554.7 million (Rs 20,706 crore), described by the SNB as 'total liabilities' of Swiss banks or 'amounts due to' their Indian clients at the end of 2020, included CHF 503.9 million (over Rs 4,000 crore) in customer deposits, CHF 383 million (over Rs 3,100 crore) held via other banks, CHF 2 million (Rs 16.5 crore) through fiduciaries or trusts and the highest component of CHF 1,664.8 million (nearly Rs 13,500 crore) as 'other amounts due to customers' in form of bonds, securities and various other financial instruments.While the funds classified as 'customer account deposits' have actually declined from CHF 550 million at the end of 2019 and those through fiduciaries also more than halved from CHF 7.4 million, the money held via other banks rose sharply from CHF 88 million in this period.However, the biggest difference has been a surge in 'other amounts due to customers' from India, which rose over six times from CHF 253 million at 2019-end.All four components had declined during 2019. These are official figures reported by banks to the SNB and do not indicate the quantum of the much-debated alleged black money held by Indians in Switzerland.These figures also do not include the money that Indians, NRIs or others might have in Swiss banks in names of third-country entities.According to the SNB, its data for 'total liabilities' of Swiss banks towards Indian clients takes into account all types of funds of Indian customers at Swiss banks, including deposits from individuals, banks and enterprises. This includes data for branches of Swiss banks in India, as also non-deposit liabilities.On the other hand, the 'locational banking statistics' of the Bank for International Settlement (BIS), which have been described in the past by Indian and Swiss authorities as a more reliable measure for deposits by Indian individuals in Swiss banks, show an increase of nearly 39 per cent during 2020 in such funds to US$ 125.9 million (Rs 932 crore).This figure takes into account deposits as well as loans of Indian non-bank clients of Swiss-domiciled banks and had shown an increase of 7 per cent in 2019, after declining by 11 per cent in 2018 and by 44 per cent in 2017.It peaked at over US$ 2.3 billion (over Rs 9,000 crore) at the end of 2007.Swiss authorities have always maintained that assets held by Indian residents in Switzerland cannot be considered as 'black money' and they actively support India in its fight against tax fraud and evasion.An automatic exchange of information in tax matters between Switzerland and India has been in force since 2018. Under this framework, detailed financial information on all Indian residents having accounts with Swiss financial institutions since 2018 was provided for the first time to Indian tax authorities in September 2019 and this is to be followed every year.In addition to this, Switzerland has been actively sharing details about accounts of Indians suspected to have indulged in financial wrongdoings after submission of prima facie evidence. Such exchange of information has taken place in hundreds of cases so far.Overall, customer deposits in all Swiss banks rose in 2020 to nearly CHF 2 trillion, which included over CHF 600 billion of foreign customer deposits.While the UK topped the charts for foreign clients' money in Swiss banks at CHF 377 billion, it was followed by the US (CHF 152 billion) at the second spot -- the only two countries with 100-billion-plus client funds.Others in the top 10 were West Indies, France, Hong Kong, Germany, Singapore, Luxembourg, Cayman Islands and Bahamas.India was placed at 51st place, ahead of countries like New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, Mauritius, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Among BRICS nations, India stood below China and Russia, but above South Africa and Brazil.Others placed above India included Netherlands, UAE, Japan, Australia, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Ireland, Turkey, Mexico, Austria, Greece, Egypt, Canada, Qatar, Belgium, Bermuda, Kuwait, South Korea, Portugal, Jordan, Thailand, Seychelles, Argentina, Indonesia, Malaysia and Gibraltar.The countries for which Swiss banks reported a decline in amounts due to clients included the US and UK, while the money parked by individuals and enterprises from Bangladesh also declined during 2020.However, the amount almost doubled in the case of Pakistan to over CHF 642 million.Just like India, the issue of alleged black money in Swiss banks has been a political hot potato in the two neighbouring countries as well.As per the SNB, there were 243 banks in Switzerland at the end of 2020.

18-06-2021||New Delhi||Possible third Covid wave unlikely to affect children, WHO-AIIMS survey reveals||A third possible wave in India by the prevailing Covid-19 virus variant is unlikely to disproportionately affect children than adults, a seroprevalence study conducted by the World Health Organisation and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has revealed.The SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity rate among children was high and were comparable to the adult population in the survey, which conducted in five-selected states with a total sample size of 10,000.Data of 4,500 participants were taken for the results of the time of midterm analysis from four states of India and more results are likely to come in the next two to three months. It was found that in resettlement colonies in South Delhi's urban areas which have a very congested population had a very high (highest reported yet in any sero-assessment) seroprevalence of 74.7 per cent, Dr Puneet Misra, Professor of Community Medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi, who led the survey said.Even before the second wave, children below the age of 18 in South Delhi had as much seroprevalence (73.9 per cent) as the below 18 years (74.8 per cent)."These areas in Delhi and NCR (Faridabad) may have higher seroprevalence after the intense second wave. Probably, these levels of seroprevalence may be protective against any 'Third wave'," Dr Misra said."In congested Urban areas of Delhi, since children already have high seroprevalence, opening schools, may after all not be a very risky proposition. During the second wave, the NCR region of Faridabad (rural area) has a seroprevalence of 59.3 per cent (almost equal in both age groups), could be considered high compared to previous national surveys," the survey said.Gorakhpur Rural has a very high seroprevalence of 87.9 per cent (2-18 years) with 80.6 per cent and above 18 years with 90.3 per cent. These levels are likely to ward off the "third wave". The survey says Gorakhur is mostly affected in rural areas that means more chances of herd immunityThe accelerated peaks and precipitous decline in Covid-19 cases in Both Delhi and Uttar Pradesh could be explained partially by these findings.Overall, more than half (62.3 per cent) of the rural population surveyed showed evidence of past infection.The Agartala Rural site had the least seroprevalence (51.9 per cent) probably because it also included some tribal population which generally have lower mobility resulting in lower vulnerability to infection.

We have taken average from past six years and not three years like the CBSE," ICSE counsel said, adding results would be declared by July 30.The Supreme Court in principle accepted the scheme proposed by both CBSE and ICSE, saying no prejudice would be caused to students who want to appear for exams. "After hearing counsel for the parties, we have already accepted the decision taken by the boards and placed before us. Students who want to appear can do so," the Bench said in its order."We have no reservation in accepting the scheme and the board can proceed with the same," it said.However, the top court said it would take up the matter again on Monday to consider additional suggestions.The Centre had on June 1 cancelled Class 12 examinations in view of the Covid pandemic.While hearing a PIL on the issue, the top court had on June 3 asked the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) to place on record in two weeks “well-defined objective criteria” for assessment of students.Explaining the CBSE evaluation scheme submitted in an affidavit, Venugopal said there would be a Result Committee for each school to rule out advantage to students in schools that traditionally gave high marks to their students.There will also be a Moderation Committee to examine the difference in marking mechanism adopted by schools, he said.Schools are required to form a Result Committee to consider the marks of a student in the three examinations, and it would be vetted by the Moderation committee of CBSE, he explained. The top court said it would hear petitions seeking cancellation of state board examinations for Class XII in Punjab, Assam, Tripura and Andhra Pradesh on June 21, the next date of hearing.Eighteen states have cancelled the Class XII Board examinations and six have already conducted the examinations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-to-adopt-303040-formula-for-evaluation-of-class-12-marks-to-declare-result-by-july-31-269830

Holding that right to protest is a fundamental right which can't be termed as a ‘terrorist act’, the Delhi High Court had on Tuesday granted bail to the three student activists who faced charges under various provisions of the IPC and the UAPA.The high court had said it was constrained to note that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters may get out of hand, “the State has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’. If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril.”Terming as "somewhat vague" the definition of 'terrorist act' under the UAPA, the HC had cautioned against its use in a "cavalier manner"."We are of the view that the foundations of our nation stand on surer footing than to be likely to be shaken by a protest, however vicious, organised by a tribe of college students or other persons, operating as a coordination committee from the confines of a University situate in the heart of Delhi," the HC had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/student-activists-kalita-narwal-and-tanha-released-from-tihar-jail-269828
