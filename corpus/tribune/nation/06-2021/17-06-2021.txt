However, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach on it at the 11th round of military talks.Last month, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane said that there can be no de-escalation without complete disengagement at all friction points in eastern Ladakh and that the Indian Army is prepared for all contingencies in the region.He also said that India is dealing with China in a “firm” and “non-escalatory” manner to ensure the sanctity of its claims in eastern Ladakh, and that it was even open to initiating confidence-building measures.India has been insisting on complete disengagement in remaining friction points to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ladakh.

17-06-2021||New Delhi||AAP govt makes fresh bid to get L-G’s nod for doorstep delivery of ration scheme||The AAP government has sent a file on doorstep delivery of ration to Lt Governor Anil Baijal, making a fresh bid to get his approval for the scheme, according to a statement from the Delhi Chief Minister’s Office on Thursday.Earlier this month, the Arvind Kejriwal government had claimed that the scheme was rejected by the L-G contending that the Centre’s approval was not sought for it and there was a pending case in the court.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has again sent the file to the L-G and said that it was according to the law and the objections raised by the Centre earlier have been addressed, the statement said.Kejriwal has stressed that the Centre’s directions have been followed and claimed that it was wrong to “stop” the scheme during the coronavirus pandemic, it said.“The chief minister has said that he studied the note of the Lieutenant Governor in which there appears to be a serious misunderstanding. The immediate matter before the LG is not the approval of the doorstep delivery scheme of ration. This plan has already been finalised,” the statement said.Kejriwal has maintained that the L-G’s contention that the matter is sent to the Central government does not seem right, according to the statement from the CMO.“The approval of the Central government is neither mandatory nor necessary. The Delhi government has only implemented the orders of the Centre and has been, from time to time, informing and seeking its assistance about the implementation of the scheme through several letters,” it said.After receiving the L-G’s opinion, the Delhi government wrote to the Centre on June 15, informing that it has cleared all their objections by way of a Cabinet decision on March 24.“The Kejriwal government plans to implement an order by the Central government on February 1, 2018, in which all states and UT governments have been directed to ensure home delivery of ration to senior citizens, differently-abled, and pregnant women,” the CMO statement said.It said that in accordance to the instructions of the Centre, arrangements are being made for home delivery of ration and stressed that fair price shops will continue to exist.“However, the Delhi government has gone a step ahead and implemented a doorstep delivery scheme for all its citizens benefitting pregnant women, disabled citizens, and senior citizens as well. Under this scheme, every citizen will be given an option whereby they can take ration either through FPS or home delivery,” the statement said.“The LG was informed about the Delhi Cabinet’s decision on doorstep delivery of ration four times in the last three years and he never opposed it. In February, a notification to implement this scheme was issued and even then, the L-G did not oppose it,” it said.The CMO statement stressed that the doorstep delivery scheme is completely under the purview of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and there should not be any concern regarding its implementation.“Under Section 24(2)(b) of the NFSA, it is the responsibility of state governments to ensure proper distribution of ration. They are also empowered under section 12(1) to reform the Targeted Public Distribution System, including the introduction of new schemes to ensure that ration reaches eligible beneficiaries properly,” it pointed out.“It is also clear from the order dated February 1, 2018, of the Central government that the doorstep delivery scheme secures the entitlement of the beneficiaries. In addition, Section 3(3) of the Act also explicitly permits the state governments to provide wheat flour in lieu of grains as per the guidelines of the Central government.”Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have already modelled doorstep delivery, while home delivery of ration has been started in Haryana’s Faridabad. Also, flour is being distributed in Ambala and Karnal, the statement added.

17-06-2021||New Delhi||Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine ‘Covavax’ to launch in India by September: Sources||The Serum Institute of India (SII) hopes to introduce US firm Novavax’s Indian version of the Covid-19 vaccine — ‘Covavax’ by September this year and start trials on children from July, sources said on Thursday.The SII is hoping to introduce Covavax in the country by September which is a version of US firm Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine, sources added.Earlier this week, Novavax’s vaccine exhibited a 90.4 per cent overall efficacy in Phase 3 clinical trials.That puts it in the same bracket as two of the frontline vaccines being used in the US and European countries, the ones produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which had efficacy rates of 91.3 per cent and 90 per cent in Phase 3 trials, respectively.“Serum Institute plans to start clinical trials of the Novavax shot for children in July,” sources confirmed to ANI.Earlier on Tuesday, the Centre said that recently declared Novavax Covid vaccine efficacy data in a large trial are promising and that clinical trials are being conducted and are in an advanced stage of completion in India.“What we’re learning from data available in the public domain is that this vaccine is very safe and highly effective. It’ll be produced in India,” said Dr VK Paul, Member-Health, Niti Aayog said in a routine briefing by the Union Health Ministry on the Covid-19 situation in India.He also added that gap in the production of Novavax’s vaccine was likely for a while.“I am also hoping they (US company Novavax) would also start trials on children too,” Paul had said.Novavax’s vaccine candidate has partnered with Pune-based vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India to produce doses in India.Meanwhile, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi from Tuesday began the screening of children in the age group of 6 to 12 years for the clinical trials of Covaxin, the indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine.AIIMS Delhi has already completed the clinical trial for a single dose of Covaxin for children aged 12-18 age group.The United States of America had in May approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for use in children as young as 12. Pfizer’s shot is the first to be cleared in the United States for children 12 to 15.

17-06-2021||---||Boatman hailed for rescuing girl from Ganges, UP to fete him||New Delhi, June 17 Little would have Ghazipur boatman Gullu Chaudhary thought that his instinctive act of saving a newborn girl floating in a box along the Ganges would catapult him into a social media sensation overnight.For him, it was a routine day like any other on the banks of Dadrighat in Ghazipur when he spotted a decorated trunk in the river, a baby’s cries emanating from inside.Ghazipur district authorities say there were many bystanders along the banks who also heard the infant’s whimpers. But it was Gullu Mallah who jumped into the Ganges and brought the child to safety.Geeta Shrivastava, convenor of the district child welfare committee, on Thursday said the child had now been placed for care at the sick newborn care unit in the Ghazipur district hospital and would now be under the protection of the state.Gullu Choudhary, meanwhile, said he would have liked to adopt the girl.“I have a daughter and two sons. I could have taken care of the child but the district child welfare officers have taken her to the hospital,” said the boatman, who earned social media praise all day today apart from an assurance of government support from the Uttar Pradesh government.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath hailed Gullu for his act and said, “Gullu Mallah has set a remarkable example of humanity by saving a child floating in a trunk in the Ganges. As a gesture of gratitude to the boatman, Uttar Pradesh government will make him a beneficiary in all its government run schemes and programmes. The state government also takes full responsibility for the care of the newborn.”Happy to have done his bit, Gullu says the child was found inside a trunk decorated with images of Hindu Gods. She was wrapped in a cloth and slips in the trunk bore her name as “Ganga”, her date of birth as “May 25, 2021” and also bore her horoscope.In April, this year, Mayur Shelke, a pointsman in the Mumbai division of Central Railways, had risked his life to save a child who had fallen on the tracks with a high speed train in sight.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/boatman-hailed-for-rescuing-girl-from-ganges-up-to-fete-him-269909
17-06-2021||New Delhi||India against Pakistan municipal courts deciding on Jadhav appeal||India has expressed dissatisfaction with the law passed by Pakistan providing the right to appeal to Kulbhushan Jadhav, and called upon it to correct the infirmities as they amount to municipal courts sitting in appeal over the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)."The Bill codifies into law the earlier Ordinance-with all its shortcomings. It does not create a piece of machinery to facilitate effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case, as mandated by the judgment of the ICJ,’’ said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi at a media briefing here on Thursday.Reacting to reports relating to the Review and Reconsideration Bill 2020 passed by the National Assembly of Pakistan on June 10, Bagchi noted that the Ordinance, now the Bill, invites the municipal courts in Pakistan to decide whether or not any prejudice has been caused to Jadhav on account of the failure to provide consular access."This is clearly a breach of the basic tenet that municipal courts cannot be the arbiter of whether a State has fulfilled its obligations in international law,’’ he observed.The ICJ had ruled that Pakistan was in breach of its international obligations because of the failure to provide consular access to Jadhav."We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address the shortcomings in the Bill and to comply with the judgment of the ICJ in letter and spirit,’’ said the MEA spokesperson.Earlier, Pakistan Law Minister Farogh Nasim had said that the bill had not been passed, India would have gone to the UN Security Council and could have moved contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ.While the Bill was on the cards, India has repeatedly asked for the verdict to be complied with in letter and spirit.Last July, Indian diplomats had walked out of the meeting with Jadhav after Pakistan reneged on its earlier assurance of unimpeded access by stationing officials with an intimidating demeanour next to Jadhav.The diplomats had also detected a camera to purportedly record the interaction.India has requested Pakistan over a dozen times for "unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access" to Jadhav who has been on death row since 2017.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-against-pakistan-municipal-courts-deciding-on-jadhav-appeal-269908
17-06-2021||New Delhi||India maintains 43rd rank on IMD's World Competitiveness Index; Switzerland tops chart||India maintained 43rd rank on an annual World Competitiveness Index compiled by the Institute for Management Development (IMD) that examined the impact of Covid-19 on economies around the world this year.The 64-nation list was led by Switzerland, while Sweden has moved up to the second position (from sixth last year), Denmark has lost one place to rank third, the Netherlands has retained its fourth place and Singapore has slipped to the fifth place (from first in 2020).At eighth, Taiwan reached the top-10 for the first time since the ranking began 33 years ago (moving up from 11th last year). The UAE and the USA remain in their same spots as last year (9th and 10th, respectively).The top-performing Asian economies are, in order, Singapore (fifth), Hong Kong (seventh), Taiwan (eighth) and China (16th).The IMD World Competitiveness Ranking ranks 64 economies and assesses the extent to which a country promotes the prosperity of its people by measuring economic well-being through hard data and survey responses from executives. This year, the rankings expose the economic impact of the pandemic across the globe.Among the BRICS nations, India is ranked second after China (16), followed by Russia (45th), Brazil (57th) and South Africa (62th).India has maintained its position for the past three years but this year, it had significant improvements in government efficiency, IMD said."India's improvements in the government efficiency factor are mostly due to relatively stable public finances (despite difficulties brought by the pandemic, in 2020 the government deficit stayed at 7 per cent) and to the positive feedbacks we registered among Indian business executives with respect to the support and subsidies provided by the government to the private companies," IMD said.It, however, added that the short term performance of India's economy will depend on its ability to address the pandemic.The report finds that qualities such as investment in innovation, digitalisation, welfare benefits and leadership, resulting in social cohesion have helped countries better weather the crisis the best and thus ranked higher in competitiveness.The report said top-performing economies are characterised by varying degrees of investment in innovation, diversified economic activities, and supportive public policy, according to the experts at the World Competitiveness Center."Strength in these areas prior to the pandemic allowed these economies to address the economic implications of the crisis more effectively," the report said.Competitive economies succeeded in transitioning to a remote work routine while also allowing remote learning. Addressing unemployment has been fundamental.Countries that ensured the effectiveness of key public spending, such as public finance, tax policy and business legislation, are seen as essential policies to relieve the pressure on the economies hit by Covid-19, the report said.The ranking, produced annually by the IMD World Competitiveness Center, measures the prosperity and competitiveness of 64 nations by examining four factors—economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency, and infrastructure. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-maintains-43rd-rank-on-imds-world-competitiveness-index-switzerland-tops-chart-269896

"Again after three four days he called claiming that he was unnecessarily put in jail and was in hospital now," Bellad said.Speaking to reporters here, he said there was a "conspiracy" behind sudden calls to him in recent days from Yuvraj Swamy, a person who is facing cases and someone whom he has not known or spoken to in the past."Despite my father Chandrakant Bellad being a five time MLA, his political life was without a black mark...as his son I'm also following in his footsteps...unable to find any fault in me, I feel attempts are being made to fix me by making such people call and talk to me...big hands are behind it," he added.Yuvraj Swamy, who Bellad is referring to, is said to be the same person who had reportedly claimed to have ties with central political leaders and powerful right-wing organisations and had allegedly conned several people taking money with assurances that he would get them plum positions.Bellad said he has submitted a letter to the Assembly Speaker, Home Minister and DG and IGP seeking an inquiry and action, and also providing him with police protection.He claimed his movements were also being monitored."Several times I have noticed that when I go to some place all of a sudden some people follow me there, how are they coming, how do they get to know about my movement.All these things makes me feel that my phone has been tapped and it is being monitored," he said, adding that he has no suspicion on any one and inquiry should be conducted to find out who is behind it," the MLA said,Reacting to Bellad's phone tapping allegations, Chief Minister's political secretary and MLA MP Renukacharya termed it a "cheap publicity" and said, "no one's phone is tapped, people are daydreaming about becoming Chief Minister..."BJP state general secretary N Ravi Kumar said "There is no question of tapping Bellad's phone, he is our legislator. I don't know why he has made such a statement, the party won't accept it, the party will talk to him."Bellad has made these allegations even as BJP national general secretary in-charge of the State Arun Singh is holding meetings with leaders and legislators individually, amid speculation in some quarters over replacing Chief Minister Yediyurappa.Bellad had recently made repeated visits to Delhi, reportedly to meet national leaders and express the concern of some legislators over Yediyurappa's style of functioning and request them to rein in the Chief Minister.His visits to Delhi along with Tourism Minister C P Yogeshwar had sparked off speculation about attempts within the BJP to unseat Yediyurappa. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-bjp-mla-arvind-bellad-alleges-phone-tapping-conspiracy-to-fix-him-269895

17-06-2021||New Delhi||Choksi planned escape, concealed evidence as he knew about impending enquiries: CBI||Absconding diamantaire Mehul Choksi had prior knowledge of the impending Enforcement Directorate (ED) enquiries against him in 2017 which triggered him to plan his escape from India and cover his tracks by concealing evidence, the agency has said.The CBI in its supplementary charge sheet has invoked Section 201 of the IPC among other charges which pertain to the destruction of evidence by a suspect as part of criminal conspiracy.Choksi allegedly in a criminal conspiracy with PNB Deputy Manager Gokulnath Shetty got back all the documents which were submitted for the issuance of 165 Letters of Undertaking (LOU) and fraudulent amendments made in 58 Foreign Letters of Credit (FLC) during March and April, 2017.Shetty “dishonestly and fraudulently” returned all the original applications along with other accompanying documents submitted by accused companies Gitanjaii Gems Ltd, Gili India Ltd and Nakshatra Brands Ltd back to them, which should have been in the custody of the bank, the CBI has alleged.“These applications along with the documents were recovered during searches conducted by CBI from the premises taken on rent by the employee of Mehul Chinubbhai Choksi at the instance of Vipul Chunilal Chitalia,” the CBI alleged.The applications along with the documents were first kept at 101/A, Sony Chamber Annex, Opera House Mumbai and other premises at Khetwadi near Harkishan Das Hospital, Mumbai, the agency has alleged.These were shifted on February 5, 2018, within a week of CBI taking over investigation, to Shop No. 188/A/192 on Babasaheb Jaykar Marg, Mumbai, a place taken on rent by Chitalia with the intention to cause “disappearance of evidence”, the CBI alleged.These documents were recovered during the searches conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) during investigation of the case.The agency also found records of fraudulent LOUs and FLCs in the Google drive of Chitalia during police custody.While his employees were allegedly busy covering tracks of the scam on his instructions, Choksi himself was trying to escape from India to a safer destination, the CBI alleged.During 2017, Choksi had visited Hong Kong where he had met “dummy” directors of supplier companies, who were allegedly his employees, the CBI has alleged.These supplier companies Shanyao Gong Si Ltd, 4C’s Diamond Distributors and Crown Aim Ltd were the beneficiaries of the LOUs and FLCs worth Rs 6,345 crore issued by the Punjab National Bank.During the visit, Choksi asked the dummy directors to not visit India as they may be subjected to ED enquiries pertaining to Gitanjali group promoted by him, the agency has alleged.“This shows that Mehul Choksi had prior knowledge of impending criminal proceedings. Hence, Mehul Choksi fled India on January 4, 2018, with dishonest intent to evade the process of law,” the supplementary charge sheet filed last week said.Choksi had taken citizenship of Caribbean Island country of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 where he was staying since 2018 till his mysterious disappearance on May 23.He was held in neighbouring country Dominica where he was arrested for illegal entry and is facing court proceedings.The Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda Gaston Browne has claimed in interviews that Choksi had not given accurate information about him while taking citizenship through the investment scheme of the country.The CBI which filed its supplementary charge sheet nearly three years after its first report alleged that Choksi asked directors of Hong Kong based supplier companies to get a Thailand visa as Hong Kong operations would be closed.In December 2017, Choksi allegedly telephoned Kalpen Doshi, a director in Crown Aim, asking him that all dummy directors should provide their documents to his aide Chitalia, also an accused, to apply for work permits for Abbeycrest, Bangkok, a company controlled by him, the CBI said.Next year, Chitalia again warned dummy directors to not visit India in the wake of “more trouble” from the investigations started by agencies, it said.The directors were shifted to Bangkok in February when the investigation into the scam began, it said. But the directors returned in the second quarter of 2018.While Choksi was moving directors, Shetty, prima donna of the scam in the bank, made desperate attempts to clean his slate prior to his superannuation, the CBI has found.Shetty was approver in all the FLCs issued for Choksi’s companies. He allegedly made entries in some FLCs initially in the central banking system of the PNB but later modified them to huge amounts without making any mention in the CBS to evade any scrutiny in case of default.Prior to his superannuation in 2017, he allegedly made pre-payment in 12 out of 16 bills drawn in fraudulent amendments putting them in “collection bills” rather than “negotiation bills” in the international banking messages called SWIFT.No corresponding entries were made in the CBS of the bank.

17-06-2021||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad case: Local leader booked over 'communal' video, FIR says Facebook didn't fact-check clip||The Ghaziabad Police has booked a Samajwadi Party worker here over a "communal video" of an elderly Muslim man alleging attack by some young men, with the FIR also mentioning that Facebook let the "misleading" clip circulate without making efforts to verify it.The FIR, however, does not mention Facebook as an accused in the case in which opposition Samajwadi Party's worker Ummaid Pehelwan Idrisi has been charged with promoting enmity and breach of peace by circulating the video on social media and giving it a "communal colour".On his Facebook account, Idrisi identifies himself as a Samajwadi Party worker and has posted purported pictures of him with party chief Akhilesh Yadav.Requesting anonymity, an SP office-bearer confirmed that Idrisi was a member of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) board during the SP government, and is still a party worker.The case was lodged at the Loni Border police station Wednesday evening, a day after the Ghaziabad police booked Twitter, a news website, some journalists and opposition Congress politicians, in a separate FIR over circulation of the video.Filed on the complaint of a local policeman, the FIR states that Idrisi had "unnecessarily" made the video—in which Abdul Shamad Saifi narrates his ordeal—with an intention to "create social disharmony" and shared it on his Facebook account."He shared on his social media account the video which had religious context to it without verifying the truth of the matter. It gave the incident a communal colour and was an attempt at disrupting social harmony," stated the FIR, which has been seen by PTI.The FIR has been lodged under sections 153A (promoting enmity between groups on ground of religion, class etc), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious belief), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (public mischief).Idrisi has also been booked under provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act, according to the FIR.The FIR, lodged only against Idrisi, mentions that social media giant Facebook "also did not make any efforts to fact-check this entire episode and let the misleading video circulate".Five accused—Kalloo Gurjar, Parvesh Gurjar, Adil, Intezaar and Saddam alias Bauna—have been arrested so far in connection with the attack on Saifi, Superintendent of Police (Ghaziabad Rural) Iraj Raja said on Wednesday.The Ghaziabad police maintained that the incident took place because the accused were unhappy over the 'tabeez' (amulets) sold to them by Saifi. The police also ruled out any communal angle in the episode.In the video that triggered nation-wide reaction, Saifi purportedly says he was attacked by some young men and forced to chant 'Jai Shri Ram' even as the district police said he did not make any such allegation in the FIR.This FIR about the assault and illegal confinement was lodged on June 7, two days after the incident, on the complaint of Saifi, a resident of Anoopshahar in adjoining Bulandshahr district. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghaziabad-case-local-leader-booked-over-communal-video-fir-says-facebook-didnt-fact-check-clip-269874

He has two wives. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/patriarch-of-largest-family-in-world-laid-to-rest-in-mizoram-four-days-after-demise-269873
17-06-2021||New Delhi||Experts term CBSE's class 12 evaluation formula 'time-bound' but 'far from fair'||The evaluation formula decided by CBSE for class 12 students has evoked mixed reaction from experts, with some hailing it as an "unbiased and time-bound" method and others terming it "far from being fair", saying students showing progress over a period of time will be at a disadvantage.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) informed the Supreme Court on Thursday that it will be adopting a 30:30:40 formula for evaluation of marks for class 12 students based on results of class 10, 11 and 12 respectively.Thirty per cent marks will be based on class 10 board exam, another 30 per cent from class 11 and 40 per cent marks based on the performance in the unit, mid-term and pre-board tests of class 12.The exams for class 12 were cancelled by CBSE on June 1 in view of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic."The proposed methodology may seriously disadvantage students showing progress over a period of time. CBSE, as a system, has never rewarded consistency in performance. It was built on the concept of one high-stakes exam."To begin with, that is a wrong system. One cannot try to correct it with this kind of criterion, especially so in a year when the students have gone through so much trauma. The evaluation criteria released by CBSE for class 10 was far superior," said Manit Jain, Chairman, FICCI ARISE, a collegium of stakeholders aimed at promoting quality education.According to Vishnu Kartik, CEO of The Heritage schools, the criteria decided by CBSE achieves the limited objective of providing a time-bound implementable framework but it is far from being a fair and accurate methodology."The alternative formula for arriving at class 12 board exams is simple to implement and easy to understand. It achieves the limited objective of providing a time-bound implementable framework. But is it a fair and near accurate methodology? Far from it. Our past data shows that performance in class 11 or 10 is not a reasonable prediction of performance in class 12."There is no scientific reason to include the 'best of three' class 10 scores as it has no impact on many class 12 subjects," he said.The silver lining of this proposed formula is in the hope that it can drive some long-term structural and cultural reforms. For one, the suggested external moderation committee will bring in much-needed accountability in schools to strengthen internal assessment processes and hopefully, students realise the need to learn consistently across grades and not just for the final exams, Kartik said.Rajat Goel, the Director of MRG School in Rohini said the criterion declared by CBSE and approved by the Supreme Court raises questions on some very important aspects."Students tend to get a little relaxed in class 11, hence the average passing percentage is slightly on the lower end. Apart from this, subjects in class 10 like social science, and no demarcation of physics, chemistry and maths are entirely different from the ones in class 12."Additionally, there are vocational subjects like fine arts, physical education as well as in class 12 which gives students a chance to increase their overall score. All of this considered, this new evaluation criteria has stirred some relevant doubts and appear as not a fair assessment method for students seeking to build their future with these marks as a foundation," he said.The board has decided that for class 10, the marks based on the average theory component of the best three performing subjects of the main five subjects would be considered and their weightage would be 30 per cent.Shishir Jaipuria, the chairman of Seth Anandram Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions said the decision to base 30 per cent marks on the best-of-three subjects in class 10 is a good one because the board exams provided a standard assessment."Classes 11 and 12 have integrated syllabus, and considering a student's performance in these classes makes it a very comprehensive evaluation. Moderation of class 11 and 12 marks is a relief to those students who could not perform well. I believe that a combination of these three should provide a reasonably fair assessment and reduce chances of a discrepancy between a student's academic potential and marks allotted," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-term-cbses-class-12-evaluation-formula-time-bound-but-far-from-fair-269871

He was initially taken to the Civil Hospital in Kokrajhar and then shifted to Barpeta Medical College and Hospital. The constable is out of danger, but the accused's condition is serious," Kokrajahar Superintendent of Police Prateek Thube told reporters."Reference to alleged Kokrajhar double rape and murder case -- one of the accused tried to escape during a search operation near Bedlangmari, Salbari and police had to fire to prevent him from escaping. He is grievously injured and hospitalised," Special Director General of Police G P Singh tweeted.The bodies of two sisters, aged 14 and 16, were found hanging from a tree near their village in the district on June 12.Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma visited the family members of the deceased and said that the government will not take the deaths of the two indigenous girls lightly.He directed the police to thoroughly investigate the case, following which Special DGP L R Bishnoi constituted a Special Investigative Team (SIT) and seven people were arrested, three of whom are prime suspects. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-double-rape-murder-accused-injured-after-cops-open-fire-during-escape-bid-269870

My job is to telephone them (officers) to let them know that they have been transferred. But he tapped the conversation, which amounted to invasion into my privacy...His act was unbecoming of a government officer," she said.Jangid, 35, said he had shared with his four IAS colleagues the recorded conversation of 30-odd seconds between him and Mukherjee over his transfer."I shared this audio with four of my IAS colleagues on personal chats. It was done after the (transfer) order was issued in writing by the GAD and updated in the department's website. I had shared it in good faith and in personal capacity when they asked me about the reason for my sudden transfer...I told them that I was not informed about the reason. So I shared the audio with them saying this is what the GAD principal secretary told me...I did not share it in any group," Jangid said.“But I think that it is not a question of breach of any conduct rules, because the information is neither of confidential nature nor of personal nature. It does not violate her (Mukherjee's) privacy. Even the Right to Information Act states that government officials should proactively disclose the information which ought to be in the public domain,” he said."This audio was of May 31, for which I have been issued notice yesterday, after a gap of 17 days," the IAS officer said, adding that he had been transferred nine times in 54 months.Jangid said that on June 11, he had written to the state government for inter-cadre deputation to Maharashtra for three years citing that his 87-year-old grandfather is a diabetic, who is also suffering from Parkinson's disease."Besides, I want to take care of my widowed mother”, the 2014-batch IAS officer, who hails from Parbhani district of Maharashtra, said.He said he would respond to the notice as per his "own time". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-ias-officer-gets-notice-for-sharing-his-conversation-with-woman-bureaucrat-over-his-transfer-269848

17-06-2021||Mumbai||IT firms set to slash 3 million jobs by 2022 due to automation, to save $100 billion in cost: Report||With automation taking place at a much faster pace across industries especially in the tech space, domestic software firms that employee over 16 million are set to slash headcounts by a massive 3 million by 2022, which will help them save a whopping USD 100 billion mostly in salaries annually, says a report.The domestic IT sector employs around 16 million, of which around 9 million are employed in low-skilled services and BPO roles, according to Nasscom.Of these 9 million low-skilled services and BPO roles, 30 per cent or around 3 million will be lost by 2022, principally driven by the impact of robot process automation or RPA. Roughly 0.7 million roles are expected to be replaced by RPA alone and the rest due to other technological upgrades and upskilling by the domestic IT players, while it the RPA will have the worst impact in the US with a loss of almost 1 million jobs, according to a Bank of America report on Wednesday.Based on average fully-loaded employee costs of USD 25,000 per annum for India-based resources and USD 50,000 for US resources, this will release around USD 100 billion in annual salaries and associated expenses for corporates, the report says."TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL, Tech Mahindra and Cognizant and others appear to be planning for a 3 million reduction in low-skilled roles by 2022 because of RPA up-skilling."This is a USD 100-billion in reduced salary and other costs, but on the flipside, it offers a likely a USD 10 billion boon for IT companies that successfully implement RPA, and another a USD5 billion opportunity from a vibrant new software niche by 2022. Given that robots can function for 24 hrs a day, this represents a significant saving of up to 10:1 versus the human labour,” says the report.Robot process automation (RPA) is the application of software, not physical robots, to perform routine, high-volume tasks, allowing employees to focus on more differentiated work. It differs from ordinary software applications as it mimics how the employee has worked instead of building a workflow into technology from the ground up and thus minimising time to market and greatly reducing cost over the more traditional software-led approaches.Offshoring helped the domestic IT sector to grow from around 1 per cent of GDP in 1998 to 7 per cent today, a highly strategic sector for its economy and has also significantly outgrown their Western peers (mainly Accenture, Capgemini and Atos) with annual revenue growth of 18 per cent between 2005 and 2019.Another key reason for the RPA-driven job losses is that many countries that had offshored their work in the past are likely to bring the jobs back to their own home markets.Developed countries will also look to increasingly bringing back offshored IT jobs and either use native IT workers or domestic software robots like RPA to secure their digital supply chain and ensure future resiliency of their national technology infrastructure, reasons the report.Software offshoring began in the 1970s and the 1980s when the personal computer began to gain traction when major world players began shifting focus to trade liberalisation.However, despite such massive automation, major economies like Germany (26 per cent shortage), China (7 per cent), India (5 per cent) Korea, Brazil, Thailand Malaysia and Russia will likely face labour shortages, warns the report, adding on contrary South Africa, Greece, Indonesia and the Philippines will have surplus labour for the next 15 years.According to the report, faster automation is driven by the shrinking talent pool of high-skilled jobs in developing economies, the need for which will only jump, but the global high-skill talent pool is shrinking and exposing outmoded immigration systems.The report goes onto warn that emerging economies mostly India and China face the most risk of technology-driven disruptions which can impact up to 85 per cent of jobs in countries like Kenya and Bangladesh.India and China are at the greatest risk of skills disruption, while ASEAN, the Persian Gulf and Japan are at the least risk. Perhaps the most worrying trend is that emerging market jobs are most at risk of automation because of the low-/mid-skilled nature of sectors like manufacturing, highlighting the risk of premature de-industrialization.India saw its manufacturing peak in 2002, while it occurred in Germany in 1970, in Mexico in 1990.

Meanwhile, Paras has challenged Chirag’s contention that the election of the former as the head of the parliamentary party was invalid since such a decision could be taken “only by the national president or the chairman of the parliamentary board”. On his first visit to Bihar since the dramatic turn of events, Paras also said Chirag had been “divested of” the post of national chief “in keeping with the party constitution”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rethink-decision-on-paras-chirag-to-ls-speaker-269438

Nearly 6,500 dwellings spread over 172 acres in Khori are facing demolition following the recent Supreme Court orders.Ganeshi, who ran a small shop here, was found hanging from a tree outside his newly built two-room house. The family, including his two sons and daughters-in-law, learnt of the tragic incident around 6 am.“My father looked stressed last night when he confided he was worried about our newly constructed house,” says Rajesh, adding that they had exhausted their Rs 2.5 lakh savings on the construction of the house built on a 100-sq yard plot bought several years ago.“We hail from Meerut in UP. The family first moved to Khanpur village of Delhi before relocating at Khori about 14 years ago,” says Rajesh, who works as charpoy maker while his elder brother is a guard in a private company. “We chose this place to settle down as it is close to Delhi and offers employment avenues, he says.The body was handed over to the family this evening after a postmortem.Meanwhile, the police have registered a case in connection with the suicide against an unidentified property dealer from whom Ganeshi had bought the plot. A police spokesperson said the accused would be arrested on the charge of selling the land illegally.The police have also booked 100 Khori residents, who allegedly attempted to disturb law and order by resorting to stone-throwing after the suicide incident. No arrest has been made so far.Sources said a majority of Khori villagers had decided to stay put despite the demolition sword hanging over their heads.

The existing 41 factories under the OFB will be subsumed under one or the other of the seven new companies, all 100 per cent government-owned public sector undertakings (PSU).Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday evening said, “I can assure the OFB employees (approx 70,000) that their service conditions remain the same. The pension and post-retirement benefits also shall remain the same.”The seven new (yet to be named) PSU entities will cover a separate sector. One will be the “ammunition and explosives group”. This will engage in production of ammunition of various caliber and explosives.Dates back to British eraThe “vehicles group” will engage in the production of defence mobility and combat vehicles such as tanks, trawls, BMP and mine protected vehicles.The “weapons and equipment group” will engage in the production of small arms, medium and large caliber guns and other weapon systems. The other four companies will be the “troop comfort items group”, “ancillary group”, “opto-electronics group” and the “parachute group”. “The move will allow these companies autonomy as well as help improve accountability and efficiency,” Rajnath said. The restructuring is aimed at transforming the ordnance factories into productive and profitable assets; deepen specialisation in the product range; enhance competitiveness besides improving quality and cost-efficiency. The government has also decided to delegate authority of the Cabinet to the Empowered Group of Ministers constituted under the Minister of Defence to decide on the matters related to the implementation of the aforesaid decisions and other incidental matters.

The number of new deaths reported in the past week decreased across all regions except for the African and the South-East Asia Regions, said the WHO, adding that globally the mortality remains high.“While the epidemics in some of the most affected countries have started to show signs of slowing down, and the global weekly mortality rate continues to decline for the sixth consecutive week, many countries across all WHO regions continue to struggle with access to vaccines, the spread of emerging SARSCoV-2 variants, and overburdened healthcare systems,” the world body said, sounding an alarm on the variants of concern and variants of interest and asking nations to step up genome sequencing and public health surveillance.Repair & prepare economy, health infraThe focus must be on repairing and preparing the health infrastructure as well as the economy for future challenges. —Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterThe WHO has so far designated four variants of concern (VOCs) – Alpha (first detected in the UK), Beta (South Africa), Gamma (Brazil) and Delta (India). There have been no additions to the list. “Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of VOCs has indicated that public health and social measures (PHSM), including infection prevention and control in health facilities, have been effective in reducing Covid-19 case incidence which has led to a reduction in hospitalisations and deaths among Covid-19 patients. Nations are encouraged to continue strengthening PHSM,” the WHO advised as India saw 62, 224 new cases today and active cases dropped below 9 lakh (8,65,432) after 70 days, making up just 2.92 per cent of all cases. The WHO also reported a new variant of interest – Lambda — associated with substantive rates of community transmission in multiple countries. The earliest sequenced samples of Lambda were reported from Peru in August 2020.No calf serum in Covaxin shot: govtAmid a social media debate on the constitution of Covid shot Covaxin, the government has said the final vaccine product did not contain newborn calf serum “at all”.

Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Bedi, who removed journalists from the virtual hearing, said he would pass orders tomorrow.The investigating officer has sought three days to conduct verification of addresses of the accused and their sureties to complete the process of their release from the jail.Holding that right to protest is a fundamental right that can’t be termed as a “terrorist act”, the Delhi High Court had on Tuesday granted bail to the three student activists who faced charges under various provisions of the IPC and the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.The HC had said it was constrained to note that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters might get out of hand, “the state has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’. If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-move-sc-against-bail-to-3-student-activists-269450
17-06-2021||---||Twitter, scribes booked under new IT rules for ‘communal unrest’ attempt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 16BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh has become the first state to lodge an FIR against Twitter under the new IT rules in connection with a video purportedly showing an elderly Muslim man being thrashed and told to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’. The action comes as the microblogging site failed to comply with the amended IT rules, losing protection granted to social media intermediaries for third-party content uploaded by users.The FIR names nine entities, including Twitter Inc, Twitter Communications India, news website The Wire, journalists Mohammed Zubair and Rana Ayyub, Congress leaders Dr Sama Mohammad, Salman Nizami, Masqoor Usmani and writer Saba Naqvi. The complaint was lodged late last night at the Loni Border police station in Ghaziabad by a local policeman, who alleged the video, which went viral on social video, was shared with an intention to provoke communal unrest.“These people did not verify the truth of the matter and shared it online with a communal angle with an intention to disrupt public peace and create a divide between religious groups,” the FIR states. The police accused Twitter of failing to do anything to prevent the video from getting viral.They all have been booked under Sections 153 (provocation for rioting), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 295A (acts intended to outrage religious feelings), 505 (mischief), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. The police action came within hours of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath exchanging remarks on Twitter over the incident. Noting that there was “no communal angle in the incident”, the police in its FIR said, “The victim, Abdul Samad Sufi, and the accused have known each other for long. The victim sold a ‘tabeez’ (amulet) to main accused (Parvesh) with the promise that it will bring him prosperity, but he complained that it had an adverse effect on his family. When the tabeez didn’t work, the accused got angry and beat up the victim.”In this case, the police said an FIR was lodged on June 7 and three of the six accused had been arrested. Tagging a media report on the incident, Rahul had tweeted: “I am not willing to accept that true devotees of Lord Ram can do such a thing. Such cruelty is far removed from humanity and is shameful for both society and religion.”Responding to the tweet, the UP CM said, “The first lesson Lord Ram taught was to ‘speak the truth’, which you have not done in your life. You should be ashamed that even after the police putting forth the truth, you are spreading poison in the society. In the greed for power, you are shaming humanity.” Meanwhile, the Press Club of India has demanded that the FIR naming the journalists should be quashed because it showed “vendetta” of the Ghaziabad police to create a “sense of terror” in the media and society at large.Nine named in FIRTwitter Inc, Twitter Communications India, The Wire, journalists Mohammed Zubair, Rana Ayyub; Cong leaders Dr Sama Mohammad, Salman Nizami, Masqoor Usmani and writer Saba NaqviDeliberate defiance: GovtIT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Twitter for “deliberate defiance”, failure to comply with the new IT rules and “deliberately choosing the path of non-compliance”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-scribes-booked-under-new-it-rules-for-communal-unrest-attempt-269451

The agenda was not accepted because there was no consensus on the same.Under PAC rules consensus is mandatory to take up any subject.Sources said BJP’s Jagdambika Pal and JDU’s Rajeev Ranjan objected to Adhir’s statement that he attempted to read out at the end of the meeting on Wednesday.The PAC members said their objection was to the “political statement the chairman was making at a platform which is not meant for political point scoring.”Congress sources said Adhir was not allowed to speak. The meeting, said sources, ended in a discordant note.Being the first meeting it was to decide on subjects for the PAC to deliberate upon this year.This was the first meeting of any parliamentary panel since the second Covid wave hit India.Meanwhile,  Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Wednesday demanding a special session to discuss the Maratha reservation issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-leader-adhir-chowdhury-led-pac-meet-turns-ugly-over-covid-jab-agenda-269428
17-06-2021||New Delhi||Monoclonal antibody mix cuts deaths of hospitalised Covid patients by a fifth: Recovery trial||In a landmark development on Wednesday, the University of Oxford led Recovery Trials working to search Covid-19 treatments said they had for the first time found an antiviral treatment saving lives of hospitalised patients.The Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial demonstrated that the investigational antibody combination developed by the US biotechnology giant Regeneron reduced the risk of death by a fifth when given to patients hospitalised with severe Covid-19 who have not mounted a natural antibody response of their own.The treatment uses a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab, known as REGEN-COV in the US) that bind specifically to two different sites on the coronavirus spike protein, neutralising the ability of the virus to infect cells.Previous studies in non-hospitalised Covid-19 patients have shown that the treatment reduces viral load, shortens the time to resolution of symptoms, and significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization or death.In a small trial in hospitalised patients, preliminary evidence suggested a clinical benefit in patients who had not mounted a natural antibody response of their own when they entered the trial (were seronegative).Recovery is the first trial large enough to determine definitively whether this treatment reduces mortality in patients hospitalised with severe Covid-19.Between September 18, 2020, and May 22, 2021, 9785 patients hospitalised with Covid-19 were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus the antibody combination treatment.Among patients who were seronegative (had no antibodies of their own) the antibody combination significantly reduced the primary outcome of 28-day mortality by one-fifth compared with usual care alone (24 pc of patients in the antibody combination group died versus 30 pc patients in the usual care group).Thus, for every 100 such patients treated with the antibody combination, there would be six fewer deaths, the Recovery Trial reported on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monoclonal-antibody-mix-cuts-deaths-of-hospitalised-covid-patients-by-a-fifth-recovery-trial-269417

This will engage in production of ammunition of various calibre and explosives, not only for the Make in India initiative but also for exports. The ‘Vehicles group’ would engage in production of defence mobility and combat vehicles such as Tanks, Trawls, BMP and Mine Protected Vehicles.‘Weapons & Equipment group’ would engage in production of small arms, medium and large calibre guns and other weapon systems. This was expected to increase the share in the domestic market through meeting domestic demand as well as product diversification.The other four companies would be ‘Troop Comfort Items group’, ‘Ancillary group’, ‘Opto-Electronics group’ and ‘Parachute group’.Each of these PSU’s would subsume the 41 OFB factories on the basis of type of manufacturing. OFB factories produce tanks, artillery guns, heavy vehicles, specialised wires, rifles, ammunition etc.  It was in 1775 that British authorities accepted the establishment of Board of Ordnance in Fort William, Kolkata.  In 1787 a gun powder factory was established at Ishapore West Bengal which started production from 1791. The British set up 18 ordnance factories and the rest have come up after India became independent in 1947. “This move would allow these companies autonomy as well as help improve accountability and efficiency,” Rajnath Singh said.The restructuring is aimed at transforming the Ordnance Factories into productive and profitable assets; deepen specialisation in the product range; enhance competitiveness; improving quality and cost-efficiencyThe new structure is aimed to overcome various shortcomings in the existing system and provide these companies opportunities in the market including exports.The prime customers of Ordnance Factories are the Indian Armed Forces. The requirements of other customers like Central Paramilitary Forces, State Police Forces for arms, ammunition, clothing, bulletproof vehicles and mine protected vehicles are also met from the OFB.The government has also decided to delegate the authority of the Cabinet to the Empowered Group of Ministers, constituted under the minister of defence, to decide upon the matters related to implementation of the aforesaid government decisions and other incidental matters.Rajnath Singh heads this empowered group of ministers and has the home minister, the finance minister, the minister for labour and minister of state in the PMO.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/246-year-old%C2%A0ordnance-factory-board-scrapped-7-new-companies-to-take-over-269397

17-06-2021||New Delhi||PNB scam: CBI files supplementary chargesheet against ex-official of Gitanjali Group of Companies||Companies owned by fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi have allegedly siphoned off over Rs 6,344.96 crore from the Punjab National Bank (PNB) using fraudulent letters of undertaking and foreign letters of credit, a CBI investigation into the scam has detected.The findings were submitted by the CBI in a supplementary chargesheet filed before a special court in Mumbai last week, where the agency said the PNB was conned by its employees who were allegedly hand in gloves with Choksi and his company executives and who facilitated the scam as part of a criminal conspiracy.The PNB officials at the bank's Brady House branch in Mumbai issued 165 letters of undertaking (LoUs) and 58 foreign letters of credit (FLCs) during March-April 2017, against which 311 bills were discounted.These LoUs and FLCs were allegedly issued to Choksi's firms without any sanctioned limit or cash margin and without making entries in the bank's central banking system to evade any scrutiny in case of a default.LoUs are a guarantee given by a bank on behalf of its client to a foreign bank. If the client does not repay to the foreign bank, the liability falls on the guarantor bank."Since the accused companies did not repay the amount availed against the said fraudulent LoUs and FLCs, the PNB made the payment of Rs 6,344.97 crore (USD 965.18 million), including the overdue interest, to the overseas banks, which had advanced buyer's credit and discounted the bills against the fraudulent LoUs and FLCs issued by the PNB," the CBI's supplementary chargesheet has alleged.The PNB had accused Choksi of duping it to the tune of Rs 7,080 crore. CBI officials said the matter is still under investigation and the final figures of loss suffered by the bank can only be determined once all the LoUs are examined and the probe is complete.In addition to the 18 accused named in the first chargesheet, the agency has named four new accused in its supplementary report, including the former international head of the Gitanjali Group of Companies, Sunil Verma, two PNB officials -- single-window operator Sagar Sawant and AGM Sanjay Prasad -- and a director of the Gili and the Nakshtra brands under the group, Dhanesh Sheth.The supplementary chargesheet, filed more than three years after the first chargesheet in the case against Choksi and his companies, coincides with the legal proceedings against the fugitive diamantaire in a court of Dominica, where he was arrested for "illegal entry" on May 24 after his mysterious disappearance from neighbouring Antigua and Barbuda."This supplementary chargesheet after three years shows that it is only an attempt to cover up anomalies that the defence had pointed out in the first chargesheet. Moreover, the addition of section 201 of the IPC for destruction of evidence is not legally tenable as a document becomes evidence only after its filing in the court and the allegations are of a period much prior to the FIR," Choksi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said.Choksi was living in Antigua and Barbuda since 2018, after he fled India in the first week of January that year, weeks before the scam was reported.The diamantaire and his nephew, Nirav Modi, have allegedly siphoned off over Rs 13,000 crore of public money from the PNB using LoUs and FLCs by bribing officials of the bank's Brady House branch.The agency has slapped charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, breach of trust, disappearance of evidence, falsification of accounts, bribery and criminal misconduct by public servant in its supplementary chargesheet.The CBI investigation has found that accused PNB official Gokulnath Shetty, in a conspiracy with Choksi, had in an "unauthorised" manner issued 165 LoUs from the PNB's Brady House branch between March 1, 2017 and April 29, 2017 on behalf of Gitanjali Gems (113 LoUs), Gili India Limited (35 LoUs) and Nakshatra Brands (17 LoUs) -- all accused firms -- the chargesheet has alleged.The purpose of this trade transaction was shown as purchasing fresh water pearls from Shanyao Gong Si Limited and 4Cs Diamond Distributors, both based in Hong Kong, the CBI has said.It has found that the accused companies availed 142 buyer's credit amounting to Rs 3,011.38 crore and did not make payments on the due date "wilfully", causing loss to the bank and corresponding profits to themselves.It is alleged that Choksi and Modi used the mechanism to get credit from foreign banks, which was not repaid, bringing a liability of over Rs 13,000 crore on the PNB.The investigation has further revealed that the fraud was allegedly perpetrated despite circulars issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which was in the knowledge of senior PNB officials.Further, the PNB officials did not implement the circulars and caution notices issued by the RBI regarding safeguarding the SWIFT (international banking messaging system) operations and instead, misrepresented the factual situation to the RBI, the agency has alleged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pnb-scam-cbi-files-supplementary-chargesheet-against-ex-official-of-gitanjali-group-of-companies-269378
17-06-2021||New Delhi||Modi calls for ‘repair and prepare’ as India emerges from pandemic||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday called for focus on ‘repair and prepare’ as the nation emerges out of a devastating pandemic.“Over the past year, we have witnessed a lot of disruption in different sectors. Much of it is still there. Yet, disruption does not have to mean despair,” he said at VivaTech Summit.“Instead, we must keep the focus on the twin foundations of repair and prepare,” he said referring to the need to augment healthcare infrastructure in the country as well as prop up the economy.Indian economy suffered its worst contraction in decades in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as the pandemic-induced lockdown impaired economic activity.The government, however, continued with the reforms that would help sustain higher growth rates after the world emerges from the pandemic.India implemented huge reforms across sectors - from mining to space, from banking to atomic energy, he said.“This goes on to show that India as a nation is adaptable and agile, even in the middle of the pandemic.”      “India offers what innovators and investors need,” Modi said. “I invite the world to invest in India based on the five pillars of talent, market, capital, eco-system and culture of openness.”   Stating that India’s strides in the world of tech and start-up are well-known, he said the country is home to one of the world’s largest start-up eco systems and several unicorns have come up in recent years.

17-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police move SC against HC order granting bail to 3 student activists in riots cases||Delhi Police on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court challenging three separate judgements of the Delhi High Court granting bail to three student activists in last year's northeast Delhi riots cases.The high court on Tuesday had granted bail to two JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita and a Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha saying in its anxiety to suppress dissent, the State has blurred the line between the right to protest and terrorist activity and if such a mindset gains traction, it would be a "sad day for democracy".Terming as "somewhat vague" the definition of 'terrorist act' under the stringent UAPA laws and warning against its use in a "cavalier manner", the high court set aside the trial court orders denying bail to the student activists."We are of the view that the foundations of our nation stand on surer footing than to be likely to be shaken by a protest, however vicious, organised by a tribe of college students or other persons, operating as a coordination committee from the confines of a University situate in the heart of Delhi," the high court had said.In three separate judgements of 113, 83 and 72 pages, the high court had said that although the definition of ‘terrorist act' in section 15 of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) is wide and somewhat vague, it must partake the essential character of terrorism and the phrase ‘terrorist act' cannot be permitted to be applied in a “cavalier manner” to criminal acts that squarely fall under the IPC.“We are constrained to express, that it seems, that in its anxiety to suppress dissent, in the mind of the State, the line between the constitutionally guaranteed right to protest and terrorist activity seems to be getting somewhat blurred. If this mindset gains traction, it would be a sad day for democracy" which would be in peril, the High Court had said, adding there was nothing to show the possible commission of a terrorist act.The high court had directed Pinjra Tod activists Narwal and Kalita and Tanha, who were arrested in May last year in connection with alleged larger conspiracy in the riots, to surrender their passports and not to offer any inducement to prosecution witnesses or tamper with the evidence in the case.The three accused shall not indulge in any unlawful activities and shall reside at the address as mentioned in records, the high court had said.Kalita, Narwal and Tanha are accused in four, three and two cases respectively relating to communal riots that broke out on February 24 last year and will be released from jail now as they have already secured bail in other matters.The high court had said there is absolutely nothing in the charge sheet, by way of any specific allegation to show the possible commission of a ‘terrorist act' within section 15 UAPA, an act of ‘raising funds' to commit a terrorist act under section 17 and an act of ‘conspiracy' to commit or an ‘act preparatory' to commit, a terrorist act within section 18 UAPA.It noted that the charge sheet was filed on September 16, 2020, and there are 740 prosecution witnesses and the trial is yet to commence which is unlikely to begin soon given the truncated functioning of courts because of the prevailing second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Regarding Narwal and Kalita, the high court had said considering their educational background, profile and position in life, it sees no reason to suspect or apprehend that they are either a flight risk or that they will indulge in evidence tampering, or witness intimidation, or will otherwise impede the trial in any way.It said no specific act is attributed to Narwal, apart from the admitted fact that she engaged herself in organising anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and anti-National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests around the time when violence and rioting broke out in certain parts of north-east Delhi.It had said allegations relating to inflammatory speeches, organising of 'chakka jaam', instigating women to protest and to stock-pile various articles and other similar allegations, at worst, are evidence that she participated in organising protests, but there is no specific allegation that she incited violence, what to talk of committing a terrorist act or a conspiracy to commit it.Regarding Kalita, it had noted that as a member of certain women's rights organisations and other groups, she did participate and help organise protests against the CAA and the NRC in Delhi and said the right to protest, which is a fundamental right to assemble peaceably and without arms, is surely not outlawed and cannot be termed as a ‘terrorist act' within the meaning of the UAPA, unless of ingredients of offences are clearly discernible from the allegations.It had added that inflammatory speeches and organising chakka jams are not uncommon when there is widespread opposition to governmental or parliamentary actions.“Even if we assume...inflammatory speeches, chakka jams, instigation of women protesters and other actions, to which Kalita is alleged to have been party, crossed the line of peaceful protests permissible under our constitutional guarantee, that however would yet not amount to commission of a ‘terrorist act' or a ‘conspiracy' or an ‘act preparatory' to the commission of a terrorist act...under the UAPA," it had said.

The STSC of NTAGI gave the following recommendation: ‘as per the Covid-19 Working Group recommendation, a dosing interval of minimum three months between two doses of Covishield vaccine was recommended,” the ministry statement says.It adds that in both the meetings Covid-19 Working Group and STSC, no dissent was given by any of the three members who have been quoted in a news report by Reuters, namely, Dr. Mathew Varghese, Dr M. D. Gupte and Dr. J. P Muliyil.The government has said NTAGI is watching Covishield evidence closely and issues of dosing could always be reviewed if needed.“Covid shots are just six-month old. The science is evolving. We had decided on postponing the second dose of Covishield based on evidence. The matter of dosing interval is still under consideration of NTAGI as of vaccine Devore bodies anywhere in the world. These things are works in progress,” NK Arora, NTAGI chief said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ntagi-members-unanimously-advised-extending-covishield-dose-interval-to-12-16-weeks-govt-269335
17-06-2021||---||No newborn calf serum in final Covaxin shot: Health Ministry||New Delhi, June 16Amid a social media debate on the constitution of made in India Covid shot Covaxin, the government on Wednesday clarified that the final vaccine (Covaxin) does not contain newborn calf serum at all and the calf serum is not an ingredient of the final vaccine product.“There have been some social media posts regarding composition of the Covaxin vaccine where it has been suggested that Covaxin vaccine contains the newborn calf serum. Facts have been twisted and misrepresented in these posts,” the Health Ministry said.The government said newborn calf serum is used only for preparation and growth of vero cells and different kinds of bovine and other animal serum are standard enrichment ingredient used globally for vero cell growth.“Vero cells are used to establish cell lives which help in production of vaccines. This technique has been used for decades in Polio, Rabies, and Influenza vaccines. These vero cells, after the growth, are washed with water, with chemicals (also technically known as buffer), many times to make it free from the newborn calf serum. Then these vero cells are infected with corona virus for viral growth. The vero cells are completely destroyed in the process of viral growth. This grown virus is also killed (inactivated) and purified,” the government explained under a statement titled “vaccine myths versus facts”.The ministry said the killed virus is then used to make the final vaccine, and in the final vaccine formulation no calf serum is used.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-newborn-calf-serum-in-final-covaxin-shot-health-ministry-269331
17-06-2021||Ajay Banerjee||Without naming China, India reiterates ‘rule-based order in Indo-Pacific’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 16Without naming China, India on Wednesday once again said it stood for a rule-based order in the Indo-Pacific based upon respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and adherence to international rules and laws.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, speaking at the eighth ASEAN Defence Ministers’ plus meeting (ADMM-Plus) said: “India calls for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific.”The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is a group of 10 countries and five of those nations -- Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam – are locked in a dispute with China over claims in the hydro-carbon rich South China Sea.Also read: Terrorism, radicalisation gravest threats facing world: Rajnath SinghChina has created several man-made islands to extend its claims at the sea.Rajnath Singh addressed the ADMM-plus meeting virtually.With regards to developments in the South China Sea, he said it has attracted attention in the region and beyond. “India supports freedom of navigation, over flight and unimpeded commerce in these international waterways,” he said.He hoped that the Code of Conduct negotiations will lead to outcomes that are in keeping with international law, including the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and do not prejudice the legitimate rights and interests of nations that were not party to these discussions.A few years ago, China lost its case on claims at a hearing under the UNCLOS, it did not accept the verdict and forced other parties to the dispute to enter into negotiations.  He said the maritime security challenges were another area of concern to India.The Sea lanes of Communication were critical for peace, stability, prosperity and development of the Indo-Pacific region.He said: “India has strengthened cooperative engagements in the Indo-Pacific based on converging visions and values for promotion of peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.”The centrality of ASEAN and utilisation of ASEAN-led mechanisms are important platforms for implementation of our shared vision for the Indo-Pacific, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/without-naming-china-india-reiterates-rule-based-order-in-indo-pacific-269286
17-06-2021|| New Delhi||UP Police book Twitter, journalists for circulating Muslim man video||Police here have booked Twitter, a news portal and six people for circulating a video in which an elderly Muslim man says he was thrashed and asked to chant “Jai Shri Ram”.Police claimed that it was done to create communal unrest.The FIR names Twitter Inc, Twitter Communications India, news website The Wire, journalists Mohammed Zubair and Rana Ayyub, Congress leaders Dr Sama Mohammad, Salman Nizami, Masqoor Usmani and writer Saba Naqvi.“These people did not verify the truth of the matter and shared it online with a communal angle with an intention to disrupt public peace and create a divide between religious groups,” the FIR states.The FIR was lodged at the Loni Border police station in Ghaziabad around 11.30 pm on Tuesday on the basis of a complaint lodged by a local policeman.The police action came within hours of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath exchanging remarks on Twitter over the incident.Meanwhile, the Press Club of India (PCI) also took note of the police action and demanded that the FIR naming the journalists should be quashed because it shows “vendetta” of the Ghaziabad police to create a “sense of terror” in the media and society at large.“The PCI appeals to the government of UP to intervene in the matter at the earliest to ensure that journalists are not made easy targets of police high handedness by filing FIR against them,” it said in a statement.In a video clip, which surfaced on social media on June 14, the elderly Muslim man, Abdul Shamad Saifi, is heard saying he was thrashed by some young men and asked to chant “Jai Shri Ram”.However, the Ghaziabad police have ruled out a communal angle. It said the accused were unhappy about a “tabeez” (amulet) he sold to them.Ghaziabad (Rural) Superintendent of Police Iras Raja said on Wednesday that three people—Kalloo Gurjar, Parvesh Gurjar and Adil—have been arrested for assaulting Saifi.Police are also looking for others involved in the case including those identified as Polly, Himanshu, Arif and Murshid, he said.The FIR states that the Ghaziabad police had issued a clarification statement with facts of the incident but despite that the accused did not remove the video from their Twitter handles.The police had also clarified that those who attacked Saifi included Hindu as well as Muslim men and the incident was a result of personal issues between them and not communal, it said.“Besides, Twitter Inc and Twitter Communications India did not take any measures to remove their tweets,” it added.The FIR has been lodged under Sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (promoting enmity between groups on ground of religion, class etc), 295A (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious belief) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Earlier on Tuesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said: “I am not willing to accept that true devotees of Lord Ram can do such a thing”. “Such cruelty is far removed from humanity and is shameful for both society and religion,” the former Congress chief had tweeted in Hindi tagging a news report on the Ghaziabad incident.Sharing a screenshot of Gandhi’s tweet, Adityanath had said, “The first teaching of Lord Ram is speak the truth, which you have never done in your life”.            “You should be ashamed that even after the police telling the truth you are spreading poison in society. In the greed of power, (you) are shaming humanity. Stop humiliating and defaming the people of Uttar Pradesh,” the chief minister had said in a tweet in Hindi.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-police-book-twitter-journalists-for-circulating-muslim-man-video-269285
17-06-2021||New Delhi||Twitter loses legal cover over non-compliance of new digital rules||The government on Wednesday said US-headquartered social media giant Twitter has failed to comply with intermediary guidelines that came into effect on May 26 and accused the company of arbitrariness in fighting fake news and also claimed that ‘manipulated media’ tagging was as per likes and dislikes.Union Minister for Electronics & Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad made a series of tweets saying there were numerous queries arising as to whether Twitter was entitled to "safe harbour provision".“The simple fact of the matter is that Twitter has failed to comply with the intermediary guidelines that came into effect on May 26,” said Prasad.Also read:As per the government's Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code Rules, 2021, amended on February 25, Twitter and other social media companies are required to submit the names of Chief Compliance Officer, Resident Grievance Officer and Nodal Contact Person."Safe harbour provision" referred to by Prasad in his tweet means if social media companies comply with the rules, they are not liable for content posted on their platforms. It is like an exemption and immunity from liabilities for any third-party information and data hosted by them. In other words, non-compliance could make the company liable for criminal action in case of complaints.Prasad said it was astounding that Twitter, which portrayed itself as the flag bearer of free speech, chose the path of deliberate defiance when it came to the intermediary guidelines. If any foreign entity believed that it could portray itself as the flag bearer of free speech in India to excuse itself from complying with the law of the land, such attempts were misplaced, said Prasad.The Minister termed it "perplexing" that Twitter failed to address the grievances of users by refusing to set up a process as mandated by the law of the land.“Additionally, it chooses a policy of flagging 'manipulated media' only when it suits its likes and dislikes,” he said. This "manipulated media" tag was recently given by Twitter to posts made by senior BJP leaders, including Union Ministers, claiming that some ‘toolkit’ was allegedly prepared by the opposition Congress to defame the Modi government  during the Covid surge in April-May. “What happened in UP was illustrative of Twitter’s arbitrariness in fighting fake news. While Twitter has been over-enthusiastic about its fact-checking mechanism, its failure to act in multiple cases like UP is perplexing and  indicates its inconsistency in fighting misinformation. Indian companies, be it in pharma, IT or other sectors, going to do business in the US or in other foreign country voluntarily follow the local laws. Then why are platforms like Twitter showing reluctance in following Indian laws designed to give voice to the victims of abuse and misuse?" said the Minister.The rule of law is the bedrock of Indian society and India’s commitment to the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech was yet again reaffirmed at the G7 summit, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-loses-legal-cover-over-non-compliance-of-new-digital-rules-269284
