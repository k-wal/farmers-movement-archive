11-06-2021||New Delhi||India’s aspirational district plan a best practice for other nations: UNDP||An independent appraisal by UNDP has shown significant improvements in India’s 112 aspirational districts across health, education, and financial inclusion sectors as compared to the rest of the districts.The report handed over on Friday by UNDP India Resident Representative Shoko Noda to NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar and CEO Amitabh Kant lauds the plan as a very successful model of local area development, and one “that should serve as a best practice for several other countries where regional disparities in development status persist.”The report says that the ADP has significantly improved previously neglected districts, including those affected by Left Wing Extremism and thee areas “have experienced more growth and development in the last three years than ever before”.The plan has been in operation since 2018.UNDP’s analysis across the five key sectors of the ADP—health and nutrition; education; agriculture and water resources; basic infrastructure; and skill development and financial inclusion—found that the programme had acted as a catalyst for expediting development in these districts.The review concluded that the best performing five ADs in India are Ranchi, Chandauli, Simdega, Sonbhadra, and Rajgarh and the least performing five are Sitamarhi, Gumla, Dantewada, Bijapur, and Nawada.From the region, Kupwara and Baramulla in Jammu & Kashmir, Chamba in Himachal Pradesh, Moga and Ferozepur in Punjab, and Mewat in Haryana are among 112 aspirational districts.A comparison between the Aspirational Districts and their counterparts found that ADs have outperformed non-Ads with 9.6 per cent more home deliveries attended by a skilled birth attendant there; 5.8 per cent more pregnant women with severe anemia treated; 4.8 per cent more children diagnosed with diarrhoea treated; 4.5 per cent more pregnant registered for antenatal care within their first trimester.UNDP has recommended ‘Malaria Mukt Bastar Abhiyaan’ in Bijapur and Dantewada as a best practice. It reduced malaria incidences in these districts by 71 per cent and 54 per cent, respectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-aspirational-district-plan-a-best-practice-for-other-nations-undp-266910
11-06-2021||Kolkata/New Delhi||Chinese man caught on Bangladesh border smuggled 1,300 Indian SIM cards to his country: BSF||A Chinese national apprehended while trying to cross the India-Bangladesh border illegally has told the investigators that he and his associates have smuggled as many as 1,300 Indian SIM cards into their country by hiding them in undergarments, the BSF said on Friday.Han Junwe (35), a resident of China’s Hubei province, has been handed over by the Border Security Force (BSF) to the West Bengal Police for “further legal proceedings”.He was nabbed by a BSF patrol party from the Malda district of the state on Thursday.“Junwe has been a wanted criminal and upon thorough interrogation, shocking facts have come to the fore that he has so far taken around 1,300 Indian SIMs from India to China using fake documents.“Junwe, through his associates, used to hide the SIMs in undergarments and send these to China,” the Kolkata-headquartered south Bengal frontier of the BSF said in a statement.These SIM cards, it alleged, were used to hack accounts and carry out financial frauds.“Their (Junwe and his associates) purpose was to cheat people using SIMs and to get their money. His apprehension is a big achievement for the BSF,” the force said.Junwe has told security officials that he was using the India-Bangladesh border to enter the country as he failed to get an Indian visa after his business partner Sun Jiang was arrested by the Lucknow Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) in a case of fraud recently.“Since then, the process of issuance of a Blue Notice (issued by the Interpol) against Junwe was also initiated as per procedure,” the BSF said.A Blue Notice is generated to collect additional information about a person’s identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.The BSF claimed that a large amount of “suspicious” electronic devices was recovered from Junwe.The Chinese national has told the interrogators that he visited India at least four times in the past and has a hotel in Gurugram, near Delhi.In a video statement provided by the force on Thursday, Junwe said he entered India by “mistake” and that he wanted to “surrender” before the Lucknow ATS.He also said he visited India in the past in connection with e-commerce business.

The inquiry has been handed over to an assistant commissioner of police," the spokesperson added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-cop-abuses-fruit-seller-threatens-challan-for-not-lowering-mango-price-shunted-266907
11-06-2021||New Delhi||Why BJP vice president Mukul Roy’s ‘ghar wapsi’ is a cause of concern for the saffron party||“An election setback is of concern,” BJP’s Bengal MP Swapan Dasgupta on Friday tweeted while party vice president Mukul Roy was in the process of his ‘ghar wapsi’ into the TMC. “An election setback is of concern. The task of Bengal BJP is to draw the lessons and move ahead. These steps are underway and will become evident. There’s no cause for new and old karyakartas to be dispirited and go into a shell. BJP will build on the 2.2 crore votes and enlarge its reach,” Dasgupta said in what otherwise appeared to have no connection to the political development of the day in Bengal.  However, much was read into it amid reports of “dissent, discontent and desertions” in the party’s state unit following the electoral loss to the TMC.While the leadership has dismissed as “inconsequential” Roy’s ‘ghar wapsi’, also calling him an “opportunist” who passed on “internal information of BJP to TMC”, there are concerns in the party which also draws significant strength from the play of perceptions.Sources agree this is not exactly how the party leadership would have wanted the Mukul Roy episode to end.Suvendu Adhikari, who met the central leadership on Wednesday, had apprised it of the ongoing happenings in the state. This is also almost the first instance when a leader of Roy’s designation (vice president) has walked out of the BJP under Modi-Shah.“He was someone who was suitably accommodated in the organisation,” party leaders say regarding Roy who joined the BJP with much fanfare and returned to TMC along with his son Subhrangshu Roy with the same hullabaloo.While Roy was said to be upset over being denied the leader of opposition post in the Assembly and the increasing clout of Suvendu Adhikari, who defeated Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram in the recent polls, his return may have just opened doors to other former TMC leaders, observers say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-bjp-vice-president-mukul-roys-ghar-wapsi-is-a-cause-of-concern-for-the-saffron-party-266904
11-06-2021||Guwahati||Assam CM’s comment asking minorities for family planning misleading: Opposition||The opposition Congress and AIUDF along with a minority student body on Friday termed Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s statement asking the minority community to adopt a decent family planning policy as “unfortunate, frivolous and misleading”.Referring to recent evictions of a number of families from “encroached land” in three districts of the state, the chief minister on Thursday had urged the minority community to adopt the policy saying that increased population leads to poverty, shrinking of living space and consequent land encroachment.The state Congress claimed that Sarma’s remarks on “population explosion” in Assam are “certainly misinformed and misleading”, while the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) claimed that the rate of increase in population among some other communities is higher than that of the minorities.The All Assam Minority Students’ Union (AAMSU) said that the population problem can be resolved by ensuring proper education and health facilities for the people.According to the 2011 Census, Muslims comprise 34.22 per cent of Assam’s total population of 3.12 crore and they are in majority in several districts. While Christians form 3.74 per cent of the total number of people in the state, the percentage of Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains is less than one per cent.The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) said that this is highly unbecoming of a chief minister who is expected to be well versed in the demographic facts of his state.As per the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) undertaken by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and released in December 2020, the total fertility rate (TFR) across most Indian states have declined in the last five years, APCC spokesperson Bobbeeta Sarma said.According to the NHFS, the fertility rate of women in Assam has declined from 2.2 in 2015-16 to 1.9 in 2020-21, which means the future population of the state will be less than what it is now and there is no question of its increase, she said.“If, however, the chief minister is referring to the population explosion that may happen in future due to immigration of people from Bangladesh and Pakistan because of implementation of CAA, then perhaps his concern is valid,” Sharma said.The Congress, however, would like to assure Sarma that the party will take definite steps in that case and do its best to prevent such encroachments, she added.The AIUDF, an alliance partner of the Congress, also termed the chief minister’s statement targetting only the minorities responsible for population explosion as “unfortunate and not proper for a person holding that post”.Population increase in Assam is lower than the national growth and it is also less compared to some other states, AIUDF spokesperson and MLA Aminul Islam said.Studies have shown that the rate of growth of many scheduled castes and tribes is higher than that of the minority community, he claimed.Besides, social scientists have pointed out that poverty, illiteracy, lack of awareness were mainly responsible for population increase and the state government should focus on these issues instead of targetting a particular community, he said.“The people of the community have already supported the government in the case of the two-child norm for election to panchayats and in government jobs,” he pointed out.The chief minister must take all communities into confidence to solve the problem of population and this can be only done if the government takes measures to ensure education facilities, employment opportunities and create social awareness in the ‘char’ or riverine and other backward areas, Islam added,AAMSU president Rejaul Islam Sarkar said that the chief minister’s statement that minority women have to be educated so that they do not give birth to many children lacks sincerity and is frivolous.“We have been working to create awareness among the community members for the last five years and nowadays nobody gives birth to 10 to 12 children. The population problem can be resolved by ensuring proper education and health facilities,” he said.Sarma had earlier served as the education minister and “if he really had the intention to solve the issue and ensure development, he could have initiated measures to remove illiteracy and poverty”, Sarkar said.The AMSU chief said that the chief minister should also focus on providing land to more than 30,000 people who have been rendered homeless by erosion caused by the Brahmaputra river.“If people are provided with land, they will not be forced to encroach upon temple, forest or any other land to be later again evicted from there. Nobody is in favour of encroachment but they must have land and a home to live in”, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-cms-comment-asking-minorities-for-family-planning-misleading-opposition-266902

The commissioner then instructed the officials to expedite the rehabilitation work and complete it by June 30,” Bhatia added.However, according to people privy to the airport development project, some villagers are delaying their relocation due to financial constraints in building houses on the developed land plot provided to them by the government.“This delay may stretch the target of completing the rehabilitation by a fortnight or so,” they said.Bhatia, who is also the officer on special duty for the local Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), said villagers have been told to raise any of their grievances with the government officials and assured of their problems being resolved.“The villagers whose land has been acquired have been given developed land plots with proper drainage, sewage systems, streets and street lights at Jewar Bangar. They have been given double the amount of their property as per evaluation to ease their relocation,” he said.The Noida International Airport is being developed by Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), a special purpose vehicle floated by the Zurich International Airport AG, the selected concessionaire for the Rs 29,560 crore greenfield project at Gautam Buddh Nagar's Jewar near Delhi.The first phase of the project will be spread over an area of 1,334 hectare and is expected to cost Rs 4,588 crore, according to officials. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/noida-airport-officials-told-to-complete-rehab-of-villagers-by-june-30-266901
11-06-2021||Bengaluru||Karnataka HC dismisses writ petition of Amazon, Flipkart against CCI probe||The Karnataka High Court on   Friday dismissed the plea by e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart on the investigation ordered by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against them for alleged violations of provisions of competition laws.Justice P S Dinesh Kumar passed the order dismissing the petitions filed by the two companies."It would be unwise to prejudge the issues raised by the petitioners in these writ petitions at this stage and scuttle the investigation," the judge said in the order.On January 13, 2020, fair trade regulator CCI ordered a probe against Flipkart and Amazon for alleged malpractices, including deep discounting and tie-ups with preferred sellers on their platforms, following which both the companies had moved the high court seeking quashing of the probe order.The Karnataka High Court on February 14, 2020, granted an interim stay on the investigation ordered by the CCI.Following this, the CCI had approached the Supreme Court, which on October 26, 2020, asked it to approach the High Court.The CCI's January 2020 probe order followed a complaint filed by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, whose members comprise many traders dealing in smartphones and related accessories.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-hc-dismisses-writ-petition-of-amazon-flipkart-against-cci-probe-266898

Raigad and Ratnagiri districts have similar alert for Saturday as well," said the Regional Meteorological Centre of the IMD here.Mumbai and Thane districts would "very likely receive heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places (on Saturday)," it added.In the rest of Maharashtra, there would be moderate rains with thunderstorms and lightning in the next two days with varied intensity, the forecast said.Mumbai got respite from rains on Friday after a downpour over the last two days brought the city to a halt. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extremely-heavy-showers-expected-in-mumbai-region-on-sunday-imd-warns-266895
11-06-2021||Hyderabad||Genetics, lifestyle play crucial role in Covid-19 susceptibility: Study||Genetics, immunity and life-style are among the contributing factors for Covid-19 susceptibility, an analysis by an international team of scientists said on Friday.The study was directed by Dr Kumarasamy Thangaraj, Director, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics and Chief Scientist, CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), here, and Prof Gyaneshwer Chaubey, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, a press release from CCMB said.With growing data, it is becoming quite clear that there are several factors, including genetics, immunity and life- style, that contribute to Covid-19 susceptibility. CCMBs expertise in population studies is proving useful in understanding these details of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Vinay Nandicoori, Director, CCMB, said.An earlier study suggested that a specific DNA segment, strongly associated with severe Covid-19 infection and hospitalisation, was found in 50 per cent of South Asians as compared to 16 per cent of Europeans.However, the study concluded that the genetic variants responsible for Covid-19 severity among Europeans may not play a role in coronavirus susceptibility among South Asians, the release said.The scientists have compared infection and case fatality rates with South Asian genomic data over three different timelines during the pandemic, especially large number of populations from India and Bangladesh in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, but it is still unclear why some people experience more severe symptoms and adverse outcomes than others.In this study, we have compared infection and case fatality rates with South Asian genomic data over three different timelines during the pandemic. We have especially looked into a large number of populations from India and Bangladesh, said Dr Thangaraj.The study also suggests that the genetic variants correlated with Covid-19 outcomes differ significantly among caste and tribal populations of Bangladesh.Scientists working in the area of population studies should be more cautious to interpret their findings by differentiating caste and tribal populations, more explicitly so in the Bangladeshi population, Prof George van Driem, a renowned linguist and co-author of the study, said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/genetics-lifestyle-play-crucial-role-in-covid-19-susceptibility-study-266893
11-06-2021||New Delhi||Court seeks Tihar’s response on ISIS man allegation he was forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’||A Delhi court on Friday sought response from Tihar jail authorities on an application moved by an alleged ISIS member claiming that he was beaten up by other inmates there and was forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’.The accused, Rashid Zafar, was arrested in 2018 on the allegations of being members of an ISIS-inspired group who were planning suicide attacks and serial blasts, targeting politicians as also government installations, in Delhi and other parts of north India.Special Judge Parveen Singh issued notice to Tihar jail superintendent and sought the reply to Zafar’s application by June 14, when the court will further hear the matter.The application said that the incident was disclosed by the accused to his father telephonically from Tihar Jail.“The accused was beaten up and forced to chant religious slogans like ‘Jai Shri Ram’ by his inmates,” advocate M S Khan, appearing for the accused, claimed.The plea, moved by advocate Qausar Khan, requested that “appropriate directions may be passed to the Jail Superintendent to look into the matter".           The accused were arrested along with nine others in December 2018 after NIA carried out searches, in coordination with Special cell of Delhi Police and Anti-Terrorism Squad of Uttar Pradesh Police, at six places in Jafrabad, Seelampur in Delhi, and 11 places in Uttar Pradesh—six in Amroha, two in Lucknow, two in Hapur and two in Meerut.The searches and the arrests came a month before the Republic Day celebrations on January 26.According to NIA, a locally-made rocket launcher, material for suicide vests and 112 alarm clocks to be used as timers were recovered from the searches.The agency also said it recovered 25 kg of explosive material—Potassium Nitrate, Ammonium Nitrate and Sulphur.The group allegedly had also purchased remote control cars and wireless doorbells to use their circuits in assembling remote-controlled improvised explosive devices.Besides, the NIA also recovered steel containers, electric wires, 91 mobile phones, 134 SIM cards, 3 laptops, knife, sword, ISIS-related literature during the searches.The probe agency had initially rounded up 16 persons of the group ‘Harkat ul Harb e Islam’, which loosely translates into war for the cause of Islam.Of the 16 detained, 10 were later arrested - five from Amroha, in UP and five from Seelampur and Jafrabad localities in north-east Delhi, the agency had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-seeks-tihars-response-on-isis-man-allegation-he-was-forced-to-chant-jai-shri-ram-266891

11-06-2021||New Delhi||Should Covid infected get jabs? NTAGI will review new evidence: Centre||Amid a raging debate on whether Covid infected should get vaccinated, the government on Friday said the inoculation policy was dynamic and India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) could review it if new evidence emerges.In the light of top experts from the Indian Public Health Association, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine and Indian Association of Epidemiologists, in a report to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that there is no need to vaccinate those with documented COVID-19 infection, Member, Health, NITI Aaayog VK Paul today noted: “Respected institutions have submitted their views and we will consider these and also engage the experts one on one. Whether Covid infected should or should not take a vaccine would be decided through the institutional mechanism which is in place for the purpose. NTAGI meets regularly to study emerging evidence and to decide on policy”.Paul said the current recommendation from NTAGI is that Covid infected should take the shots three months after recovery (the WHO recommends shots to Covid infected six months post recovery).“If more data emerges, the policy can be nuanced. It is dynamic. There is no hardcore ideological position in science. Suggestions will be appropriately discussed. NTAGI consists of experts who are globally commended,” said Paul, repeating the same thing when asked if the gap between two Covishield doses—recently increased at 12-16 weeks—should be revised to eight weeks, as the UK has done.The experts in their report to the PM have said: “Those infected with Covid may be vaccinated after generating evidence that the vaccine is beneficial after natural infection”.They have also argued against current mass indiscriminate vaccination.”Vaccinating the vulnerable and those at risk, instead of mass population-wide inoculation including children, should be the aim at present. Mass, indiscriminate and incomplete vaccination could lead to mutant strains. Given the rapid transmission of infection across India, it is unlikely that mass vaccination of all adults will catch up with the pace of natural infection among our young population. The present situation of the pandemic demands that we should be guided by the logistics and epidemiological data to prioritize vaccination rather than opening vaccination for all age groups at this stage,” the report said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/should-covid-infected-get-jabs-ntagi-will-review-new-evidence-centre-266877

I always do", replied Kumar with a broad smile when asked by reporters what would he like to say on the birthday of the RJD supremo, whom he had unseated from power more than a decade ago.Political hostility between the two leaders, which began in mid 1990s and continues till date barring a short-lived alliance in the previous decade, has been highly talked about in the political circles.When Prasads elder son Tej Pratap Yadav got married in 2018, it was the image of the grooms father and his political adversary in a warm embrace which hogged the limelight.Prasad, who has been convicted in a good deal of fodder scam cases, was released from jail recently, though the fresh outbreak of Covid-19 has kept the ailing septuagenarian from being in his home town, in the midst of his doting supporters.The ailing septuagenarian, who is staying at New Delhi, took part in a quiet celebration, pictures of which were shared on social media by his eldest daughter Misa Bharti.Adored and abhorred in equal measure for his devil may care attitude, Prasad can be seen, in one of the pictures, flanked on either side by wife Rabri Devi, who had succeeded him as the Chief Minister of Bihar, and Misa besides his grandchildren.Other pictures show the flamboyant politician, dressed in T-shirt and shorts, cutting the cake and receiving a bouquet from his wife.In Patna, former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) president Jitan Ram Manjhi wished Prasad on his birthday.Manjhi talked to Prasad over phone when Tej Pratap Yadav visited his house during the day.Manjhi and Yadav meeting was seen with interest in the political circles as HAM is a part of the NDA in Bihar.But, both Manjhi and Yadav maintained that the meeting was personal and not political. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lalu-turns-74-celebrates-quietly-at-delhi-home-nitish-extends-greetings-266875

Rakesh Wadhawan was at the KEM hospital since April this year, she alleged.When she visited the hospital earlier this month, she saw Rakesh Wadhawan conducting his business affairs and signing office documents from the hospital bed, she said.“He has been running his office from the 11th floor of the KEM hospital,” Sayed told the HC. She also submitted photographs and videos to support her claim.The state’s lawyer told the court that Rakesh Wadhawan was suffering from Covid-19 and hence he was hospitalised.Advocate Sayed, however, said in that case he should have been in an isolation or Covid ward.The court will hear the plea next Thursday.

Thereafter, in 2017 and 2019, the maximum speed limit for few roads was further revised.Meenu Choudhary, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said, "There have been a number of changes and improvements in the road infrastructure in the city in past few years, including construction of flyovers, underpasses, high speed/signal free corridors as well as improvement in vehicle technology.“Further, there was a need to make speed limit uniform on Delhi roads as far as possible. Therefore, a revision of the existing speed limits was felt necessary,” she said.According to the revised notification, speed limits for two-wheelers is now separately notified as 50 Kmph on the roads where speed of car is 50 Kmph, and 60 Kmph on roads where it is 70/60 Kmph.The maximum speed limit for M2 and M3 category vehicles (passenger vehicles comprising nine or more seats in addition to the driver's seat) has also been notified."The maximum speed limit for M2 and M3 categories vehicles has been notified as 50 Kmph on roads where speed of car is 50 Kmph, and 60 Kmph on roads where it is 70/60 Kmph, whereas the maximum speed limits for all types of transport vehicles, excluding M1, M2 and M3 category vehicles including Gramin Sewa, TSRs, Phat-Phat Sewa, Quadricycle, and N category vehicles (goods vehicles), has been notified as 40 Kmph,” a police officer said.However, the maximum speed limit for residential areas, markets, service lanes and for minor roads inside all residential area, commercial markets and service roads, has been notified as 30 Kmph, the officer said.Earlier, the speed limit for transport vehicles in these areas was between 20-30 kmph.

11-06-2021||New Delhi||SC postpones INI CET Exam 2021 by a month||The Supreme Court on Friday postponed by a month the INI CET Examination, 2021 scheduled to be conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on June 16 for admission to higher/post-graduate medical studies."Considering that many of the candidates intending to appear in the exam are in Covid duty and in remote areas, we are of the opinion that June 16 date is arbitrary. We direct the exam to be postponed by one month," said a Bench led by Justice Indira Banerjee.The examination can be held anytime after the expiry of one month, it said.Noting that the situation in Delhi has improved but in other places figures were high, the Bench sought to know from AIIMS if the examination could be postponed by a month.The AIIMS counsel opposed putting off examination. "Staying the exam will create an unprecedented crisis. One thousand doctors will be recruited by this exam. The petitioners can apply in the next September session exam. If a stay is granted there will be no doctors," he argued."These doctors are on Covid duty. How will they appear for the exam," asked the Bench, which also included Justice MR Shah.A group of 26 doctors had moved the top court against the holding of INI CET Exam 2021, contending that it went against the assurance regarding postponement of PG Examinations given by the PMO while postponing the NEET PG Examination, 2021 by four months.The students were assured that they will be given at least one month to prepare for the examination and holding the examination during the pandemic would increase pressure on graduate doctors. They also cited how Class 12 examinations were cancelled."Conducting of this examination is resulting in endangering lives of thousands of doctors who are frontline workers in different hospitals which is a clear negation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India," they submitted.Highlighting the fact that only 19-day prior notice was given, they submitted that examination centres were in different states or far from the candidates’ place of working requiring them to travel during restrictions due to Covid-19 lockdown.They said many of the doctors were not fully vaccinated and had not even received the first jab of Covid-19 vaccine."In the prevailing circumstances due to Covid-19, the conducting of this examination is resulting in building up pressure on the graduate doctors from across India to sit for the examination on 16th June, 2021, when under the present circumstances the Board examinations and other professional examinations have been either cancelled or postponed," the petitioners submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-postpones-ini-cet-exam-2021-by-a-month-266860

As a gesture of solidarity & close cooperation, medical equipment including ventilators & ambulances was handed over today by Ambassador Kwatra to General Purna Chandra Thapa, Chief of the Nepali Army,” the Indian Embassy in Nepal tweeted.“The medical supplies were provided by the Indian Army,” the Nepal Army spokesperson said in a tweet.As part of its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, medical equipment and supplies worth Nepali Rupees 28.80 crore (about INR 18,01,09,000) provided by the Indian Army, the Indian Embassy said in a statement.The ambassador reaffirmed India’s support to the Nepali Army in its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.The medical equipment, including ventilators, ambulances, ICU beds, PPE kits, PCR test kits etc was delivered to Kathmandu on June 10.The Indian Army has been assisting the Nepali Army to fight Covid-19 through various kinds of assistance since last year, including 1 lakh doses of Covishield vaccines which were provided in March 2021.The latest assistance is another testament to the close cooperation between the two armies and the two countries, particularly in times of need, the statement said.Nepal’s coronavirus caseload surpassed 6,00,000-mark on Thursday with 2,874 more people testing positive for the infection.Meanwhile, 59 fresh fatalities pushed Nepal’s total death toll to 8,238.The country’s active Covid-19 case count currently stands at 77,858.

In 2015, it halted all the proceedings before all courts in India in view of an ITLOS (International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea)  order calling upon India and Italy to suspend all criminal proceedings against the two marines.The Hague-based tribunal on July 2 last year ruled that the two marines should be tried in Italy and asked the Indian authorities to close the criminal case against them.The tribunal, however, had agreed with India's contention that the Italian marines broke the freedom of navigation aspect of UNCLOS and, therefore, the killed fishermen's kin were entitled to compensation.The top court on April 9 asked the Centre to deposit with it the Rs 10 crore compensation agreed to be paid by Italy in terms of an award given by a Hague-based international tribunal before the proceedings were closed.It had on August 7 last year said it would like to hear the relatives of two Indians killed by Italian marines off the coast in Kerala in 2012 before closing the case.A day after an international tribunal ruled that India didn't have jurisdiction to try two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen in Kerala, the Centre had on July 3, 2020, moved the Supreme Court seeking disposal of the case pending before it.The Centre said it had accepted the award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/italian-marines-sc-to-pass-orders-on-compensation-on-june-15-266857

11-06-2021||New Delhi||No link between genetic risk factor and severe Covid among South Asians: Study||The major genetic risk factor for Covid-19 severity in European population may not increase the susceptibility to the disease among South Asians, according to a study that used data from India and Bangladesh.Since the beginning of the pandemic, scientists have wondered why some people experience more severe symptoms and adverse outcomes from Covid-19 than others.An earlier research done on European population suggested variations in a specific segment of DNA, or genetic material, is strongly associated with severe Covid-19 infection and hospitalisation.This DNA segment is present in 50 per cent of South Asians as compared to 16 per cent of Europeans.A team of scientists, led by Kumarasamy Thangaraj, from CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and Professor Gyaneshwer Chaubey, from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi, analysed the role of this DNA segment in determining Covid-19 outcomes among the South Asian population.The finding, published in the journal Scientific Reports on Friday, concluded that the genetic variants responsible for Covid-19 severity among Europeans may not play a role in disease susceptibility among South Asians."In this study, we have compared infection and case fatality rates with South Asian genomic data over three different timelines during the pandemic. We have especially looked into a large number of populations from India and Bangladesh," Thangaraj."Our result reiterates the unique genetic origin of South Asian populations. A dedicated genome-wide association study on South Asian Covid-19 patients is the need of time for us in the Asian sub-continent," said Chaubey, first author of the study.The research also suggests that the genetic variants correlated with Covid-19 outcomes differ significantly among caste and tribal populations of Bangladesh."Scientists working in the area of population studies should be more cautious to interpret their findings by differentiating caste and tribal populations, more explicitly so in the Bangladeshi population," said Professor George van Driem, from The University of Bern in Switzerland.“With growing data, it is becoming quite clear that there are several factors including genetics, immunity and the lifestyle are the contributing factor for Covid-19 susceptibility," said Driem, a co-author of the study.Other participants of this study included researchers from Dhaka University, Bangladesh, Forensic Science Laboratory in Madhya Pradesh, and Birla Institute of Scientific Research, Jaipur. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-link-between-genetic-risk-factor-and-severe-covid-among-south-asians-study-266847

Can there really be a blanket stay on FIRs lodged against you ? We are not dealing with all FIRs. There are different Magistrates to deal with it,” the Bench told Jethmalani.The case was assigned to Justice Gupta’s Bench after Justice B R Gavai on May 18 recused himself from hearing his plea.Singh, a 1988-batch IPS officer, was removed from the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner on March 17 and was made the General Commander of Maharashtra State Home Guard after he levelled allegations of corruption and misconduct against the then Home Minister and senior NCP leader Anil Deshmukh.The Bombay High Court had ordered a CBI probe into allegations of Singh against Deshmukh who had to resign as the minister.He has alleged that he has been made to face several probes by the state government and its instrumentalities and sought their transfer outside Maharashtra and a probe into them by an independent agency like the CBI.Singh has been facing enquiries, including the one under the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in a case of 2015 and he has termed this as a witch-hunt by the state agency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-param-bir-singhs-plea-for-transfer-of-inquiries-to-independent-agency-outside-maharashtra-266827

A profound scholar, he turned to organic farming to enrich nature and humanity. His demise will leave a void. My condolences to his family and followers.”         The Odisha government had also awarded him with the Utkal Seva Samman for his outstanding social service.Similarly, UNEP had conferred ‘The Global Roll of Honour’ on Radha Mohan for his distinguished work for the environment.“Prof Radhamohan Ji was deeply passionate about agriculture, especially adopting sustainable and organic practices. He was also respected for his knowledge on subjects relating to the economy and ecology. Saddened by his demise.Condolences to his family and admirers. Om Shanti,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a Twitter post.Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik tweeted, “Deeply saddened to know the passing away of Gandhian and Padma Shri awardee Prof Radha Mohan.

11-06-2021||New Delhi||Uttarakhand disaster was caused by massive rock and ice avalanche, says international team of scientists||The February 7 disaster in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, that resulted in over 200 dead or missing, was the result of an avalanche that dropped about 27 million cubic metres of rock and glacier ice from the nearby Ronti peak, according to a study by an international team of researchers.The region experienced a humanitarian tragedy on February 7 this year, when a wall of debris and water barrelled down the Ronti Gad, Rishiganga and Dhauliganga river valleys.To investigate the cause, scope, and impacts of the disaster, a global team of 53 scientists came together in the days following the tragedy.The researchers, including those from Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi and Indian Institute of Technology Indore, determined that the flood was caused by falling rock and glacier ice that melted on its descent, and not by a lake or diverted river.The study, published in the journal Science on Thursday, suggests that climate change is contributing to such events happening more frequently, and highlights risks of increasing development projects in fragile environments.The rock and ice avalanche rapidly transformed into an extraordinarily large and mobile debris flow that transported boulders 20 metres in diameter, and scoured the valley walls up to 220 metres above the valley floor, the researchers said.The finding will help researchers and policymakers better identify emerging hazards in the region.The study used satellite imagery, seismic records, and eyewitness videos to produce computer models of the flow.Initial hypotheses for the cause of the event suggested a glacial lake outburst flood.However, there are no glacial lakes large enough to produce a flood anywhere near the site, the researchers noted.“Our access to high-resolution satellite imagery and research software, and our expertise in satellite remote sensing were crucial to get a bird’s-eye view of how the event unfolded,” said study co-author Shashank Bhushan, a doctoral student at the University of Washington in the US.“We worked with our French collaborators to coordinate satellite collections within days of the event and rapidly process the images to derive detailed topographic maps of the site,” Bhushan said.The team compared the images and topographic maps from before and after the event to document all of the changes and reconstruct the sequence of events.“We tracked a plume of dust and water to a conspicuous dark patch high on a steep slope,” said study lead author Dan Shugar, associate professor at the University of Calgary in Canada.The dark patch turned out to be the scar left by the 35 million cubic yards of missing rock and glacier ice with a three-foot-deep layer.“This was the source of a giant landslide that triggered the cascade of events, and caused immense death and destruction,” said Shugar.The researchers also used the maps to determine how far the block of ice and rock fell.“The failed block fell over a mile before impacting the valley floor. To put this height in context, imagine vertically stacking up 11 space needles or six Eiffel Towers,” Bhushan said.The team also quantified how the pulverised rock and ice were redistributed over the downstream areas.“As the block fell, most of the glacier ice melted within minutes. This resulted in a huge volume of water associated with the flooding,” Bhushan said.“This is highly unusual—a normal rock landslide or snow/ice avalanche could not have produced such huge volumes of water,” he explained.The team also used satellite image archives to show that previous large ice masses had been dislodged from the same ridge and struck the same valley in recent years.The researchers suggest that climate change is likely increasing the frequency of such events, and that the greater magnitude of the latest disaster should be considered before further infrastructure development in the area.“These high-mountain rivers are appealing for hydropower projects, and we need a better understanding of the full spectrum of potential high-mountain hazards,” said David Shean, a University of Washington assistant professor.“We hope that lessons learned from this effort will improve our ability to respond to future disasters and guide policy decisions that will save lives,” he added.

11-06-2021||Washington||India fastest-growing FinTech market, ahead of US in financial innovation: Senator Steve Daines||Republican Senator Steve Daines said India is the "fastest-growing" FinTech market in the world and far ahead of the US in terms of financial innovation.The senator from Montana said the US faces a challenge from China, which has launched a digital Yuan, which they hope will one day displace the dollar as the world's dominant reserve currency. "Even beyond the digital Yuan, it's no secret that China and many other countries are well ahead of us with regard to financial innovation," he said during a Congressional hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy on Central Bank Digital Currency."India is among the fastest-growing FinTech markets in the world. In fact, India processed nearly 10 billion more real-time payments than China in 2020, USD 25.5 billion, versus USD 15.7 billion for China," Daines said.He said that compared to India and China, the United States processed just USD 1.2 billion of real-time payments.Darrell Duffie, the Adams Distinguished Professor of Management and Professor of Finance at Stanford Graduate School of Business, agreed during the testimony."At this stage, the United States has fallen behind even India and China with respect to digital currency technology. And the competition for commercial services internationally is very important," Duffie said."US banks have been ceding ground to Chinese banks internationally. If the United States wants to compete, it is going to have to invest in technology in this area, particularly with respect to the new uses of digital ledger technology," he added.Christopher Giancarlo, the former Chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said the use of distributed ledger technology with tokenised money may present a future very different from the one known today."Today, we think of a global network of banking institutions that have been very useful to the United States in sanctions, power and other areas but also to clean up money laundering and surveil that banking network. But in the future, we may see very different networks of digital currency. There may be a Yuan network. There may be a dollar-based network," he said.How these networks interact with each other is going to be of critical importance and the work of China in looking at blockchain technology and helping to set the standards of interoperability between these networks is going to be of critical importance. "Whether we eventually want a digital dollar or not is almost an issue of second-order magnitude. The first issue is that we lead in the technological development and in the standard setting," Giancarlo said.

11-06-2021||United Nations||PM Modi to address virtual dialogue on desertification, land degradation and drought at UN next week||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a virtual high-level dialogue on desertification, land degradation and drought at the UN convened by the President of the General Assembly next week.Modi, President of the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP14 President), will address the high-level event convened by President of the 75th session of General Assembly Volkan Bozkir with the support of the UNCCD on the morning of June 14, according to a media advisory issued here by the office of the General Assembly President.The high-level event will also be addressed by Deputy UN Secretary-General Amina Mohamed, Undersecretary-General and Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification Ibrahim Thiaw and Coordinator of the Association of Peul Women and Autochthonous Peoples of Chad (AFPAT) Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim as well as Heads of State and Government, ministers and senior UN officials.Agricultural industry leaders, representatives from international organisations and civil society groups will also address the event that aims to assess the progress made in fighting land degradation and map the way forward on global efforts to revive and restore healthy land. “Land is the foundation of our societies and is a cornerstone to global food security and environmental health, zero hunger, poverty eradication and affordable energy. It underpins the success of the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” the advisory said.Modi had inaugurated the high-level 14th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in New Delhi in September 2019.The Conference had adopted the Delhi Declaration in which parties encouraged the transition and increased access to energy in rural and urban communities in the context of projects aimed at combating desertification/land degradation and drought and achieving land degradation neutrality and resilience-building.It also encouraged a proactive approach to reduce the risks and impacts of desertification/land degradation and drought through the implementation of drought preparedness plans and increased risk mitigation for drought and sand and dust storms.The high-level dialogue next week will put the land restoration at the centre of the entire SDG agenda and for climate, biodiversity and disaster risk reduction, along the path to the UN Biodiversity Conference 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CBD COP 15), United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP26), UNCCD COP15, and the 2021 Food Systems Summit.“Globally, one-fifth of earth’s land area – more than 2 billion hectares – is degraded, including more than half of all agricultural land. Unless we change how we manage soil, over 90 per cent could become degraded by 2050,” the UN said.“Land degradation negatively impacts one-fifth of the planet’s land area and the livelihoods of 3.2 billion people, 40 per cent of the global population. It accelerates climate change and biodiversity loss, and contributes to droughts, wildfires, involuntary migration and the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases,” it said.The UN added that one billion hectares can be restored over the next 10 years to reverse course, and power Covid-19 recoveries and provide livelihoods at a time when hundreds of millions of jobs are at risk.The Dialogue aims to focus the international community’s attention on land issues and generate political will for implementing land solutions within Covid-19 adaptation and recovery strategies.It will encourage all member states to adopt and implement Land Degradation Neutrality targets and National Drought Plans, it said.The advisory added that the event will also encourage member states, the private sector and all stakeholders to partner for land action, and to support the Land Degradation Neutrality Fund and other funding mechanisms to scale up land restoration by all sectors of society.It will enable participants to share experiences and best practices, cutting-edge technologies and innovative business models that advance green, resilient and inclusive recovery strategies, it said.

11-06-2021||New Delhi||Unplanned vaccination can promote mutant Covid strains: Health experts in report to PM||A group of public health experts, including doctors from AIIMS and members from the national taskforce on Covid-19, have said that mass, indiscriminate and incomplete vaccination can trigger emergence of mutant strains and recommended that there is no need to inoculate those who had documented coronavirus infection.Read also: Record 6,148 Covid deaths in India in 24 hours, 94,052 new casesIn their latest report, the experts from Indian Public Health Association (IPHA), Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine (IAPSM) and Indian Association of Epidemiologists (IAE) said vaccinating the vulnerable and those at risk, instead of mass population-wide inoculation including children, should be the aim at present."The present situation of the pandemic in the country demands that we should be guided by the logistics and epidemiological data to prioritise vaccination rather than opening vaccination for all age groups at this stage."Opening all fronts simultaneously will drain human and other resources and would be spreading it too thin to make an impact at the population level," the experts said in the report which has been submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Highlighting that vaccination of young adults and children is not supported by evidence and would not be cost effective, they said unplanned inoculation can promote mutant strains."Mass, indiscriminate, and incomplete vaccination can also trigger emergence of mutant strains. Given the rapid transmission of infection in various parts of the country, it is unlikely that mass vaccination of all adults will catch up with the pace of natural infection among our young population," they said in the report.There is no need to vaccinate people who had documented Covid-19 infection. These people may be vaccinated after generating evidence that vaccine is beneficial after natural infection, the recommendations stated.Evidence-based flexibility in vaccine schedules may need to be considered for areas or populations experiencing surge on account for specific variants; for example, a reduced interval for the second dose of Covishiled for areas with surge due to the delta variant. "Vaccine is a strong and powerful weapon against the novel coronavirus. And like all strong weapons it should neither be withheld nor used indiscriminately; but should be employed strategically to derive maximum benefit in a cost-effective way," they said.While it makes perfect sense to vaccinate all adults, the reality is that the country is in the midst of an ongoing pandemic with limited availability of vaccines, the report said.In this scenario the focus should be to reduce deaths, majority of which are among older age groups and those with co-morbidities or obesity. Vaccinating young adults, given the present constraints, will not be cost-effective, they stated.The report suggested implementing repeated local level serosurveys in real time at the end of the second wave to map the vulnerability at district level to guide vaccination strategy and long term follow up of the cohort of recovered COVID-19 patients to document re-infection, severity and outcome to provide evidence base on duration of immunity after natural infection.Ongoing research on vaccine effectiveness under field conditions by following cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated in different age strata should be prioritised.Stating the current wave is largely attributable to multiple variants, the experts pointed out that India has done genome sequencing of less than 1 per cent of its positive samples and also lags behind other high incidence countries in another crucial measure, sequence per 1,000 cases.Achieving a target of genomic sequencing of 5 per cent positive samples looks challenging at the moment, but all efforts should be made to reach at least 3 per cent mark, they recommended while appreciating setting up of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) of 10 national laboratories timely and addition of 17 more laboratories.The molecular epidemiology investigations need to be accelerated with INSACOG scientists, field epidemiologists and clinical specialists working in synergy to delineate the epidemiological features of the variants with specific reference to transmissibility and fatality.Genetic sequences need to be tracked to delineate virus transmission both across the community and in health care settings. It can detect outbreaks that may otherwise be missed by traditional methods, the experts pointed out.They also recommended that syndromic management approach should be rolled out in a planned manner after sensitisation of healthcare staff, along with the optimum utilisation of laboratory testing.There is an acute shortage of testing facilities for SARS-CoV-2 in rural and peri-urban areas.The sensitivity of RAT is quite low; there are chances that some truly positive cases would remain unidentified and thus continue to spread the disease."Timely testing of each and every symptomatic patient is not possible and will put a huge burden on the health system and will delay the isolation and treatment. The optimal solution in such a situation is to adopt a syndromic management approach. It should put focus on making diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and epidemiologically linked suspects," they said.They further recommended that the vaccination status of all individuals tested for Covid-19 must be entered into the sample referral form in the RTPCR app both for individuals tested by RTPCR and RAT.The collected information must be analysed periodically to know the status of vaccinated individuals with regards to Covid-19 and its severity including mortality. As way forward, the experts said that district level sero surveillance may be planned with the methodology of EPI cluster sampling."If the seroprevalence at district level, is more than 70 per cent (on account of a combination of natural infection and vaccination,) there should not be any lockdown and return to normalcy should be attempted."This will also help in prioritising the districts for vaccination i.e. districts with lower seroprevalence should be given priority for vaccination. A fine balance is needed to be maintained between life and livelihood."  The experts also said that if very large number of individuals are vaccinated at a fast pace with limited resources for monitoring of adverse events following immunization (AEFI), some adverse events and deaths will be missed. Also, while some of these AEFI may be coincidental, it may end up contributing to vaccine hesitancy.

The home was run by a Mother Teresa Welfare Trust, which has no links with the Sisters of Charity, founded by Saint Teresa, known as Mother Teresa prior to her canonisation.“We have ordered a high-level enquiry into the incident. The 11-member enquiry team comprises officials from the police, administration, doctors and others. The committee has been asked to submit its report as early as possible,” Deputy Commissioner, East Singhbhum, Suraj Kumar told PTI.Kumar said the Director, National Employment Programme (NEP) is heading the probe team.“We have also asked the District Social Welfare Officer (DSWO) to shift the children from the Centre to another shelter home,” he said.Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), East Singhbhum, Dr M Tamil Vanan said the FIR has been lodged under Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and sections of the Indian Penal Code against the Director of MTWT, Harpal Singh Thapar, his wife Pushpa Rani Tirkey, Warden Gita Singh, her son Aditya Singh and one more person on June 6 on the complaint of two minors that they were being sexually assaulted and psychologically tortured for a long time.Tirkey, wife of Director, MTWT, is also chairperson of the East Singhbhum district child welfare committee (CWC).No arrests could be made so far in the case, the SSP said.Both the minor girls, aged about 17 years have levelled serious allegations of abuse and investigations are on as to how many children were abused, the SSP said, adding that the incident came to light after the Shelter Home In- charge had lodged a missing FIR about both the tribal girls with Telco Police Station on June 5.Both the girls were traced by lady police officers from the Telco station but were not willing to return to the Shelter home and related harrowing tales of torture and abuse which was brought to the attention of senior police officials, he said.The girls, aged 16 and 17, have given video-recorded statements in which they have reiterated all the charges made in their statements to the special Pocso court. The girls said they were physically and mentally tortured at the home and were subjected to sexual assault by Thapar, Vanan said.The girls said they were in the childrens home for the past four years, but no action was taken despite repeated complaints to Tirkey, the CWC chief, the SSP said, adding that the police were looking at the involvement of some other suspects as well.He said the police is awaiting medical reports of the two girls.The shelter home located at Shamsher Tower in Kharangajhar had girls in two rooms on the second floor, while the warden lived in another room on the same floor with her daughter and son while boys who had also been given shelter in the home, lived on the ground floor.Vanan said police were also probing allegations that Thapar and Tirkey used to transfer government funds and private donations into their personal accounts. Police said that the girls had alleged that money and other gifts and donations were taken away from them and added that efforts were on to arrest all accused by raiding possible hide-outs.When contacted, DSWO Satya Thakur told PTI: “There are 40 children in the government registered Mother Teresa Welfare Trust including 24 girls and 16 boys. All of them are below 18 years barring a girl and a boy each of 20 years. We will be shifting them to BK Bal Kalyan Singh run shelter home at Patamda by Friday.Mother Teresa Welfare Trust was being run for the last 10 years, she said.A Delhi Court last year had convicted 19 persons, including main accused Brajesh Thakur, in connection with sexual and physical assault of girls at a shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district.

The UP CM had made the request much earlier, however, it got delayed due to the pandemic,” they said.Many in the state BJP have been openly critical of Adityanath over “mishandling” of the second wave of the Covid pandemic and have also voiced concern to the top leadership over the impact people’s anger may have on polls next year.Apart from accusations of “mismanagement” and the anti-incumbency factor, Yogi Adityanath is also facing allegations of “favouring” the Thakur community at the cost of Brahmins.Sharma and Prasada are believed to be part of the BJP’s re-boot plan to gain the favour of the community. The buzz is that PM Modi may also induct some state leaders in his Cabinet to assuage the feelings of the powerful Brahmin lobby of eastern parts and control the damage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/adityanath-meets-amit-shah-in-delhi-amid-reports-of-dissent-and-speculation-of-cabinet-rejig-266368

Everybody should get vaccinated. Also, people should practice yoga and Ayurveda which will prepare a protective shield against disease and will also prevent Covid casualties. I will also get vaccinated soon."Commenting on the drug mafia, he said, "We cannot be at enmity with any organisation. And all the good doctors are all messengers sent by God on this earth. They are a gift to this planet. But if a person being a doctor does anything wrong then that is the fault of that individual. Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadh stores had to be opened because drug mafias have opened fancy shops where they are selling unnecessary medicines at very high prices instead of basic and necessary ones." "Our fight is not with the doctors of the country, the doctors who are opposing us, they are not doing it through an institution," he added.After controversy over allopathy and Ayurveda, the yoga guru stated that there was no doubt that allopathy is better in terms of emergency cases and surgeries but Ayurveda treats incurable diseases."We want that nobody should be harassed in the name of medicines and people should refrain from unnecessary medication. There is no doubt that allopathy is better for emergency cases and surgeries. But other life-threatening diseases, incurable disorders can be cured through ancient practices listed in Yoga Ayurveda, which is not a matter of argument," said Ramdev. As the Uttarakhand government announced certain relaxations amid the ongoing Covid-induced curfew, Baba Ramdev requested the state government to allow Char Dham Yatra with Covid guidelines. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Wednesday wrote to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) against yoga guru Ramdev alleging him of making "Unprovoked demeaning and prejudicing utterances against modern medicine".The controversy started with a video, floating on different social media sites, showing Ramdev terming modern allopathy "a stupid and failed science". Last week, the IMA had appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take appropriate action under sedition and other charges against Ramdev for allegedly "spearheading a misinformation campaign on Covid vaccination". The IMA had sent a legal notice to yoga guru Ramdev over his alleged statements against allopathy and "defaming" scientific medicine. However, the Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust has denied allegations by the IMA that Ramdev has misled people by making "unlearned" statements against allopathy and defamed scientific medicine.On May 23, Ramdev had withdrawn his statements on allopathic medicine after receiving a strong-worded letter from Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan who called his remarks "inappropriate".According to the Haridwar-based Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust statement, Ramdev was reading out a WhatsApp forwarded message in the video that has gone viral on social media.
