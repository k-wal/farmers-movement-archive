We suspect that someone was waiting somewhere to guide him to Kaliachak in Malda district,” the officer said.The STF is also trying to find out whether or not he had any connection with the banned Maoist outfits.“He may have some role in providing financial assistance to the Maoists,” the IPS officer said.The 35-year-old man believed to be a resident of Hubei in China was arrested by the BSF earlier this month.The BSF had said on June 11 that Junwe told the investigators that he and his associates have smuggled as many as 1,300 Indian SIM cards into their country by hiding them in undergarments.These SIM cards were allegedly used to hack accounts and carry out financial frauds.The BSF had said that Junwe used the India-Bangladesh border to enter the country as he failed to get an Indian visa after his business partner Sun Jiang was arrested by the Lucknow Anti-Terrorism Squad in a case of fraud recently.

22-06-2021||New Delhi||Rahul takes dig at govt over rising fuel prices||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at the Centre over the rising fuel prices on Tuesday, saying the petrol and diesel rates will come down at the time of the next elections in the country.He also shared a graph with the caption "GOI's Vikaas of Fuel Prices" on Twitter, which showed that the prices of petrol and diesel have been rising since September last year, only plateauing or dipping during state polls."When will the prices of petrol and diesel come down? When the next elections happen," the former Congress chief said in a tweet in Hindi.His attack on the government came as the diesel price crossed the Rs 100-per-litre mark in Odisha after the fuel rates were hiked again.The price of petrol was hiked by 28 paise per litre and that of diesel by 26 paise per litre, according to a price notification of the state-owned fuel retailers.In Delhi, the petrol price has hit an all-time high of Rs 97.5 a litre, while diesel is now priced at Rs 88.23 per litre.The fuel prices differ from state to state, depending on the incidence of local taxes such as Value-Added Tax (VAT) and freight charges.For this reason, first the price of petrol and now that of diesel has crossed Rs 100 per litre at several places.The Congress has been critical of the government for the rising petrol and diesel prices.The opposition party has also been demanding that petrol and diesel be brought under the purview of the GST regime. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-takes-dig-at-govt-over-rising-fuel-prices-272444

22-06-2021||Mumbai||Wealth of India’s super-rich slips 4.4 per cent to USD 12.83 trillion in 2020 due to rupee fall: Report||In spite of Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, the Poonawallas and many other Indians seeing a jump in their net worth in the pandemic-hit 2020, overall wealth of the country’s super-rich dipped 4.4 per cent to USD 12.83 trillion in the year due to the rupee’s fall, and so did their tally, says a report.  The number of dollar millionaires in India fell from 7,64,000 in 2019 to 6,98,000 solely because of the rupee’s fall, while their cumulative wealth stood at USD 12.833 trillion, down USD 594 billion or 4.4 per cent from the previous year, according to the report by Credit Suisse Research Institute.The country is home to just 1 per cent of the global rich, whose number rose by 5.2 million to 56.1 million in the COVID-hit year.  However, the report expects the number of millionaires in India to soar 81.8 per cent to 1.3 million by 2025.Each adult Indian was worth an average USD 14,252 in 2020, which has been growing at an average annual rate of 8.8 per cent from 2000 through 2020 as against the global average of 4.8 per cent.There were 4,320 ultra-high networth individuals with net worth exceeding USD 50 million.Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani had earned Rs 90 crore every hour or Rs 2,77,700 crore in 2020, taking his overall wealth to Rs 6,58,400 crore, according to the Hurun India Rich List. Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani’s wealth jumped USD 16.2 billion in 2020 to USD 67.6 billion as of mid-May, according to a Bloomberg tally.Global wealth climbed by USD 28.7 trillion to USD 418.3 trillion, after losing USD 17.5 trillion in the market rout in the first quarter, while the number of overall global millionaires jumped by 5.2 million to 56.1 million, as per the Credit Suisse report.As a result, an adult now needs over USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1 per cent, up from USD 988,103 in 2019.For the first time, over 1 per cent of all global adults were in nominal terms dollar millionaires in 2020, it added. Among the rich, the ultra-high networth group grew even faster, adding 24 per cent more members—the highest increase since 2003. Those with USD 10,000-100,000 have seen the biggest rise since 2000, more than trebling from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020.According to Credit Suisse economists, wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.Total global wealth grew 7.4 per cent and wealth per adult rose 6 per cent to reach another record of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in wealth creation.However, the pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020 as USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March of 2020, or a fall of 4.4 per cent. But this was reversed by end-June when share prices began to soar and reached record levels by year-end. Housing markets also benefited from the prevailing optimism.The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year, taking the aggregate global wealth up by USD 28.7 trillion to USD 418.3 trillion, the report said. While North America added USD 12.4 trillion, USD 9.2 trillion was added in Europe, China gained USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) added another USD 4.7 trillion. Latin America was the worst performer, with total wealth loss of 11.4 per cent or USD 1.2 trillion, followed by India with a loss of 4.4 per cent.The report also projected a 39 per cent rise in global wealth by 2025 at USD 583 trillion, with the number of millionaires reaching 84 million. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wealth-of-indias-super-rich-slips-4-4-per-cent-to-usd-12-83-trillion-in-2020-due-to-rupee-fall-report-272432

In addition, 29 cases are of B.1.1.7 Alpha variant, he added.The Alpha variant is also a strain “of concern” as it spreads more rapidly than the original strain.Apart from these, a few other variants of coronavirus have also been detected in the state, Singh said.A maximum of 145 cases has been detected from Jamshedpur followed by 56 from state capital Ranchi. Both the districts have been witnessing a high number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities.Dhanbad accounted for 49 cases of the variants, Hazaribag 48 and Palamu 30, he said.“For identifying the strains of the virus prevailing in the community, the state has sent 364 positive stored RT- PCR samples to Regional Genome Sequencing Laboratory (RGSL), Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) Bhubaneshwar for WGS,” State Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Praveen Kumar Karn told PTI.The samples were sent from Ranchi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), IRL, Itki Ranchi, District Palamu Medical College, and Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Jamshedpur which have been identified as Sentinel Surveillance Sites.“This sequence will help in better planning for the future and alert f the Health Department to plan for better management of the patients,” Dr. Karn said.A total of 537 samples had been sent to ILS, Bhubneshwar, between March and April 2021 for WGS out of which 364 were processed.In a letter to heads of the sentinel surveillance sites, the health secretary mentioned: “All labs are directed to get the SRF ID of the death cases from the District Administration and send the respective samples for WGS within 48 hrs”.“Therefore samples of all those patients who have died on or after 1st April 2021 shall mandatorily be sent for WGS to ILS, Bhubneshwar. Hence, all identified Sentinel sites are directed to kindly comply with all activities for combating this large outbreak Covid-19”.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said that even though the rate of recovery is more than 98 per cent in the state, the danger is not over.“According to experts, the third wave may trouble us in six to eight weeks and the state government has made preparations for it but it would not be possible without the help of people”, he added.The number of active coronavirus cases in Jharkhand has been recorded at 1,489 while the death toll has reached 5,100.New coronavirus cases were recorded at 122, which took the caseload to 3,44,665. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/detection-of-multiple-covid-variants-puts-jharkhand-on-high-alarm-272429

22-06-2021||Kochi||Kerala HC stays two recent orders of Lakshadweep administration||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday stayed the operation of two recent orders of the Lakshadweep administration—to close down dairy farms and remove meat products, including chicken, from the menu of midday meals for school children.The stay order was issued by a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly on a PIL filed by a lawyer from the Islands.Petitioner Ajmal Ahmed R alleged that when Praful Khoda Patel took charge as island administrator in December last year, his top priority was to close down the farms run by the Animal Husbandry department and to ‘attack’ the food habits of the islanders that were being followed from time immemorial.Challenging the May 21, 2021, order of the Director of Animal Husbandry, directing immediate closure of all the dairy farms, Ahmed said it was done with an intention to implement the proposed ‘Animal Preservation (Regulation), 2021’, which bans slaughter of cows, calves and bulls.He submitted that as per this proposed rule, sale and purchase of beef and beef products would be banned by closing down the farms, curtailing the islanders’ source of getting milk products and forcing them to purchase milk products imported from Gujarat.“This is nothing but interfering with the right to choose the food habits of the Island people, which is against the right enshrined under the Constitution,” Ahmed alleged.The petitioner also challenged the administrations’ decision to remove chicken and other meat items from the menu of midday meals for school children in Lakshadweep.“Now the Administrator wants to intervene and as part of his ill-motivated intention to implement his hidden agenda, a meeting of the union territory level monitoring committee was held at his instance.As per the decision taken by said committee in the meeting held on January 27, 2021, a new menu has been suggested, totally altering the prevailing menu for mid-day meal for the students in the Islands”, he alleged.Lakshadweep has been witnessing protests by various political parties since the administration started implementing reform measures in the islands. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-hc-stays-two-recent-orders-of-lakshadweep-administration-272423

22-06-2021||New Delhi||Passenger held for ruckus at IGI Airport over denial to fly without RT-PCR report||A 36-year-old passenger from Uttar Pradesh was arrested for creating ruckus at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here after allegedly being denied boarding by the airline for not carrying a mandatory RT-PCR test report, police said on Tuesday.Suraj Pandey, a businessman from Rudrapur in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested on Monday based on a complaint received from Deepak Chadha, Deputy Manager of Vistara Airlines, they said.In his complaint, Chadha alleged that the passenger came to IGI Airport’s Vistara airline counter for heading to Mumbai by flight number UK933 but he did not have an RT-PCR report and was not allowed to board the aircraft following which he missed the flight, police said.The airline official further alleged that around 3 pm, Pandey turned violent and started shouting. He also got onto the baggage belt and started walking on it and obstructed the airline staff and other passengers, police added.Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGI Airport) Rajeev Ranjan said, “We checked the CCTV footage to verify the complainant’s version. From the contents of the complaint, CCTV footage and enquiry conducted so far, accused Suraj Pandey had committed offence under relevant sections of the Delhi Police Act. Subsequently, he was arrested and his medical examination was also conducted.”            Since it was a bailable offence, the accused passenger was released on bail and will be produced before a court here, he said.An official statement issued by the Vistara spokesperson said the customer booked the flight from Delhi to Mumbai on June 21 but was not accepted on the flight as he was not carrying a Covid-19 RT-PCR test report, which is mandatory as per government guidelines.“In reaction, he behaved badly with our staff and other customers, and his acts threatened the safety of ground operations. We have provided a full refund of the booking to the customer and notified the authorities of the incident,” the spokesperson added.Vistara stands firm with its zero-tolerance policy against unruly behaviour or act that endangers the safety, security, and dignity of its customers and staff, the airline further said.

22-06-2021||New Delhi||SC dismisses petitions against cancellation of Class XII exams||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed petitions challenging the decisions of the CBSE and the ICSE to cancel Class XII examinations and go for separate formulae for evaluation of students, saying it’s a well-informed decision taken at the highest level to protect interests of over 20 lakh students.“We hold that there is no need to interfere with the scheme propounded by CBSE and ICSE. It takes into account concerns of all students,” said a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar.Rejecting all petitions challenging the decision by CBSE & ICSE against conducting Class XII board exams, it affirmed the assessment schemes and timeline for optional examinations between August 15 and September 15. The Bench also gave its final approval to the evaluation formulae proposed by the two boards to evaluate Class XII students after cancellation of their examinations.Attorney General KK Venugopal assured the top court that the UGC will instruct colleges to take into account the schedule and complete the process of admission after declaration of results by all boards.“We find force in the submission made by Attorney General that the scheme has been formulated by an expert body consisting of 12 members,” it said.“Boards have taken the decision to cancel the examinations which is in larger public interest. Accordingly, the writ petition deserves to be dismissed...,” the Bench said.The Bench rejected arguments of senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing a parent body, that the scheme should provide an option to appear for improvisation at the initial stage itself and results of internal assessment should be declared together.“After hearing the views of Attorney General, we are of the view that this suggestion can’t be taken forward. This would result in denial of option to students and would result in uncertainty until the examinations of improvisation are conducted and results are declared,” it said.“Individual perception will not decide this case. Decision based on larger interest has to be taken, there are logistical issues and issues with teachers and support staff,” noted the Bench which also included Justice Maheshwari.The Bench asked the Andhra Pradesh government to inform it by June 24 its decision regarding holding Class 12 examinations in the state.“If there is one fatality, we will make the state responsible’,” it told the counsel representing Andhra Pradesh.Ending uncertainty over the method of calculating marks/grades of Class XII students following cancellation of their examinations due to Covid-19, the top court on June 17 accepted the formulae of CBSE and ISCE to evaluate them and publish their results by July 31.According to the scheme, Class X, XI and XII marks will be considered in 30:30:40 ratio to prepare the final results of Class XII students of CBSE and results would be declared by July 31. The marks in best of three subjects would be considered for the purpose for Class X, XI and XII.However, the ICSE proposed a different set of criteria to compute marks based on performance of students in the last six years and declare results by July 20.As some students and parents’ bodies questioned the decision to cancel the Class XII examinations and the evaluation formulae to declare results of students, the top court had on Monday asked the CBSE and the ICSE to respond to their pleas, saying it’s important to have finality in the matter“For students…they need to have some ray of hope, not uncertainty” it had said, adding, “The decision for cancellation of examination has been taken at the highest level and we have in-principle accepted it.”Demanding physical examinations, UP parents’ association had assailed the different sets of criteria adopted for evaluation of students by the CBSE and the ICSE, saying there should be uniformity in the criteria of both the boards.Marking should be based on the performance of the current batch and not on any previous batch and the option to improvise the results must be given at the outset before the declaration of results, Singh had said, terming the policy as “irrational” and “complex”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dismisses-petitions-against-cancellation-of-class-xii-exams-272409
22-06-2021||New Delhi||BJP’s silence hurts, relations with them cannot remain ‘one-sided’: Chirag Paswan||“Hurt” at the BJP’s silence while he battles challenges from within his party, Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan said on Tuesday his relations with the saffron party cannot remain “one-sided” and he will consider all possibilities about his future political steps if attempts to corner him continue.In an interview with PTI, Paswan said his father Ram Vilas Paswan and he always stood by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP like a “rock” but the saffron party was not there when he expected their intervention during these “difficult” times.Underlining that he retains his faith in Modi, Paswan said, “But if you are cornered, pushed and forced to take a decision, then the party will consider all probabilities... The LJP will have to take a decision about its political future based on who stood by it and who did not.” To questions on whether the BJP reached out to him during the current crisis and speculation about its role in the split, he said it was not “appropriate” for the saffron party to keep mum while the JD (U) worked to “engineer” a split in the LJP.“I expected them (BJP) to mediate and try to sort whole things out. Their silence definitely hurts,” he said.The BJP has maintained that the LJP crisis is an internal matter of the regional party.Asked why he kept mum on the BJP while targeting another NDA constituent JD (U), Paswan said it was the saffron party that has kept mum on him.He alleged that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s party played a “visible” role in splitting his party and has had a history of doing so.Kumar never wanted a Dalit leader to gain in stature and had earlier tried to weaken the LJP founder and his father, he said, citing a history of the JD (U) wooing LJP leaders to its side. Amid speculation that his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, who has led a group of five MPs against Paswan and has been recognised as the LJP leader in Lok Sabha, may be inducted in the Union Cabinet, the two-term MP asserted that if the BJP offers Paras a ministerial berth as an LJP nominee then such a decision will not be acceptable to him. Paras may be inducted as an independent or in any other capacity but his representation as the LJP nominee will not be acceptable to him, Paswan said, adding that it is now for the Election Commission to decide on the rival claims about which faction represents the party. Asked if he still sees himself as a constituent of the BJP-led NDA at the national level, he said: “I don’t know. It is for the BJP to decide whether I am part of the alliance or not. I have proven my honesty as an ally with them... But this relation cannot be one-sided forever”.                  “If in return you do not recognise me, you help those who have separated from my party or are seen standing with them directly or indirectly. then I cannot remain in this capacity forever. If you do not give me recognition and respect, then eventually as party president I will have to take a decision in future,” Paswan said.He, however, added that he would like the relations of “faith” that developed between his party and PM Modi when his father was around to continue.  Ram Vilas Paswan was a Cabinet minister in the Modi government since it came to power for the first time in 2014 and till his death last year.Chirag Paswan said “friends” from the rival RJD-Congress alliance in Bihar have reached out to him for joining them but added that his priority is not an alliance but to deal with the political and legal battle with the rival faction on hand.Amid talks of various anti-BJP regional parties coming together and NCP leader Sharad Pawar seen to be working on it, he said, to a question on whether he sees a role for himself in the grouping, that “one can never say never” in terms of possibilities.  On all contentious issues during the Modi government, be it revocation of article 370, abolition of instant triple divorce among Muslims or the enactment of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, his father and he had been vocal supporters of its stand and noted that the JD(U) took a different line from the BJP. He has announced “Aashirvad Yatra” from Hajipur in Bihar from July 5, the birth anniversary of his father, as he battles the rival front for the party’s ownership.While five of six LJP MPs are with Paras, Chirag Paswan has asserted that over 90 per cent of the party’s office-bearers are with him.Paras, on the other hand, has claimed that his faction is the real LJP.

22-06-2021||---||Uphaar fire tragedy: Sushil Ansal played fraud to get passport renewed, police tells court||New Delhi, June 22Sushil Ansal, convicted in the 1997 Uphaar cinema fire that killed 59 people, played a fraud on authorities by concealing information about criminal cases pending against him while getting his passport renewed, Delhi Police has told a court here in a charge sheet filed against him.In its 8-page charge sheet filed before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Pankaj Sharma, the police claimed that Ansal misled the government authority on oath that he has not been convicted in any criminal proceedings by any court.Police claimed that regarding the passport issued in 2013 to Ansal on a ‘Tatkaal’ application, “it is found that an affidavit under the Tatkaal scheme required specific deposition by the applicant to the effect that there were no criminal proceedings pending against the applicant in any court of law or that she/ he has not been convicted by any court of law for any criminal offence in past.” “In 2013, this affidavit was filed by the accused Sushil Ansal along with his application and he has on oath misled the Government Authority (RPO) that he has not been convicted in any criminal proceedings by any Court,” said the charge sheet, filed in February this year but has come to public knowledge only now.The matter has been adjourned for January 31, 2022.The police also said that a supplementary charge sheet will be filed in the case soon, along with the sanctions from the authorities concerned to prosecute Ansal.The case was lodged on the direction of the Delhi High Court while hearing a petition by Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) chairperson Neelam Krishnamoorthy alleging that Ansal concealed or gave false information to the authorities for renewal of his passport.Krishnamoorthy said that it took Delhi Police more than two years since the high court’s direction to file the charge sheet despite the fact that that a detailed inquiry report by MEA was available on record.“We hope that the sanction under section 15 of Passport Act is granted at the earliest, for the trial to commence. In past too Sushi Ansal has taken the advantage of the delayed trial and got scot-free after being held guilty for the death of 59 people. I hope this matter will be decided at the earliest,” she said.Ansal, however, surrendered his passport on August 14, 2017 “because he knew that adverse orders against him may well be passed”, the final report said.“Sushil Ansal was fully aware of the provisions of Passport Act. He had deliberately left the relevant boxes in the application form pertaining to criminality or court proceedings unticked,” it said in the charge sheet.The police said however that during the course of the investigation, no evidence came on record against the then sub-inspector who conducted the verification in 2013 of the passport of the accused as he carried out the verification as per laid down procedure.“Regarding the role of RPO officials it is found that in 2013 the passport was issued as no adverse report was received from Special Branch, Delhi Police as the applicant Sushil Ansal changed the address from Panchseel Park to Feroze Shah Road and also concealed the fact of his conviction in his declaration in passport application,” it said.The charge sheet sought Ansal’s prosecution under sections 177 (furnishing false information) and 181 (False statement on oath or affirmation to public servant or person authorised to administer an oath or affirmation) and 12 (obtaining a passport by suppressing information about his nationality) of Passport Act.Krishnamoorthy, who lost two children in the tragedy, has been fighting a legal battle on behalf of the victims’ families for the last 20 years.It was alleged in the complaint that Ansal was getting his passport renewed every 5-10 years.As per rules, the passport application for new/ re-issue/ replacement of lost/ damaged passport issued by the Ministry of External Affairs mandates the applicant to disclose whether he is involved in any criminal case or not and to produce the NOC from the concerned court in case they are involved in any criminal prosecution.The plea claimed that Ansal was holding two passports. The court had also noted in an order that his passport number given to the court in 2018 was different from the earlier one mentioned in 2008.The fire at the Uphaar cinema had broken out during the screening of Hindi film ‘Border’ on June 13, 1997, had claimed 59 lives. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uphaar-fire-tragedy-sushil-ansal-played-fraud-to-get-passport-renewed-police-tells-court-272404

However, I was forced to drop out of college when I was 20 years old because of an early marriage," Lodaya told PTI.Inspired by her guru Jaydarshitashriji Maharaj, a scholar on Jainism, Lodaya renewed her ambition and worked to realise it by enrolling for an online course in Jainism at the trust-run institute in Jalgaon, Maharashtra."My decades-old dream came to be realised as I was inspired by my guruji to join a three-year graduation course in Jainism started at Shatrunjay Academy," she said.Lodaya completed a three-year degree course in Jainism, followed by a two-year Masters and three-year Doctorate course."As I belong to the Jain community, I plan to continue exploring the religion further and teach students from the community, who come to me regularly," said a determined Lodaya.

22-06-2021||New Delhi||SC stays Bombay HC order quashing Amaravati MP's Scheduled Caste certificate||In a relief to Amravati independent MP Navneet Kaur Rana, the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed an order of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court that quashed her Scheduled Caste certificate.Acting on her appeal challenging the high court's order, a Bench led by Justice Vineet Sharan also issued notices to the Maharashtra Government and the petitioner before the high court and posted the matter for further hearing on July 27.“Issue notice. We will have it for hearing on July 27. Meanwhile, we have stayed the judgement of the Bombay High Court. It is understood that on the next date of hearing the matter will be disposed of,” the bench said.The Bombay High Court had on June 9 cancelled the caste certificate of Rana, saying it was obtained fraudulently using fabricated documents, and had also imposed a fine of Rs 2 lakh on her.The court, which proposed to issue notice on Rana’s appeal and stay the high court’s judgement at the outset, took note of vehement submission of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Adsul, that the verdict not be stayed without hearing him.“I have a lot more to say,” Sibal said and referred to various documents to show that the high court rightly cancelled the caste certificate.“So do I”, Rohatgi said and referred to the fact that his membership to the Lok Sabha is sought to be annulled without filling the election petition.Rana, backed by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had won from Amravati constituency in 2019 by claiming to be a member of ‘Mochi’ scheduled caste.During the hearing, Rohatgi submitted that the terms ‘Mochi’ and ‘Chamaar’ are synonymous.The scrutiny committee had decided her caste status based on original records produced before it and there is a presumption that documents over 30 years old are correct, he said, adding that the genuineness of the documents was not contested.“However, the High Court reversed the scrutiny committee’s decision while hearing a petition under Article 226 (writ petition),” the senior lawyer for Rana said.A division bench of the high court, in its judgement, had asked Rana to surrender the certificate within six weeks and had asked her to pay a penalty of Rs 2 lakh to the Maharashtra Legal Services Authority within two weeks.The high court had held that Rana’s claim of belonging to ‘Mochi’ caste for obtaining the scheduled caste certificate itself was fraudulent and made with the intention of obtaining various benefits available to a candidate from such category, despite knowing she does not belong to that caste.“The application (for caste certificate) was made intentionally to make a fraudulent claim to enable the respondent no.3 (Rana) to contest the election for the post of member of parliament on a seat reserved for a Scheduled Caste candidate,” the Bombay high court had said in its judgement.“In our view, since respondent no.3 has obtained the caste certificate fraudulently and got it validated fraudulently from the Caste Scrutiny Committee by producing fabricated and fraudulent documents, such caste certificate is cancelled and stands confiscated,” the bench had said.The high court in its judgement had also noted the “abysmal” functioning of the scrutiny committee.The high court had passed the order on a petition filed by social worker Anandrao Adsule, seeking cancellation of the caste certificate dated August 30, 2013, issued by Mumbai deputy collector, identifying Rana as belonging to the ‘Mochi’ caste.Adsule filed a complaint with the Mumbai District Caste Certificate Scrutiny Committee, which ruled in Rana’s favour and validated the certificate. Adsule then approached the high court.He contended that Rana obtained the certificate using forged and fabricated documents.It was obtained by using the influence of Navneet Rana’s husband Ravi Rana, who was a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, he alleged.The high court held that the order passed by the Scrutiny Committee was “totally perverse, without the application of mind and contrary to the evidence on record”.The bench had noted that the original birth certificate of Navneet Rana did not mention the caste ‘Mochi’.—With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-bombay-hc-order-quashing-amaravati-mps-scheduled-caste-certificate-272391

But, her family didn't like their relationship due to the boy's illness and poor background and also had a grudge against his family members," Pandey told the court.The lawyer further said the victim had the knowledge of what she was doing and got into the relationship voluntarily.However, special public prosecutor Veena Shelar opposed the plea and denied all the allegations made by the applicant.The prosecution contended that there is prima-facie sufficient material on record to show the involvement of the applicant in the commission of the offence.There is no material on record about the illness of the accused applicant. If the accused is released on bail, he may tamper with the evidence in the case, the prosecutor said.The court, after hearing the submissions, granted bail to the accused, saying his detention will serve no purpose as the probe into the matter is completed and nothing has to be recovered from him.The court noted that the victim's statement "prima facie shows she herself left her parents' house and joined the company the accused".The facts of the case indicate the girl (even though she is a minor) had sufficient knowledge and capacity to know the full import of what she was doing and only thereafter voluntarily joined the applicant, the court observed. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-with-peter-pan-syndrome-gets-bail-in-case-of-sexually-assaulting-minor-girl-272390
22-06-2021||Mumbai||Fake TRP case: Mumbai Police names Arnab Goswami as accused in second chargesheet||The Mumbai Police has named senior television journalist Arnab Goswami and some employees of two Republic group channels as accused in the alleged TRP (Television Rating Points) rigging scam in the second chargesheet filed before a court here on Tuesday.The 1,912-page chargesheet was submitted before a magistrate’s court by the police’s Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) probing the case.Besides Goswami, the Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV, and ARG Outlier Media that runs Republic TV channels, the police has named five other accused including some employees of Maha Movie channel, Republic News and Republic Bharat in the fresh chargesheet.The first chargesheet in the case filed in November last year had named ex-BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta and Republic TV CEO Vikash Khanchandani.As per law, once a chargesheet is filed, the next procedure will be for the court to take congisance of the same. The magistrate would then supply copies of that chargesheet to all the accused and their lawyers, and once the copies are supplied, the magistrate would commit the case to the court of sessions.The alleged fake TRP scam came to light in October last year when the rating agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group (HRG), alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers.The HRG had been tasked with installing barometers for recording channel viewership data at sample households.Police had arrested about dozens of people, including the top officials of BARC and Republic TV. Most of them are currently out on bail.In March this year, the Bombay High Court had asked the Mumbai police why Republic TV and Goswami had not been named as accused in the case if the investigators believed to possess adequate evidence against them.Senior advocate Ashok Mundargi, the counsel for Goswami and ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, had told the HC that the police had named Goswami and several employees of the ARG Outlier Media as suspects, but had no evidence to charge them as accused in the case.However, the prosecution told the HC that the police have adequate evidence in the case and that they are still “collecting” additional evidence.The ARG Outlier Media and Goswami had approached the high court last year, filing a bunch of petitions seeking several reliefs in the alleged TRP scam.They had alleged that the whole case was malafide and they had been targeted for Republic TV”s reportage in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and Palghar lynching case last year.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fake-trp-case-mumbai-police-names-arnab-goswami-as-accused-in-second-chargesheet-272389

22-06-2021||Anugul||Odisha becomes only state to have all three species of crocodiles||Odisha has emerged as the only state to have all the three species of the reptile freshwater Ghadials at Satakosiya in Mahanadi, muggers in Bhitar Kanika National park and saltwater crocodiles.Gharial eggs need incubation for 70 days, and the hatchlings stay with their mothers for several weeks or even months.For the first time since they were introduced in its rivers back in 1975, Odisha has seen the natural nesting of Ghadials, a critically endangered species. As many as 28 hatchlings were spotted towards the end of May in the Mahanadi, in the Baladamara area near the Satkosia range.Officials have been monitoring them closely since, with round-the-clock surveillance with drones.All the original Ghadials introduced over the years in Odisha are dead now. Having waited more than 40 years for their numbers to grow naturally and for them to lay eggs, Odisha introduced 13 more Ghadials over the past three years in the Mahanadi. Only eight survived. While the Forest Department is still tracking two of them via their radio collars, the other six have moved out of its radar.With the introduction of Ghadials in 1975, Odisha had become the only state to have all the three species of the reptile freshwater Ghadials, muggers and saltwater crocodiles.About 50 forest officials from six forest divisions are monitoring the hatchlings, camping close to their habitat, patrolling the water bodies and spreading awareness across 300-odd villages located close to the river to help preserve the Ghadials.Gharials, being different from muggers, do not harm humans. But many people mistake them for crocodiles and consider them harmful.Anugul Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) Suvendu Behera said that they would be watching the Ghadials till they are in their natural habitat, which is deeper waters.“Gharials come to the shallow areas to lay eggs. Most of the gharials introduced in Odisha earlier were first kept in the Nandankanan zoo before being released into the river,” he said.As per Prashanna Behera, wildlife warden of Anugul district, the habitats of Ghadials are under threat due to encroachment and fishing. Those caught in fishing nets are either killed or have their snouts cut off. Gharials are also weaker than crocodiles and muggers, and don’t survive a fight between them.Gharials were granted full protection by law and listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

22-06-2021||New Delhi||Third Covid wave will be worse, must prepare now: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday asked the government to prepare for a third Covid wave saying it was coming and would be worse than the second.“If you think the second Covid wave was bad, the third will be worse. It is pretty clear that a third wave is coming and there will also be subsequent waves. The government must prepare now for infrastructure, essential medicines and beds,” he said releasing a White Paper on Covid Management prepared by the party’s research department.• Who demanded decentralization & then did a u-turn?- Congress• Which states did the worst in terms of vaccination yesterday even as the country created a world record? - Congress ruled statesकहावत है ‘दिया तले अंधेरा’ - समझ जाये तो बेहतर है।  Gandhi said the aim of the paper was not to finger point but flag gaps and emphazise that we need to be prepared.“Experts had spoken of the second wave but government actions and behaviour was not what it should have been. Everyone had to sufferl Today again we are standing there. The whole country knows the third wave will come. Virus is mutating and so the third wave will come. The government should make preparations for essential supplies and beds,” he said adding that Monday’s record 84 lakh dose delivery in a day was “good” but the government must ensure this process continues smoothly because it was not a one-day event.Gandhi said the management of the second and first waves was “disastrous” and the Congress was just presenting a blueprint on how to handle the third wave.Noting that he believed deaths from Covid were five to six times the official data, Gandhi suggested a Covid compensation mission saying it should not be a problem since the government is raising petrol abs diesel prices.Gandhi said the central pillar of fighting Covid is vaccination and the government must aggressively do vaccination and cross the bridge of 100 per cent vaccination of adults.Asserting that the 150-page-long document was a result of discussions within the Congress and with experts, Gandhi said it has ‘four-pillar’ strategy—information and insights—into what went wrong and how to correct them, preparation for the third wave, which includes developing critical infrastructure like oxygen and other medical supply and the idea of an economic assistance package to assist the poorest and the weakest.The fourth element of the paper is to have a Covid compensation fund.Attacking Gandhi over the ‘white paper’, BJP leader Sambit Patra accused him of playing politics over Covid crisis, and said when something good happens in the fight against coronavirus, the Congress and Rahul Gandhi “specially do something to derail it”.“Yesterday was a significant day when India became the first country in the world to administer 87 lakh vaccine doses in one day. People seemed excited and jubilant. There is a feeling that India is winning in its fight against coronavirus, just then Rahul Gandhi spoke of white paper and tried to derail it,” BJP national spokesperson said.Gandhi said: “Yes, good work has happened yesterday (highest number of vaccines administered) but this is not a series of events. The government has to make this process work not just for one day but every day until we have vaccinated our whole population”.The Congress leader also urged the central government not to have bias against non-BJP-ruled states and treat all states equally for Covid-19 vaccinations.Hitting out at the Prime Minister, Gandhi alleged that he did not take the second wave seriously as he was busy fighting elections in West Bengal and his focus was elsewhere.“The Prime Minister’s tears cannot wipe the tears of those who lost the lives of their dear ones. The families know that when their father, mother, brother, sister died, the Prime Minister was not there. The PM’s tears did not save the lives of those who died, but oxygen could have saved them,” he said, while taking a swipe at the PM for turning emotional during his address to the nation earlier this month.The former Congress chief said doctors have told him that “90 percent of the deaths during the second wave were needless. They could have been saved had timely oxygen and medicines been provided to them”.Around 3.89 lakh Covid deaths have been reported in India so far with a majority of them during the second wave. The country’s daily infections have on Tuesday come down to 42,640 new cases, the lowest in 91 days, after reporting over 4.5 lakh cases during the peak.The former Congress chief said it is pretty clear that the management of the first and second wave was “disastrous” and the party has tried to point out reasons in its white paper.“This is a blueprint on how to react to the third wave, which is going to come... The idea behind our white paper report on Covid-19 is to provide insights and information so that avoidable deaths can be prevented in the coming waves. GOI must work on our constructive inputs in the interest of the country,” he later tweeted.Asserting that the central pillar to fight Covid was vaccination, Gandhi said it was important that “we aggressively do vaccinations and cross this bridge over 100 percent vaccination as soon as possible, because that is the only protection”.     “It is important that the government prepares itself for what is going to come,” he said, adding that it needs to have the infrastructure ready, which was not there during the first and second wave, and have oxygen supply and medicines required ready.Noting that vaccinating 50 per cent of the population would not help, he said everyone should be vaccinated as fast as possible. “Vaccinations should be done fast on a war footing, as a mission”.“If the second wave was bad, the third wave would be worse,” Gandhi said, and added that the virus is smart and is mutating fast and the government has to evolve a dynamic and responsive vaccine policy by selecting vaccines that are effective.He also attacked the Centre for not giving compensation to families of Covid victims, and said if the government can take money out of their pockets as tax on fuel, why can’t it pay adequate compensation to those who lost earning members.Gandhi also said that this is not the time for claiming victory over Covid as the virus has hurt the country and will continue to hurt in the third wave and the consequent ones.Urging the Prime Minister to step up vaccine production for the benefit of all, he said he should “not get into marketing gimmicks, as done in the past”.He also alleged that the government was hiding the truth about the number of Covid deaths. “In my view, the number of death is at least 5-6 times (more),” he alleged. But, it is not productive for us to now get into the discussion of how many people have died, he added. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/third-covid-wave-will-be-worse-must-prepare-now-rahul-272370

22-06-2021||Kathmandu||Yoga originated in Nepal, not India, claims PM Oli||Nepal caretaker Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday claimed that Yoga originated in Nepal, adding that India wasn't around when Yoga started in the world."Yoga originated in Nepal, not in India. At the time when Yoga came into existence, there was no existence of India; it was divided into factions," caretaker Prime Minister Oli said.Oli made the statement while addressing a program held at his residence Baluwatar on the occasion of International Yoga Day. Oli also claimed that Indian experts have been hiding facts about it."India that exists now wasn't there in the past. India at that time was divided into different factions," caretaker PM Oli said."Divided into factions, India at that time was like a continent or sub-continent," he added.International Day of Yoga has been celebrated annually on June 21 since 2015, following its inception in the United Nations General Assembly in 2014.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his UN address, had suggested the date of 21 June, as it is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and shares a special significance in many parts of the world.In July last year, Oli had claimed that Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, is in Nepal and Lord Rama was Nepali."Although real Ayodhya lies at Thori, a city in the west of Birgunj, India has claimed that Lord Rama was born there. Due to these continuous claims even we have believed that deity Sita got married to Prince Rama of India. However, in reality, Ayodhya is a village lying west of Birgunj," Oli claimed at an event organised at Prime Minister's residence in Kathmandu.He had also blamed India of cultural encroachment by "creating a fake Ayodhya." --ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yoga-originated-in-nepal-not-india-claims-pm-oli-272362
22-06-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Popular Malayalam lyricist Poovachal Khader succumbs to Covid||Popular lyricist in Malayalam films Poovachal Khader became a victim to Covid as he passed away at the state-run Medical College Hospital here, said family sources.The 72-year-old was under treatment for a while and suffered a cardiac arrest after midnight.In a career spanning over four decades he wrote lyrics for over 400 Malayalam films for 1,500 Malayalam film songs, some of which have turned into immortal hits.Hailing from the capital city suburbs Poovachal, it was in 1973 that he entered the Malayalam film industry and has been busy till 2011.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled the death and described it as a huge loss."He will probably go down as the person who wrote the maximum lyrics for the film industry. He will be missed," said Vijayan.Every major musician and singer in the state has used his lyrics; besides he has worked with the biggest hit makers in the Malayalam film industry of yesteryears.The last rites would be conducted here later on Tuesday.

Low population is a serious issue and hurdle for small communities or tribes like Mizos to survive and progress," Royte said.Mizoram is home to various Mizo tribes.He said that some churches and influential civil society organisations like the Young Mizo Association are advocating a baby boom policy to encourage population growth for ensuring optimum size vis-a-vis the area of the state.Mizoram's population was 1,091,014, according to the 2011 census. The state covers an area of approximately 21,087 square kilometres.With only 52 per sons per square kilometre, Mizoram has the second lowest population density in the country next to Arunachal Pradesh, which has a population density of 17 persons per sq km. The national average is 382 per sq km.Mizoram's neighbour Assam, however, is treading a different path.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma recently announced that his government will gradually implement a two- child policy for availing benefits under certain schemes funded by the state.In 2019, the state administration decided that those with more than two children would not be eligible for government jobs from January 2021. Assam currently has a two-child norm along with other requirements for contesting in panchayat polls.On Sunday, Uttar Pradesh Law Commission Chairman Aditya Nath Mittal said that there should be a check on the increasing population as it is creating problems in the state.However, the Population Foundation of India (PFI), an NGO, has said that India should learn from China's revision of its two-child policy claiming the move shows that empowering women and enhancing their capabilities work better than coercive population policies.In December last year, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare told the Supreme Court that the family welfare programme in India is voluntary in nature.

22-06-2021||New York||India to share latest US vaccine allocations through COVAX||India will get a share of the 16 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccines that US President Joe Biden is earmarking for Asia in the latest donations to COVAX, the international outfit for jab distribution to developing countries, according to the White House.The White House did not say exactly how many will go to India when it made the announcement on Monday about the latest donation of 55 million vaccine doses.While the announcement of the 55 million doses completes Biden administration's pledge to allocate 80 million doses by the end of this month, it is struggling to get the vaccines to the countries receiving them because of regulatory and logistical problems, the President's spokesperson Jen Psaki has acknowledged."What we found to be the biggest challenge is not actually the supply, we have plenty of doses to share with the world, but this is a herculean logistical challenge. And we've seen that as we've begun to implement," she told reporters on Monday.Psaki said that among the issues were sharing safety and regulatory information and ensuring proper temperature control for the vaccines.India has not yet approved the three main vaccines in use in the US -- Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.Pfizer and Moderna have to be kept at extremely cold temperatures before readying for distribution.The vaccines coming to India in the tranche announced on Monday would be on top of the two sets of donations announced for it on June 3.Vice President Kamala Harris had told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India would get a share of the six million doses that Biden was releasing directly to New Delhi and other countries facing a Covid surge.In addition to that, India was also allocated a share of the seven million doses to be distributed in Asia through the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization and two other groups to promote the availability of vaccines and other Covid-fighting material.Those were a part of a distribution of a total of 25 million doses announced at that time.Other South Asian countries are also sharing in the US vaccine largesse.Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives and Bhutan are among the 18 Asian countries that will share the 16 million doses allocated through COVAX in the Monday announcement.Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan will, in addition, get a share of another 14 million being sent directly to several countries based on "regional priorities" to help deal with surges, according to the White House.COVAX will be getting a total of 41 million doses with 14 million earmarked for Latin America and the Caribbean and 10 million for Africa.In the allocations through the COVAX announced on June 3, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Maldives also shared in the seven million earmarked for Asia.Biden also announced earlier this month that the US will be buying 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine for distribution around the world and got a pledge from the G7 group of Western industrialised powers to donate one billion vaccine doses to developing nations.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-share-latest-us-vaccine-allocations-through-covax-272352

He has been declared a fugitive by India.Headley, 60, was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack. Rana has opposed his extradition to India, arguing that he has already been convicted by a US court in Chicago.The United States government asserts that the premise of Rana's argument is incorrect because the Indian substantive charges are not considered lesser included offences of their conspiracy charges.As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated this extradition proceeding. The US government has argued that Rana meets all the criteria warranting certification of his extradition to India.

22-06-2021||New Delhi||Parents, students flag concerns over Class XII evaluation plan||As some students and parents’ bodies questioned the decision to cancel the Class XII examinations and the evaluation formulae to declare results of students, the Supreme Court on Monday asked the CBSE and the ICSE to respond to their pleas, saying it’s important to have finality in the matter.Board results: What petitioners contend“For students… they need to have some ray of hope, not uncertainty,” said a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar, which had on June 17 given in principle approval to evaluation formulae of the two boards for declaration of results by July 31. However, it said, “The decision for cancellation of examination has been taken at the highest level and we have in-principle accepted it.”Asking the CBSE and the ICSE to file their replies to the petitions, the top court posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday at 2 pm after Attorney General KK Venugopal agreed to it.On behalf of UP Parents’ Association that demanded physical examinations for Class XII, senior advocate Vikas Singh assailed the different sets of criteria adopted for evaluation of students by the CBSE and the ICSE, saying there should be uniformity in the criteria of both boards.Marking should be based on the performance of the current batch and not on any previous batch and the option to improvise the results must be given at the outset before the declaration of results, Singh said even as he reiterated his demand for physical examinations in view of improvement in Covid situation.“Such irrational policy of linking the performance of the present batch of students with that of former students can’t be legally sustained under any circumstances. The present batch of students can’t be penalised for the past performances of ex-students,” he contended.“How is the board exam a threat but not IIT-JEE or CLAT?” asked some of the petitioners. Advocate Abhishek Choudhary pointed out that even if a compartment student performed well in CLAT, he couldn’t get admission as his/her board examination was to be held later in physical form.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parents-students-flag-concerns-over-class-xii-evaluation-plan-272023

PTI“We do not find any case made out for recalling, modification or stay of order passed by this court on June 18,” the court said in its order today. The way the state was proceeding in the matter, which required immediate action, did not inspire confidence,” the court further said in the order.The Bengal Government had sought recall of the June 18 order on the ground that it was not heard and adequate opportunity was not given to place all facts on record, including the steps taken by the state government to address the issues related to post-poll violence.The High Court had on June 18 noted that while the state government has been denying instances of post-poll violence from the very beginning, the petitions filed by certain affected parties and a report submitted by the State Legal Services Secretary in this regard painted a different picture.The court then directed the NHRC to constitute a committee to examine the complaints. The committee shall examine all cases by visiting the areas and report to the court about steps to be taken to reinstate the confidence of the people.The order was passed on a bunch of petitions alleging that many people from opposition were subject to violence after the TMC won the elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/high-court-rejects-plea-to-call-off-nhrc-probe-into-west-bengal-post-poll-violence-272074

Seven other BJP leaders from the region, too, followed in Sharma’s footsteps and joined the Banerjee camp. PTIHe said the proposed state could consist of Birbhum, Burdwan, Asansol, East and West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram. It would be one of those small states like Mizoram or Manipur with a 60-member Assembly, Khan said.He added if Prime Minister Narendra Modi could be called an “outsider” by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee despite him being an Indian, the latter also was no less an outsider for someone living in Jangalmahal.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh termed Khan’s statement as an “irresponsible gameplan” by the saffron party. He alleged that the BJP was trying to create trouble as it could not come to terms with electoral defeat handed out to it by Mamata Banerjee-led TMC.The separate state demand raised by two BJP MPs in quick succession has put state BJP president Dilip Ghosh, also a member of the Lok Sabha, in an embarrassing situation. His political opponents have stared questioning his control over the party’s state unit.Ghosh on Monday said Khan demanded a separate state as he was extremely frustrated with the present law and order situation in West Bengal. The BJP had no plans to break up the state, Ghosh asserted.WBPCC president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, however, said the two BJP MPs would not have spoken out without approval from the party’s top leadership. “The BJP is a regimented party. I am not ready to believe that the party’s Central leaders were unaware of what these two MPs were saying,” Chowdhury, who is also Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/irresponsible-gameplan-tmc-junks-demand-for-bifurcation-272089

India does not figure among the priority countries named by the EU which are Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-eu-naval-exercise-to-set-stage-for-greater-cooperation-272098
22-06-2021||New Delhi||Twitter withholds 50 tweets related to alleged assault of Muslim man in Ghaziabad||Twitter has "withheld" 50 tweets related to a communally sensitive video clip of an elderly Muslim man in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh on the microblogging platform, according to sources.According to Lumen database, Twitter received a legal request from the Indian government on June 17 for actioning 50 tweets. These tweets have been withheld and the content could not be independently verified.Upon clicking on the blocked URLs listed on Lumen database, a message saying the tweet has been “withheld in India in response to a legal demand” is displayed.UP assault case: Bombay HC grants transit anticipatory bail to journalist Rana AyyubAccording to sources, these tweets contained content related to the said video clip. When contacted, a Twitter spokesperson said: “As explained in our Country Withheld Policy, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in response to a valid legal demand or when the content has been found to violate local law(s)”. The spokesperson noted that the withholdings are limited to the specific jurisdiction/country where the content is determined to be illegal. The account holder is notified directly - by sending a message to the e-mail address associated with the account(s), if available - so that the user is aware that Twitter has received a legal order pertaining to the account. “The legal requests that we receive are detailed in the biannual Twitter Transparency Report, and requests to withhold content are published on Lumen,” the spokesperson added.Requests received by Twitter for withholding content are published on Lumen database—an independent research project studying 'cease and desist' letters concerning online content.The Ghaziabad police have booked Twitter and six people for circulating a video that claimed to have the elderly Muslim man saying he was allegedly thrashed and asked to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. Police say this was done to create communal unrest.The Ghaziabad police have sent a notice to Twitter India Managing Director Manish Maheshwari, asking him to join a probe in connection with the case.Twitter has drawn flak for failure to fully comply with the new IT rules, which mandates among other requirements, the appointment of three key personnel - chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance officer by social media platforms with over 50 lakh users. All the three personnel have to be resident in India. While the rules came into effect on May 26, Twitter is yet to adhere to the social media guidelines, despite repeated reminders from the government. The government, last week, had slammed Twitter for deliberate defiance and failure to comply with the IT rules, which has led to the US giant losing its intermediary status in India and becoming liable for users posting any unlawful content. Twitter and the government have been at loggerheads over multiple instances in the past months, including during the farmers' protest and later when the microblogging platform tagged political posts of several leaders of the ruling party BJP as "manipulated media", triggering a sharp rebuke from the Centre.Twitter has an estimated 1.75 crore users in India, as per data cited by the government recently.Earlier this month, Twitter had blocked accounts of Punjabi rapper JazzyB, Sydney-based hip-hop artist L-Fresh the Lion and two others following demands by the Indian government.Earlier this year, more than 500 accounts were suspended and access to hundreds of others in India blocked after the government ordered the microblogging platform to restrain the spread of misinformation and inflammatory content related to farmers' protests. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-withholds-50-tweets-related-to-alleged-assault-of-muslim-man-in-ghaziabad-271938

22-06-2021||New Delhi||SC tells CBSE, ICSE to respond by tomorrow as parents, students flag concerns over Class 12 evaluation formula||The Supreme Court on Monday asked CBSE and ICSE to respond by Tuesday to the concerns raised by some students and parents on the schemes of both the boards formulated to evaluate Class XII students, whose examination was cancelled due to the Covid pandemic.A parents' association and students flagged several concerns with regard to the CBSE and ICSE schemes for evaluation for Class 12 results and said that many clauses are arbitrary and would be detrimental to future prospects of the students.A special bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said that it would hear the response of counsel for CBSE and ICSE on Tuesday on the concerns raised by interveners.The bench also directed registry to list all pending petitions in the matter on Tuesday, June 22, in which they have challenged the decision of CBSE to cancel Class 12 examination and raised concerns on the evaluation schemes of both the boards.At the outset, senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for intervener UP Parents Association, Lucknow, said the option to students for external examination as given in the CBSE's scheme would be "a premium" for those students who could not do well in internal assessment.Singh said, “This option should be given at the very initial stage to both student and school to opt for either external examination or internal assessment. If any school or student does not want to opt for this internal assessment then a date may be fixed for external examination in mid of July or any date found conducive for holding of examination.”The bench said that there should be some ray of hope for the students and there should not be any confusion.“The decision for cancellation of examination has been taken at highest level and we have in-principle accepted it,” the bench said. Singh said there are several concerns with regard to the evaluation scheme of the students which are increasing uncertainty and no one knows what exactly would happen.He said that it has been provided in the CBSE scheme that marks obtained by a student in any subject in internal assessment (based upon marks obtained in class X (30 per cent), class XI (30 per cent) and class XII pre-board examination (40 per cent)) shall not exceed the best marks obtained by ex-students in the said schools in the specific reference year (best year subject-wise amongst past three class 12 board exams) by more than 2 marks.Singh said that there may be a case where due to past poor performance of students in a particular subject, the school hires a good teacher and the students performed well in their internal examination but they are likely to suffer due to poor performance by the ex-students.“The present batch of students (or for that reason any student) may suffer because the marks obtained by ex-students in the reference year is lower than what present batch of students have obtained in any subject,” he said, adding that maximum the student would be given is the grace of two marks.Singh said, “Such irrational policy of linking the present batch of students with that of past performance of ex-students cannot be legally sustained under any circumstances. The present batch of students cannot be penalised for the past performances of ex-students.”He said that there should be uniformity in evaluation scheme as English has been made mandatory for calculating average marks in CISCE scheme, while in CBSE there is no such requirement and best of three marks are taken.“The policy of internal assessment should be uniform for both central boards. There is practically no scheme of internal assessment envisaged by ICSE. There are only a few letters to that effect. There are various variables which are not defined namely weightage for board exams is not defined anywhere. There is no clarification and teachers are in utter confusion,” he said.The senior lawyer said he had discussion with a maths teacher about the evaluation formula suggested by the board to which he had said that it is very complicated.The bench said that what kind of maths teacher he is if he don't understand the formula and added that the court is not going by the perception of individuals and looking at the institutional response.Advocate Abhishek Choudhury, appearing for private students and those with second compartment, said the CBSE has said that they will be facing difficulties in admission to higher institutes as CBSE class exam 12 will be held when the situation is conducive, may be in July or August.The bench said it might direct that admissions will be subject to the outcome of the board exam results but asked him to argue the points on Tuesday.The bench listed the matter for further hearing on Tuesday at 2 pm.On June 17, the top court had said that there is no question of reversing earlier decision to cancel Class 12 board exams, and had approved the assessment schemes of the CISCE and the CBSE, which has adopted 30:30:40 formula for evaluation of marks for students based on results of class 10, 11 and 12 respectively.The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) said however that it would consider the performance of students for last six years, unlike CBSE which is taking note of performance in class 10, 11 and 12 exams, in finalising the final board results.Both the boards had said they would declare the class 12 results on or before July 31.

22-06-2021||Aditi Tandon||Congress seeks restoration of status quo ante in Jammu and Kashmir||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 21Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s June 24 J-K outreach the Congress has demanded repeal of JK Reorganisation Act, 2019, and restoration of status quo ante in the erstwhile state.Status quo ante—return to the pre-August 5, 2019 position—is also what the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration has been seeking.This means restoration of special status and full statehood.Congress veteran and CWC member P Chidambaram on Monday said, “Congress Party’s position that full statehood must be restored to J&K should clear any doubt or ambiguity. What was made under the Constitution cannot be unmade by an Act of Parliament misinterpreting and misusing the provisions of the Constitution.”He said the dismembering of J&K has been challenged in the Supreme Court and the cases are pending for nearly two years.“In the Monsoon session, Parliament should repeal the offending laws and restore the status quo ante in J&K. That is the only way to draw the starting line for a political resolution of the Kashmir issue. J&K was a ‘state’ that signed an Instrument of Accession and acceded to India. It must enjoy that status forever. J&K is not a piece of ‘real estate’.  J&K is ‘people’. Their rights and wishes must be respected,” Chidambaram added.The National Conference has challenged the JK Reorganisation Act in the Supreme Court and the matter is pending.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-seeks-restoration-of-status-quo-ante-in-jammu-and-kashmir-271839
