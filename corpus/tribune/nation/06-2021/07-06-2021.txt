07-06-2021||New Delhi||Doctors move SC for postponement of INI CET exam 2021||A group of doctors moved the Supreme Court demanding postponement of the INI CET examination, 2021 – meant for admissions to higher medical studies—scheduled to be conducted by All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) on June 16.The petitioners submitted that the holding of the examination on June 16 went against the assurance regarding postponement of PG examinations given by the PMO while postponing the NEET PG examination, 2021 by four months.The students were assured that they will be given at least one month to prepare for the examination and holding the examination during the pandemic would increase pressure on graduate doctors. They also cited how Class 12 examinations were cancelled.“Conducting of this examination is resulting in endangering the life of thousands of doctors who are frontline workers in different hospitals which is a clear negation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” they contended.Highlighting the fact that only 19-day prior notice was given, they submitted that examination centres were in different states or far from the candidates’ place of working requiring them to travel during restrictions due to Covid-19 lockdown.They said many of the doctors were not fully vaccinated and had not even received the first jab of Covid-19 vaccine.“In the prevailing circumstances due to Covid-19, the conducting of this examination is resulting in building up pressure on the graduate doctors from across India to sit for the examination on 16th June, 2021, when under the present circumstances the Board examinations and other professional examinations have been either cancelled or postponed,” the petitioners submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctors-move-sc-for-postponement-of-ini-cet-exam-2021-264940
07-06-2021||New Delhi||Around 35,000 students take DU’s online open-book exams||Nearly 35,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students took the online open-book exams of the Delhi University (DU) on Monday and no technical glitches were reported, officials said.Monday was the first day of the exams and the officials said all the 35,000 students uploaded their answersheets using the portal and there were no email submissions.DS Rawat, Dean (Examinations), said the process went off smoothly and there were no complaints of any technical glitches.Last year, when the OBE was held for the first time, students had complained about failure to submit answersheets, problems in downloading question papers and other issues.Some had also said they were grappling with Covid-19 in the family and would not be in the right frame of mind to appear for the exams, but Rawat said most of the students wanted to finish their academics.Arpita, a third-year BA student, said, “The process went off smoothly. One of our classmates encountered issues while uploading the answersheets but in the end, he was also able to upload those.”Shashwat Verma, who took the exam from his hometown in Kanpur, said, “OBE is a time-taking process. The question paper takes a couple of minutes to download and after finishing the exam, clicking the photos of each page, converting those into the PDF format and uploading takes time. The internet speed also poses issues. But whatever said, the OBE was smoother this time as compared to the last time.”Ramhari Chowdhury, a student of Motilal Nehru College, took the exam from his hometown in Mathura.“The process was smoother than the last time and I could complete the paper in time,” he said.The exams were postponed twice.The exams were scheduled to start from May 15 but were deferred to June 1 owing to a spike in the number of coronavirus cases across the country.Later, the university released a new notification, saying the final semester or the annual exams will commence from June 7, instead of June 1.

07-06-2021||New Delhi||CMs, BJP welcome PM’s free Covid vaccine initiative; Opposition claims policy reversed due to fear of SC action||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on Monday that his government would provide Covid-19 vaccines free of charge to all above the age of 18 years was welcomed by the chief ministers of various states and the BJP, even as opposition parties claimed that the Centre withdrew the “faulty” vaccine policy to save its face before the Supreme Court.“Whenever there is any crisis in the country, our Prime Minister Modi ji has always led the country from the front,” BJP president J P Nadda said, joining other senior leaders of the ruling party in hailing the move which they said has infused new strength in the fight against the pandemic.GOI reverts to centralised procurement of vaccines on states’ demandCongress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, claimed the Centre had taken the step after being reprimanded by the Supreme Court which had questioned its “botched” vaccine policy, and demanded that the prime minister apologise.“Better late than never, but never late is better Modi ji,” the party said on its Twitter handle and noted that the Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi have been pressing the Centre for free universal vaccination in the country.The party opposed keeping 25 per cent vaccines for the private sector for which they will charge people.“One simple question - If vaccines are free for all, why should private hospitals charge for them,” Gandhi tweeted using the hashtag “#FreeVaccineForAll”.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh (Congress), Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik (BJD), Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin (DMK), Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan (CPI-M) and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar (JD-U) were among the state leaders who appreciated that the Centre had approved their request for free vaccine supply.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, a vocal critic of Prime Minister Modi, said he has finally “listened to us” after four months, but the delayed decision has “cost many lives”.“The well-being of the people of India should’ve been prioritised since the very start of this pandemic. Unfortunately, this delayed decision by PM has already cost many lives. Hoping for a better managed #VaccinationDrive this time that focuses on people & not propaganda!,” the Trinamool Congress chief tweeted.Amarinder Singh said the move will help Punjab and other states facing problems in sourcing vaccines to ensure early vaccination of their people.It’ll also bring much-needed pricing parity - a necessity in pandemic times, he said.“Every life is precious. No one is safe until everyone is vaccinated. As a nation, we stand united in this fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Thank PM Shri Narendra Modi ji for making vaccination a national mission,” Patnaik said.Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said the Centre’s decisions are commendable and will help in winning the battle against the coronavirus pandemic.“The Hon. Prime Minister’s declaration that the Covid-19 vaccine will be supplied free of cost to the States from 21 June, is the most appropriate response at this hour. I am happy that our request has been positively responded to by the Prime Minister,” Vijayan, who is also a CPI (M) politburo member, said                The Left party, however, alleged that the prime minister had tried to “defend his dubious discriminatory vaccine policy by passing the buck on to state governments”.“Now Modi abandons his policy, fearing a Supreme Court directive for a free and universal vaccination programme by the Centre.“The Modi government must now sincerely implement the free and universal vaccination campaign and not look for excuses. There is a lot to be done. Many lives to be saved,” CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted.Stalin welcomed the decision of the Centre to procure “75 per cent of the vaccines produced in the country” and provide them free to the states.“I also appreciate the Prime Minister for reversing his government’s previous position,” he said.“I am glad that looking at public sentiments, the PM had to reverse his earlier decision,” Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said.AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the Modi government had taken the decision after the Supreme Court’s intervention and alleged that the states could not buy vaccine doses directly due to the Centre’s policies.“We express our gratitude to the Hon’ble Supreme Court that after its intervention, free vaccines will be available to all age groups across the country. If the central government wanted, it could have done this long ago, but due to the policies of the Centre, neither the states were able to buy the vaccines nor the central government was giving it,” Sisodia tweeted.On June 2, the Supreme Court questioned the Centre’s policy of paid vaccination for the 18-44 age group, saying it is “prima facie, arbitrary and irrational”.The top court had pointed out the changing nature of the Covid-19 pandemic and asked the Centre to review its vaccination policy.AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said private hospitals will continue to have a 25 per cent quota so that rich have a “VIP queue” while the poor will have to wait for vaccine availability.“Reversal of vax policy seems to be the result of SC’s order.  Although blame of terrible vaccine policy has been put on states, it’s Modi who failed to ensure vax supply (sic),” Owaisi tweeted. However, BJP leaders were all praise after the prime minister’s announcement.“States were given the freedom to buy vaccines for those in the age group of 18-44 years. But many states were finding it difficult to do so. We are grateful that the prime minister has resolved this issue,” Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said.Union Minister Smriti Irani said that this shows the sensitivity and commitment of this government. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cms-bjp-welcome-pms-free-covid-vaccine-initiative-opposition-claims-policy-reversed-due-to-fear-of-sc-action-264938

All the other states have understood it properly and have uploaded the information, how is it that only West Bengal doesn't understand the order. Don't take refuge under confusion. All other States have provided it, there is confusion only for West Bengal?" the Bench told West Bengal Government counsel.On behalf of NCPCR, Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj said the commission was facing difficulties with West Bengal and Delhi which were not uploading the data of such children on ‘Bal Swaraj' portal.The top court also asked the Delhi Government to upload the updated information on the NCPCR's website.The Supreme Court had on Tuesday asked the Centre to provide details of schemes announced for children who lost their parents to the COCID19 along with monitoring mechanisms.The Centre had last month announced that PM CARES will contribute through a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each child when he or she reaches 18 years of age.The top court—which had earlier taken up suo motu cognizance of the spread of Covid-19 in children homes—is hearing an application filed by amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal seeking identification of orphaned children due to Covid-19 or otherwise and providing them immediate relief.The NCPCR had earlier told the court that data of 9,346 affected children have been uploaded on Bal Swaraj portal. This includes 1,742 children who lost both parents, 7,464 now in a single-parent household, 140 have been abandoned between March 2020 and May 29, 202||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-gives-more-time-to-centre-to-work-out-modalities-to-implement-pm-cares-for-children-264927

The people who took to protest came under the banner of "save Lakshadweep forum" and posted pictures of protest in social media.Opposition parties in Lakshadweep and in Kerala have alleged that Patel unilaterally lifted restrictions on the use of alcohol in the Muslim-majority islands, banned beef products, citing Animal Preservation and demolished fishermen's sheds built on the coastal areas, saying they violated the Coast Guard Act.The BJP has however defended Patel, claiming that the protests were a result of his efforts to end "corrupt practices" involving local politicians and usher in development there.In Kochi, United Democratic Front parliamentarians from Kerala staged a protest in front of the Lakshadweep Administrator's Office in solidarity with the protestors, demanding withdrawal of the proposed "anti-people laws" by the union government."The islanders held a peaceful protest today. Almost all the establishments, shops and commercial establishments were closed today.Almost everyone in the island took part in the protest," Hamdullah Sayeed, former Lakshadweep IUML MP, told PTI.He said Lakshadweep is closely associated with Kerala in every aspect and the administrator was trying to "separate the islands" from the state.IUML MP E T Mohammed Basheer, who inaugurated the protest, termed as "undemocratic" the actions of the administrator and demanded withdrawal of regulations and executive orders passed after May 12.AIYF, the youth wing of the CPI, a major ally in the LDF government in Kerala, also protested in front of the Administrator's office.All MPs from Kerala, except Rahul Gandhi, K Muraleedharan, K Sudhakaran, Kodikunnil Suresh, Sashi Tharoor, Adoor Prakash and N K Premachandran, took part in the protest.The Lakshadweep people are demanding repeal of the proposed LDAR, the Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (PASA or Goondas Act) and the Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation (LAPR).Social media was flooded with #SaveLakshadweep with islanders posting pictures of their protests.Thousands of others also trended the hashtag.Expressing solidarity with the people of Lakshadweep, the Kerala Legislative Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution, demanding the recall of Patel and requesting the Centre's immediate intervention "to protect the lives and livelihood of the islanders."An archipelago in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep has been witnessing protests by locals over the recent actions and administrative reforms being implemented by Patel. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/underwater-protest-fast-by-lakshadweep-people-demanding-administrators-recall-264911

07-06-2021||Lucknow||BJP government in UP spent 4 years hiding behind rhetoric, lies: Akhilesh||The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh has spent four years of its tenure hiding behind rhetoric and lies but now the people are counting days as they have decided to remove the party from power, Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav claimed Monday.Referring to the rise in crimes in the state and the government’s alleged failure to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, Yadav said: “The double-engine government of the BJP is no longer in a condition to start since it has been standing at the yard and has rusted away. It should now be sent to the sickline of the Railways”.        The “double-engine government” is a reference to BJP’s pitch that the state will progress more if the same party is in power in it and at the Centre.The SP chief further claimed that central observers of the BJP camping in the state capital recently accepted that there was no use spending too much energy as this government has to go.Amid speculations over a possible cabinet expansion and a change in the BJP’s organisational setup in the state, the party’s general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and vice-president and in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Radha Mohan Singh held separate meetings with senior leaders and ministers in the Adityanath government in Lucknow last week.On Sunday, Singh met Governor Anandiben Patel and Speaker of the Assembly Hriday Narain Dikshit.The BJP vice-president, however, dismissed all speculations of any change in the party organisation and the government while talking to news persons later.Yadav, a former chief minister, alleged that the BJP was using new propaganda and tactics to divert attention, and said the entire system has failed in the face of increasing organised crime and criminals protected by those in power.Unscrupulous criminals continue to commit crimes fearlessly in Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s home district Gorakhpur, the SP chief said in a statement.He also claimed that 11 houses near the Gorakhnath temple are being vacated forcefully, and asked how a chief minister will handle a state if his own district is out of his hands.The BJP government was in a helpless condition during the coronavirus epidemic, and patients continued to die in agony due to lack of treatment and medicines, the SP leader added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-government-in-up-spent-4-years-hiding-behind-rhetoric-lies-akhilesh-264909
07-06-2021||Hyderabad||Old parents allegedly starved to death in Hyderabad||In a shocking incident that has come to light, the Telangana Police have arrested a man and his wife on charges of starving his parents to death.The incident took place in Suryapet, where the old parents, identified as Nallu Ramachandra Reddy (90) and his wife Anasuyamma (80) were made to live under a makeshift tarpaulin tent erected on the premises of their house. Both elderly husband and wife died on the same day on May 27, and their son performed their final rites.The police suspected the hand of their son Nallu Nageshwar Reddy and his wife Lakshmi.The police have taken them into custody for interrogation and meanwhile also exhumed the bodies for post-mortem findings. Since there were rumours that Nageshwar Reddy was not taking care of his parents in old age and that they were not given food or drinking water, the police got suspicious.Sub-Inspector Praveen who visited the spot told media that the old couple was forced to live under a tarpaulin tent on the house premises.  A case under Section 304-II of the IPC has been registered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/old-parents-allegedly-starved-to-death%C2%A0in-hyderabad-264907
07-06-2021|| Hyderabad||Andhra extends lockdown with minor relaxations||The Andhra Pradesh Government has further extended the COVID curfew across the State till June 20. However, keeping in view the drop in cases, the State has extended people's movement by an additional two hours. The decision was announced after a meeting by Chief Minister YSR Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday. The state will be under a complete lockdown from 2 pm to 6 am the following day from June 10, the date till which the Covid curfew was first imposed on May 5. The chief minister has announced that all government offices would function from 8 am to 2 pm daily till June 20. The positivity rate of coronavirus fell from a high of 25 per cent in mid-May to about 10 percent now. Consequently, the rush in hospitals has also reduced, and there is a large availability of beds, both general and ICU.   Andhra Pradesh Government has imposed a curfew for the fourth time to control the spread of the Covid pandemic. Following a steady rise in Covid cases, Andhra Pradesh had initially announced a 2-week partial curfew from May 5. Subsequently, the partial curfew was extended till May 31 and, after that, till June 10.  The State clarified that Section 144 CrPC would remain in force during these 8 hours of relaxation. Anyone involved in a group activity or gathering at one spot would be booked under the Disaster Management Act.  Interestingly, while chief minister Reddy is busy taking stock of the COVID-19 situation in Andhra Pradesh, his sister Y.S. Sharmila has announced his decision to launch a new political party in Telangana next month. To be named 'YSR Telangana Party' after their father, Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, who was chief minister of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, the new party will come into being on July 8, her father's birth anniversary.  She and her comrades have already started registering the Party coordinator Vaduka Rajagopal said on Monday that the process for writing the new party with the Election Commission of India (ECI) had been completed.   Sharmila said she was launching the party to question those in power and fulfill the Telangana movement's aspirations and for the self-respect of Telangana. Since March, Sharmila has been holding political meetings with her father’s loyalists from various districts in Telangana to take their feedback before announcing her political plans.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-extends-lockdown-with-minor-relaxations-264898
07-06-2021||New Delhi||UDID card included in list of documents required for Covid vaccination: Govt||To further facilitate access to vaccination for persons with disability, the government has decided to include the UDID card in the list of prescribed photo ID documents for Covid vaccination and the necessary provisions for the same are being made and would be available on CoWIN shortly, the Health Ministry said on Monday.The ministry has advised the states and Union territories to widely publicise the use of the UDID card as a permissible photo ID for accessing Covid vaccination.The Centre has been supporting the efforts of the states under the “whole of government” approach for ensuring a smooth and effective vaccination drive since January 16.It has developed the CoWIN digital platform to streamline the process of vaccination for various categories of beneficiaries across the country.CoWIN provides the technological backbone to effectively roll out and scale up the mechanism for the Covid vaccine distribution system, the ministry said in a statement.It has been the Centre’s constant endeavour to streamline the vaccination process for its universalisation.In this backdrop, the Health Ministry wrote to the states on Monday to include the Unique Disability Identification (UDID) card as a photo ID while registering on Co-WIN 2.0.According to the guidance note for Co-WIN 2.0 issued on March 2, seven photo IDs were specified and prescribed for the verification of beneficiaries prior to their vaccination.In the letter to the states and Union territories, the Health Ministry has said the UDID card, issued to persons with disability by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, has all the necessary features such as the name, year of birth, gender and photograph of the person, and meets the criteria for use of identification in Covid-19 vaccination.“Therefore, with a view to further facilitate access to vaccination for persons with disability, it has been decided to include the UDID in the list of prescribed photo ID documents for Covid-19 vaccination. The necessary provisions for the same are being made and would be available in Co-WIN shortly,” the ministry said.

The electrolyte of the film is alkaline in nature and capable of providing better wear and corrosion resistance compared to the existing process. High-strength aluminum alloys are extensively used in aerospace, textile, and automotive applications because of their low density and high specific strength. Aerospace components made out of aluminum alloys include landing gear, the main structural part of the wing, fuselage, aircraft skins and pressure cabins. These parts need resistance against wear and corrosion damages in addition to enhanced fatigue life. The widely used technique for aluminum alloys to improve corrosion resistance at present is called hard anodizing. It involves sulphuric and oxalic-based electrolytes which emit not only toxic fumes but are also hazardous to handle during processing.To cater to the aerospace segment, extensive research has been carried out at ARCI, and the high-cycle fatigue life of aerospace Al alloys under plain and simultaneous corrosion environments could be significantly improved.In order to cater to the growing demand for cleaner industrial processes, MAO was developed at the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI), a research and development center under the Department of Science and Technology.MAO is a high-voltage driven anodic-oxidation process which uses an electrochemical method to produce an oxide film on a metallic substrates. ARCI team has further designed and developed a duplex treatment of ‘shot peening’, a process used to modify the mechanical properties of metals and alloys, followed by coating deposition.“Systematic investigations conducted at ARCI have shown that the duplex treatment has led to the remarkable enhancement in aerospace aluminum alloys' fatigue life while retaining the outstanding corrosion and wear resistance of MAO coating,” according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology, today.“The efficacy of duplex treatment has been validated for different aluminum alloys and extended to impart superior corrosion fatigue life. This work has been recently published in the International Journal of Fatigue,” the statement added.The MAO process developed at ARCI has been patented in India and abroad and the technology is ready for transfer to the industry for commercial production. The process with necessary modifications can be used for wear, corrosion, thermal, and fatigue and corrosion-fatigue life enhancement of a variety of components made out of aluminum, magnesium, titanium and zirconium.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-eco-friendly-process-enhances-fatigue-life-of-aluminium-alloy-used-in-aerospace-components-264895

07-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre mulling to allow domestic air travel without Covid-negative report post vaccination||The Centre is considering a mechanism to allow air passengers who have got both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to travel within the country without a negative test report, senior government officials said on Monday.Central ministries, including the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, are currently discussing the matter with various other stakeholders, they added.Currently, a number of states, including Odisha, Meghalaya and Maharashtra, ask passengers coming from outside to carry a Covid-negative report with them wherein the test sample was taken not more than 72 hours before the journey.Domestic airlines, which have already taken a major hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic, have told the civil aviation ministry that such state-level requirements are hampering the growth of air travel and the fully-vaccinated passengers should be allowed to travel without Covid-negative reports, the officials said.Domestic air travel had reached around three lakh passengers per day by the end of February. However, the second wave of the pandemic has reduced it to around 85,000 passengers per day.To conserve cash and survive this tough time, all Indian airlines have taken measures such as cutting the employees' salaries, firing employees and renegotiating leases with aircraft lessors.Since health is a state subject, the Centre is discussing with the states a way through which domestic air passengers, who have got both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, can be allowed to travel without the test reports, the officials said.The Centre is also in talks with other aviation stakeholders such as airlines, airports etc. on how it can be done, they added.While the government is considering allowing domestic air travel without Covid test reports for those who have got both doses of the vaccine, it has opposed a similar measure for international travel.At a G7 meeting of health ministers on June 4, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan expressed India's "concern and strong opposition" to allow vaccine passports for international travel at this juncture of the pandemic."With vaccine coverage as a percentage of population in developing countries still low compared to developed countries, such an initiative could prove to be highly discriminatory," he said.Meanwhile, on May 28, the airlines were asked by the Centre to operate only 50 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights from June 1, instead of 80 per cent permitted earlier.The decision was taken "in view of the sudden surge in the number of active Covid-19 cases across the country, decrease in passenger traffic and passenger load factor (occupancy rate)", the civil aviation ministry said in an order.When the government resumed the scheduled domestic flight operations in the country on May 25 last year after a two-month break, the ministry had permitted the carriers to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic services.This cap was gradually increased to 80 per cent by December last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-mulling-to-allow-domestic-air-travel-without-covid-negative-report-post-vaccination-264885

And importantly, they must shift the project from the only playground available in Namchi,” he said.Recently Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Golay during a visit to South and West Sikkim districts has said he has already released Rs 80 crore for the project.“First of all, this hospital is being built on the only playground available in Namchi at the moment. It would have been better if it had been shifted to Karfectar near Jorethang, where the government has sold land for a cancer hospital. This location suits people from both South and West Sikkim,” the ‘Sikkimese Sniper’ said.Bhutia said the need of the hour should be to procure vaccines instead of investing in a new project.With Rs 80 crore already sanctioned the priority should have been procuring vaccines for people of Sikkim which is the need of the hour, Bhutia, who founded the party in 2019, said.During this pandemic, the government should have focused on upgrading all existing hospitals and PHCs with the right infrastructure, equipment and trained manpower to fight Covid on a war footing instead of building a new hospital, he said.“The focus right now must be on manpower and upgradation of existing hospitals including PHCs. Remember we all fought for good parivartan and the people voted for parivartan but what is actually taking place in Sikkim has completely been disappointing so far.“Percentages and commissions can wait but peoples’ lives and livelihoods are at stake here so let us hope the government gets its priorities right,” he added.Bhutia had made his political foray with Trinamool Congress and contested elections for the party in 2014 and 2016 before setting up his own party.

We have to be very careful. The economic activity can resume after we see that Covid-19 cases across India are coming under control," he said.Lobo suggested tourism be opened in a phased manner prioritising those activities which won't trigger transmission of coronavirus."When we reopen hotels guests should be asked to carry a Covid-19 negative certificate and they should abide by all the protocols," he added.Lobo said the pandemic situation in Goa is improving but Covid-19 fatalities will continue to show up in daily charts as many people are currently on ventilators.As of Sunday, Goa's coronavirus caseload stood at 1,59,393 while the death toll stood at 2,760, a health official had said.The Goa government had last week extended the ongoing coronavirus-induced 'curfew' till June 14. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goa-nightlife-should-resume-only-after-improvement-in-pandemic-scenario-minister-264872

07-06-2021||New Delhi||SC gives Centre more time to apprise about scheme for children orphaned by COVID||The Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that it needed some more time to apprise the court of the modalities on the recently launched 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme for kids orphaned by COVID-19. The National Commission of Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) said West Bengal and Delhi have not been cooperating and have not provided the latest data on the number of children who have lost their parents due to coronavirus.A bench of Justices L N Rao and Aniruddha Bose was informed by Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, that they are in consultation with states and ministries to work out the modalities of the 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme. “We need some more time to apprise the court about the modalities of the scheme as the consultation is still going on. We have made district magistrates directly responsible for the children who have been abandoned or have been orphaned,” Bhati said. The bench said that it is inclined to give some more time to the Centre to formulate the modalities of the scheme and how they will implement it.Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for NCPCR, told the bench it was facing difficulties with West Bengal and Delhi, who are not uploading the data of such children on ‘Bal Swaraj'.Advocate Chirag Shroff, appearing for the Delhi government, said their data is provided solely by Child Welfare Committees (CWC), while in other states different departments provide data to the district magistrates from where it is uploaded.The Delhi government last week wrote to different departments like revenue and police and sought data from them, he said.The bench said that Delhi should have a task force at the district level like other states and upload the information as soon as they get it and the task force should attend to the immediate needs of the children. “Don't wait for orders of the court and implement all the relevant schemes,” the bench told the counsels of Delhi and the West Bengal government.It told the West Bengal counsel that the court has in its order stated that information regarding children, who have been orphaned after March 2020, is needed.  “All states have understood the directive properly but how can only West Bengal not understand the order,” the bench said, adding that the state has to direct the authorities concerned to provide all the data about the children.Nataraj said by providing the necessary information, there will be continuous monitoring and it would help in protecting the rights of children. The bench said it will issue some directions in its order, which may be uploaded by Tuesday. Senior advocate Gaurav Agrawal, who has been appointed amicus in the matter, told the bench that the identification process of such children has been satisfactory except for Tamil Nadu, where the situation is difficult in terms of COVID.  He said Tamil Nadu is only identifying those who have lost one or both parents due to COVID-19; the approach may not be very helpful in locating all children, who may have been affected due to the virus. The bench said that it understands that the COVID-19 positivity rate is high but there are Child Welfare Committees and Child Protection Units that need to be activated for identification and providing immediate assistance to those children. Advocate Aristotle, appearing for Tamil Nadu, said that the state has come with a scheme under which it is paying Rs 5 lakh to the children, who have lost both their parents and Rs 3 lakh who have lost one parent.The bench asked Aristotle to instruct the officers of the state that each of such children is identified by district officers/child care units and should be reported to Child Welfare Committees within 24 hours as per the Juvenile Justice Act. The top court said that such children need continuous monitoring under which one person may be in charge of 5-6 children.On June 1, the top court had asked the Centre to provide information on the recently launched 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme for kids orphaned by COVID-19, and directed states to appoint nodal officers to apprise it on identification and welfare measures for such children.The NCPCR, in its affidavit, said that as per the data given by states so far, 9,346 children have either lost both or one of their parents to the deadly virus.As many as 1,742 children have lost both of their parents and 7,464 have lost one of the parents, the child rights body had said.  The top court had taken note of Agrawal that Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 29 launched the scheme which aims to provide various reliefs to the children orphaned by the pandemic and he did not have much detail about it.  Under 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme, various steps would be taken including providing a corpus of Rs 10 lakh when the beneficiary child turns 18 years old.  The fixed deposits will be opened in the names of such children, and the PM-CARES fund will contribute through a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each of them, the government had said in a statement earlier.  The top court's direction had come on an application filed by the amicus curiae in the pending suo motu case seeking identification of orphaned children due to COVID-19 or otherwise and providing them immediate relief by the state governments.

07-06-2021||New Delhi||SC orders eviction of 10,000 encroachers from forest land in Faridabad||Holding that land grabbers can't take refuge under rule of law, the Supreme Court on Monday ordered eviction of around 10,000 residential structures illegally constructed in Lakkarpur-Khori village in the Aravali forest area of Faridabad district in Haryana and sought a compliance report from the authorities in six weeks.A Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar ordered the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and the Faridabad Police to evict the illegal occupants of government land in six weeks."Land grabbers can't take refuge under rule of law and talk of fairness," the top court said rejecting a plea filed by five encroachers against the demolition/eviction drive. Maintaining that there was no question of compromise on forest land irrespective of the policy, the Bench, however, said the petitioners’ demand for rehabilitation can be considered independently.The petitioners had challenged the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran Rehabilitation Policy to the extent it limits of the cut-off for rehabilitation to 2003 and sought a stay on demolition of about 10,000 houses at Khori Gaon in Haryana's Faridabad.As senior counsel Colin Gonsalves, representing the petitioners, said those evicted should be accommodated, the Bench shot back, “Who is asking this? Land grabbers! When you come to court you become honest and law abiding and on site, you do not do anything lawful.” It said, "In our opinion the petitioners are bound by the directions given by the Punjab and Haryana High Court and the Supreme Court”. It ordered the local police to give necessary logistical support to enable the corporation to implement its directions to “evict the occupants/encroachers including by forcible eviction from the subject forest land and to clear all the encroachments therefrom.”The Superintendent of Police, Faridabad, shall be personally responsible for ensuring adequate logistical support and police protection to the officials of the corporation, the court said.“We further make it clear that the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation and the Secretary of the forest department shall be personally responsible to oversee the implementation of the directions given in this order and submit their compliance report(s) within six weeks,” it said, posting the matter for July 27.Noting that it had passed an interim order in February, 2020 for removal of encroachment on forest land, the Bench said it would be asking the civic body why the encroachments had not been removed so far.“First forest land has to be cleared. No concession with regard to the forest land. Don’t give us Covid excuses. File a compliance report. It may be a case where some people are hand in glove with the encroachers,” it said.The Bench directed the state forest department secretary to verify the factual situation regarding encroachments on forest land and submit an independent compliance report under his signature.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-orders-eviction-of-10-000-encroachers-from-forest-land-in-faridabad-264848
07-06-2021||New Delhi||Priyanka accuses govt of 'suppressing' Covid data, prioritising propaganda over saving lives||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday accused the Centre of suppressing data related to the Covid pandemic, and said the Modi government's emphasis on propaganda over saving lives had caused "immense damage".Going ahead with her "Zimmedaar Kaun (who is responsible)" campaign, in which she has been asking questions of the government over its handling of the pandemic, the Congress general secretary focused on the data related to Covid put out by the government.Is it more important to save the prime minister's image than it is to save Indian lives, she asked in her posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram while alleging that the government was using data as a "propaganda tool"."From the very start of the pandemic, the Modi government's attitude towards data was to utilize it as a propaganda tool rather than an invaluable weapon in the fight against Covid 19," Priyanka Gandhi added in a statement.The government's propaganda machinery repeatedly indulged in the "suppression and manipulation" of data to serve the government's political agenda even as lives were lost in “battling the scourge of a century", she alleged.To emphasise her point, Priyanka Gandhi said right from the beginning of the pandemic, deaths and infections were reported as a ratio of the population while testing was reported as an absolute figure."This was designed to mislead the public into believing that the infection and death rates were not alarming, while the testing rates were sufficient. In fact, it was exactly the opposite," she said.The Modi government seems to be following the exact same pattern on data surrounding the vaccination programme today, Priyanka Gandhi said."The Modi government's emphasis on propaganda over saving lives has caused immense damage. It is answerable to the people of India," Priyanka Gandhi asserted.Experts from across India have been demanding that data surrounding the virulence and spread of the pandemic should be made public, but this has never been done, she asserted.Citing the examples of states like Uttar Pradesh, she said the government presented RT-PCR and antigen test data together in order to "manipulate the truth".  "In fact, it is widely known that antigen tests are unreliable in comparison. In UP even now, the ratio of RT-PCR tests versus antigen tests is 65:35 per cent," Priyanka Gandhi said.Both infections and the actual number of deaths have been actively "suppressed" by the government in an effort to save face, she claimed.Citing news reports claiming 2,000 dead bodies were found along an 1,100 kilometer stretch on the banks of the Ganga, Priyanka Gandhi said the stretch spanned 27 districts of UP and none of these deaths find space in government records."Instead, when drone footage revealed hundreds of shallow graves along the Ganga in cities like Prayagraj, the UP government immediately set up a “Safaai Abhiyan” (cleaning programme) aimed at obliterating any sign of the graves," the Congress general secretary in-charge of UP alleged. News reports from the state revealed a glaring difference between the official death records and those kept by graveyards and crematoriums in cities like Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi and Meerut, Priyanka Gandhi said. The latter being many multiple times greater than the former, she added.Posing questions to the government, she asked why the Modi government summarily ignored the advice of scientists and experts and not make the data around the spread of Covid transparent and public.Did the Centre not understand the importance of correct use of data as one of the most essential tools to fight COVID or was there some other reason behind its actions, she asked.Pointing to the alleged difference between official death records, death certificates issued and crematorium/graveyard records across India, Priyanka Gandhi asked why the Modi was government doing nothing to rationalize these differences and put the true figures before the people of India."Does the Modi government's image management matter more than Covid management? Is it more important to save the Prime Minister's image than it is to save Indian lives?"       Data is a double-edged sword, she said. On its own, it can never reflect the true human cost of a tragedy as it cannot account for the pain, the trauma and the suffering of people, yet it is critical in the management of any natural disaster -- especially a pandemic -- of the scale being experienced today, Priyanka Gandhi asserted.The Congress has been critical of the Centre's handling of the Covid situation in the country, but the government has dismissed the criticism of the Opposition party, accusing it of politicising the pandemic.

The BLOs will visit households in 72 wards from Tuesday to identify and send eligible persons for vaccination at the polling booths, he said.The chief minister said polling booths are close to the homes of the people so they will not have to travel long distances to get the vaccine. Also, the government has arranged e-rickshaws to ferry people to the vaccination centres.The BLOs will give slots for vaccination to people in the 45 plus age group at the nearest polling centre. In a cycle of five days, all the eligible persons will be covered.“After covering all the 280 wards in four weeks, the government will be able to say that all those eligible (45 years and above) have received the vaccines,” Kejriwal said.He said a similar drive will be conducted again for second dose vaccination after three months.“When we will get vaccines for the 18-44 age group in the required quantity, we will start this programme for them too,” he added.

07-06-2021||Washington||US lawmakers and governors push for more Covid vaccines to India||Several lawmakers and governors have urged the Biden administration to ensure India receives Covid vaccines and medical aid, saying the crisis in the country is "devastating" and that the US has a responsibility to help its close allies fight the pandemic.India on Sunday reported 1,14,460 new coronavirus infections, the lowest in 60 days, while the daily positivity rate stood at 5.62 per cent. The total tally of coronavirus cases in the country is 2,88,09,339."The crisis in India is devastating and demands more action from (US President Joe) Biden. More Covid-19 vaccines and medical supplies are needed to help one of our most important global allies fight this virus," Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.In a tweet, he urged US citizens to join him in praying for India.Republican Senator Ted Cruz said that almost 300 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the US."India is a critical friend of the US. Biden's vaccine sharing programme is flawed: We should prioritise our allies such as India, and make sure it receives the Covid-19 vaccines they desperately need," he said.Senator Roger Wicker from the Senate Armed Services Committee said that it is important for the US to continue helping other nations beat the coronavirus. "Sending excess vaccines to close allies like India doesn't just make sense, it is the right thing to do," he said.Congressman Michael McCaul, a ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs, tweeted, "Glad to see critically needed vaccines and other therapeutics will be sent to India to continue to support a longstanding partner and ally."      He said as Texans, this reinforces close ties between "our community and the Indian-American diaspora".               Congressman Adam Smith lauded President Biden for the steps taken to assist countries that need help. "The Covid-19 crisis in India and other countries has been devastating, and more vaccines and medical supplies are still needed," said the chairman of the powerful House Armed Services Committee."To defeat Covid, we must fight it both at home and around the world," Smith added.Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna said to help India deal with shortage, the US needs to send those vaccines that it will never use, just like India helped America in its time of need.  He is also a member of the House Armed Services Committee.Congressman Dan Crenshaw said Houston is home to a large Indian community with friends and families in need back in India. "It should be a priority within this international programme," he tweeted.Observing that the Covid situation in India is "heartbreaking", Congressman August Pfluger said that the US has a responsibility to help its ally."We should immediately send additional vaccines and critical medical supplies," he said.Congressman Darren Soto said as a member of the India Caucus, he thanked President Biden for announcing 25 million in vaccines to hard hit places like India."Let's continue to take the necessary steps to address the deadly second wave of Covid there with surplus medical supplies and vaccines," said the member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Congressman John Curtis said that while 63 per cent of adult Americans have received at least one shot, many of the US' friends have no access to vaccine."It's important we share with countries like India — a return to normalcy and an eventual end to this brutal pandemic will require some global cooperation" said Curtis, who is a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Congressman Troy Nehls urged Biden to immediately send surplus vaccines to India to help it in its fight against Covid. He is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.In this global health crisis, it is important that America targets excess Covid vaccines to those around the world that need it most, said Congressman French Hill.         “The situation in India, one of our closest allies, is dire. I encourage the Biden administration to support India with vaccines in their time of need," said Hill, who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee.Congressman Tim Burchett said that the US needs to make sure that India gets the Covid vaccines.“The response to the tragedy of the Covid pandemic must be global. We must work to close the gaps in our global alert system and work with our allies to make sure this never happens again,” tweeted Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick.

Among the 17 prisoners in Pakistan who are believed to be Indians, four are women — Gullu Jan, Ajmeera, Naqaya and Hasina.In 2015, Pakistan had conveyed to India about 17 Indians lodged in their jails and said they had completed their jail terms, but could not be sent back home as they were unable to recall their whereabouts since they were “mentally unsound”.As Pakistan failed to get details of their background, the Indian High Commission in Islamabad was then given special consular access to these prisoners, hoping for breakthroughs.The Indian High Commission in Islamabad had sent the pictures of all these 17 prisoners to the Ministry of External Affairs to trace their family members.The MEA subsequently forwarded the pictures to the MHA to help identify their families and homes in India.“Since then we have put their photos on the MHA website but so far no clue has been received from anyone. We have shared their photos with the states and UTs, but no information has been received from them,” a Home Ministry official said.Many of them seem to be old in the pictures provided by Pakistan. The prisoners could not disclose any other particulars during the consular access in 2015.There are Indian and Pakistani prisoners in each other’s jails and the two countries share the list of their inmates twice every year. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/six-yrs-later-no-clue-about-mentally-unsound-indians-lodged-in-pak-jails-264753

In June last year, the Railways began running special trains and issued strict guidelines — e-ticketing through the IRCTC website or through a mobile App.Fully waitlisted passengers and unreserved passengers were not allowed to travel on trains as the unreserved coaches were booked as reserved second sitting coaches to ensure that the necessary Covid-related protocols are followed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-curbs-27-lakh-caught-without-ticket-on-trains-rti-264742

Amid the shadows emerged a story of courage and enforcement of fundamental rights by Justice Rajendra Nath Aggarwal.The former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court breathed his last this morning. He was 95. Those who know him recall how he strived to prevent the judiciary from submitting to an absolutist government.Available information suggests journalist Kuldip Nayar was arrested under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act — an action challenged by his wife before the Delhi HC.The matter was placed before the Bench of Justice S Rangarajan and Justice Aggarwal. It ordered his release, making it clear that the right to a writ of habeas corpus had not been suspended. Both judges were “punished”. Justice Rangarajan was transferred to Sikkim and Justice Aggarwal’s term as an Additional Judge was not extended.Post Emergency, Justice Aggarwal was elevated to the Delhi HC and his seniority was restored.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-cj-of-delhi-high-court-justice-rajendra-nath-aggarwal-passes-away-at-95-264732

Deaths were similar for both CAM and non-CAM patients. A higher proportion of mucormycosis patients — 74.6 per cent — were men.Authors also found that newly detected diabetes mellitus was more frequent during the evaluation of mucormycosis among CAM than non-CAM indicating that many Covid infected may not have been aware of their diabetic condition when diagnosed with black fungus.“Age, rhino-orbital-cerebral involvement and intensive care unit admission were associated with increased mortality rates among mucormycosis patients. Antifungal drug treatment improved mucormycosis survival. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to increase in mucormycosis in India, partly from inappropriate glucocorticoid (steroid) use. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among CAM and non-CAM patients,” says the publication.Among 287 mucormycosis patients studied, 187 (65.2 per cent) had CAM putting the prevalence of black fungus at 0.27 per cent among hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Covid-induced black fungus prevalence in ICUs was much higher (than the average 0.27 per cent) at 1.6 per cent.More mucormycosis cases were identified during the 2020 study period (231 cases) than during the same time range in 2019 (112 cases), authors said warning of many more cases as Covid-19 continues.“We noted a 2.1-fold rise in mucormycosis during the study period compared with 2019,” says the research.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-fold-rise-in-mucormycosis-cases-in-a-year-264621

In one tweet, Dhankhar wrote, “Post-poll violence continues in unabated fury that will put humanity to shame.” He wrote that police inaction was emboldening the perpetrators of violence and added, “All this to punish and discipline opponents for daring to vote in democracy.”In another tweet posted later in the morning, Dhankhar described the law and order situation in the state as “extremely alarming” with numerous instances of killings and rapes.Dhankhar said West Bengal was in the grip of unprecedented post-poll retributive violence at an unimaginable scale with lakhs of people being displaced and property worth hundreds of crores vandalised.On the state police, the Governor said they were “an extension of ruling dispensation to let loose vindictiveness on political opponents”.Condemning alleged incidents of social boycott and denial of benefits to people who did not vote for the TMC, he said they were being made to pay extortion fees for living in their own house or running their own business.“There is a state of anarchy and lawlessness. All elements of police state are amply reflected. Democratic values are openly shredded and trampled by ruling party ‘harmads’. People are in mortal fear of police and that in turn is at the feet of ruling party rogue elements,” the Governor wrote on his official Twitter handle.Raju Bista, BJP MP from Darjeeling and party spokesperson, appealed to the President for “urgent intervention” to stop the violence going on in the state since the announcement of the Assembly poll results on May 2.In a tweet, Bista posted videos of men with hands and legs tied up with bamboo poles being subjected to brutal beatings with a stick. On May 21, the BJP published a list containing names of 31 supporters, including two women, allegedly killed in post-poll violence in the state since May 2.‘Dhankhar’s office is his extended family’Addressing Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar as “Uncle ji”, TMC MP Mahua Moitra alleged that his family members and other acquaintances have been appointed as officers on special duty (OSDs) in Raj Bhawan. She said, “We all have the democratic right to ask him questions. He keeps asking questions to the state government. He has brought his entire village and clan to Raj Bhawan.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/alarming-law-order-scenario-in-post-poll-bengal-governor-264620

The senior BJP leader, however, described his meeting with Patel as a “courtesy call”.PM aide’s entry into cabinet imminent?When asked about the possibility of a reshuffle, Singh told mediapersons that there were vacant posts in the Cabinet which would be filled by the Chief Minister at the right time. “I think the CM will take a call on the issue,” he added.Singh said after becoming the party in-charge of UP, he had not met the Governor. “When she was the CM (of Gujarat), I was the agriculture minister (in the Centre). I met her today as courtesy demanded so, especially since she is the Governor of the state of which I am the (BJP) in-charge. It was a personal meeting,” Singh said.Backing the embattled CM, Singh said the UP Government and the party’s organisation were going strong. “The strongest organisation and most popular government are working in UP,” Singh said. However, observers are reading much into the meeting given the hectic political developments in the state over the past few days, especially after accusations of “mismanagement” against Adityanath during the second wave of coronavirus.It also follows a string of meetings by the BJP’s ideological fountainhead, the RSS, in the Capital. Though Sangh functionaries described them as preparations for an upcoming annual meeting, sources say discussions were held over the Covid situation in poll-bound states, including UP, where elections are due in March 2022.Also on the agenda was resolving the political crisis created due to “differences” between Adityanath and PM Narendra Modi over former Gujarat-cadre IAS officer Arvind Kumar Sharma. The CM is believed to have refused to accommodate Sharma in any top post in the state, though he was willing to let him have a minister of state post.Observers also say that any meeting with Anandiben Patel cannot be a routine one. “She is the Governor, has been a CM, and understands the situation well,” they say.It remains to be seen whether Sharma will be accommodated in the Cabinet but before visiting the Raj Bhavan, Singh also met state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and Jal Shakti Minister Mahendra Singh. Earlier, Singh and BJP general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh met several state leaders in Lucknow and backed Adityanath, describing him as “hardworking and efficient” to dispel speculations surrounding his future.Before leaving for Lucknow, Singh had held a meeting yesterday with party chief JP Nadda.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talk-of-up-cabinet-rejig-as-bjp-vice-prez-meets-governor-anandiben-patel-backs-embattled-adityanath-yogi-264647

Besides the promotion, their retirement and pensionary benefits will be upgraded.No adverse report, they told apex courtFollowing the intervention of the apex court, a special review board was conducted for the two officers. Since both have crossed 58 years, the retirement age of Maj General, they will not rejoin the force. The two were first considered, along with their batch for promotion in 2015, but were not promoted. Maj General Bhatia was from Intelligence Corps and Maj General Chaturvedi from Education Corps. A Brigadier retires at 57 years of age while a Maj General retires at 58 years. Had the two been promoted in 2015, they would have served till 2019 and would have also been in the race, subject to vacancy and their performance, for the next promotion to the rank of Lt General.The duo first approached the Armed Forces Tribunal, which dismissed the plea, saying it was the discretion of the Army to promote or not promote an officer.After that, the two officers then filed an appeal before the Supreme Court in 2017, saying that both of them were not promoted despite having no adverse or negative report. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-brigadiers-promoted-4-years-after-retirement-264646

The overall SDG score of India is 61.9 out of 100.Elaborating state-wise preparedness, the report said Jharkhand and Bihar are the least prepared to meet the SDGs by 2030, which is the target year. While Jharkhand lags in five of the SDGs, Bihar lags in seven.It said the states/UTs with the best overall score which are on the path to achieving the SDGs are Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, which provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.There are 17 SDGs which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.The 17 SDGs adopted by UN member states are SDG1- no poverty, SDG 2-zero hunger, SDG3-good health and well-being, SDG4- quality education,  SDG 5- gender equality, SDG 6- clean water and sanitation, SDG 7- affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth, SDG 9- industry, innovation and infrastructure.SDG 10 – reduced inequalities, SDG 11- sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12- responsible consumption and production, SDG 13- climate action, SDG 14- life below water, SDG 15- life on land, SDG 16- peace, justice and strong institutions and lastly SDG 17- strengthening global partnerships for the goals.The report also said that India ranked 168 out of 180 countries in terms of Environmental Performance Index (EPI) which is calculated on various indicators, including environmental health, climate, air pollution, sanitation and drinking water, ecosystem services, biodiversity, etc.India’s rank was 172 in the environmental health category, which is an indicator of how well countries are protecting their populations from environmental health risks.According to the EPI 2020 report by Yale University, India ranked 148, 21 positions behind Pakistan which was at 127th position in the category of biodiversity and habitat which assesses countries’ actions toward retaining natural ecosystems and protecting the full range of biodiversity within their borders.

07-06-2021||New Delhi||Six years on, no clue about 17 'mentally unsound' Indians languishing in Pakistan jails||Six years after Pakistan conveyed to India about 17 “mentally unsound” Indians languishing in jails in that country, efforts to confirm their identity have not yielded any result despite the Ministry of Home Affairs putting up their photos on its official website and seeking assistance from the general public as well as states and UTs.They have completed their sentences but due to non-confirmation of their nationality they could not be repatriated to India, an official said.Among the 17 prisoners in Pakistan who are believed to be Indians, four are women and were named Gullu Jan, Ajmeera, Naqaya and Hasina by Pakistani authorities.The others are Sonu Singh, Surinder Mahto, Prahalad Singh, Silrof Salim, Birju, Raju, Bipla, Rupi Pal, Panwasi Lal, Raju Mahouli, Shyam Sunder, Ramesh and Raju Rai.The MHA has said anyone who can identify these 17 persons should give information to the Under Secretary (Foreigners) in the Ministry of Home Affairs, the home department of state governments or union territory (UT) administration concerned or respective Director General of Police or Inspector General of Police or Commissioner of Police."Photographs of 17 mentally unsound persons, believed to be Indian nationals, who are lodged in jails in Pakistan, are attached. These persons have not been able to disclose any other particulars about them including the names of their parents or relatives, address in India, etc. due to their mentally unsound condition," the MHA notification said.In 2015, Pakistan had conveyed to India about these 17 Indians lodged in their jails and said they have completed their jail terms in that country, but they cannot be sent back home as they are unable to recall their whereabouts since they are “mentally unsound”.As Pakistan failed to get details of their background, the Indian High Commission in Islamabad was then given special consular access to these prisoners, hoping to make breakthroughs.The Indian High Commission in Islamabad had sent the pictures of all these 17 prisoners to the Ministry of External Affairs to trace their family members.The MEA subsequently forwarded the pictures to the MHA to help identify their families and homes in India.“Since then we have put their photos on the MHA website but so far no clue has been received from anyone. We have shared their photos with the states and UTs but no information has been received from them,” a home ministry official said.Many of them seem to be old in the pictures provided by Pakistan. The prisoners could not disclose any other particulars during the consular access in 2015.There are Indian and Pakistani prisoners in each other's jails, and the two countries share the list of their inmates twice every year.Despite tensions in bilateral relations, the two countries have been exchanging the lists of prisoners without any break over the years.India-Pakistan relations deteriorated after Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad targeted a CRPF bus on February 14, 2019 at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir killing 40 jawans.Days later, Indian Air Force fighter jets bombed a terrorist train camp deep inside Pakistan.Relations further nose-dived after Pakistan objected to India abrogating Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcating the state into two Union Territories on August 5, 2019. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/six-years-on-no-clue-about-17-mentally-unsound-indians-languishing-in-pakistan-jails-264375

Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Punjab, Rajasthan & West Bengal show improvement by at least 20 per cent”, he said.The ministry said most of the States/UTs improved their grade in PGI 2019-20 compared to the earlier years. Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Puducherry, Punjab and Tamil Nadu improved their overall PGI score by 10 per cent—that is 100 point or more.Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep and Punjab have shown improvement of 10 percent (eight points) or more in the ‘Access’ domain.As many as 13 states and UTs have shown improvement by 10 percent (15 points) or more in ‘Infrastructure and Facilities’ while Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Odisha have improved their scores in the domain by 20 percent or mored.In ‘Equity’, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Odisha have shown an improvement of more than 10 per cent.In ‘Governance Process’, 19 states have shown improvement by 10 per cent (36 points) or more. “Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal have shown improvement by at least 20 per cent (72 points or more),” the Ministry said.The PGI for States and Union Territories was first published in 2019 with reference year 2017-18.The index has been prepared with 70 parameters to “catalyse transformational change in the field of school education.”The PGI: States/UTs for 2019-20 is the third publication in this series. “The PGI exercise envisages that the index would propel States and UTs towards undertaking multi-pronged interventions that that will bring about the much-desired optimal education outcomes.“The PGI helps the States/UTs to pinpoint the gaps and accordingly prioritise areas for intervention to ensure that the school education system is robust at every level,” the Ministry said.“State-wise performance in PGI 2019-20 shows that 33 States and UTs have improved their PGI scores in 2019-20 compared to the previous year. The major purpose of PGI is indeed to create an environment that nudges States/UTs to continuously improve its performance,” said Pokhriyal.“The difference between the maximum and minimum PGI scores is more than 380 points in the year 2019-20. The main purpose of PGI is to make all the States and UTs aware of the areas where there is scope for improvement. We aim to have all the States and UTs at the highest,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-chandigarh-among-top-5-in-performance-grading-index-2019-20-264358

If you want a Covid vaccine, then be self-reliant,” he said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag “#Priorities”.In another tweet, he talked about stopping language discrimination after a Delhi government hospital asked nurses not to converse in Malayalam. The hospital order has been revoked.“Malayalam is as Indian as any other Indian language. Stop language discrimination,” he said.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also shared the concern and posted the order of the Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research warning the nursing personnel to use only Hindi and English for communication, else serious action will be taken.“This order is a violation of the basic values of our country. It is racist, discriminatory and utterly wrong,” she said in a tweet in Malayali, saying Malayali nurses are risking their lives in Covid times to save people.“This order is also an insult. We owe them a debt of gratitude and respect. It should be withdrawn as soon as possible and an apology should be published,” she demanded.In another tweet, Vadra alleged that the Modi government reduced oxygen beds by 36 percent, ICU beds by 46 percent, ventilator beds by 28 percent between September 2020 and January 2021.“Is the health of Indian citizens less important than the Central Vista project,” she asked, alleging that the government has declared the project as an essential service with people working day and night to complete it by 2023.“When every expert in the country, the Parliamentary Committee on Health and their own Sero-surveys warned them that additional beds would be needed for an inevitable second wave,” she said as part of her “ZimmedarKaun” (Who is responsible) campaign.

Otherwise, serious action will be taken," it had said.     An official of the G B Pant nurses' association said there are around 850 nurses working at the hospital, of which around 400 are Malayali.The association's president, Liladhar Ramchandani, claimed the circular was issued based on a complaint sent by a patient to a senior officer in the health department, regarding use of Malayalam language at the hospital, while adding that "the union disagrees with the wordings used in the circular".The circular invited criticism from the medical fraternity, political leaders and the public.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called for stopping language discrimination. Party leader Shashi Tharoor said that the order was “unacceptable, crude, offensive and a violation of the basic human rights of Indian citizens”. Last year, the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences had also issued an order advising staff that regional languages should not be spoken in its premises. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-govt-hospital-revokes-order-barring-nurses-from-talking-in-malayalam-at-work-264339
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||A year after Supreme Court orders, two Brigadiers promoted to Major General four years after retirement||Over a year after orders were passed by the Supreme Court directives, the Army has promoted two Brigadiers to the rank of Major General about four years after they retired from service.In separate letters sent to Headquarters Central Command and Southern Command, from where they retired, the Military Secretary’s Branch at Army Headquarters has stated that the competent authority has approved the empanelment of Brig Nalin Bhatia (retd) and Brig VN Chaturvedi (retd) for promotion.Brig Bhatia is of 1981 seniority and belongs to the Intelligence Corps, while Brig Chaturvedi is of 1983 seniority and belongs to the Army Education Corps. They had been due for promotion in 2015 but were overlooked.The aggrieved officers had initially moved the Armed Forces Tribunal which rejected their plea for promotion. Thereafter they challenged the Tribunal’s judgement before the Supreme Court.In February 2020, the apex court ruled that the non-empanelment of the appellants for promotion as Major General was contrary to the Army’s promotion policy and they were entitled for reconsideration for empanelment by a Review Selection Board strictly in accordance with the promotion policy by keeping in mind the observations in its judgment.The Army was directed to complete the exercise within six months.“The Army was dragging its feet on the issue and we moved a contempt petition. The Supreme Court issued notices to the Defence Secretary and Army Chief and the case is still pending,” the officers’ counsel, Col Indra Sen Singh (retd), said.The Army had contended before the Supreme Court that the Selection Board is comprised of seven top Army officers and their wisdom cannot be questioned. The apex court, however, held that there was no presumption that a decision taken by persons occupying high posts was valid and that judicial decision did not depend on the rank or position held by the decision makers.Col Sen said that the two officers were the only ones in their respective batch to be considered for promotion in 2015 but were not elevated despite their excellent service profile which ranged from above average to outstanding and no adverse report.Further, they met all the laid down criteria for promotion and had been recommended for promotion by all the reporting officers without exception in the chain of command.“The Army did not did not disclose the reasons for not promoting the officers that were sought in an application filed under the Right to Information Act. Apparently, there were extraneous factors and internal politics at play,” he said.While the court order does not specify the date from which the officers will be deemed to have been promoted, as per the policy in vogue, it will be with effect from the date promotion was due and they will be entitled to consequential benefits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-year-after-supreme-court-orders-two-brigadiers-promoted-to-major-general-four-years-after-retirement-264334
07-06-2021||New Delhi||Doorstep ration delivery scheme: BJP and AAP engage in a slanging match||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday engaged in a slanging match over the “doorstep ration delivery scheme” proposed by his government in Delhi.He said the scheme should be implemented across the country in view of Covid-19 otherwise ration shops will act as super-spreaders.“If pizza, burgers, smartphones and clothes can be delivered at home, then why can’t ration be delivered at their doorstep,” Kejriwal asked.He alleged that the Centre was fighting with everyone, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Maharashtra, Delhi and Jharkhand governments, farmers and the people of Lakshadweep.“People are distressed that the Central government is fighting everyone. If we fight like this, how will we tackle Covid-19,” the chief minister said in an online briefing.“The Delhi government did not require the Centre’s approval for the implementation of the scheme, but it sought permission five times to avoid any dispute,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi government on Saturday had claimed the doorstep delivery of ration scheme was rejected by the Lt governor saying the Centre’s approval was not sought and that a litigation was pending in the high court regarding it.He said the scheme would have finished the powerful ration mafia in Delhi.“If you stand with the ration mafia, who will stand with the poor people” the chief minister said, adding that the scheme was intended to benefit 72 lakh people in the national capital.  BJP’s Sambit Patra accused him of “doing drama for politics” and called his ‘doorstep ration delivery scheme’ a “scam”.“Arvind Kejriwal is trying to mislead. He claims the Prime Minister is preventing door-to-door ration delivery, this is false. One nation, one ration card is a central initiative. The Delhi Government refused to implement it, denying its benefits to thousands of migrant labourers”.Patra also countered Kejriwal questioning how he will provide doorstep delivery and ensure that the ration reaches the right people.“They said they will take biometrics. EPOS is a machine to track ration which Kejriwal stopped in ration shops. In Delhi, Aadhaar card verification is also zero,” he said.The BJP leader said under the national food security act 72.78 lakh people were provided ration. The Central government is giving food grains under two schemes NFSA and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana in Delhi and that they cannot be tampered with. “If Kejriwal wants to start another scheme let him buy the grain and do so,” Patra added.    — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doorstep-ration-delivery-scheme-bjp-and-aap-engage-in-a-slanging-match-264325
