The melting glaciers fulfils the water requirements of more than a billion people of the region who will be affected when much of the glacier ice mass melts throughout this century and gradually stops supplying the required amount of water,” Dr Azam said. Region-wide, the total impact on each year’s water supply varies. Glacier-melt water and climate change impacts on glaciers are more crucial for the Indus basin in comparison to the Ganga and Brahmaputra basins which are predominantly fed by monsoon rains and are affected mainly due to the changing rainfall patterns, he added. Pprojected trends in river runoff volume and seasonality over the 21st century are consistent across a range of climate change scenarios. Total river runoff, glacier-melt and seasonality of flow are projected to increase until the 2050s, and then decrease, with some exceptions and large uncertainties,” Smriti Srivastava, a PhD student and co-author of the study said The study, funded by the Department of Science and Technology and has been published in the peer reviewed journal, Science. It identified gaps in understanding the impacts of climate change on the Himalayan water resources, and highlighted prospective solutions to bridge these gaps. To address these gaps, the authors have recommended an expanded observation network that places fully automatic weather stations on selected glaciers along with developing comparison projects to examine glacier area and volumes, glacier dynamics, permafrost thaw, and snow and ice sublimation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/glacier-melt-in-himalayas-to-increase-rapidly-till-2050-then-may-decrease-says-study-by-iit-272975
23-06-2021||New Delhi||India likely to have Covid vaccine for children by Sept-Oct: AIIMS Director||Noting that children usually have a mild disease but there is a need to develop Covid-19 vaccines for them, AIIMS-Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria has said Bharat Biotech and other companies are doing trials at a very fast pace and hoped that data will lead to approvals so that there is a vaccine for children in the country by September-October.In an interview with ANI, Dr Guleria said that Covaxin’s data for children after completion of phase two or three trials is expected by September-October.Covaxin is an indigenous vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR.“Children usually have the mild disease but we need to develop vaccines for children because if we have to control this pandemic, everyone should be vaccinated. Bharat Biotech and other companies are doing trials at a very fast pace as parents have come forward with their children for the trials,” he said.“One is hopeful that trial will be completed early and possibly with follow-up of about two-three months, we shall have data by September. Hopefully, by that time, approvals will be there so that by September-October, we’ll have vaccines from our country which we can give to children,” he added.Dr Guleria said Bharat Biotech is conducting trials between the age group of 2 to 18 years and “this covers a wide spectrum”.Asked about Zydus Cadila vaccine, he said it is a DNA vaccine, a new platform is being used and “it is something that we should proud of”.He added that it is a platform for which research has not been done in past in the country.“The data is still being collated and one is hoping that they will be able to submit the data to the DCGI for regulatory approval. It will depend on the company how quickly it is able to collate the data and give it to the regulatory authority,” he said.Asked about Pfizer CEO stating that the company is in the “final stages” of getting approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in India, Dr Guleria said that the firm has been in negotiations for some time and these would have possibly reached the final stage.“One is hopeful that it should occur because the negotiations with the company are going on for quite some time. I am sure now they are reaching a stage where final sort understanding will be there,” he said. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-likely-to-have-covid-vaccine-for-children-by-sept-oct-aiims-director-272974

Mukul Roy's name was in that list," said a senior TMC leader.The BJP has also submitted a list of six names for PAC memberships.Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari said Roy's nomination does not matter as he would cease to exist as a member of the House under the anti-defection law.The BJP legislative party is apprehensive that the post of the PAC chairman, whose selection is the prerogative of the speaker, might go to Roy as there have been instances when Congress MLAs switching over to TMC were appointed to the important post, party sources said."As per the norm, the PAC chairman post goes to the opposition party. But in the last assembly, we saw how Manas Bhunia and Sankar Singh held the post despite switching over to the TMC and not resigning as Congress MLAs," a state BJP leader said.Reacting to this, senior TMC MLA Tapas Ray said it is the prerogative of the speaker to select the PAC chairman.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mukul-roy-among-nominees-for-bengal-assembly-pac-membership-272973
23-06-2021||Beijing||China says border issue should not be linked to bilateral relations||China on Wednesday said the prolonged border issue with India should be addressed through peaceful negotiations and not be linked to bilateral relations. Asked for his reaction to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's comments at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday that China's military deployment along the disputed border with India and uncertainty over whether Beijing will fulfil its promise on troop reductions remains a challenge for relations between the two neighbours, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the border issue should not be linked to the bilateral relations.  "We advocate that we should address the boundary issue through peaceful negotiations and we don't think that the border issue should be linked up to our bilateral ties,” he said at a media briefing here."China always stands for a peaceful settlement of the boundary issue through negotiation and against linking the boundary issue with bilateral relations," the Chinese foreign ministry later updated its response on the ministry's website.Zhao said the military deployment by China in the western sector along the border is a "normal defence arrangement.” "China's military deployment along the western section of the China-India border is a normal defence arrangement aimed at preventing and responding to encroachment and threat on China's territory by relevant country," he said.  In his remarks, Jaishankar said that the larger issue relating to the border row in eastern Ladakh is whether India and China can build a relationship based on mutual sensitivity and respect and whether Beijing would live up to the written commitments about both sides not deploying a large armed force along the frontier.      It has been more than a year since the military standoff between China and India erupted in eastern Ladakh on May 5, 2020, during which there were fatalities on both sides for the first time in 45 years. They have made limited progress in achieving disengagement at the Pangong Lake area. The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points. India has been particularly pressing for the disengagement of troops in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.Last month, Indian Army Chief Gen. MM Naravane said that there can be no de-escalation without complete disengagement at all friction points in eastern Ladakh and that the Indian Army is prepared for all contingencies in the region. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-says-border-issue-should-not-be-linked-to-bilateral-relations-272970

23-06-2021||Kolkata||Mamata flays Centre for ‘victimising’ ex-West Bengal CS Alapan Bandyopadhyay||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday slammed the Centre for “victimising” her former top bureaucrat Alapan Bandyopadhyay, against whom the union government has initiated penalty proceedings that could deprive him of post-retirement benefits.Banerjee said that IAS and IPS officers of the country are in solidarity with the former West Bengal chief secretary, as it is the “battle of every bureaucrat”.“The Centre must realise it is victimising an official who lost his brother, nephew and mother within a span of 15-20 days... and he is in mental agony because he has worked for the country all his life, and now he is being treated in such a manner... This is irresponsible behaviour and we will not allow this,” she told reporters.The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has sent Bandyopadhyay, now an advisor to the chief minister, a “memorandum” mentioning the charges and giving him 30 days to reply, officials had said on Monday.He has been warned of major penalty proceedings, which allows the central government to withhold pension or gratuity, or both, either in full or in part.The CM said Bandyopadhyay, a 1987-batch IAS officer (retired), has always worked with dedication, determination and devotion, and he is authorised to take any action as part of his response to the Centre.“Our government will give him full support,” Banerjee asserted.She also said the union government is not abiding by the law in its actions against Bandyopadhyay.“You cannot forcibly change rules because the country has a Constitution. It (central government) is turning into a selfish giant... Former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress party, too, had a massive majority, but even he had never done something like this,” Banerjee said.The Centre had on May 28 sought services of Bandyopadhyay, barely a few days after he was given a three-month extension beyond the date of his superannuation (May 31), and asked the state government to relieve him immediately with a direction to him to report at DoPT, New Delhi.The DoPT had sent him a reminder after he failed to report in response to its May 28 order.As the tussle between the Centre and the state continued over the order, Mamata Banerjee on May 31 said that Bandyopadhyay has “retired” and been appointed as her advisor for three years. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-flays-centre-for-victimising-ex-west-bengal-cs-alapan-bandyopadhyay-272966
23-06-2021||New Delhi||Need to dramatically scale up Covid-19 vaccine production: S Jaishankar||The world would not be able to deal with coronavirus pandemic without “dramatically” scaling up production of Covid-19 vaccines, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday, noting that Europe’s support is “key” for lifting patents on the vaccines and keeping open the supply chains.Speaking at a virtual interactive session along with Portuguese foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva, he also said that Europe needs to keep open the supply chains to boost manufacturing of the vaccines.In reply to a question about a proposal at the WTO by India and South Africa to temporarily waive patents on the vaccines, Silva said the European Union was of the view that innovation and research needed to be preserved and signalled the grouping’s reservations in lifting the protections.Portugal currently holds the presidency of the 27-nation European Union, considered as one of the most powerful groupings globally.“We think that temporarily waiving the intellectual property rights is a last resort kind of a solution. But we are discussing it within the European Union,” he said at the dialogue organised by the Observer Research Foundation.Calling for addressing existing bottlenecks in vaccine production, Silva said the EU has been waiting for a move by the US on the waiver, saying the American proposal at the World Trade Organisation could be “much more concrete”.In his response, Jaishankar stressed the need to scale up vaccine production to address the current challenge facing the globe.“This is a calamity of a kind none of us could even think about. So, I think it does meet the kind of last resort standard, and I think it is very much in that mode of thought that we have made the proposal,” Jaishankar said.He said that there was a need to significantly enhance the production of the Covid-19 vaccines.“Without dramatically raising production levels, we are not going to be able to deal with this problem, not at the current production level. We will have to see what are the preconditions to dramatically raise the production level,” he said.“Europe is absolutely key to solving this problem; not just due to intellectual property rights, but also because a lot of supply chains go through Europe,” he added.Jaishankar said that there was no uniformity in views on the issue among all the EU member states.The TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) council of the WTO is likely to start text-based negotiations on the proposal by India and South Africa soon.Talking about the overall India-EU ties, the external affairs minister also referred to the decision by the two sides to resume the free trade talks, describing it as a significant one.At a virtual summit last month, India and the EU decided to resume talks on a free trade pact after a gap of eight years besides vowing to work on a connectivity partnership.“It has been a remarkable six months in our relationship with the European Union. We have crossed the threshold, we have seen more momentum and more energy. We have had a very important virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and all the EU leaders and we made some very important decisions,” Jaishankar said.The Portuguese foreign minister also batted for a united agenda by the US, the UK, the European Union and India in dealing with challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.Referring to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Silva said some of the countries involved in the mega infrastructure programme are paying an increasingly higher price.He said the BRI cannot be the only initiative available to the developing countries and that there was a need to bring out other such instruments. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-dramatically-scale-up-covid-19-vaccine-production-s-jaishankar-272965

How come all the thieves have Modi as the common surname?"   He was the Congress president when he had made this remark. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi had appeared before the court in October 2019 and had pleaded not guilty for his comment."Rahulji is expected to attend the court proceedings on Thursday in a false defamation suit filed against him. He will arrive at 10 am and leave at 12.30 pm.

23-06-2021||New Delhi||Trust in news has grown amid pandemic, but it is below average in India: Report||Trust in news has grown amid the coronavirus pandemic with 44 per cent of the respondents globally saying they trust most news most of the time, but the figure is below average at 38 per cent in India, according to a survey released on Wednesday.Finland has topped the charts with overall trust of 65 per cent, while the US is placed at the bottom with 29 per cent score. India is ranked in the bottom half in the 46-nation survey conducted by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford.In India, legacy print brands and government broadcasters Doordarshan and All India Radio are more trusted, while print brands, in general, are more trusted than TV brands, which are seen as far more polarised and sensational.In another interesting finding, the study found that personalities—celebrities and influencers—attract the most attention amongst social media news users across the four big platforms in India—Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.Internet personalities were followed by mainstream news outlets/journalists, politicians/political activists, smaller or alternative news sources, and ordinary people among the top five groups to whom Indian social media users pay attention to for news.The study, however, flagged that its data is based on a survey of mainly English-speaking online news users in India, a small subset of a larger, more diverse, media market in the country.Within Asia-Pacific, India has been ranked 8th, while Thailand is at the top with 50 per cent respondents saying they trust news.The study conducted by the Reuters Institute also showed that global concerns about false and misleading information edged higher this year, ranging from 82 per cent in Brazil to 37 per cent in Germany.It also found that social media users are more likely to say they have been exposed to misinformation about the coronavirus than non-users, with platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp being seen as the main channels for spreading false information.Among the Indian respondents, most expressed concern about COVID-19 misinformation through WhatsApp (28 per cent), followed by Facebook (16 per cent), YouTube (14 per cent), search engines such as Google (7 per cent) and Twitter (4 per cent).Trust in the news has grown, on average, by six percentage points in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic with 44 per cent of the respondents globally saying they trust most news most of the time. It reverses to some extent recent falls in average trust, bringing levels back to those of 2018, according to the survey report.India also figured among a few countries where a majority of respondents (over 50 per cent) were concerned about financial state of news organisations, while this proportion was only 32 per cent in the US, 26 per cent in the UK, 23 per cent in Germany and 41 per cent in Singapore.The survey further found that personalities such as celebrities and influencers attract the most attention amongst social media news users across all four big networks of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.Facebook users among the respondents said they pay as much attention to ordinary people as they do to journalists or news organisations when accessing news, while those using Twitter said they pay almost as much attention to politicians as they do to journalists or news organisations.Within India, legacy print news brands and newspapers, in general, have borne the maximum brunt of the slowdown, while television remains the most popular source overall despite the growing popularity of digital media, the survey found.Among India respondents, legacy print brands and government broadcasters Doordarshan and All India Radio retain a high level of trust among consumers.Print brands, in general, are more trusted than TV brands, which are seen as far more polarised and sensational in their coverage, it said.The survey found that India is one of the strongest mobile focused markets, with 73 per cent accessing news through smartphones and just 37 per cent via computer.India has more than 600 million active internet users, many of whom access the internet only through mobile phones—aided by low data charges and cheap devices—it said.The study, however, flagged that the findings should not be taken to be nationally representative, as the respondents are generally more affluent, younger, have higher levels of formal education and are more likely to live in cities than the wider Indian population.For each of the 46 countries including India, the sample size for the survey was in the range of 2,000 to 2,099. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trust-in-news-has-grown-amid-pandemic-but-it-is-below-average-in-india-report-272961
23-06-2021||New Delhi||‘PR event’: Congress slams dip in vaccinations after record high||The Congress on Wednesday attacked the government over the dip in vaccination numbers after a record high earlier this week, with former party chief Rahul Gandhi saying the country is not safe unless vaccination is done on a large scale but sadly the government is “unable to move beyond a PR event”.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also lashed out at the Centre over the dip in the number of vaccinations after India achieved a “historic milestone” of administering 88.09 lakh coronavirus vaccine doses in a single day on June 21. the numbers dipped to over 53.4 lakh on Tuesday.“The Delta variant (of coronavirus) is knocking on the doors of the country. Only 3.6 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated but the PM has taken on the role of EM event manager,” Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.After patting his own back, the vaccinations saw a drop of 40 per cent the next day, the Congress general secretary said.“Formula of record vaccination...Madhya Pradesh, June 20: 692 vaccine doses administered, June 21: 16,91,967, June 22: 4,825,” Priyanka Gandhi said.“Collected vaccines, used it in a single day for event, then a dip the next day. For administering vaccines to all adults by December, 80-90 lakh vaccine doses will have to be administered daily,” she said.Rahul Gandhi said unless coronavirus vaccination is done on a large scale continuously, “our country is not safe”.“Sadly, the central government is not able to move beyond a PR event,” the former Congress chief said in a tweet in Hindi.In a tweet, senior Congress spokesperson P Chidambaram said, “Look at the numbers for MP, Karnataka and Haryana on Sunday to Tuesday. BJP governments pulling a rabbit out of a hat! Pure magic for a day!”               He tagged a media report on the vaccine doses administered in various states, showing the dip in numbers after the record high on Monday.“Watch UP and Gujarat numbers for a few more days,” Chidambaram added.“I am appalled that eminent doctors attribute Monday’s record to ‘planning’. The plan was to ‘doctor’ the numbers on Monday,” the former Union minister alleged.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh also highlighted the Madhya Pradesh vaccination numbers for the last three days to attack the government and asked “who are we trying to fool”.Attacking the government, Chidambaram had said on Wednesday, “Hoard on Sunday, vaccinate on Monday, and go back to limping on Tuesday. That is the secret behind the world ‘record’ of vaccinations on a ‘single day’.”     “I am sure the ‘feat’ will find a place in the Guinness book of records! Who knows, there may be a Nobel Prize for Medicine awarded to the Modi government,” he had said.

23-06-2021||Jalpaiguri/Kolkata||BJP’s John Barla again rakes up demand for separate North Bengal despite party warning||BJP MP John Barla on Wednesday again raked up a controversial demand seeking a separate union territory comprising North Bengal districts, despite his party cautioning against such statements.The Alipurduar MP alleged that people who voted for the BJP were being denied ration and 100-days work under the job guarantee scheme.“In order to escape from such atrocities, I raised the demand for North Bengal to be declared union territory,” he said.“I will take this matter up with Delhi (leadership),” he told reporters at his Lakshmipara tea garden residence in Jalpaiguri, surrounded by people who claimed they were sheltering there from attacks by Trinamool Congress supporters.In a jolt to the BJP, the party’s Alipurduar district president, Ganga Prasad Sharma along with seven other local BJP leaders, joined the TMC on Monday.Barla however claimed that nine members of Kumargram panchayat and a zilla parishad member from Alipurduar district have taken shelter at his residence along with their family members after being pressured to leave the BJP and join TMC.Denying the allegation, the TMC district leadership said having won the recent assembly elections with a huge majority, it does not require people from BJP to join the ruling party.Reacting to Barla’s repeated outbursts demanding that North Bengal be declared a separate union territory, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said “everyone has to go by the party line,” while at the same time stating there is space for personal opinions in the party.“Democracy cannot flourish by gagging people,” he said.Accusing the BJP of adopting a duplicitous policy, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh alleged the saffron party is trying to create unrest in the state.“It is not clear whether the BJP wants these leaders to stop making such statements or continue with their diatribe on dividing West Bengal,” he said.Days after Barla first made known his demand for a separate North Bengal union territory,  BJP’s Bishnupur MP Saumitra Khan stoked a fresh controversy by demanding a separate state by carving out districts of Junglemahal and other areas in South Bengal. This happened despite the BJP West Bengal unit on Tuesday cautioning party members against violating the party line.“Some of our leaders may have made those comments in their own capacity. It has nothing to do with our party line or opinion, which is against any form of division of Bengal..., everybody has to toe the party line as a loyal soldier of the party. Violation of party line won’t be tolerated,” the BJP state president has said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-john-barla-again-rakes-up-demand-for-separate-north-bengal-despite-party-warning-272956

However, they were given Covishield due to lapse on the part of the employees there," Singh said.They will be under observation for 24 hours.The six will have to take the second dose of Covishield, the official saidAfter the mix-up was noticed, there was a commotion at the centre and police personnel have been deputed at the spot.Chhatarpur Sub-Divisional Police Officer Ajay Kumar said that police and civil officials reached the spot and brought the situation under control. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jharkhand-different-vaccines-given-to-six-in-jab-mix-up-272950
23-06-2021||New Delhi||Fresh standoff between Delhi and Centre over doorstep ration scheme||A fresh standoff between Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ruled Delhi government and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Central government erupted with Food and Civil Supplies Department raising various concerns on Delhi government’s proposed doorstep ration delivery scheme.The Centre’s Food and Civil Supplies Department in a letter to the Delhi government has pointed out four issues which need to be followed under the proposed doorstep ration delivery scheme in the national capital and also to protect the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in the future as well.The department in the letter has pointed on challenges observed in contravention of statutory provisions of NFSA, which applies across the country for providing food grains on subsidized rates by the Centre.The department has pointed out that the proposed scheme (doorstep ration) involves distribution of packaged food commodities—wheat flour (atta) instead of wheat and rice, and it will involve milling, processing, packing, additional transportation, etc.“Hence, it will naturally increase the per kg cost of commodities, and will have a direct financial implication on the poor NFSA beneficiaries. Further, it shall be obligatory on the part of the state govt to clearly mention the additional cost of milling (per kg) over and above CIP of wheat.”The department also pointed out that there is no clarity on how Delhi government will maintain the address of beneficiaries to ensure uninterrupted home delivery of packaged commodities every month even in case of change in address of the beneficiaries.It further stated that free movement of delivery vehicles may not be possible in narrow streets in residential colonies and the scheme also may not be successful in multi-storeyed residential colonies.“Every beneficiary shall expect the vehicle in front of their door. If not, there may be issue of favouritism and nepotism.”It noted that the Delhi government in its proposal has not clarified on various subjects, for instance, who will be the delivery partner and for how long the contract will be made to deliver subsidised packed food commodities in every home.“Most importantly, how the GNCTD intend to ensure continuous online monitoring of delivery of food security entitlement, as it will be difficult in a scenario where existing distribution process itself is not yet automated and integrated with the central online system- ‘Annavitaran portal’.In absence of an institutionalized oversight mechanism this may also give rise to grievances, complaints, and petition in the courts,” the letter to Delhi government read.The department further noted that the Delhi government has not clarified that how the packaged food would to be supplied to street dwellers, rag-pickers, migratory labourers, construction workers, etc who do not have permanent address in Delhi.“Therefore, in view of observations and concern, it is clarified that proposal of GNCTD does not meet the statutory and financial requirements of the NFSA and therefore, proposal made by GNCTD can’t be accepted,” the department stated in the letter to Delhi government issued on June 22.Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia accused the Centre of rejecting AAP government’s flagship door-to-door ration scheme.“Distribution of food under NFSA comes under the state and it has the right to distribute food commodities in its own way. Delhi government’s doorstep ration scheme is only to provide packed food commodities at home. The Centre has rejected the scheme on baseless arguments.”—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fresh-standoff-between-delhi-and-centre-over-doorstep-ration-scheme-272940
23-06-2021||London||UK High Court rejects Nirav Modi’s extradition plea, has 5 days to appeal for oral hearing||Wanted diamond merchant Nirav Modi, whose extradition to India was ordered in April by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, has lost the first stage of his extradition appeal in the High Court here.The appeal was before a High Court judge for a decision “on the papers” submitted for the appeal to determine if there are any grounds for an appeal against the Home Secretary’s decision or the Westminster Magistrates Court February ruling in favour of Nirav Modi’s extradition to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering.A High Court official confirmed that the permission to appeal was “rejected on paper” on Tuesday, which leaves the 50-year-old jeweller with a chance to make his case at a brief oral hearing in the High Court with a renewed “leave to appeal” application for a judge to determine if it can proceed to a full appeal hearing.Under the legal guidelines, Nirav Modi as an appellant has five business days to apply for such an oral consideration, giving him time until next week.If a renewal application is made, it will be listed before a High Court judge for a hearing. It is understood that Nirav Modi plans to make such an application.“We are waiting to see if they do apply for permission to appeal. If they are allowed to appeal then we would contest any appeal proceedings on behalf of the GOI (government of India),” the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which appears in court on behalf of the Indian authorities, said last month.Meanwhile, Nirav Modi remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest over two years ago on 19 March 2019.In his ruling in February, District Judge Sam Goozee concluded that the diamond merchant has a case to answer before the Indian courts and that the bars to extradition under UK law do not apply in his case.As part of a very comprehensive judgment, the judge concluded that he was satisfied that there is evidence upon which Nirav Modi could be convicted in relation to the conspiracy to defraud the PNB.“A prima facie case is established,” he said, in relation to all counts of charges brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) – including money laundering, intimidation of witnesses and disappearance of evidence.The court had also accepted that while Nirav Modi’s mental health had deteriorated due to the lengthy incarceration in a London prison, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, his risk of suicide did not meet the high threshold to conclude that it would be “unjust or oppressive” to extradite him.Nirav Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added to the CBI case.As witnessed in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya – who remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” matter, believed to relate to an asylum request, is resolved – there is still some way to go before Nirav Modi can be moved from Wandsworth Prison in London to Barrack 12 Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai and face trial in India.

23-06-2021||New Delhi||Association of physicians suggests ways to augment India's heathcare workforce capacity||A leading consultancy firm and a global association of physicians of Indian origin have jointly released two papers, suggesting ways to augment the healthcare workforce capacity in the country, including by making nursing a more appealing profession.The two-position papers, titled 'Reimagining Nurse's Role in India' and 'Formalising Allied Healthcare Workforce in India', have been presented to NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant and Member Dr VK Paul, according to a statement issued on Wednesday.The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the Global Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (GAPIO) have jointly released the two position papers and the aim is to see the augmentation of the healthcare workforce capacity in the country, the statement said.The papers assume significance as nurses and other allied healthcare professionals have played a crucial role in combatting COVID-19 in the last two years, with the pandemic underlining a shortage of such workforce at various healthcare facilities.According to Dr Prathap C Reddy, founder-president, GAPIO and founder-chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group, "Given the continued shortage of both nurses and the allied healthcare workforce in the overall healthcare system, India needs to review and drive transformation in this sector holistically." He asserted that nurses are the "backbone of every health system", accounting for "50 per cent of the global health workforce", and their roles are diverse from devoting their lives to caring for mothers and children, giving life-saving immunisation and health advice, and looking after people of all ages.The years 2020 and 2021 are the years of the nurses, he was quoted as saying in the statement issued by the Apollo Hospitals group on behalf of the GAPIO."Studies from MoHFW (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) and NSSO (National Sample Survey Office) indicate that the demand for allied healthcare workers is significantly higher than the supply, with a disparity also being observed across the states," said Dr Sudhir Parikh, secretary-general, GAPIO.India could need 60 lakh to 70 lakh allied healthcare professionals (AHPs) by 2024. The current training capacity at about 1.5 lakh seats per year would fall short of achieving the objectives. "We need to enhance both the capacity and the quality of the healthcare workforce," Parikh said.To address these challenges, the papers propose an integrated strategy, according to Priyanka Aggarwal, managing director, and partner, BCG."Issues concerning nursing such as the lack of college infrastructure need to be addressed with a focus on the states with a limited infrastructure. Tagging of colleges with operational multispecialty hospitals needs to be developed. The attractiveness of the profession needs to be enhanced for better fill rates, including through building social respect for the profession and strengthening professional development and progression," she was quoted as saying in the statement.There is an opportunity to enhance the current skilling pedagogy and adopt new methodologies, tele-nursing, robotic nursing, forensic nursing, etc., and the global best practices. The availability of training faculty for nursing colleges also needs to be improved, Aggarwal said.The government defines AHPs as associates, technicians or technologists supporting the diagnosis and treatment of a medical condition and the implementation of any healthcare and referral plan, according to the recommendations of a qualified health professional, Reddy said."It is crucial to plan a holistic strategy for the nursing workforce in India that can comprehensively solve the challenges of adequate nursing staff as well as the quality of education and training of nurses," said Dr Anupam Sibal, president, GAPIO and group medical director, Apollo Hospitals Group.Healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, paramedical and other ancillary medical professionals, have been hailed the world over for their dedication and sacrifices in offering Covid care to patients during the pandemic.Many healthcare workers have lost their lives fighting the coronavirus pandemic and for their contribution, the society has hailed these men and women as "corona warriors".Kshitij Vijayvargiya, partner, BCG, said the Lok Sabha approval for the Allied and Healthcare Professionals Bill, 2018, which formalises education and licensing for the workforce and sets up state-level councils for the recognition of education and training institutions, is a major milestone."College infrastructure needs to be enhanced and awareness about job opportunities needs to be increased. The attractiveness of the profession needs to be increased by enhancing awareness in secondary schools, formalisation of staffing and deployment norms, and making career progression easier," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/association-of-physicians-suggests-ways-to-augment-indias-heathcare-workforce-capacity-272938

On the contrary, reports suggest that PLA has converted temporary ammunition dumps, helipads and surface-to-air missile positions into permanent positions.In case, there is any indication at the WMCC about Chinese intentions for disengagement and lowering of troop strength, the 12th meeting of Corps Commanders will be sequenced.Though the two sides disengaged from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February, a similar process in the remaining areas is yet to be agreed upon. Army Chief Gen MM Naravane has ruled out lowering of troop strength from an estimated 50,000-60,000 unless there is complete disengagement from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eastern-ladakh-row-china-plays-hardball-on-eve-of-diplomatic-talks-272895

As a result, the states got an extra Rs 1.06 lakh crore.The first reform under the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ policy required states to seed all ration cards with Aadhaar. About 17 states completed this reform and were eligible for additional borrowings of Rs 37,600 crore. The second reform made renewal of business-related licences under seven Acts automatic. Twenty states completed this reform and were allowed additional borrowing of Rs 39,521 crore.The third reform required states to notify floor rates of property tax and of water and sewerage charges. Around 11 states completed these reforms and were granted additional borrowing of Rs 15,957 crore.The fourth reform was direct benefit transfer in lieu of free power to farmers. Additional borrowing of 0.15 per cent of the GSDP was linked to this.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-borrowed-rs1l-crore-extra-during-pandemic-pm-modi-272499

It takes into account concerns of all students," said a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar.Rejecting petitions challenging the decision by the CBSE and CISCE against cancellation of Class XII board exams, the Bench also gave its final approval to the formulae proposed by the two Boards to evaluate students.Regarding compartment and private students, it said they would be allowed to take physical examination to be conducted between August 15 and September 15, 2021.There should be a finality regarding the status of examinations as uncertainty was affecting the psychology of students, it noted.Attorney General KK Venugopal assured the Bench that the UGC would instruct colleges to take into account the schedule and complete the process of admission after declaration of results by all Boards."We find force in the submission made by the Attorney General that the scheme has been formulated by an expert body consisting of 12 members,” it said, adding that the evaluation formulae can’t be doubted on the mere apprehension of manipulation of marks by the schools to favour their own students.The Bench rejected arguments of senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing a parents' body, that the scheme should provide an option to appear for improvisation at the initial stage itself and results of internal assessment should be declared together."After hearing the views of the Attorney General, we are of the view that this suggestion can't be taken forward. This would result in denial of option to students and would result in uncertainty until the examinations of improvisation are conducted and the results are declared," it said."Individual perception will not decide this case. A decision based on larger interest has to be taken… there are logistical issues and issues with teachers and support staff,” noted the Bench which also included Justice Maheshwari.Ending uncertainty over the method of calculating marks/grades of Class XII students following cancellation of their examinations due to Covid-19, the top court on June 17 had accepted the formulae of the CBSE and CISCE to evaluate them and publish their results by July 31.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-junks-pleas-against-class-xii-exam-cancellation-272501

The outfits, however, clarified that their demand for full statehood to J&K was intact. Noting that the position of the PAGD was clear and need not be repeated, alliance chairman and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah said, “We are confident we will be able to put forth our stand before the PM and Home Minister (Amit Shah) at the meeting.” The PAGD was formed to work for the restoration of Articles 370 and 35-A and statehood in J&K.PAGD vice-chairperson and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said her party favoured a dialogue to resolve long-standing issues. “We will talk about what has been snatched from us, that it was a mistake and was illegal and unconstitutional…. They are talking to the Taliban in Doha. They should talk to everyone in J&K and with Pakistan also for the resolution,” she said. The PDP chief also said political prisoners should be released and those lodged outside of J&K should be brought back to restore confidence.The Congress reiterated its demand for full statehood to J&K and said its stand on Article 370 abrogation remained the same as articulated in the CWC resolution dated August 6, 2019, which said, “Article 370 is the constitutional recognition of the terms of the Instrument of Accession between the State of Jammu & Kashmir and India. It deserved to be honoured until it was amended, after consultation with all sections of the people, and strictly in accordance with the Constitution.”At a meeting, Congress president Sonia Gandhi convened today to discuss the PM’s invite, a decision was taken to attend and put forth the party’s stated stand on J&K. The meeting was attended by former PM Manmohan Singh and party leaders Karan Singh, Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Rajni Patil, GA Mir and Tariq Hameed Karra.The People’s Conference led by Sajjad Lone had yesterday accepted the government invitation for the June 24 meeting. Fourteen leaders invited for talks include four former CMs (Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Ghulam Nabi Azad), four former Deputy CMs (Nirmal Singh, Kavinder Gupta, Muzaffar Beg and Tara Chand) and presidents of mainstream J&K parties.The government has not spelt out any agenda and said discussions would be freewheeling.

Both the judges hail from West Bengal. The two TMC leaders have challenged the High Court’s order refusing them to file affidavits with regard to their alleged role on the day of arrest of their four party leaders on May 17 by the CBI, which alleged that the TMC leaders played a key role in stopping the CBI from performing its legal duty after arresting four leaders in the case.The Calcutta High Court is hearing the CBI’s application for transfer of the Narada sting tape case from the special CBI court to the HC.On June 9, a five-judge Bench of the Calcutta High Court had said it would decide later on considering the affidavits by Banerjee and Ghatak on their respective roles on the day of the arrest of four leaders in connection with the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/second-sc-judge-recuses-from-hearing-didis-plea-in-narada-case-272504

||India in touch with Taliban amid Afghan peace process||Tribune News Service New Delhi, June 22 External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar set out India’s red lines for the settlement process in Afghanistan during a UNSC debate even as a Qatari official revealed that there was a “quiet visit by Indian officials to speak with the Taliban”. Jaishankar called on the international community to ensure zero tolerance for terrorism by immediate dismantling of terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries and disruption of their supply chains. The statement comes after Jaishankar stopped over twice in a week in Doha, the venue for peace talks with the Taliban. Ministry of External Affairs officials said he met the Qatari Foreign Minister and the NSA, besides US Special Representative on Afghanistan reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad. The MEA did not comment on reports about the meeting between Indian officials and the Taliban. India’s call to crack down on violence and terrorism, including the cross-border variety, comes ahead of Friday’s meeting between US President Joe Biden with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, who also underline this point. As a starting point, Jaishankar said the international community must press for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire because intra-Afghan talks have not resulted in reduction of violence in Afghanistan. On the contrary, violence has only increased, especially after May 1. Reiterating his call for “double peace” — peace within and around Afghanistan — he said the negotiating parties are yet to tangibly demonstrate a commitment to engage in good faith and eschew the path to find a military solution. “Any political settlement in Afghanistan must ensure that the gains of the last two decades are protected, and not reversed by preserving the constitutional democratic framework and ensuring the protection of rights of women, children and minorities,” he said. “It is equally important to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country. Those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-in-touch-with-taliban-amid-afghan-peace-process-272485

The government must prepare now for infrastructure, essential medicines and beds,” Rahul said, adding that though he believed that Covid deaths were five to six times higher than the official data, it would not help anyone to talk about the issue now.In a swipe at PM Narendra Modi, who had become emotional in one of his addresses on Covid, Rahul said, “The PM’s tears did not save the lives of those who died, but oxygen may have saved them.”Rahul termed yesterday’s record 88 lakh Covid vaccine dose delivery as “good” saying he hoped the government would sustain the momentum and vaccinate on war footing to ensure protection from viral mutations.Irani asked, “Where did second wave start? — Congress-ruled states. Which states had huge percentage of India’s cases and deaths? Congress-ruled states. Highest fatality rate — Congress-ruled states.”BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra accused the Congress of playing politics on Covid management and asked why Rahul did not take the jab when he became eligible after April 1 and if Priyanka Vadra and her family have taken the shots.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prepare-for-3rd-wave-vaccinate-on-war-footing-rahul-272486

It was apolitical,” NCP leader Majeed Memon said.Memon said all like-minded parties had been invited to discuss the challenges confronting the country, including unemployment, “attack” on institutions, Covid “mismanagement” and petrol and diesel price rise. “We had called some Congress leaders too,” Memon said.Also in attendance were former JDU leader Pawan Verma, KTS Tulsi, lyricist Javed Akhtar, among several intellectuals.Verma also said the Rashtra Manch had been holding open-ended “apolitical discussions” on a range of issues since it was founded. The meeting at Pawar’s residence has triggered talks of a possible realignment of opposition forces ahead of 2024 General Election. The meeting came a day after Pawar met poll strategist Prashant Kishor here. Earlier today, the NCP national executive also met at Pawar’s house to discuss various issues and party policies.Congress veteran and former Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath called on Pawar at the latter’s residence this evening.Sources close to Pawar said Nath had requested an audience with the NCP supremo whenever the latter was in the city. “Pawar had undergone a surgery. Kamal Nath has been wanting to see him ever since. It was a courtesy call,” sources close to Pawar said, downplaying any political nuance to the meeting, held hours after Pawar hosted opposition leaders at his house. —TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/seven-oppn-parties-attend-pawar-meet-cong-gives-it-a-miss-272510
23-06-2021||New Delhi||22 cases of Delta Plus variant of Covid found in Maharashtra, MP, Kerala: Centre||Twenty-two cases of the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus have been detected in India, with 16 of them being reported from Maharashtra and the remaining from Madhya Pradesh and Kerala, the government said on Tuesday.India is among the 10 countries where the Delta Plus mutation has been found so far, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press briefing.A statement issued by the Union Health Ministry stated INSACOG had informed that the Delta Plus variant, "currently a variant of concern (VOC)", has these characteristics—increased transmissibility, stronger binding to receptors of lung cells and potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response.Besides India, the Delta Plus variant has been found in the US, UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, China and Russia.The Delta variant is found in 80 countries around the world, including India, and it is a variant of concern, Bhushan said.Detection of multiple Covid variants puts Jharkhand on high alarmCases of the Delta Plus variant have been detected in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri and Jalgaon and parts of Kerala and Madhya Pradesh."Any variant's transmissibility and virulence decides whether it is a variant of concern or interest. Delta variant is found in 80 countries around the world, including India and it is a variant of concern. "Delta Plus variant has been detected in nine countries besides India. In India, 22 cases of Delta Plus variant have been found and it is in the category of variant of interest, (and) not yet in the category of variant of concern," Bhushan said at the briefing.He said the Health Ministry has released an advisory on the kind of public health response that Maharashtra, MP and Kerala should initiate to address this issue which "presently looks fairly small in terms of number but we would not want this to assume significant proportions".Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin shows 77.8% efficacy in Phase III trialsAccording to the Health Ministry statement, it has alerted and advised Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh to take up immediate containment measures, enhanced testing, tracking and vaccination in districts and clusters where the Delta Plus variant of COVID-19 is found."Union Health Secretary has communicated to these three states this variant has been found in genome sequenced samples from Ratnagiri and Jalgaon Districts of Maharashtra; Palakkad and Pathanamthitta Districts of Kerala; and Bhopal and Shivpuri Districts of Madhya Pradesh," the statement said.The Union Health Ministry has advised Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh that the public health response measures, while broadly remaining the same as have been implemented by them earlier, have to become more focused and effective.The chief secretaries of these states have been advised to take up immediate containment measures in the districts and clusters, including preventing crowds and intermingling of people, widespread testing, prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage on a priority basis, the statement said.They were also advised to ensure that adequate samples of positive persons are promptly sent to the designated laboratories of INSACOG so that clinical epidemiological correlations can be made for further guidance to be provided to states, the statement said.In response to a question at the press briefing, Bhushan said, "Broadly speaking, both the Indian vaccines—Covishield and Covaxin—are effective against Delta variant but to what extent and what is the proportion of antibody titers they produce, that information we would very shortly share." Bhushan further informed that INSACOG has 28 laboratories and they have sequenced 45,000 samples, of which 22 cases of delta plus variant have been found."The labs of INSACOG bring this information to the notice of Health Ministry which then in timely and prompt manner indicates to the concerned states what are the activities that have to be initiated to curb the spread. The public health response is standardised for the variants," he said.INSACOG, or Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics, was set up to conduct genome sequencing of the coronavirus.The INSACOG is tasked with not just the whole genome sequencing but also for giving timely inputs on appropriate public health response measures to be adopted by States and Union Territories.Speaking on the overall pandemic situation in the country, NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said there is a consistent improvement in the pandemic situation but stressed that people must continue to follow COVID-19-appropriate behaviour and avoid crowds and parties. Uptake of vaccination has to be increased, he said."The number of districts reporting more than 100 daily cases have shrunk to 135 from 531 (in the week ending May 20) which is reassuring and even with restrictions being eased we are able to maintain the declining pace."But with the restrictions being lifted our responsibility increases...it is in our hands to ensure that pandemic remains localised and suppressed," Paul said.Bhushan said there has been an almost 90 per cent decline in India's daily COVID-19 cases as compared to the highest peak reported on May 7.Also a sharp decline in weekly positivity rate—84 per cent decrease has been noted since the highest reported weekly positivity of 21.4 per cent recorded between May 4 and 10. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/22-cases-of-delta-plus-variant-of-covid-found-in-maharashtra-mp-kerala-centre-272433

23-06-2021||New Delhi||No tangible commitment yet to peace in Afghanistan: Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar set out India’s red lines for the settlement process in Afghanistan during a UNSC debate even as a Qatari official revealed that there was a “quiet visit by Indian officials to speak with the Taliban”.Jaishankar called on the international community to ensure zero tolerance for terrorism by immediate dismantling of terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries and disruption of their supply chains.The statement comes after Jaishankar stopped over twice in a week in Doha, the venue for peace talks with the Taliban. MEA officials said he met the Qatari Foreign Minister and the NSA besides US Special Representative on Afghanistan reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad. The MEA did not comment on reports about the meeting between Indian officials and the Taliban.India’s call to crack down on violence and terrorism, including the cross-border variety, comes ahead of Friday’s meeting between US President Joe Biden with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah who also underline this point.As a starting point, Jaishankar said the international community must press for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire because intra-Afghan talks have not resulted in a reduction of violence in Afghanistan. On the contrary, violence has only increased, especially after May 1.Reiterating his call for “double peace”’—peace within Afghanistan and peace around Afghanistan—he said the negotiating parties are yet to tangibly demonstrate a commitment to engage in good faith and eschew the path to find a military solution.Any political settlement in Afghanistan must ensure that the gains of the last two decades are protected, and not reversed by preserving the constitutional democratic framework and ensuring the protection of rights of women, children and minorities, he said.“It is equally important to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country. Those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-tangible-commitment-yet-to-peace-in-afghanistan-jaishankar-272417
23-06-2021||New Delhi||Sharad Pawar hosts meeting of opposition leaders||Leaders of several opposition parties including TMC, SP, AAP, RLD and the Left assembled at NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s residence here on Tuesday and discussed various issues facing the country, amid intense speculation about the possibility of a third front against the ruling BJP.However, leaders who took part in the discussions asserted that it was a “non-political” meeting of like-minded individuals by Rashtriya Manch that was floated by former finance minister and TMC vice-president Yashwant Sinha along with others.NCP leader Majid Menon said it was not a meeting for forming an anti-BJP front or a non-Congress front.The meeting lasted more than two hours and was attended by Omar Abdullah from National Conference, Samajwadi Party’s (SP) Ghanshyam  Tiwari, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Chaudhary, Sushil Gupta from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Binoy Viswam from the Communist Party of India (CPI), Nilotpal Basu from CPI(M) and Sinha among others.Former Congress leader Sanjay Jha and former Janata Dal (United) leader Pavan Verma also participated.Besides politicians, several eminent personalities such as Javed Akhtar, Ambassador KC Singh, Justice (retd.) AP Shah were also present at the meeting.Addressing reporters after the meeting, Menon, who is one of the founders of the Manch, said it was a non-political meeting and was not called by Sharad Pawar.“It was not an anti-BJP political front meeting called by Sharad Pawar. It was a meeting of Rashtriya Manch held at his residence. Like-minded individuals or people with the same ideology attended the meeting and there were several apolitical personalities present in the meeting,” Menon said.He also dismissed reports stating that an attempt is being made to form a non-Congress front.There is no such attempt, he said, adding five Congress MPs including Kapil Sibal, Vivek Tankha, Manish Tewari and Abhishek Manu Singhvi were invited for the meeting but due to some pressing issues, they could not attend.Similar sentiments were expressed by CPI (M) leader Basu after the meeting saying that it was an interaction among like-minded people and should not be seen as a political meeting.He said several issues such as “COVID management, ‘attack’ on institutions and unemployment, and rising inflation among others were discussed.Earlier in the day, a senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, on the condition of anonymity, said though Pawar is hosting the meeting, it has been organised by former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha who is the convenor of the Rashtra Manch.Sinha formed the Rashtra Manch, a political action group, in 2018 that targeted the BJP-led government’s policies.Octogenarian Pawar is one of the senior-most politicians in the country and enjoys a good rapport with political parties across the board.It was due to his efforts that ideologically opposite Shiv Sena and Congress joined hands along with the NCP to form government in Maharashtra.The meeting, which was attended by leaders from several non-Congress opposition parties and eminent personalities who have been critical of the Modi government, further fuelled speculation of a third front to take on the BJP-led NDA juggernaut in the elections.On Monday, poll strategist Prashant Kishor had met Pawar at his residence and the NCP had said that the Maratha strongman is trying to unite the opposition. NCP national executive meets Meanwhile, NCP's national executive also met to discuss current national issues, the party’s future policies, and its role in the 2024 Lok Sabha election.The meeting was chaired by NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and attended by party leaders Supriya Sule, Praful Patel, and Sunil Tatkare among others.The meeting, which was held at Pawar’s residence here, lasted for about two hours.The future goals of the party were discussed in detail at the meeting, Pawar said in a series of tweets in Marathi and English.“I had a detailed discussion with my committee members on our future policies, our role in the next Lok Sabha (polls) and current national issues,” he said.Among various issues, the meeting also discussed the local body elections to be held in Mumbai next year, Patel said.“The party’s work was evaluated at the meeting, which also discussed the state elections to be held next year,” the Rajya Sabha MP told reporters.Rahul Gandhi parriesCongress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday parried questions on the meeting on a possible third front, saying today is not the time to discuss politics.Gandhi, who held a virtual press conference on the pandemic situation, said he wanted to focus on Covid and how to save the country from the third wave of coronavirus which may hit soon."On the political aspect, my intention here is to bring focus on Covid. My intention here is to point clearly in the direction where we think the government should act," said the Congress leader who released a white paper of the party on Covid management."So, I am not going to distract you or myself by getting into, you know, what is going on in the politics and what is going on here and there. "There is a time and place for that discussion and I am happy to talk to you at that time," he said when asked about a meeting of opposition leaders convened at the residence of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar here. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sharad-pawar-hosts-meeting-of-opposition-leaders-272402
23-06-2021||Aditi Tandon||No need at the moment to change Covishield doses gap: Vaccine task force experts||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 22The Chairman of the national Covid Vaccine Administration task force on Tuesday said there was no need felt at the moment to revisit the Covishield doses gap of 12 to 16 weeks.Member (Health), NITI Aayog and Chairperson, National Expert Group on Vaccines Administration VK Paul today said that no need was felt at the moment to change the interval.“We are collecting data under the National Vaccine Tracking System - and doing real-time evaluation regarding effectiveness of vaccines, dose interval, region-wise impact, variants; at present, no need is felt for changing dose interval of COVISHIELD. The basic principle is that our people should get the maximum benefit from every dose of the vaccine. We find that the current dosages are proving to be beneficial,” he said.Paul added that at the same time, nothing was set in stone.NK Arora, chairman of the National Technical Advisory group on Immunization also said at the moment there was no cause to change the gap.The experts said India has the capacity to administer 1.25 crore doses a day and 22 crore doses were available for July.“The target is to start inoculating over 1 crore people a day,” Arora said.“Our aim is to vaccinate at least one crore people every day. Our capacity is such that we will easily be able to administer 1.25 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine every day,”Arora said that this target was especially achievable in the wake of good support from private sector and this was proved on the very first day when revised guidelines came into force.Speaking how India has been successful in the past as well, Arora said: “This is not unprecedented. In one week, we give polio vaccines to around 17 crore children. So, when India decides to do something, we are able to achieve it.” India's COVID-19 vaccination drive is becoming a prime example of how public and private sectors can join together to better address and solve problems faced by the nation.”Asked to comment on whether or not a third wave will occur Paul said it is in our hands.“The third wave can be stopped if COVID Appropriate Behaviour is followed and majority of people get vaccinated. Why will there be a third wave if we follow COVID Appropriate Behaviour and get ourselves vaccinated? There are many countries where even second wave has not arrived; if we follow COVID appropriate behaviour, this period will pass."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-need-at-the-moment-to-change-covishield-doses-gap-vaccine-task-force-experts-272368
