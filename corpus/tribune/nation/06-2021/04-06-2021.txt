The special leave petition is, accordingly, dismissed.”    At the outset, Justice Shah said, “We have gone through the case files and the orders of the high court. We can say that the police have done absolutely nothing in the matter. Then Munger SP is a relative of member of the ruling party in Bihar. That’s why nothing was done and the case was transferred to CID. You must comply with the order”.Justice Shah further said, “We have gone through the order. It is well reasoned order which does not call for any interference. He was a young boy who had his entire life before him”.Advocate Manish Kumar, appearing for Bihar government, vehemently opposed the observations and said that he is not challenging the order but is against Rs 10 lakh compensation at this stage, when there is no clear cut finding that whether the youth was a victim or an accused, as firearms were found in the procession.He said that the procession was illegal as permission was granted for immersion of idols till October 25 but they took out the procession on October 26, last year.“Several firearms, bullets and cartridges were found at the site of the clash and we don’t know at this time whether he was shot by police firing or he was shot by someone else in the mob,” Kumar said.He said that nowadays protests are happening whether it’s farm law protests or anti-CAA protests and if police officers are asked to pay for compensation to rioters, then they will refrain from taking any action.Kumar said that the high court is supervising the investigation and till concrete findings are there, the state may not be directed to pay for compensation and that part of the high court be stayed.The Bench said that besides monitoring the investigation, the high court is also looking into the role of police officials in the matter.

The state government has already cancelled the class 10 board examination, conducted by the Board of Secondary Education.The Karnataka government announced that the SSLC or class 10 examination will be held in the third week of next month while cancelling the second year pre-university course (PUC) exams this year in view of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.The PUC second year students will be promoted to the next level and the grading will be based on their performance in the first PUC exam."The SSLC  exam will have one multi-choice question paper for mathematics, science and social science and one more question paper for languages," Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar said.The multi-choice question paper bearing 40 marks will be easy and straight and there will not be any indirect questions, he said.Kumar said there will be a supplementary examination for those students who are affected by Covid-19.

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre asks states to set up special search committees to find ‘unsung heroes’ for Padma awards||The Centre has asked all states to set up special search committees to find out talented people who could be nominated for Padma awards but so far have been left out of consideration despite their exceptional contributions.The Narendra Modi government has been honouring many “unsung heroes”, who are contributing to society in different ways, with Padma awards.The letter from the Union Home Ministry to chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories was sent as the Central government opened the window for receiving applications on the online portal ‘padmaawards.gov.in’ from June 1 to September 15 for the Padma awards to be announced on the eve of Republic Day 2022.The Home Ministry said it has been observed in the past that while nominations are received in respect of a large number of people, there could be several talented persons who are left out of consideration despite exceptional contribution in their field.Often many such persons may get overlooked primarily for the reason that they may not seek publicity or attention in the public domain, it said.“It is, therefore, requested to make concerted efforts in identifying such persons whose excellence and achievements deserve to be recognised and make suitable nominations in their favour. It goes without saying that recognition of such deserving persons will only add to the prestige of these awards.“In the above background, I request you to kindly send suitable nominations for the Padma awards to be announced on the occasion of Republic Day, 2022. In this regard, it is suggested that you may constitute a Special Search Committee for identifying, considering and finalising your recommendations or nominations,” the letter by Home Ministry Joint Secretary RK Singh said.The states were told that while finalising recommendations, they should keep in mind that the persons recommended are pre-eminently worthy of the awards, looking at their lifetime achievements.The criteria for selection should invariably be ‘excellence plus’ and the highest standards should be applied while recommending persons for these awards. The existence of an element of public service in the achievements of the person recommended for the award would be a desirable factor.As the Padma awards are the second-highest civilian award of the country, it should also be considered whether the recommended person has earlier been given any national award or a state award in his or her field, the letter said.Efforts may be made to identify talented persons from among women, weaker sections of the society, SCs and STs, and ‘divyangs’ who deserve to be considered for the award.The decoration is normally not conferred posthumously. However, in highly deserving cases, the government could consider giving an award posthumously if the demise of the person proposed to be honoured has been recent, say within a period of one year preceding the Republic Day on which it is proposed to announce the award, it said.A higher category of Padma awards can be considered in respect of a person who has earlier been conferred an award, provided a period of at least five years has elapsed. However, in exceptionally deserving cases, a relaxation can also be considered.Government servants, including those working with PSUs, except doctors and scientists, are not eligible for the Padma awards.The nominations or recommendations should contain all relevant details specified in the format available on the portal, including a citation in narrative form (maximum 800 words), clearly bringing out the distinguished and exceptional achievements or service of the person recommended in his or her respective fields or discipline.While recommending a person online, it should be ensured that all the necessary details are properly filled.The Padma awards—Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri—are among the highest civilian awards of the country.The award seeks to recognise ‘work of distinction’ and is given for distinguished and exceptional achievements or service in all fields or disciplines, such as art, literature and education, sports, medicine, social work, science and engineering, public affairs, civil service, trade and industry among others.All persons without distinction of race, occupation, position or sex are eligible for these awards.Apart from the state governments, Union Territory administrations, central ministries, NGOs and individuals themselves can send their nominations for the Padma awards.

His accomplices Sharad and Shilpi were sentenced to 20-year imprisonment in the same case. He was also convicted in a 2002 rape case and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He is also facing a rape case in Surat in Gujarat.Asaram has challenged the Rajasthan High Court order dismissing his plea for suspension of sentence to undergo treatment.“I am here for interim bail. I am an 83-year-old man serving a life term and there has been a history of medical ailments,"  senior advocate Siddharth Luthra submitted on behalf of his client, Asaram Bapu. "Give him two months to recuperate. This is the limited relief I am seeking. Today he needs holistic treatment,” he said.“We are not medical experts,” the Bench said and went on to issue notice to the Rajasthan Government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-raj-government-on-asarams-plea-for-suspension-of-sentence-for-holistic-treatment-263384

Both India and Mauritius have never acknowledged the operation, but it has been written by former Naval Intelligence officer Ranjit Rai.India has an agreement for deputing its service personnel to Mauritius’ coast guard and helicopter squadron.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-india-helped-jugnauth-263383

Shops and market spaces, however, continue to remain under curfew.According to CAIT, there are about 15 lakh traders in Delhi providing employment to about 40 lakh people, and the capital has lost a business of Rs 40,000 crore during the past two months.Recommending a system of function, CAIT said the market spaces should open every day based on a "wholesale-retail staggered timing format"."The wholesale markets should have work timings from 10 am to 4 pm, whereas the retail markets should open from 12 pm to 7 pm," the CAIT statement said."The decision to choose between wholesale and retail for classification of trade under any of the two formats, should be left open to the markets,” it said.In its letter to the government, CAIT also requested that all transport and logistics be allowed to function according to the timings of both market formats, allowing "easy movement of goods from one place to another in Delhi and also sending goods to other states rather than following the general rules of no entry". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-implement-odd-even-system-in-functioning-of-markets-traders-to-kejriwal-l-g-baijal-263376

They said that unusual deaths of 120 pigs have also been reported so far, but the cause of death is yet to be ascertained.The outbreak of various diseases including ASF, Foot-and-mouth among the animals, mostly livestock, have occurred in different states of the northeast region almost every year. After the outbreak, the northeastern states have sounded high alert and asked people, especially owners of piggeries, to refrain from bringing pigs and piglets from other states and neighbouring countries, specially from Myanmar.The northeast's annual pork business is worth around Rs 8,000-10,000 crore, with Assam being the largest supplier. Ppork is one of the most common and popular meats consumed by tribals and non-tribals in the region.According to experts, pigs are generally affected by the classical fever, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome besides ASF, which was first detected in 1921 in Kenya.

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Impact of climate change on Southwest Monsoon is showing: Experts||On eve of World Environment Day,  experts say the impact of climate change has started showing on the Southwest Monsoon on which two-third of India’s agricultural tracts depend. Back-to-back powerful cyclones Tauktae and Yaas on either side of the Indian coast not only delayed the onset of Monsoon 2021 in Kerala but also impacted its current. Monsoon arrived on the Indian mainland on June 3 against the normal onset date of June 1. Earlier the IMD had predicted its arrival on May 31, which it later changed. Experts say the formation of Yaas in the Bay of Bengal coincided with the time of onset, which “held the Monsoon wave”. GP Sharma, chief of meteorology and climate change at Skymet Weather, says Tauktae and Yaas took away “much of the kinetic energy from the water bodies, which almost ceased the weather activity in Kerala. Required wind patterns and speed were also absent.  Tauktae and Yaas put a brake on the momentum”.Sushant Puranik from the Department of Atmospheric and Space Science at the University of Pune also says that Yaas intensified rapidly due to conducive atmospheric conditions, taking away all the moisture and energy.“Winds too started concentrating over the system. As a result, the eastern arm of the Monsoon that passes through the Bay of Bengal became more powerful, while the western arm that moves through the Arabian Sea became weak. "For the onset of Monsoon, the western arm must be stronger and take the lead. As a result, there was a delay in Monsoon's arrival over Kerala".Though weathermen also say that upcoming cyclonic circulations will strengthen the current.Matthew Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, says that the global ocean has absorbed 90 per cent of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since 1970.“This has led to anomalous ocean warming in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, which in turn makes cyclones intensify rapidly. Heat is energy, and cyclones intensify rapidly by turning the potential energy stored in the ocean into kinetic energy.“The western tropical Indian Ocean has been warming for more than a century, at a rate faster than any other region of the tropical oceans and turns out to be the largest contributor to the overall trend in the global mean SSTs”.Studies indicate that frequency of extremely severe cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea has increased during the post-monsoon seasons of 1998–2018 also according to a report by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), climate models project a rise in the intensity of tropical cyclones in the North India Ocean basin during the twenty-first century. Climate change' signal to changes in SST and associated Tropical Cyclone activity might emerge sooner in the Indian Ocean as compared to other ocean basins, experts say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/impact-of-climate-change-on-southwest-monsoon-is-showing-experts-263373
04-06-2021||New Delhi||4 people arrested for robbing man at gunpoint near Delhi Cantonment||Four people were arrested for allegedly robbing a man at gunpoint near the Delhi Cantonment area here while he was headed for the airport, police said on Friday. They were identified as Amrik, Gurnam Singh, Gurmukh Singh and Manveer Singh, the police said.According to complainant Gaurav Dhiman (29), the accused robbed him of his bag and mobile phone on the night of April 22 and fled towards Gurgaon when he was going to the airport to catch a flight to Dubai, they said.Narrating the incident, the police said soon after Dhiman boarded a car arranged by his travel agent in front of a petrol pump on NH-8, four people approached the vehicle, opened its doors and hurled chili powder at the occupants, while threatening them with a gun.As the people inside the vehicle rushed out and ran towards the petrol pump, the accused took Dhiman's bags and two mobile phones, and fled towards Gurgaon in another car, the police said. There were clothes, food items, cash, 15,000 Saudi Riyal and some documents in the bag, they said. Police were able to identify one suspect as Amrik, who was then apprehended from Khayala, a senior police officer said. The other three were arrested based on information received from him, the police said.A countrymade pistol, two live cartridges, a car, 9,000 Saudi Riyal and a mobile phone were recovered from their possession, the police added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-people-arrested-for-robbing-man-at-gunpoint-near-delhi-cantonment-263368
04-06-2021||New Delhi||‘Do not propagate any religion’, court tells IMA chief in suit alleging forced conversion of Hindus||“Mazhab nahi sikhata apas mein bair rakhna,” a Delhi court said while directing IMA president JA Jayalal not to use the organisation’s platform to propagate any religion, and cautioned him that loose comment cannot be expected from a person chairing the responsible post.Additional District Judge Ajay Goel passed the order in a suit filed against Jayalal for allegedly starting a defamatory campaign against the Hindu religion “by way of promoting Christianity, in the garb of proving superiority of Allopathic medicines over Ayurveda in treatment of Covid-19 patients”.Complainant Rohit Jha stated that Jayalal is taking the umbrage of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), misusing his position and misleading the nation and its citizens in order to convert Hindu to Christian religion.Citing articles and interviews of the IMA president, Jha sought a direction from the court to restrain him from writing, speaking in media, or publishing any content which is defamatory to Hindu religion or Ayurveda.Noting that the suit seems to be an offshoot of a verbal duel with respect to Allopathy vs Ayurveda, the court said on Thursday that no injunction is required based on the assurance given by Jayalal that he will not indulge in such kind of activity.“He shall not use the platform of IMA for propagating any religion and rather shall concentrate for welfare of the medical fraternity and progress in the medical field,” the Additional District Judge directed in an order passed on June 3.He further asked him not to indulge in any activity contrary to the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India and maintain the dignity of the position chaired by him.The district judge pulled up the chief and said, “Any kind of unguarded or loose comment cannot be expected from someone chairing the responsible post. IMA is a prestigious institution...such a platform cannot be used to propagate an individual’s views on any religion.”               He also cited a couplet written by poet Mohd. Iqbal - “Mazhab Nahi Sikhata Apas Mein Bair Rakhna; Hindi Hai Hum Watan Hai Hindustan Humara; Saare Jahan se Acha Hindustan Humara [Religion does not teach us to fight against each other. We are all Indians. Our India is the best.]”      “The word Hindi in this couplet, written by a Muslim poet, does not refer to Hindus but is referred to all Hindustanis irrespective of caste, colour and religion, which is the beauty of secularism,” judge Goel said in a seven-page order.During the course of proceedings, the litigant told the court that Jayalal took advantage of his position for Chirstian missionary activities and also used the Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity to convert medical students, doctors and patients to Christianity.Rohit Jha added, “Even in the criticism of Ayurveda, defendant does not lag behind. He alleged that the Modi government believes in Ayurveda because of its cultural values and traditional belief in Hindutva. He claimed that for the last 3-4 years, efforts are being made to replace Ayurveda with modern medicine.”        Jha averred that an article of March 30, 2020 published in Nation World News read with TV debate of defendant with Baba Ramadev on various TV news channels in May 2021 have seriously disparaged and denigrated his “reputation in the society being a Hindu”.           Counsel for Jayalal, however, told the court that his client never uttered any remarks against Hinduism nor ever tried to force convert any Indian of any religion into Christianity, adding that the suit seems to have been filed at the behest of RSS.Jayalal told the court that he is not against Ayurveda but against mixopathy.This comes amidst ongoing tussle between yoga guru Ramdev and the Indian Medical Association chief after the former’s alleged comments against Covid-19 vaccination and efficacy of allopathic medicine.

04-06-2021||Chandigarh||Rules relaxed for getting medical advance in cases of serious illness, including Covid||The central government has relaxed the rules for getting medical advance without documentation from the Employees Provident Fund in cases of emergency hospitalisation on account of serious life-threatening illnesses including Covid-19.“A lump sum medical advance up to Rs 1 lakh may be granted by the authority competent to grant medical advance by relaxing the formality of estimate from the hospital treating the employee or for depositing the advance with the hospital for starting treatment,” a letter issued this week by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in the Ministry of Labour and Employment states.“This advance should be granted immediately, preferably on the same day, If it Is a working day else on Immediately succeeding working day after the receipt of application of advance without insisting for the estimate of expenditure from hospital /other documentation,” the letter adds.Stating that the procedure of getting an estimate for granting medical advance In cases of hospitalisation on account of serious life-threatening illnesses has been revisited, the ministry observed that many times it becomes imperative to get the patient Immediately admitted in hospital to save his or her life, and It is not possible to get the estimate from the hospital in such situations.“A need is felt for streamlining the advance facility for such serious in-patient’s treatment in hospital wherever family members of employees are not able to manage estimate from the hospital concerned in which such patient has been admitted in emergency Sometimes a patient employee may be in ICU where the estimate is not known in advance,” the letter said.After receipt of estimate for treatment subsequently but before the discharge of the patient from the hospital, if entitlement of medical advance is more than Rs 1 lakh, then additional advance will be sanctioned.The medical advance amount may either be credited to the salary account of the employee or can be paid to the hospital concerned directly as per the request of a family member or employee.After discharge from the hospital, the employee is required to submit bills within 45 days and the amount of advance paid would be adjusted against the final bill of the hospital as per rules and entitlement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rules-relaxed-for-getting-medical-advance-in-cases-of-serious-illness-including-covid-263361

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Tech firms' carbon emissions drop by 85% in India||While Covid-19 pandemic has been associated with negatives like illness, deaths, and drop in economic activity, it has on a positive note propelled India's $194 billion worth outsourcing technology industry towards carbon neutrality in FY 2020-21, according to a new report released on Friday.The pandemic led to an 85 per cent decrease in carbon emissions from outsourcing technology companies including IT, ITeS, engineering, GIC/GCC and startups in FY 2020-21, revealed a report by market intelligence firm UnearthInsight.The reduction means a drop in approximately 0.3 million tonnes of carbon emission from pre-pandemic levels and approximately 2 million tonnes annually.The reason for drop in carbon emissions could be attributed to factors such as Covid-induced work from home, increased adoption of digital platforms, electric vehicles (EV) and digital campus hiring platforms.In FY 2020-21, a mere $750 million were spent on travel costs, resulting from commute to work, domestic travel, and international travel, by the outsourcing industry compared to $2.9 billion in FY 2019-20. Top five IT services companies—TCS, Infosys, HCL, Wipro and Tech Mahindra—spent around $370 million on travel costs in FY21, which is 75 per cent lower compared to $1.4 billion in FY20.While today only 4 to 5 per cent of the approximately 4.4 million workforce in the outsourcing industry is travelling to work, an estimated over 20 per cent to 25 per cent employees will return back to work by early next year as global and domestic IT firms' complete vaccination of employees and families.Thus, post- pandemic (mid next year) deployment of disruptive EV along with AI transportation tech platforms will pay off as tech companies aim to move from approximately 5 per cent employee travel on EVs to over 25 per cent to 30 per cent by 2025.Significant adoption of digital tools to avoid future domestic and international travel needs with consumer-grade experience will also aid carbon neutrality, the report suggested."The outsourcing industry was on track for the adoption of hybrid working models, electric mobility even before Covid. However, the pandemic and quick adoption of digital tools/technology has dramatically changed the scenario and today carbon emission reduction looks sustainable over a longer period of time," said Gaurav Vasu, Founder and CEO, UnearthInsight, in a statement.Further, the report showed that Covid pushed large industry players to deploy technologies like digital campus hiring platforms, significantly reducing carbon emission earlier generated by travel to over 1,000 campuses across the country.By 2025, 75 per cent of campus hiring for tech industry is expected to happen through advanced end-to-end digital platforms/tools. This will force other Tier-I and Tier-II IT firms also to build digital platforms to attract graduate talent from across the country."Covid-19 disruption has made outsourcing organisations, clients' and employees' environment friendly, helping them accelerate their journey towards carbon neutrality and also digital workplace, improving operating margins in the long run. We see a greater realisation among companies on issues related to carbon emissions, hybrid workplaces and WFH policy and these are trends which will shape the future," Vasu said.The study conducted by UnearthInsight for FY 2020-21 included around 2,000 plus outsourcing technology companies in India. The findings are based on the annual reports of companies, primary research and UnearthInsight database. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tech-firms-carbon-emissions-drop-by-85-in-india-263340

The Chief Minister had assured us that we will reach home and he sticked to his promise. This shows his sensitivity towards us...We could reach home without any hassles. We extend thanks to him."The women, who had gone in a group, said they had been working in a factory in Tirussoor of Tamil Nadu for last three months. They got stranded after factory got them seated from work 15 days ago in the wake of second wave of coronavirus pandemic lockdown."Having got not any  means to return to Dumka, we made video clippings and sent these to Jharkhand government for help."Surprisingly Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren took cognisance of our plight and arranged the special coach to return", said Rubi Hansda, one of the women.The women said they did not face any problem for food and residence after being shunted out from work."Since there was no worth in staying after losing  job in factory, we decided to return Dumka till normalcy (Covid cases controlled) and will then go back to Tamil Nadu", one of them said.Chief Minister Soren directed Dumka officials to ensure work for the migrant workers.Dumka Deputy Commissioner Rajeshwari B said they will be provided work as per thier skills.Dumka DC said: "As soon as we got information about tribal migrant workers from our district getting stranded in Tiruppur, we ensured their return with the help of the Chief Minister's Office and non-profit organisations. We ensured transportation for them once they reached Dhanbad Railway station."Dhanbad district transport officer (DTO) Om Prakash, who received them at Dhanbad, said the women had reached Dhanbad in the morning at 10.30 am by Alleppey Express.After conducting Covid-19 test, they were served a food packet and sent to Dumka by three special busses under supervision of a magistrate and force, the official said.Distance between Dhanbad and Dumka is around 131 km.Besides senior officials of Dhanbad district administration, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) Tundi MLA Mathura Prasad Mahto had also reached Dhanbad railway station in the morning to receive the women."Chief minister is sensitive on these matters. As he got information about these girls he  personally took interest and arranged  special coach for bringing them back", said  Mathura Mahto.The Jharkhand government had last month rescued 26 migrant workers from the state stranded in Nepal due to a coronavirus-induced lockdown in the Himalayan country. The government had arranged a special bus to bring them back from the Nepal border.Last year after Covid-19 first lockdown, the Jharkhand government had ensured that the first "special train" transported about 1,200 workers from  Telangana to Hatia in Ranchi district.The Jharkhand government had airlifted 60 migrant workers hailing from the state from Ladakh during nationwide lockdown in May last year.The textile clusters in Tamil Nadu, are facing hardships due to lockdowns and a steep hike in yarn prices, forcing many to minimise output. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/38-jharkhand%C2%A0tribal-women-stranded-in-tamil-nadu-reach-home-263339

Revised MRPs will be informed in public domain within a week by NPPA," the Ministry said.Every retailer, dealer, hospital and institution shall display a price list as furnished by the manufacturer, on a conspicuous part of the business premises in a manner so as to be easily accessible to any person wishing to consult the same.State Drug Controllers (SDCs) have been directed to monitor the compliance of the order to prevent instances of black-marketing.With the spurt in cases under Covid 2.0 pandemic in the country, demand for Medical Oxygen has gone up considerably.Oxygen concentrator is a non-scheduled drug and presently under voluntary licensing framework of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). Its price is being monitored under the provisions of DPCO 2013.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-steps-in-to-regulate-prices-of-oxygen-concentrators-263323
04-06-2021||New Delhi||India managed Covid second wave ‘very well’; need to prepare for third wave: Niti member||India has managed the second Covid wave very well as the number of fresh cases has come down significantly, Niti Aayog Member V K Saraswat has said, even as he emphasised that preparations need to be in place to deal with the third wave that might impact the younger population more.Saraswat further said that India’s epidemiologists have made very clear indications that the third wave of Covid-19 is inevitable and is likely to start from September-October, so the country should vaccinate as many people as possible.“I think we have done reasonably well. We have managed the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic very well, as a result Covid-19 numbers have come down significantly.“... we have been able to manage (the second wave Covid-19) with the help of our science and technology activities, creating oxygen banks, making large number of industries to support oxygen supply. Using railways, using airports, using the military for transporting liquid oxygen,” he told PTI.From a daily case count of over 4 lakh, the number of new Covid-19 cases has been hovering around 1.3 lakh in the last few days.Saraswat said India’s management of the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic was good and the kind of discipline which had been introduced at that time, gave the country a lot of confidence to control the second wave of the pandemic.“We did a fantastic job (of managing the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic), what we call emergency management,” he asserted.The Niti Aayog member pointed out that all indications were there that there might be a second wave of COVID-19, but epidemiologists’ studies did not show it was going to be such a strong wave.“... activities like marriages, religious functions that took place during this time resulted in a certain amount of accelerated spread of Covid-19,” he noted.Saraswat noted that in the first wave of Covid-19, intensity was not vigorous, which indicated that the country will be able to manage the second wave with the kind of infrastructure created last year in terms of ventilators, hospital beds and ICU beds.“But in the second wave, the virus had a different characteristic which resulted in an indirect attack on lungs in a big way, which resulted in a large number of people demanding oxygen at a very early stage of infection. “So, this mutant caught us unaware. As a result, we found that we are not in a position to meet the increased demand of oxygen and some of the medicines which were needed at that particular stage,” he argued.The B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 variants of Covid-19, first identified in India, are highly infectious. The UN health agency named the B.1.617.1 variant of the Covid-19 as ‘Kappa’ while the B.1.617.2 variant was dubbed ‘Delta.Asked how prepared India is to deal with the third wave of covid-19, Saraswat said India’s epidemiologists have made very clear indications that the third wave is inevitable and might impact the younger population more.“We expect by July-August, we have to take all preparations because the third wave is likely to start from September-October onward,” he said, adding that lockdowns should be opened in a gradual manner.According to Saraswat, despite the fact that India is going to have certain relaxations on the lockdowns, severe implementation of the pandemic norms of usage of masks and maintaining the social distances should be enforced by the states in a big way.“We have to also see the infrastructure which we have also created, continues to remain in position and should be augmented further. So that we don’t run into the crisis which we ran into during the second wave as far as the oxygen availability in the country is concerned,” he said.India reported 1,32,364 new coronavirus infections taking the country’s total tally of Covid-19 cases to 2,85,74,350, while the recovery rate crossed 93 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday.

The state continues to be affected by Covid. Covid management leaves much to be desired. The required level of government involvement needed for Covid testing is also not there in Punjab. Internal factionalism has been bogging down the Congress government in Punjab for about six months. The entire party and the government have been camping in Delhi for the past four days.So who will care about the people? Disregard of the people at the altar of internal party politics is a big sin of the Congress,” Javadekar Javadekar said on Friday.He said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi should put his own house in order in the state ruled by the Congress rather than lecture others on vaccine policy.“Dangerous and disturbing reports coming out of Punjab suggest the state government got 1,40,000 Covaxin doses, which they sold to 20 private hospitals for Rs 1,060,” said the minister.He asked “What kind of people’s governance is this where the state government wants to make profits on a vaccination drive for Covid? And Punjab is charging people Rs 1,500. Government of India has given free 22 crore doses to states till now.”Javadekar said Punjab was among the states that first sought decentralisation of procurement of vaccines and now want centralisation.“They change their stand everyday. Punjab government should urgently address people’s concerns. This is the principal urge of the people of the state,” the union minister added.Back in Delhi, CM Amarinder Singh ducked questions on the subject as he met the AICC panel on Punjab issues.It was later, Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said that his department does not deal with vaccine procurement or distribution.It is under the Chief Secretary or Covid Vaccine Nodal Officer Vikas Garg.He said that the health department only tests the quality of vaccine and then administers to public.

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Defence Ministry okays Rs 43,000 crore tender for 6 more submarines||The Ministry of Defence on Friday okayed the proposal to issue a formal tender for a Rs 43,000 crore project to construct six new-generation stealth conventional submarines in India.A foreign manufacturer will tie up with an Indian partner under what is termed as ‘strategic partnership (SP) model’ to make these under-sea vessels for nearly $ 5.8 Billion. The SP model entails foreign manufacturers working in India at the facility of its Indian partner.India has asked for submarines, that will run on a mix of Diesel-electric power, to have air-independent propulsion (AIP). An AIP adds to be submergence capabilities, allowing the submarine to dive for 12-15 days, much more than the 4-5 days endurance of conventional subs.The Indian Navy would have the option to manufacture six more submarines under the project.The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, okayed the move. The DAC is the apex decision making body of the MoD. The case will go to the Cabinet Committee on Security for formal ratification. Known as the ‘project 75-India’, the DAC okayed the next step that is Request for Proposal (RFF) for the submarines.Under the procurement rule of the MoD, the RFP is the second stage of the tendering process. This will be followed by technical evaluation of bids, cost evaluation and negotiations, technology transfer on offer, before a contract is signed.The Ministry of Defence owned shipyard Mazagon Docks (MDL) and Larsen & Turbo (L&T) have been shortlisted among bidders. The latter is a private entity and is engaged in making the hulls of the Arihant Class of Indian strategic submarines.Both will have a tie-up of their own with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) from the five makers short-listed by the MoD earlier.The five foreign companies in the race are South Korean company Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, The Naval Group of France, Navantia of Spain, ThysenKrupp Marine Systems of Germany and the Rosboronexport of Russia.The Naval group in collaboration with the MDL is already making six conventional submarines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-ministry-okays-rs-43-000-crore-tender-for-6-more-submarines-263309
04-06-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to cancel anticipatory bail of TV journalist accused of rape||The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition seeking cancellation of anticipatory bail given by the Delhi High Court to Mumbai-based TV journalist Varun Hiremath—accused of raping a 22-year-old woman in the National Capital.“We find no reason to interfere. The special leave petition is dismissed,” said a Bench led by Justice Navin Sinha, rejecting the complainant’s petition challenging the May 13 order of the Delhi High Court granting pre-arrest bail to Hiremath."If a man and woman are in a room, the man makes a request and the woman complies with it, do we need to say anything more at this stage?" the Bench—which also included Justice Ajay Rastogi—told senior advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, who represented the complainant.The Bench, however, made it clear its observation was purely for the purpose of deciding the question of bail only.The complainant alleged that she was raped by the accused at a five-star hotel in Chanakyapuri on February 20.Based on her complaint, an FIR under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) was registered at the Chanakyapuri Police Station here.Ramakrishnan contended that the accused had earlier absconded for 50 days to evade the non-bailable warrant and that had not faced custodial interrogation even for a day despite not co-operating the investigation.However, the counsel for the accused had claimed before the trial court that there was a history of the sexual relationship between the complainant and the journalist.He had highlighted WhatsApp and Instagram chats between the complainant and the accused before the trial court “in order to show the love and passion between them”.The trial court, while rejecting his anticipatory bail plea on March 12, had said consent can’t be implied from the complainant’s previous experiences with the accused and if the woman stated in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-cancel-anticipatory-bail-of-tv-journalist-accused-of-rape-263308

04-06-2021||New Delhi||PM hails Indian scientists for developing vaccine against Covid-19||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lauded Indian scientists developing made-in-India vaccine against Covid and boosting other measures to fight the pandemic within a year of its outbreak.Addressing a meeting of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Society via video conferencing, he cited India’s experience in the previous century to say that it used to wait for years to lay its hands on innovations achieved abroad, but its scientists are now working shoulder to shoulder with their counterparts outside.They are working at the same quick pace, he said.Noting that the world is grappling with the biggest challenge in a century, the prime minister praised the scientific community, saying it is perhaps unprecedented that vaccines were prepared within a year.On the occasion, Modi reiterated his call for an “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-reliant) and strong India, saying the Covid-19 crisis may have slowed its pace but our resolve remains the same.India wants to be self-reliant in a number of sectors, ranging from agriculture to astronomy, disaster management to defence technology, vaccine to virtual reality, and biotechnology to battery technology, he asserted.He said India is now showing the way to the world in sustainable development and clean energy, and is playing an important role in progress in other countries with its role in software and satellite development.

04-06-2021||Kolkata||4 Bengal leaders appear before CBI court in Narada case||Four senior leaders, facing trial in the Narada case, appeared before the special CBI judge at a court in Kolkata on Friday.Judge Anupam Mukerjee had on April 17, while ordering interim bail to the four leaders, directed them to physically appear before the court on June 4.State ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, TMC MLA Madan Mitra and former city mayor Sovan Chatterjee appeared before the judge and left the Bankshall court premises after a while.Judge Mukherjee said that the next date for the hearing of the matter will be fixed later in the day.A five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court granted interim bail on May 28 to the four leaders, who were arrested on May 17 by the CBI, which is investigating the Narada sting tape case on an order of the high court.The special CBI court had granted them bail on that day itself, but the order was stayed by the high court, which remanded them to judicial custody.Production of the four before the special CBI court was held virtually on May 17 as the investigating agency claimed it was unable to produce the accused in court physically owing to protests outside its office at Nizam Palace by a mob of 2,000-3,000 people.Chargesheet in the Narada sting case was also submitted against the accused before the special court on that day.The special court, granting interim bail, had fixed the next date of hearing on June 4, when the accused were to appear before it.They were placed under house arrest on May 21 by a division bench of the high court, which modified its earlier stay on interim bail granted to the four leaders by the special CBI court.The matter was referred to a larger bench of five judges after the judges of a division bench presided by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal differed on granting interim bail to the four accused.

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt, students appeal in HC against order allowing pvt schools to charge annual fees||Several appeals, including one by the AAP government, have been moved in the Delhi High Court against its single judge's decision allowing private unaided recognised schools to collect annual and development charges from students for the period after the lockdown ended in the national capital last year.The petitions moved on behalf of the students studying in the private unaided schools have contended that the single judge's May 31 decision was based on incorrect facts and law.The single judge, in his May 31 judgment, had quashed two office orders of April and August 2020 issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government forbidding and postponing collection of annual charges and development fees, saying they were "illegal" and "ultra vires" the powers of the respondent (DoE) stipulated under the Delhi School Education (DSE) Act and the Rules.The single judge had said that the Delhi government has no power to indefinitely postpone collection of annual charges and development fees by private unaided schools as it would unreasonably restrict their functioning.The Delhi government, in its appeal, filed through its standing counsel Santosh K Tripathi, has contended that its orders of April and August last year were issued in larger public interest as due to the lockdown people were in financial crisis.The DoE has contended that "charging fees is not the only source of augmenting the income" and therefore, any observation to the contrary will not only be prejudicial to the interest of the private unaided schools, but it will be difficult to regulate them. The DoE has said schools, if unregulated, will determine their own fee structure "as per their whims and fancies" and therefore, it was duty bound to not allow any other head of fees other than those necessary to be charged as 'fees'.The appeals on behalf of the students have claimed that establishment costs, like repairing of buildings, administrative expenses, rent and hostel expenses, are not applicable when the schools are closed.They have also contended that the charging of annual and development fees was only deferred and not stopped and the schools could have charged the same once the pandemic situation normalised.The pleas on behalf of the students and that filed by DoE have also contended that the conditions imposed by the Supreme Court on Indian School, Jodhpur vs. State of Rajasthan, could not have been made applicable to Delhi, as the education laws in both states are different.The single judge had said that schools shall collect annual fees with a deduction of 15 per cent as was allowed by the apex court in the Indian School case.The single judge had also said the amount payable by the students have to be paid in six monthly instalments from June 10.The other directions of the apex court, that were incorporated in the May 31 judgement, were -- it would be open to the schools to give further concession to their students or to evolve a different pattern for giving concession, management shall not debar any student from attending online classes or physical classes or withhold exam results on account of non-payment of fees and students name for Board exams shall also not be withheld over non-payment of fees/arrears.The May 31 decision had come on the plea moved by Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, which represents 450 private unaided schools, through advocate Kamal Gupta.The organisation had challenged the two office orders of April and August last year of the DoE on grounds that they curtail the rights of the private unaided recognized schools to fix their own fees.The organisation had also contended that to restrict the collection of fee to certain heads or amounts was illegal and without any authority or jurisdiction.It had also said that the DoE has limited jurisdiction to regulate fees, that too only to prevent commercialisation and profiteering.

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Petrol crosses Rs 100/litre mark in Leh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana||After Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, petrol price has crossed the Rs 100-per-litre mark in Leh, in almost all districts of Andhra Pradesh and parts of Telangana after fuel prices were again hiked on Friday.Petrol price was increased by 27 paise per litre and diesel by 28 paise a litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.The hike - 18th in the last one month - took fuel prices across the country to a historic high.In Delhi, petrol hit an all-time high of Rs 94.76 a litre, while diesel is now priced at Rs 85.66 per litre.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges.Petrol price is well above the Rs 100-per-litre mark in all districts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - the states which levy the highest value-added tax (VAT) in the country.Retail prices have risen after an increase in international oil prices on investors' optimism that improving demand and a dwindling supply glut may mean the market can absorb any additional production from OPEC and its allies.Brent crude - the global oil-price benchmark, has risen above USD 71 per barrel for the first time in two years.Following the relentless price increase, fuel rates in places like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Leh have witnessed unprecedented levels.Petrol is sold at over Rs 100 per litre in almost all districts of Andhra Pradesh, except Vizag where it costs 99.75 a litre. Diesel in Vizag is priced at Rs 94.08 per litre.In Telangana, petrol prices crossed the psychological level in Adilabad (Rs 100.57) and Nizamabad (Rs 100.17).Petrol costs Rs 100.43 a litre in Leh.Rajasthan levies the highest VAT on petrol and diesel in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Mumbai on May 29, became the first metro in the country where petrol was being sold at over Rs 100-a-litre mark. Petrol now costs Rs 100.98 per litre in the city and diesel comes for Rs 92.99.At Bellary, in Karnataka petrol is being sold at Rs 99.83 per litre. In Bengaluru, petrol is priced at Rs 97.98 per litre and diesel at Rs 90.87.The increase on Friday is the 18th increase in prices since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 18 increases, petrol price has risen by Rs 4.36 per litre and diesel by Rs 4.93 a litre.Rates are at the highest in the country in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan where petrol comes for Rs 105.81 a litre and diesel for Rs 98.64 per litre. Madhya Pradesh's Shahdol district has petrol priced at Rs 105.18 a litre and diesel at Rs 96.31.Oil companies revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15-days, and foreign exchange rates.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, earlier this week agreed to continue relaxing curbs on oil production, signalling their confidence in improving oil demand and a drop in the global supply glut.The rollout of vaccines is helping governments to reduce coronavirus restrictions and resume more normal economic activity. That will help pare global oil stocks - which at one point last year threatened to overwhelm the world's ability to store them.

04-06-2021||New Delhi||US plays catch-up with Russia, China in vaccine exports to world||The US on Friday said the Quad’s plans for increased manufacturing capacity of vaccines in India "has the potential to be a game-changer well beyond India’s borders’’.The plans for stepping up vaccine manufacturing capacity in India is part of a three-pronged strategy by the White House to catch up with Russia and China that have already exported about 50 crore and 30 crore doses of vaccines, respectively. The US on Thursday announced plans to send 8 crore vaccines by June-end, of which it announced the region-wise distribution of 2.5 crore vaccines, some of which will be shipped to India."Virtually no element of Indian society has been left untouched by this horrible, horrible scourge. And so that is why we have – even before this announcement today, spoken of the focus on increased manufacturing in India but also the bilateral support that we have provided to India as a means to help the country address this. $ 500 million – has been put towards this, including by the U.S. Government,’’ said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price.Of the 8 crore vaccines that the US will ship to other countries, 6 crore AstraZeneca doses are awaiting FDA approval, with the remaining 2 crore combinations having cleared the required formalities.The US has so far announced the vaccine shares per region but not the specific number of doses per country. The vaccines "will be going out the door imminently, ’’ said Price but there was no timeline because "there are logistical challenges associated with this, but we are moving as quickly as we can in an effort to get these vaccines to their destination countries as soon as we can.’"Price said the first thrust of America’s vaccine strategy was on increasing production domestically so that the country was confident in meeting domestic vaccine supply requirements as well as meet the pledge of sharing 8 crore vaccines with the rest of the world by the end of June.The second thrust is to increase manufacturing capacity abroad in a partnership that the Quad countries have developed, including in the context of India and the increased manufacturing capacity there.The third prong is dose sharing, which Price detailed a bit more. Of the first 2.5 crore, 75 % will go to the UN-led COVAX initiative of supplying vaccines to poor countries. The remaining 25 % will go directly to countries including India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-plays-catch-up-with-russia-china-in-vaccine-exports-to-world-263279

04-06-2021||Washington||India will be a ‘significant recipient’ of US vaccines, says envoy Sandhu||India will be a “significant recipient” of US vaccines, the country’s envoy here has said as President Joe Biden announced details of his administration’s decision to send 25 million Covid-19 shots to countries across the globe.US President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced that the US will allocate 75 per cent -- nearly 1.9 crore of the first tranche of 2.5 crore doses -- of unused Covid-19 vaccines from its stockpile through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme to countries in South and Southeast Asia as well as Africa.The move is part of his administration’s framework for sharing 80 million (8 crore) vaccines globally by the end of June.According to a White House fact sheet, nearly 19 million vaccines will be shared through COVAX.Of these approximately six million for South and Central America to the following countries: Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Haiti, and other Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, as well as the Dominican Republic.Approximately seven million for Asia to the following countries: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and the Pacific Islands, it said.“India will be a significant recipient of US vaccines as India has been included in both the identified categories in the allocation announced today- direct supply to neighbours and partner countries, and under the COVAX initiative,” India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, told PTI.Vice President Kamala Harris personally made a call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to inform him about the administration’s decision. “I deeply appreciate the assurance of vaccine supplies to India as part of the US Strategy for Global Vaccine Sharing. I also thanked her for all the support and solidarity from the US government, businesses and Indian diaspora,” the prime minister said in a tweet.Officials in New Delhi said that Modi and Harris discussed ongoing efforts to strengthen the health supply chain between the US and India, including in the area of vaccine manufacturing. They highlighted the potential of the India-US partnership as well as the QUAD vaccine initiative in addressing the long-term health impact of the pandemic.The prime minister also said he hopes to welcome Vice President Harris in India soon after the normalisation of the global health situation.Sandhu described the phone call as “an important conversation” focusing on vaccines, post-Covid global health and economic recovery.“The removal of the Defence Production Act priority ratings would further strengthen vaccine supply chains including for manufacturers AstraZeneca and Novavax,” Sandhu said, reflecting on other important decisions taken by the Biden administration.“These developments are reflective of the firm commitment of the leadership of both India and US to work in partnership on global issues,” Sandhu told PTI.Sandhu on Thursday also had a substantive discussion with Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy.“We discussed India – US cooperation to contain the global pandemic, including in vaccines, and potential collaborations to ensure affordable healthcare,” the Ambassador said in a tweet.India is currently witnessing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, the country has recorded over 2,84,41,986 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 3,37,989 deaths.The Biden administration had been under pressure to send the excess COVID-19 vaccines with the US to nations like India, which are facing severe vaccine shortages. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who visited the US last month, also said that the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines were an important part of his discussions in the US.He also said the endeavour was to expand the production of vaccines in India with assistance from the United States.

Of the total wheat, 411.12 LMT, purchased till June 2, Punjab has contributed 132.27 LMT (32.17 per cent), which is an all-time high, Haryana 84.93 LMT (20.65 per cent), and Madhya Pradesh 128.08 LMT (31.15 per cent). Chandra said close to 97 per cent of this grain was under scientific storage.Being key producers, Punjab and Haryana “face a temporary issue of unscientific storage for a few days. “Around 3.5 per cent of the grain is under temporary storage, all in Punjab and Haryana,” he said.“Punjab and Haryana see a great volume of offloading in a short span of time, unlike other grain-producing states. This is temporary storage, and in the first instance, the grain is moved to a place where it is safe. It is a small quantity compared to the amount of grain storage. “The issue is going to be resolved before July-end to make it 100 per cent scientific storage across the country, including in Punjab and Haryana,” Chandra said. Grains under unscientific storage include around 19.6 LMT in Punjab and 9.4 LMT in Haryana, around 29 LMT (3.5 per cent) of the 880 LMT in all, according to the FCI CMD.Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said the previous record for wheat procurement was 389.92 lakh tonnes last year. “We have revised the target to 432.5 lakh tonnes,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/29-lmt-grain-in-unscientific-storage-all-in-punjab-haryana-263087
04-06-2021||---||Digital tax row: US suspends additional tariffs on India||The US has backtracked from imposing penalties on six countries, including India, for introducing the digital services tax (DST) which it felt targeted its social media giants.The US has decided to opt for negotiations for the next six months with these countries to work out a satisfactory solution. Making the announcement, US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai said the plan for retaliatory tariffs on some goods from six countries would be suspended till November 29 to provide additional time to complete the ongoing multilateral negotiations on international taxation at the OECD and in the G20 process.“The US is focused on finding a multilateral solution to a range of key issues related to international taxation. It remains committed to reaching a consensus through the OECD and G20 processes. Today’s actions provide time for those negotiations to continue while maintaining the option of imposing tariffs if warranted in the future,’’ said Tai in a statement. The USTR holds that the DST is discriminatory and burdens US commerce. In March, Tai was unmoved by the arguments from Commerce Minister Piyush Goel. A day after their meeting, the USTR had said it would impose higher import duties on 45 categories of Indian imports equal to the $55 million that New Delhi presumably earned from imposing 2 per cent DST. Indian imports that would have faced higher duties would have been seafood, bamboo products, semi-precious and precious stones, furniture, cork and cigarette papers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/digital-tax-row-us-suspends-additional-tariffs-on-india-263096

Local producers – Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech – are yet to scale up in the face of massive demand. The government said the proposal of Biological-E was recommended for approval after due deliberation by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC).“...Biological-E Covid vaccine candidate has been supported by the Government of India from ‘preclinical stage to Phase-3 studies’,” government sources said.Adult vaccination was opened too soon on May 1, derailing the previously ongoing programme to inoculate priority groups.In the 18 to 44 year category, nearly 3 crore doses have been administered so far.

Those offences, going by the allegations in the FIR and other attending circumstances, are not made out at all and any prosecution in respect thereof would be violative of the rights of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution,” a Bench headed by Justice UU Lalit said.Had flayed govt on YouTube showThe Bench, which had reserved its verdict on October 6 last year, said: “We have quashed the proceedings and the FIR. Every journalist will be entitled to protection under the Kedar Nath Singh judgment (on sedition).” While upholding the validity of Section 124A of the IPC (sedition), a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had in Kedar Nath Singh case (1962) restricted the scope of the law by saying that its application should be limited to “acts involving intention or tendency to create disorder, or disturbance of law and order; or incitement to violence”.The Bench, however, rejected Dua’s prayer for setting up of a high-level committee in each state for prior vetting of sedition charges against journalists of 10-year standing, saying that “it will be directly encroaching upon the legislative domain”.The Shimla FIR was registered at the instance of a BJP leader, who filed a criminal complaint against Dua, accusing him of instigating violence against the government by allegedly spreading fake news.Quoting from its verdict in the Kedar Nath Singh case, the top court said, “A citizen has a right to say or write whatever he likes about the government, or its measures, by way of criticism or comment, so long as he does not incite people to violence against the government established by law or with the intention of creating public disorder.”It said, “It’s only when the words or expressions have pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order that Sections 124A…of the IPC must step in.”Referring to Dua’s alleged seditious statements, the Bench said they could “at best be termed as expression of disapprobation of actions of the government and its functionaries so that the prevailing situation could be addressed quickly.”“They were certainly not made with the intent to incite people or showed a tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace. The petitioner was within the permissible limits laid down in the decision of this court in the Kedar Nath Singh case,” it said while quashing the FIR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-junks-sedition-case-against-dua-upholds-right-to-criticise-263015

04-06-2021||New Delhi||US suspends retaliatory duties for India's digital tax||The US has backtracked from imposing penalties on six countries, including India, for introducing the digital services tax (DST), that it felt targeted its social media giants.The US has decided to opt for negotiations for the next six months with these countries to work out a satisfactory solution.Making the announcement, US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai said the plan for retaliatory tariffs on some goods from six countries will be suspended till November 29 to provide additional time to complete the ongoing multilateral negotiations on international taxation at the OECD and in the G20 process. "The US is focused on finding a multilateral solution to a range of key issues related to international taxation. The US remains committed to reaching a consensus through the OECD and G20 processes. Today’s actions provide time for those negotiations to continue while maintaining the option of imposing tariffs if warranted in the future," said Tai in a statement.The USTR holds that the DST is discriminatory and burdens US commerce.In March, Tai was unmoved by the arguments from Commerce Minister Piyush Goel. A day after their meeting, USTR had said it will impose higher import duties on 45 categories of Indian imports equal to the $ 55 million that New Delhi presumably earns from imposing two per cent DST.Indian imports that would have faced higher duties would have been seafood, bamboo products, semi-precious and precious stones, furniture, cork and cigarette papers.Even at that time, Tai had favoured a global consensus on international tax issues.In a Trump era decision, the USTR had investigated 10 jurisdictions. Four—Brazil, Czech, EU and Indonesia—were let off because they had not implemented DST.The USTR put the remaining six—India, Austria, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the UK—on notice as they had already operationalised DST.The latest USTR order suspends any retaliation against them till November 29 while it negotiates the question of DST in multilateral fora, as was suggested by Goel to the USTR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-suspends-retaliatory-duties-for-indias-digital-tax-262912

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Antigua and Barbuda prefers repatriation of Choksi from Dominica to India directly: Local media||Antigua and Barbuda prefers that fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi be repatriated from Dominica to India directly, the Cabinet of the Caribbean island country decided in a meeting, local media reported.The Cabinet minutes published by the media outlet show that “Choksi matter” was one of the agenda items discussed during the meeting on Wednesday where it was held that Choksi is now a “problem” of Dominica and if he comes back to Antigua and Barbuda the “problem reverts” to it.READ ALSOMehul Choksi denied bail over illegal entry in DominicaIndia steadfast in resolve to bring fugitives back to country: MEA on Mehul Choksi issueThe meeting chaired by Prime Minister Gaston Browne and attended by all his ministers physically and virtually decided that law enforcement officials will continue to gather intelligence in the circumstances of Choksi’s “departure” from Antigua, media outlet Antigua Breaking News said.“The preference of the Cabinet of Antigua and Barbuda is for Choksi to be repatriated to India from Dominica,” the Cabinet minutes said.Choksi had mysteriously gone missing on May 23 from Antigua and Barbuda where he was staying since 2018 as a citizen.He was detained in neighbouring island country Dominica for illegal entry after a possible romantic escapade with his rumoured girlfriend.His lawyers alleged that he was kidnapped from Jolly Harbour in Antigua by policemen looking like Antiguan and Indian and brought to Dominica on a boat.A Dominica High Court is hearing a Habeas Corpus petition filed on behalf of Choksi challenging his illegal detention.He was also brought before Roseau Magistrate, on the orders of High Court, to answer charges of illegal entry where he pleaded not guilty but was denied bail.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi had fled India in the first week of January, 2018 weeks before Rs 13,500 crore scam in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) rocked the Indian banking industry.The duo allegedly bribed the officials of the state-run bank to get Letters of Undertaking on the basis of which they availed loans from overseas banks which remained unpaid.The allegedly corrupt officials did not enter these LoUs in the core banking software of the PNB thus evading any scrutiny.The non-payment of these LoUs or bank guarantees worth Rs 13,500 crore resulted in default and became a liability on the bank.Modi escaped to Europe and was finally held in London where he is contesting his extradition to India while Choksi took citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 where he had been staying since his escape from Delhi.
