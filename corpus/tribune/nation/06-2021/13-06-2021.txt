One of our members has said phone calls of two-three legislators are being tapped. In such a situation, he should meet and inform the chief minister about it,” Khachariyawas told reporters here.He said the Congress government worked as a model government in the country during the coronavirus pandemic and such statement given by any legislator is not justified.Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, who belongs the Sachin Pilot camp, had Saturday alleged that some legislators have talked about their phones being tapped.Without naming the MLAs, Solanki said the legislators also fear of being trapped by various agencies.

Askar Ali told IANS that the Administrator is reaching on Monday and will continue to stay there till Sunday. "He will be reviewing a slew of projects in power sector, hospitals, and schools at the Agatti, Kavaratti, Minicoy, Androth and Kalpeni islands." While Members of Parliament from Kerala had petitioned the Administrator to allow them to visit the islands to have a first-hand study on the new measures being implemented, filmmaker Aisha Sultana, a native of Lakshadweep, was slapped with sedition charges after she made an observation during a discussion in a television channel that the Union government had used "Bio Weapon" on the people of Lakshadweep.Sultana had later come out with a statement that she had some network problems while speaking at the television debate and that she had used the term "Bio Weapon" for Patel.Lakshadweep is inhabited almost entirely by Muslims, and coming to their support, political leaders and parties from Kerala have been conducting several protest marches across the state and had burnt the Administrator in effigy in front of his office at Ernakulam."The Lakshadweep Administrator is planning something massive which will destroy the culture of the island and the lives of the people of this serene place," CPI-M MP, Elamaram Kareem told IANS."This is a highly eco-sensitive place and highly fragile and any constructions like huge resorts will have a negative impact on the ecology of the region. The Administrator is acting like a dictator and is not listening to the voices of the people of Lakshadweep." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakshadweep-administrator-praful-patel-to-reach-agatti-on-monday-267926

It is a commitment and there is no sharing of the post. It is non-negotiable”. Reacting  to state Congress president Nana Patole’s remarks that the Congress will be the largest party in the state after the 2024 assembly polls, Raut said there is a viral video on social media, in which it is said that Patole aspires to be a chief minister.“There is no harm in aspiring for a post. There are several claimants in all parties. In the Congress, there are several leaders capable even of leading the country,” he said.Raut said the MVA is an alliance of three ideologically different parties.“We have come together to run a government and now merged into one political outfit. All three have the right to expand their base and strengthen the organisation,” he said.To a question on poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s recent meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, the Sena’s Rajya Sabha member said Kishor has met several political leaders before and has worked even for Narendra Modi.“If all opposition parties come together to put up a good fight against Narendra Modi in 2024, what’s wrong in that,” he said.To a question on BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis remarks that Modi will be re-elected in 2024, Raut responded saying: “When did we say that it will not happen. Fadnavis is just putting forth his party’s stand”. “Modi is the top leader of the BJP. If all opposition parties come together to put up a formidable fight against Modi, what’s wrong,” he asked.“Can’t say what will happen in politics. In West Bengal assembly polls, media says Modi and (Amit) Shah lost and not the BJP,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cm-post-in-mva-government-non-negotiable-will-remain-with-shiv-sena-for-5-years-sanjay-raut-267921

The smugglers managed to escape from the spot taking the advantage of darkness,” the officer said.The ASP said no police personnel was injured in the attack by the smugglers.“We have rescued 30 bovines from the boat. A case has been registered under the sections of the IPC and a search is on for the cattle smugglers,” Sarma added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-police-foils-cattle-smuggling-attempt-fires-in-air-in-self-defence-267920

13-06-2021||Kolkata||Sacrifices have to be made if one chooses to be in BJP: Dilip Ghosh||With several TMC turncoats making a beeline to return to the party, post-BJP’s drubbing in the assembly polls, state unit chief of the saffron camp, Dilip Ghosh, said on Sunday that the ones who wish to enjoy power without making sacrifices would be asked to leave.Ghosh, who had said on Friday that party national vice president Mukul Roy’s departure won’t make much of a difference, wrote on Twitter that “some people are in the habit of switching parties”.“If one has to stay in the BJP, he/she will have to make sacrifices. Those who only wish to enjoy power cannot stay in the BJP. We won’t keep them,” he tweeted in Bengali.Echoing Ghosh, BJP national secretary and former MP Anupam Hazra said members who are not willing to stand by the party at this hour, when “several of its workers are facing attacks by the TMC and going homeless, are free to leave”.Hitting out at former state minister Rajib Banerjee, who had joined the BJP ahead of the elections, Hazra maintained that “leaders like him have started singing paeans for the TMC immediately after its landslide victory. They are not required in the party”.Shortly after Roy rejoined the TMC, Rajib Banerjee met the party’s state general secretary Kunal Ghosh, but both described it as a “courtesy visit”.“Dilipda said the right thing. Those who crossed over to the BJP before polls only for power and are now sending SOS to Mamata Banerjee expressing their wish to return should leave forthwith. The party does not need them,” he said.Hazra had earlier said lobby politics was at play in the BJP state unit during polls, and just one or two leaders were given responsibilities with the rest feeling “ignored”.He had, however, asserted that he would continue to support his party.Calling Roy a “Trojan horse”, BJP veteran Tathagata Roy tweeted, “After having been welcomed into the BJP, he gained access to its all-India leaders, hobnobbed with state BJP’s gullible... learnt all about the party and its innermost detail, he went back and leaked everything to Mamata”.“But what’s done is done. Now the big question is, did Mukul leave back Trojan Horses within this Trojan Horse? BTW I used to wonder why Mukul always avoided meeting me. Now it all figures,” Tathagata Roy added, indicating there could be agents planted by Roy in the BJP. Kunal Ghosh, who is also the spokesperson of the TMC, said many have expressed their wish to return, but our supremo Mamata Banerjee will take the final decision.His party colleague and senior leader Sougata Roy said, “Had Dilip Ghosh any modicum of self respect and accountability, he would have resigned from the post (of state BJP president) after the poor performance of his party”.A group of five BJP workers in Birbhum district on June 8 took to the streets to announce that they have decided to quit the party and return to the TMC “to get a chance to work for ‘maa mati manush’ (mother, motherland, and people) under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee”.District TMC leaders said their pleas would be considered after holding talks with local party members who worked for the party during the polls.Earlier, several other TMC turncoats, including former MLAs Sonali Guhaa nd Dipendu Biswas, had appealed to Banerjee to take her back under her wings.The TMC supremo, during a recent press meet, said she will not accept requests of leaders, who had abandoned her ship just ahead of the April-May elections. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sacrifices-have-to-be-made-if-one-chooses-to-be-in-bjp-dilip-ghosh-267903
13-06-2021||Kolkata||Visva-Bharati university issues show-cause notice to professor||Visva-Bharati University authorities on Sunday issued a show-cause notice to a professor accusing him of showing inappropriate behaviour towards Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty and not following his instructions during a virtual meeting.The central university authorities claimed in the notice that Manas Maity, professor of physics, had “hurled abuses” at the VC after being asked to speak on the issue of disbursement of salaries and allegations of “some teachers being lackeys and trying to derail the agenda by making wild allegations”, during the meeting on June 8.Maity was asked to reply to the charges within three days.The professor had filed an FIR at Santiniketan police station on Saturday against the VC for allegedly insulting and humiliating him and some other faculty members by making some “unsavoury comments” against them at the meeting.Within hours after the show cause was issued to him, Maity claimed that he was silent at the meeting “despite repeatedly being prodded by the VC and ultimately he was logged out of the interaction”.The professor had also alleged in the FIR that the comments of the VC at the said meeting accusing some faculty members of deliberately leaking the minutes of the meetings and questioning whether “people having such mindset” are eligible to become teachers of the august institution have lowered the prestige of educators.Left-leaning Visva Bharati University Faculty Association (VBUJFA), a staunch critic of the VC, condemned the action against Maity and threatened to carry out protests once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted “against the autocratic attitude of VC and his move to silence the free thinkers in the central institution”.A university source said, “there is an attempt by the VBUFA to rake up controversy during every meeting convened by the VC instead of highlighting the academic performance of the university founded by Rabindranath Tagore”.A veteran ashramite said, “the frequent run-ins between the VC and the VBUFA is sulllying the image of the internationally reputed institution”.Visva-Bharati was formally established as a university in 1921, though it had existed as an educational centre since 1901. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/visva-bharati-university-issues-show-cause-notice-to-professor-267901

At the time, his younger brother's wife had gone to her parents' place.After killing them, he tried to create an alibi and shouted out to his neighbours claiming that his parents were murdered following a robbery.The neighbours called the police, who reached there with a forensic expert and a dog squad. Ravi also lodged an FIR over the deaths. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghaziabad-couple-strangled-to-death-by-son-fretting-over-property-succession-267897

13-06-2021||New Delhi||BJP works to strengthen its social arithmetic ahead of UP assembly polls||Joining hands with smaller parties with a political base in different castes was a part of the BJP strategy as it won big in Uttar Pradesh in the 2017 assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The saffron party is again working to stitch up a strong social alliance as it prepares for the state elections slated for early next year.With senior party leader and Union minister Amit Shah reaching out to the leaders of Apna Dal (S) and Nishad Party, both BJP allies but disaffected over the issue of their representation in the government, and Congress leader Jitin Prasada joining the saffron party, the ruling party seems to be taking measures to get its arithmetic right.Prasada hails from a noted Brahmin family of the state that had remained in the Congress for three generations, and the BJP believes that the young leader’s defection to its ranks will help it contain any dissatisfaction a section of the politically influential community might have with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath-led government.While Anupriya Patel of Apna Dal has not spoken on her meeting with Shah, Sanjay Nishad of Nishad Party made it clear that his party wants representation in the state government to “fulfil” the aspirations of the marginalised communities it draws its support from.“Political power is stronger than God’s power,” he told PTI to emphasise its importance to address myriad issues facing different deprived communities.He also reiterated his demand for giving the community of boatmen, who come under various castes and subcastes, benefits under the scheduled castes and not under the category of Other Backward Communities as being given currently in UP.In a message to the BJP, he said the community has in the past supported parties like the BSP, SP and the Congress but stopped voting for them after they did not address their concerns.“We understand the Modi government has been busy with important national issues,” he said, referring to Article 370 revocation. “Now we believe our concerns will be addressed,” he said.His son Praveen Kumar Nishad’s victory as Samajwadi Party candidate from Adityanath’s pocket borough of Gorakhpur had shocked the BJP, which then worked to woo him over to its camp during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Patel was a minister in the first Modi government but her party’s reported talks with the Congress during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections even as it finally fought as a BJP ally resulted in the Kurmi leader being kept out of its second innings.There have been reports that the BJP may also bring its former ally Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party to its fold again but its leader Om Prakash Rajbhar has ruled out such a possibility.BJP sources said their party has always worked to give due representation to various communities and noted that it has never been averse to tying up with smaller parties.“We have done it in various states, be it Bihar, Assam or Uttar Pradesh,” a leader said.Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav has also been working to broaden his party’s social appeal by bringing leaders from outside its core constituency.With the Yogi government’s handling of the recent Covid-19 crisis drawing questions from even state BJP leaders, with several of them writing letters to highlight their concerns, the saffron party leadership has been taking measures to address organisational and governance challenges.There has been strong speculation that Adityanath may go for an expansion of his Cabinet, and Shah’s meetings with allies are being seen as part of the exercise.The BJP has a lot at stake in the next round of assembly elections in five states early next year as it is in power in four of them, including Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur besides the all-important Uttar Pradesh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-works-to-strengthen-its-social-arithmetic-ahead-of-up-assembly-polls-267891

He died on Saturday. Now, only I and my sister-in-law Babli (40) are left in the family," he told PTI. He said his family spent their entire savings as well Rs 18,000 they received after the video went viral for his treatment. "We do not have an Ayushman Health card so we had to bear the expenses of the treatment, We also have to borrow money from our relatives to run the family and for the treatment of my father," he said. "When my father became popular on social media, several people including local leaders, officials, dignitaries visited the stall and assured financial help. But, nobody turned up after that," he rued.Babli said, "Agra mayor Naveen Jain visited the stall and promised to provide a stall to us, but nothing was given. Other officials came too, but no help was provided." She said they are facing difficult times now and need help. "We are struggling financially after the pandemic. We appeal to officials and local leaders to help us in our time of need. Help us to run the stall."  She said she will now run the stall in his name. "I used to prepare the 'kaanji bade' for the customers." When contacted, Agra Mayor Naveen Jain said, "On the request of the family, the street light where he used to run his cart was repaired. But, now we will provide the family with a stall at a new place, so that they can continue their business."

They also claimed that they had approached the vaccine manufacturers—Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India (SII)—and also state governments, but to no avail.Meanwhile, in a recent communication to the Union health ministry, Prakash Kumar Singh, director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at SII, is learnt to have written, “As per your direction, we are not accepting any further orders/payment from any private hospital in the country. We await your further direction with regard to a roadmap for future supplies to private hospitals.”Elaborating the problems faced by private hospitals, S C L Gupta, medical director, Batra Hospital said, "The problem is that there is no clarity on how we will be procuring the vaccines. When we ask the state government officials, they say wait till June 21 stating that the policy is not yet clear.“The central government also has asked us to wait. We have approached the companies too, but they are also not clear on the methodology of procurement,” he said.In the whole process, Gupta said, vaccination of people is getting delayed."With fear of a possible third wave hitting India, we want to vaccinate as many people as possible. Also, several people and many of our healthcare workers who have taken the first dose are waiting for their second dose," he said.P K Bhardwaj, Chief Executive Director and Head of Department of Surgery, Saroj Hospital also said that nothing has been clearly spelt about procurement by private hospitals and how many vaccines will be given to each private hospital.The vaccinations at most of the private hospitals are on hold and the public, especially those patients who need to get the second doses, are at the receiving end."The government should soon come out with transparent and clear guidelines so as to avoid any further delay in this crucial exercise of inoculating people against the deadly virus," Bhardwaj, who is also secretary of the Delhi Voluntary Hospital Forum, said.Sarvesh Saran Joshi, president, Rajasthan Doctors' Association and also managing director of Shekhawati Hospital, Jaipur said, "We have spoken to manufacturers of both Covishield and Covaxin, and they said the government has asked them not to supply the vaccines directly to private hospitals. So, the majority of medium to small hospitals are suffering the most."Jitendra Saraf, director, Sita Memorial Multispeciality Dental Clinic, Raipur said when he approached the state government officials, they said they are yet to receive proper guidelines on how private hospitals would be procuring the jabs."We have been writing to both Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute, but there is no response from them," Saraf, also a member of the Indian Dental Association, said.Some of the private hospitals also flagged the service charge for vaccination being capped at Rs 150, saying it may not be feasible for them to to organise sessions outside their own centres at that rate."At a service charge of Rs 150, we can provide vaccination only at our centre. We had started to go to RWAs and private sector companies, but now organising such sessions at this rate will not be possible. Capping the price at Rs 150 will also impact the entire vaccination drive. So a mechanism needs to be worked for this too,” Gupta said.Organising outside camps requires additional resources and manpower, and holding such sessions at Rs 150 is not feasible, another private hospital said.Under the revised guidelines, which will come into effect from June 21, the Centre will procure 75 per cent of the Covid-19 vaccines being produced by manufacturers.Domestic vaccine manufacturers are given the option to also provide jabs directly to private hospitals, which would be restricted to 25 per cent of their monthly production.According to the guidelines, states/UTs will aggregate the demand of private hospitals, keeping in view equitable distribution between large and small private hospitals and regional balance.Based on this aggregated demand, the central government will facilitate supply of vaccines to private hospitals and their payment through the National Health Authority's electronic platform.The price of vaccine doses for private hospitals would be declared by each vaccine manufacturer, and any subsequent changes would be notified in advance. The private hospitals may charge up to a maximum of Rs 150 per dose as service charge. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-clarity-on-covid-19-vaccine-procurement-say-private-hospitals-seek-proper-guidelines-267869

His parents had died. All his three sisters are married."Pagade told us that he learnt bomb-making after watching tutorials and decided to do it himself. He extracted flash powder from firecrackers and used a mobile battery and a petrol bottle to make the makeshift bomb. He connected the wires from the battery to the petrol bottle," the officer said.However, he developed cold feet and decided to get rid of the explosive. He disconnected wires and walked up to the police station, where he handed over the bag to the police at 5 pm on Saturday."He told the police that he found the bag containing the bomb abandoned near KDK college. However, the police suspected his statement and interrogated him. Finally, he confessed to making the explosive himself. Pagade said as he panicked and didn't understand what to do with the explosive, he walked to the police station with the hope to defuse the bomb," the officer said.A case was registered against Pagade under the Arms Act and section 123 of the Mumbai Police Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-a-man-walks-into-maharashtra-police-station-with-a-bomb-267857
13-06-2021||Srinagar/New Delhi||Google asked to preserve data of Parra's emails to Pak-based terror groups: Police||The US authorities and Google have been approached by the Jammu and Kashmir Police to share email contents exchanged by Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra, a close aide of PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, with Pakistan-based secessionist leaders and terrorists, a charge sheet filed by the union territory police has said.The charge sheet said there is prima facie evidence "sufficient to launch prosecution" against Parra for establishing a nexus with terrorists to seek their backing for his political gains and for reciprocating by way of providing a range of help and support which led to terror strikes."During investigation, it was found that the accused used to receive instructions and advice from Pakistan-based secessionist and terrorist leaders and communicated action-taken reports and a host of information in furtherance of terrorism and secessionism," the charge sheet filed by the Counter Intelligence Kashmir (CIK) wing of the police said.The charge sheet, submitted before a designated court in Srinagar earlier this month, said Parra used to share information through several email services, of which three have been brought on record."Accordingly, a request has been forwarded through proper channels to Google US as per their standard forms and norms for providing details/contents of emails exchanged by Parra through his three email IDs," the 19-page charge sheet said.Parra's lawyer, as well as the PDP, has denied all the allegations levelled against Parra and has termed them "politically motivated".PDP president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti have also alleged that the police were "torturing" Parra and keeping him in "inhuman conditions".She had tweeted earlier that Parra was being "persecuted and tortured to admit the false allegations. Since an admission didn't happen, he is being kept under inhuman conditions. This investigation has been fraudulent and politically motivated from day one".However, the police, which charged Parra under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, said in its charge sheet that even the US authorities have been approached through the medium of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) via the Ministry of External Affairs for providing necessary assistance in the case."Google US has been requested to preserve the data of the emails (of Parra) ...and Google has conveyed compliance," the charge sheet said.The CIK, which is part of the Jammu and Kashmir Police's CID, has also asked Google to provide WhatsApp chats and data stored in the iCloud account connected to his mobile phone and the details are awaited, the charge sheet said.This is the second charge sheet against Parra, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in November last year. In January this year, Parra was granted bail by the NIA court in Jammu but was immediately detained by the CIK and brought to Srinagar, and at present, he is in judicial custody.In March this year, he was charge-sheeted by the NIA, and it was alleged that Parra had paid Rs 5 crore to the son-in-law of hardline Hurriyat Conference leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani for keeping Kashmir in turmoil after the death of Burhan Wani, the poster boy of the Hizbul Mujahideen, in 2016.The CIK had filed a case last year against unknown politicians and others based on 'reliable and confidential sources' who said some political functionaries were misusing their power and helping militants.These politicians have variously supported the terrorists and secessionists, and even facilitated their movement, transporting their hardware and converting areas under their political responsibility as "unavailable" for anti-terrorist operations."...had such unprincipled and illegal influence not exercised by these unethical political party functionaries, the guilty terrorists and secessionists would have been brought to justice," the FIR of the CIK had said.The CIK, which is mandated to probe cases under the UAPA and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), took sanction for Parra's prosecution from the Jammu and Kashmir Home Department under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).

The family says that there was no reason for them to die by suicide. So, there is a mystery," he told reporters here.Sarma said he personally did on-ground inspection and held discussions with the Bodoland Territorial Area IGP and Kokrajhar SP about the case."We have some doubts on a few people and have picked up four-five persons for interrogation. Of them, two deleted all messages and photos from their phones but they used to talk for one to one-and-half hours with the girls."Prima facie the case hints at murder as well as suicide under duress. If it is murder, then we will find the culprits and punish them. If it is suicide, then we will find the reason behind such a step. I have instructed the police," he said.The chief minister also said that many indigenous people in lower Assam districts like Kokrajhar and Dhubri are "threatened", but he did not elaborate."We are not taking the deaths of the two indigenous girls lightly. That is why I have come here. I want to give one message from here that this government will not accept any torture on the poor and downtrodden people," he said.The incident took place inside a forest, where the bodies of the two siblings were found hanging from a tree on Friday evening.The incident sent a shockwave across the district with the family alleging that they were raped, then killed and hanged from the tree to make it look like suicide.A senior police official said: "The preliminary investigation indicates suicide. We will be able to tell exactly after receiving the detailed post mortem report."Locals said that the two sisters were missing from their residence since Friday afternoon. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-cm-visits-family-of-girls-found-hanging-from-tree-promises-stern-action-267854

She later removed the picture after the controversy erupted.A complaint was filed with the district administration based on this picture alleging preferential treatment to the singer for inoculation for which one has to otherwise required to go to a designated centre after booking a slot online.An inquiry was initiated after the complaint and a show-cause notice was also issued to the concerned health worker, officials said."As per the complaint received by me yesterday, Geeta Rabari had taken vaccination at her house at Madhapar village on Saturday evening.

13-06-2021||New Delhi||‘Love jihad’, ‘cow terror’ will not work in UP polls; farmers’ issues supreme: RLD chief||Asserting that the BJP’s alleged “apathy” towards protesting farmers will hurt it in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary on Sunday said artificial issues such as “love jihad” and “cow terror” will not work as issues of development will win in the elections.As the focus shifts from the West Bengal polls earlier this year to the high-stakes election battle in Uttar Pradesh in 2022, newly-appointed Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Chaudhary asserted that his party will not allow a communally polarised campaign to ruin the Hindi heartland state in the run up to the assembly polls.In an interview with PTI, Chaudhary, who took over as RLD chief after his father Chaudhary Ajit Singh’s demise last month, said his party and the Samajwadi Party have a good rapport and a strong working relationship.He said details need to be worked out for a formal alliance for the polls.Asked if a ‘Mahagathbandhan’ or a grand alliance is needed in UP to take on the BJP and whether the BSP and the Congress would be part of such an alliance, Chaudhary said, for him, issues come first and an understanding of those needs to be built between all alliance partners.“Who can be accommodated depends on who is honestly open to working together on the common framework,” the 42-year-old leader said.On whether the Congress would play a significant role in the Assembly polls despite its poor showing in the panchayat elections, Chaudhary said he would not like to comment on the Congress’ plans and chances.Asked about the speculation over UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s political future as CM and reports about Cabinet reshuffle in the state, Chaudhary said the BJP is just trying to divert attention and create an illusion of dialogue to manage the disgruntled elements in the party.“Social engineering doesn’t come about by tinkering with one or two leaders at the top. The fact is that BJP’s Uttar Pradesh government has been caught in a caste-based matrix and has not delivered jobs, economic growth, and efficient governance to people,” he alleged.The state government’s Covid response has been atrocious and no one can forget the scenes of dead bodies in the Ganga, he added.“Now, after four-and-a-half years to create rumours of change in leadership is a poor attempt to shift focus from failures,” Chaudhary said.Talking about the farm laws protests and whether they would be a key issue in the polls, he said farmers will and should be the biggest poll issue in our country, and asserted that as a class they have been denied their rights for far too long.“The Centre’s new laws are prescribing a takeover of the entire market and value chain by the private sector and the withdrawal of the government from procurement and subsequent monopolisation will hurt producer and consumer interests,” the RLD chief said.The “apathy and insensitive” attitude towards the protesting farmers will continue to haunt and hurt the BJP in polls, he claimed.Chaudhary has participated in a number of ‘kisaan panchayats’ in western Uttar Pradesh, where his party has had a significant presence over the years, and campaigned aggressively against the Centre’s farm laws.Farmers from various parts of the country are protesting at Delhi’s borders against the three farm laws brought by the Centre last year, alleging that the legislations will hamper farming.Asked about the electoral chances of the Opposition against the BJP in UP, Chaudhary said “when the nation is grieving and hurting, the Hindi heartland also will respond appropriately”.“Love jihad, cow terror, Kairana exodus and other useless artificial issues will be rejected; healthcare, education and balanced development will win (in the polls),” he asserted.The Opposition in UP has been alleging that cow vigilante violence is on the rise in the state, a charge denied by the BJP.The ‘Kairana exodus’ was a reference to a BJP MP’s claim in 2016 that close to 350 Hindus had left Kairana over alleged threats and extortion by criminal elements belonging to a particular community.Asked how he plans to turnaround the fortunes of the party which drew a blank in the last assembly polls, Jayant Chaudhary said, “I am humbled by the opportunity and the faith reposed in me by the Party at this critical juncture.”“Chaudhary Saheb’s untimely passing has been a jolt for all of us. Just as any family copes with stress responds by coming together, the office bearers and workers of Rashtriya Lok Dal will need to work cohesively and look to the future,” Chaudhary said.For reviving the party, Chaudhary said, as a first step he wants to engage with people who have worked at the grassroots and have political experience.He said the party is also in conversation with a lot of leaders from other parties who want to join the RLD and work with us, Chaudhary said.Asked if a fragmented opposition will be able to pose a challenge to the BJP in UP, the RLD chief said poll arithmetic has its own rhythms and rules and it’s not as easy to combine different parties and fight elections and assume a “2+2=4 result”.“It is not as if the multiplicity of players is helping the incumbent. Some of the parties could also be taking away votes which might otherwise shift to the BJP,” he argued.Asserting that it is most important to pick the right issues, Chaudhary said social developmental deficits need to be addressed aggressively if we want the state to progress.

13-06-2021||Jaipur||Phone-tapping issue come back to haunt Gehlot-led govt in Rajasthan||Phone-tapping charges have come back to haunt the Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan, with Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki alleging that some legislators have talked about their phones being tapped.Without naming any MLA who levelled the phone-tapping charge, Solanki, a staunch supporter of Congress leader Sachin Pilot, said the legislators also fear of being trapped by various agencies.“I do not know if my phone is being tapped or not. Some legislators have told me that their phones are being tapped. I am also not aware if the state government is involved in phone tapping. Many officials told them (legislators) that it seems that there are efforts under way to trap them,” Solanki, a legislator from Chaksu assembly constituency, told reporters on Saturday.“Some of these MLAs have also informed the Chief Minister of the matter,” he said.Solanki said he does not know whether the MLAs have technical knowledge or there is some App through which they come to know that their phones are being tapped.Reacting to the remarks, BJP state president Satish Poonia charged that the Congress is intimidating its MLAs.“Today again a Congress MLA is saying that many MLAs say their phones are being tapped and spying is happening. Congress should tell who these MLAs are? The Congress is intimidating its own MLAs,” Poonia tweeted.In a tweet, Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore charged that the state government was once again trying to intimidate public representatives.In July last year, Pilot and 18 Congress legislators had rebelled against chief minister Gehlot. One of the accusations they levelled was about illegal phone-tapping. The charges gained ground when some audio clips of telephonic conversations were shared by Gehlot’s officer on special duty (OSD) Lokesh Sharma.The audio clips were later handed over to Rajasthan Police’s special operations group (SOG) to investigate charges that some legislators were trying to topple an elected government through horse trading.The SOG ultimately closed the case after the Congress high command intervened to resolve the issues between Gehlot and Pilot.

13-06-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena was treated as 'slaves' in erstwhile BJP govt in Maharashtra: Sanjay Raut||The Shiv Sena was virtually treated as "slaves" and attempts were made to finish off the party politically when it was in power with the BJP in Maharashtra from 2014 to 2019, Sena MP Sanjay Raut has alleged.Addressing Sena workers in Jalgaon in north Maharashtra on Saturday, Raut said, "The Shiv Sena had a secondary status in the previous government and was (treated) like slaves. Attempts were also made to finish off our party by misusing the very power which was enjoyed because of our support".Raut's remarks came days after Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi separately, setting off political speculations in the state.The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance crumbled in 2019 over the issue of chief ministership. The Sena, which was one of the oldest allies of the BJP, later formed an unlikely alliance with the NCP and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra.Raut said he always thought that the Sena should have its chief minister in Maharashtra."Even if Shiv Sainiks don't get anything, we can proudly say the state's leadership is now in the hands of the Shiv Sena. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government was formed with this sentiment (in November 2019)," he said.Recalling the drama preceding the formation of the tripartite government in November 2019 after the Assembly elections, Raut said senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who briefly switched sides to form a government with the BJP under Devendra Fadnavis, is now the "strongest spokesman "of the MVA. The second Fadnavis-led government which was formed with Ajit Pawar had lasted for just 80 hours."....Anything can happen in politics. Ajit Pawar, the deputy CM of Maharashtra, is now working shoulder to shoulder with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray," Raut said.

13-06-2021||---||Sharpening income inequalities telling story of 'uneven' economic recovery amid pandemic: Ex-RBI Guv Subbarao||New Delhi, June 13  Former RBI Governor D Subbarao has expressed concerns over "extreme unevenness" in economic recovery and "sharpening inequalities" between upper-income segments and lower-income households in the country, cautioning that the trend will hit growth prospects going forward.Terming the uneven recovery "morally wrong and politically corrosive", he said liquidity in the domestic market and foreign fund inflows are leading to soaring prices of stocks and other assets despite disruptions due to the Covid pandemic.The ex-central bank governor further said that earlier expectations of a sharp economic recovery this year have been dashed by the new pandemic wave."The economy contracted last year, for the first time in four decades, by as much as 7.3 per cent. That was less deep than we had first feared but still deep enough to have caused distress to millions of families in the informal sector. There was expectation of a sharp recovery this year but those expectations are now tempered by the impact of the second wave," Subbarao told PTI.The RBI too reduced its growth forecast for the current fiscal by one percentage point, from 10.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent, he said adding that even 9.5 per cent growth might seem impressive but note that this is coming on a very low base of last year."Even if we clock this growth rate, the output during this fiscal 2021/22 will still be less than the output two years ago before the pandemic hit us. Compare that with China which never fell below its pre-pandemic level and the US which is expected to recover to its pre-pandemic level this year," the former RBI chief said.Expressing concerns, Subbarao said that while the majority of people have lost jobs and saw a reduction in their income, the wealth of some rich individuals have increased during the pandemic period."The positive wealth effect of the upper-income segments juxtaposed with the negative income effects of the lower-income households tells a story of a very uneven recovery and sharpening inequalities. This is morally wrong and politically corrosive," he said adding that it will also have a big impact on growth prospects going forward.Explaining further, he said the booming stock market is in fact "symptomatic of the extreme unevenness of this recovery".The domestic liquidity coupled with foreign inflows is fuelling stock prices as also prices of other assets, he said. "Who benefits from this? People who have investable surpluses." "Contrast that with the findings of a study by the Azim Premji University that the one year of Covid-19 pandemic has pushed 230 million people into poverty with a 15 per cent increase in the poverty rate in rural India and a 20 per cent surge in urban India," he said citing the findings of a study."Add to that CMIE data showing that the unemployment rate has gone up as high as 12 per cent in May, 10 million jobs have been lost just on account of the second wave and 97 per cent of the households in the country have experienced declines in incomes," Subbarao added.India's economy contracted by less-than-expected 7.3 per cent in the fiscal ended March 2021.The Reserve Bank has lowered the country's growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 per cent from 10.5 per cent estimated earlier, amid the uncertainties created by the second wave of the pandemic, while the World Bank on Tuesday projected India's economy to grow at 8.3 per cent in 2021.To a query on the urban-rural divide, he said the second COVID-19 wave has hit villages and "we are hearing grim tales of loss of lives and livelihoods"."Poor households have run down their savings for medical expenses, and given the weak medical infrastructure in the villages, rural households are also much more uncertain and anxious about the impact of a possible third wave," Subbarao said.He added that the forecast of a normal monsoon should act to counterbalance some of these fears and anxieties.On being asked about the fiscal measures necessary to support households in distress, Subbarao said the government is under intense fiscal pressures."Even so, it is absolutely necessary to provide some safety-nets to households in distress," he said.Noting that MNREGA proved to be a very effective stabiliser last year, Subbarao said the finance minister can make an open-ended commitment to finance MNREGA to the full extent of demand."If it turns out that there is no uptake for MNREGA because of fear of the virus, direct cash transfers may become necessary but that should be the last resort," he said.  According to the former RBI governor, the government should also consider extending some support on the production side, especially to MSME units, particularly to those sub-sectors which are engaged in exports.When asked if the government should borrow more than budgeted, he said given the already high debt-to-GDP ratio, borrowing beyond the budgeted level should be avoided to the extent possible."For sure, there is going to be additional expenditure not foreseen at the time of the budget. The free food grain programme plus the expanded free vaccines will cost the government up to 0.5 per cent of GDP. Perhaps more may need to be spent depending on how the situation evolves," he said.According to Subbarao, it may, unfortunately, become necessary to cut some desirable capital expenditure to meet the safety-net expenditures."But such expenditure switching is a better option than borrowing more." He also said that the government could of course consider some one-time tax measures such as a cess on corporate profits, capital gains and sin taxes.On inflation, Subbarao pointed out that as per RBI's policy statement, the current inflation reading of 5.1 per cent is largely due to supply constraints."If economic activity revives sooner than is currently expected, demand pressures will ignite inflation calling upon the RBI to adjust their policy stance," he said.On being asked about the impact of the global situation on India's short-term economic prospects, Subbarao said the world is experiencing a multi-speed recovery.      "Developed countries, and China too, are expected to grow rapidly this year, many of them reaching pre-pandemic levels of output, and in the case of China, even surpassing it," he said adding this should provide demand for our exports as was evident to some extent in the growth number for the first quarter (Jan-March) of this year.Subbarao opined that the flip side of global recovery is that global commodity prices, including the price of crude, will firm up which will have substantial implications for India's growth and inflation prospects.

13-06-2021||New Delhi||Rollback fuel price hike, control prices of essential commodities: Left parties||The Left parties in a joint statement on Sunday demanded the rollback of a hike in petroleum products and urged the government to control prices of essential commodities and drugs.The joint statement has been signed by Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary, Communist Party of India (Marxist); D Raja, General Secretary, Communist Party of India; Debabrata Biswas, General Secretary, All India Forward Bloc; Manoj Bhattacharya, General Secretary, Revolutionary Socialist Party and Dipankar Bhattacharya, General Secretary, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)Liberation.The parties jointly directed their state units to ensure the success of the call for country-wide protest against the rise in prices of petrol and essential commodities and drugs.The Left-leaning organisation which will organise a five day-protest beginning June 16, have contextualised it with the rise of prices with the trail of hardships to the common man due to upheavals caused by the Covid pandemic, not least the kind of apocalyptic of its second wave."More assaults on people’s livelihood are being mounted by this relentless rise in prices of all essential commodities," Yechury said."Instead of helping people to combat the ravages of the Covid health catastrophe, the Modi government hiked the prices of petroleum products by at least 21 times after the announcement of results of the recent assembly elections on May 2," Raja said.The Left leaders said the rise in prices has to lead to a cascading inflationary spiral with the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rising to an eleven-year high.In a joint statement, they said that prices of food articles have risen by nearly 5 per cent in April. Primary commodities saw a rise of 10.16 per cent and manufactured products have risen by 9.01 per cent. By the time these commodities reach the retail markets, the consumers are charged much more.They attributed this to black-marketing and hoarding taking place under state patronage.They asked the Union government to give direct cash transfers of Rs. 7500 per month for six months to all families not in the income tax-paying bracket.They said the provisions announced by PM Modi regarding the extension of PMGKAY till Diwali of 5kgs of foodgrains is completely inadequate and does not cover the neediest.Hence, 10 kg food grains per month to all individuals including a food kit with pulses, edible oil, sugar, spices, tea must be distributed free.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rollback-fuel-price-hike-control-prices-of-essential-commodities-left-parties-267825
13-06-2021||New Delhi||Children orphaned in pandemic stare at uncertain future, scramble for aid||Losing a loved one is never easy but if one were to compare, there would not be a loss that could quite match the severity of losing one's parents, especially for dependent children.The death of a parent strips away the child of not just the emotional blanket of comfort, but also in several cases takes away the financial support, leaving their futures in a lurch.According to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), 3,621 children have been orphaned during the pandemic, and over 26,000 children have lost one parent.Ten-year-old Deepika is one of them.She lost her father to COVID-19 less than a month back and is trying to get her life back to normal, but her mother Kalpana said "nothing will ever be normal again", and who could argue?The sole breadwinner of the family, her 57-year old-husband -- an editor at a Hindi publishing house -- was gone almost in a night's span, without even getting a chance at proper treatment, and now she is at a loss for ideas to secure her daughter's future."He had low-grade fever and a slight cough, which actually got better in a few days, but one morning he suddenly collapsed. Although we managed to revive him then… after scrambling for an ambulance and a bed for hours, by the time we reached the hospital, we had lost him," Kalpana said."I remember my little daughter running after the ambulance, pleading with me to take her along," she added, barely managing to keep it together.The challenge with Deepika's situation now is that even though she still has a mother to take care of her, the financial support has gone."I have always been a housewife. How am I suddenly supposed to start working? Honestly, I don't even know what I can do. And even if I do find a job, where will I keep my daughter while I am away. We live in times where no one can be trusted," Kalpana said.However, she has filled in a form seeking free education at her daughter's school under the Delhi government's scheme instructing schools to waive the fees for children who have lost their parents to COVID-19, but she hasn't heard anything yet.The story of Gaurav (13) and Rohan  (6), who live in Uttam Nagar, is not very different.Their father, again the only earning member in the family, was an e-rickshaw driver making a living one day at a time, but his death has pushed the family to the depths of hopelessness.Life was already a challenge with dipping incomes due to the lockdown. The boys' parents had decided to take the younger son out of school, and shift the older one to a government one to make managing finances a little easier, but before anything could happen, tragedy struck."My younger son keeps asking about his father, and I do not have an answer. The little one was really close to him... the elder boy has become indifferent."I don't know what to take care of. My children, their futures, or myself. I am so clueless and scared," said Madhu, the mother.Like Kalpana, Madhu too has applied at her older son's school for his education to be made free, but nothing has come out of it yet.A lot of this cluelessness, the widows said, was also because they have nowhere to turn to for guidance. Relatives helped for a few days after the deaths, but not anymore.In another tale of the cruel twist of fate, three siblings -- aged nine, 11 and 13 -- lost both their parents to COVID-19 in the first week of May.To make things worse, their landlord refused to let their tenancy continue unless they paid rent.Thankfully, their uncle, a welder, came to their rescue and took the three children in."They are my sister's children and I love them. I want to ensure they get an education and have a bright future, but there is only so much that I can do."I do not earn enough to fend for three children. I want the best for them, but I will need help," said Mohammad Asif, who also has to take care of his seven-month pregnant wife.In an attempt to provide help to caretakers like Asif, and non-earning single parents like Kalpana and Madhu, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), an NGO led by Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi has been identifying children rendered orphans during the pandemic for almost a year now.They recently launched a distress helpline asking people to report orphaned children when the death toll increased drastically during the second wave.Kalpana said she managed to get in touch with a BBA volunteer who assured her help, and is hoping to hear from them soon.Earlier this month, the organisation also sought the Delhi High Court's assistance to get information on the number of children who have been orphaned during the pandemic in the capital."While our workers have been trying to locate and provide relief to such children by giving them food and shelter wherever necessary, it is important to understand that our organisation too has limitations."We have got in touch with state government authorities to provide these children with long-term support. It is the primary responsibility of the government to care for these children," said Manish Sharma, Director, Bachpan Bachao Andolan.(Names have been changed to protect identities) PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/children-orphaned-in-pandemic-stare-at-uncertain-future-scramble-for-aid-267821
13-06-2021||Ahmednagar||4 wed in Maha jumbo Covid centre, 1,000 patients bless the couples||It was truly a memorable and refreshing 'day out' for some 1000-odd patients undergoing treatment at a Jumbo Covid Hospital in the tiny Bhalavani village of 7,500 people here.For, this week, they were 'invited' to the weddings of two bright young couples who chose to tie the knot at the sprawling 1,100-bed "Sharadchandra Pawar Arogya Mandir", in this village in Parner, with around 20 relatives of the two sets of brides and grooms, permitted as per protocols.The excited couples were: Rajashri R. Kale, 30, an engineer who got married with Rahul J. Kadam, 33, a doctor working for a government hospital, and Aarati N. Shinde, 20, a final year college student who wed Niket S. Vyavhare, 32, a social worker.Parner Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Nilesh Lanke, who organized the novel marriage ceremony said that the couples wished to do "something different for their upcoming weddings since there are so many strict guidelines" in force."Last month, Rajashri R. Kale, had come to celebrate her brother's birthday and was highly impressed with the arrangements here. Then, she and the other couple insisted on getting married at the Covid centre," Lanke told IANS.Buoyed by their enthusiasm, Lanke set up a crack team of aides and NCP workers like Rahul Zaware, Babaji Tarte, Balasaheb Khilari, Rajendra Chaudhary, Shrikant Chaure, Datta Korde, Pramod Godse, Sandeep Chaudhary, Satyam Nimse and Annasheb Dalvi to make the double-marriage preparations.They secured all government and medical permissions to perform the double-marriages in the hospital campus, solemnized by two Hindu priests and witnessed by more than a thousand Covid patients, medicos, health care workers and party activists.The couples performed all the marriage rituals, including exchanging the traditional garlands, seeking blessings of their immediate family members and Lanke, with traditional Maharashtrian wedding music playing gently in the background.Seeing the festivities on the stage, many of the Covid patients rose to cheer and clap, others beamed and blessed sitting or lying on their cots, but all delighted in the diversion from their usually dull and despondent days at the hospital.Zaware said that the twin wedding sought "to drive away the fears surrounding Covid among the ordinary folks" and pointed out how "such highly educated persons opted for the hospital as a launch-pad for their marital life"."This double-wedding is a first in India where the masses dread the very mention of Coronavirus… We hope it will create awareness that the disease is curable and people should not run from it," Lanke said.Expressing their gratitude, the two couples threw a sumptuous wedding feast, each sponsoring the lunch and dinner for all, donations of Rs 26,000 from Rajashri-Rahul and Rs 11,000 from Aarati-Niket to the Covid centre."We are absolutely thrilled… Our weddings couldn't have been better… An unforgettable experience as we step into our new lives," gushed the two new brides Rajashri and Aarati soon after their public nuptials.Before leaving, the couples went around taking blessings of the patients and gifting Covid-special boxes containing gloves, sanitisers, masks, PPE kits, basic medicines, etc to the hospital.The unique event earned admiration from NCP President Sharad Pawar, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, NCP MP Supriya Sule and other top leaders.Lanke said that the "Sharadchandra Pawar Arogya Mandir" free jumbo hospital, the country's biggest at the taluka-level, was inaugurated in August 2020, with 100-oxygen beds and all emergency or specialized equipment.It got donations of over Rs 4 crore comprising funds or medical equipment or medicines, and local villages chipped in with more than 50-tonnes foodgrains for the patients, cared for 24x7 by 200 doctors, nurses and health workers."We get patients from across Maharashtra and even Karnataka, and all are welcome to get the best treatment absolutely free. In the ongoing second wave, we treated 8,500 patients, including 1,000 children, with zero deaths," Lanke said with pride. --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-wed-in-maha-jumbo-covid-centre-1-000-patients-bless-the-couples-267819

Of these, 1.85 crore were earmarked for procurement by private hospitals, which, under the liberalised policy, were allowed to procure 25 pc doses directly from the manufacturers (states were allowed to procure another 25 per cent and Centre the remaining 50 per cent for free distribution to states).1.85 crore jabs were earmarkedThe private hospitals were finally able to procure 1.29 crore doses in May and out of these, they could administer 22 lakh through May, which is just about 17 per cent.Top government sources today said the potential of vaccine wastage and indications of consumer hesitancy in accepting jabs from private facilities were principal reasons behind tweaking of the national policy that still allows vaccine makers to give up to 25 per cent of their monthly production to private facilities, but involves state governments in aggregating the demand of such facilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pvt-centres-administered-only-17-doses-procured-in-may-267493

The longstanding tradition has been for a section of Hindus to serve as priests.Asked if the government would also be willing to train women priests as part of its all-community priest scheme, Babu said, “If women want to work as priests they will be trained and appointed as priests with the approval of the CM.”The minister’s remarks became a subject of intense controversy on the social media minutes after he spoke, indicating that the road towards gender equality in the service of God would be long and rutted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tamil-nadu-open-to-training-women-as-priests-minister-267497

Choksi had approached the High Court after the magistrate had rejected his bail petition.The 62-year-old diamantaire, who has an Interpol Red Notice against him, had mysteriously gone missing on May 23 from Antigua and Barbuda. He was detained in the neighbouring island country of Dominica for illegal entry after a possible romantic escapade with his rumoured girlfriend.Choksi’s lawyers had filed a habeas corpus petition calling his arrest illegal and alleging that he was abducted, tortured and handed over to Dominica authority to deny him rights available to him in Antigua and Barbuda as a citizen. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/flight-risk-dominica-hc-denies-bail-to-choksi-267491
13-06-2021||New Delhi||Not hiding deaths, report claiming toll 7 times higher speculative: Govt||Rejecting as speculative a report in The Economist claiming five to seven times excess deaths in India over and above the official figures, the government today said the country was following the WHO’s ICD-10 codes for mortality reporting.The Health Ministry said it had been transparent in Covid management and in May last, the ICMR had issued guidelines for appropriate recording of Covid deaths in India as per the ICD-10 mortality coding.As the Congress too sought a judicial probe into alleged excess deaths in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and UP, the government said, “The Health Ministry has regularly emphasised with states the need for a robust reporting mechanism for monitoring district-wise cases and deaths on a daily basis. The states consistently reporting lower number of daily deaths were told to recheck their data. A case in point is the Union Government writing to Bihar to provide detailed date and district-wise break-up of the reconciled number of deaths, which recently led to massive surge in daily reported deaths.” It said there would always be differences in mortality recorded during a prolonged pandemic and well conducted research on excess mortalities done after the event when data was available from reliable sources.“The methodologies for such studies are well established. But a renowned international magazine has speculated that India has suffered perhaps five to seven times excess deaths than the official toll. This is devoid of basis. The unsound analysis is based on extrapolation of data without any epidemiological evidence,” the government said on a day when India reported 84,332 new cases, a 70-day low.India has recorded less than 1 lakh daily new cases for five days now. Daily positivity rate remained below 5 per cent at 4.39 per cent today in signs of a receding second wave.

13-06-2021||New Delhi||War histories to be made public, but many caveats||With three full-blown wars, a conflict in Kargil and several path-breaking operations like the dramatic capture of Siachen Glacier in 1984 remaining cloaked in secrecy, the Ministry of Defence on Saturday approved a policy on archiving, declassification and compilation and publication of histories of wars and military operations.Panel to take call on sensitive opsThe requirement of having war histories written with a clear-cut policy on declassification of war records was recommended by NN Vohra Committee and Kargil Review Committee. The declassification will be done through the history division of the MoD. A committee headed by Joint Secretary, MoD, and comprising representatives of the Services, MEA, MHA and other organisations will compile the histories. The MoD says the committee will be formed within two years of the completion of a war.Thereafter, the collection of records and compilation should be completed in three years and disseminated to all concerned. For past operations, the committee would take a call on each case.So far the only officially released history is that of the India-Pakistan war of 1947-48. The histories of Indo-Pak wars of 1965 and 1971 were published, but these carry a caveat by the authors: “I don’t consider this as an account of proper history.” These are for “restricted circulation”, which means these are available only at select libraries of the forces. Both were released in the early 1990s.The caveat means that access to records of Operation Meghdoot (Siachen), Operation Pawan (Sri Lanka) and Operation Falcon in Arunachal Pradesh in the mid-1980s will not be made public immediately. The same applies to Operation Bluestar. All these could have political fallout.As per existing policy the responsibility for declassification of records rests with the respective organisations as specified in the Public Record Act 1993 and Public Record Rules 1997. According to these, records should ordinarily be declassified in 25 years.The MoD has asked the armed forces,  Assam Rifles and Indian Coast Guard, to transfer records, including war diaries, letters of proceedings and  operational record books to the History Division for proper upkeep, archival and writing histories.The requirement of having war histories written with clear cut policy on declassification of war records was recommended by Kargil Review Committee headed by K Subrahmanyam and also by the NN Vohra Committee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/war-histories-to-be-made-public-but-many-caveats-267446
13-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre trashes report on higher Covid deaths||India on Saturday refuted a report which claimed that its Covid deaths could be “five-to-seven times” higher than the official number, saying the assessment is based on extrapolation of data without any epidemiological evidence.In a statement, the Union Health Ministry also slammed the publication, without naming it, for the article which claimed “India has suffered perhaps five to seven times ‘excess deaths’ than the official number of Covid-19 fatalities”.Read also: GST Council cuts tax on Covid medicines, equipmentChinese researchers find batch of new coronaviruses in bats: ReportThe ministry termed the article, published by The Economist, speculative, without any basis and misinformed.“The unsound analysis of the said article is based on the extrapolation of data without any epidemiological evidence,” the ministry said, adding the studies used by the magazine to estimate the mortality are not validated tools for determining the death rate of any country or region.The ministry then went on to list the reasons why the studies used by the publication cannot be trusted.An internet search of research studies in scientific databases such as Pubmed, Research Gate, etc., did not locate this study and its detailed methodology has not been provided by the magazine either, the ministry said.“Another evidence given is the study done in Telangana based on insurance claims. Again, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data available on such a study,” the statement said.“Two other studies relied upon are those done by Psephology groups namely ‘Prashnam’ and ‘C-Voter’ who are well versed in conducting, predicting and analysing poll results. They were never ever associated with public health research. Even in their own area of work of psephology, their methodologies for predicting poll results have been wide off the mark many times,” it said.By their own submission, the magazine states that “such estimates have been extrapolated from patchy and often unreliable local government data, from company records and from analyses of such things as obituaries”, the statement said. It said the government has been transparent in its approach to Covid data management.In order to avoid any inconsistency in the number of deaths being reported, the ministry said, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issued guidelines as early as in May 2020.It said that for correct recording of all deaths, the ICD-10 codes recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) was followed.States and Union Territories have been urged through formal communications, multiple video conferences and through the deployment of Central teams for correct recording of deaths in accordance with laid down guidelines, it said.The Health Ministry said that it has also regularly emphasised the need for a robust reporting mechanism for monitoring district-wise cases and deaths on a daily basis.“States consistently reporting lower number of daily deaths were told to re-check their data. A case in point is the Union Government writing to the State of Bihar to provide detailed date and district wise break-up of the reconciled number of deaths to Union Health Ministry,” it said.The statement said there shall always be difference in mortality recorded during a profound and prolonged public health crisis such as Covid pandemic and well conducted research studies on excess mortalities, usually done after the event when data on mortalities are available from reliable sources.The methodologies for such studies are well established, the data sources are defined as also the valid assumptions for computing mortality, the statement said.

Detailed action plan for Mission UP and Uttarakhand will also be taken up soon within SKM,” it said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for more than six months now in protest against the three laws that they say will leave them at the mercy of big corporates and end the MSP regime.The government has said all these concerns are baseless and that the new laws are pro-farmer.The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the laws till further orders and set up a committee to examine the issues.

13-06-2021||New Delhi||Twitter sends notices to cartoonist Manjul, other prominent users on requests from law enforcement agencies||Unnamed law enforcement agencies have asked Twitter to take down certain tweets of popular cartoonist Manjul, fact-checking website Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair and others, over alleged violation of law.Manjul, Zubair, and retired IAS officer Surya Pratap Singh have shared screenshots of the notice sent by the microblogging platform on their Twitter handles over the last few days. Sources said the Ministry of Electronics and IT was not involved in sending these legal requests to Twitter. It wasn't clear which agencies have flagged these tweets by these users and for what violations. Emails sent to Twitter did not elicit a response. Meanwhile, the screenshot shared by Manjul showed Twitter as saying: "In the interest of transparency, we are writing to inform you that Twitter has received a request from Indian law enforcement regarding your Twitter account @MANJULtoons, that claims the ... content violates the law(s) of India". It further stated that Twitter has “not taken any action on the reported content at this time as a result of this request”. Twitter, in its notice, said it is the company's policy to notify users if it receives a legal request from an authorised entity (such as law enforcement or a government agency) to remove content from their account. Twitter further informed the account holders that while the platform is unable to provide legal advice, "we want you to have an opportunity to evaluate the request and, if you wish, take appropriate action to protect your interests". "This may include seeking legal counsel and challenging the request in court, contacting relevant civil society organisations, voluntarily deleting the content (if applicable), or finding some other resolution," Twitter added. Mohammed Zubair and Surya Pratap Singh also shared screenshots with similarly worded notices from Twitter on their own accounts. These three users each have lakhs of followers on the platform. Twitter has had several faceoffs with the Indian government over the past months, including during the farmers' protest and later when it tagged political posts of several leaders of the ruling party BJP as "manipulated media". Twitter has also been facing heat for delay in complying with the IT rules that mandate large digital platforms to undertake greater due diligence and make them more accountable and responsible for the content hosted by them. Social media companies will have to take down flagged content within 36 hours, and remove within 24 hours content that is flagged for issues such as nudity and pornography under the new rules. Under the rules, significant social media intermediaries -- those with over 50 lakh users -- are required to appoint a grievance officer, a nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel have to be residents in India. Earlier this week, Twitter assured the Indian government that it is in advanced stages of finalising the appointment of chief compliance officer as required under the new IT rules, and that it will submit additional details within a week. Twitter has also stated that India will be one of the first countries in which it pilots a new approach of building an in-market team to "locally tailor" its global product to the needs of the region. As part of its strategy, the company is scouting for a 'Staff Designer', who will help the platform establish a bespoke product strategy for Twitter in India and execute against it with support from a dedicated local team. Twitter has an estimated 1.75 crore users in India, as per data cited by the government recently.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-sends-notices-to-cartoonist-manjul-other-prominent-users-on-requests-from-law-enforcement-agencies-267407

He has appointed lawyers in India and one of them recently gave a press interview about the happenings in Dominica supporting the version being advanced by Choksi. It is unfortunate that Choksi has suppressed all this from the court and has instead suggested that there are no proceedings against him in India,” Indian probe agencies told the Dominica court.After taking note of the facts of the case, the Dominica High Court dismissed Choksi’s bail petition and noted that he is “flight risk”.Choksi’s counsel argued for bail citing medical grounds. However, Counsel for the State opposed the bail and told the court that Mehul Choksi is “flight risk” and has an Interpol red notice issued against him.The 62-year-old fugitive businessman, who fled to Antigua and Barbuda, is wanted by the Indian probe agencies for allegedly cheating the Punjab National Bank of over Rs 13000 crore rupees, one of the largest bank frauds in the country.

He did his matriculation from Punjab Public School, Nabha, and then joined the Maharaja Ranjit Singh Armed Forces Preparatory Institute (AFPI), Mohali, from where he had proceeded to the National Defence Academy, Kharakvasla. At IMA, he held the appointment of Academy Cadet Adjutant.The Army today commissioned 341 officers as Lieutenants during the passing out parade of the 148 Regular Course and 131 Technical Graduate Course. Another 84 foreign cadets also passed out of the Academy today, who will be joining the armed forces of their respective countries.Amongst the highest contributing states, Uttar Pradesh topped the tally with 66 officers followed by Haryana with 38. Uttarakhand had 37 officers while Punjab had 32.  There was no representation from eight states, while some had just a single officer.The coveted Sword of Honour for being adjudged as the overall best cadet of the term was bagged by Battalion Under Officer Mukesh Kumar from Rajasthan, who also received the silver medal for standing second in the order of merit. The gold medal for standing first went to Academy Under Officer Deepak Singh from Uttarakhand.The silver medal for standing first in the Technical Graduate Course was presented to Junior Under Officer Daksh Kumar Pant, while the silver medal for standing first among foreign cadets went to Junior Under Officer Kinley Norbu from Bhutan. The Chief of Army Staff’s Banner was awarded to Dograi Company for standing overall first amongst all 16 companies in the IMA.Exhorting the newly commissioned officers to dedicate themselves to the service of the nation, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, Lt Gen RP Singh, who was the parade’s reviewing officer, said that the external and internal challenges that our nation faces from adversarial forces are only set to increase as we rise to take our destined place in the new global order.“These are extremely challenging times while the world battles with the Covid pandemic and witnesses a host of varied conflicts across the world. You are stepping into an era typified by disruptive technologies, blurring definition of threats, expanding domains of conflict and an interplay of multi-polar complexities,” he said. “As warrior leaders of the future, your awareness, proficiency and leadership has to remain extremely dynamic and evolve constantly,” he added.Congratulating the new officers, Lt Gen Singh said that as they step into the folds of the Army, every bit of what they have imbibed at IMA shall be put to test and everyone has complete confidence that they shall come out with flying colours. Stressing that the Chetwode Motto which accords priority to the nation and the men they command must always remain at the core of their conduct, he said that character, selflessness, empathy, risk taking and firm resolve must guide them as young leaders.The ‘Pipping Ceremony’ that is pinning the badges of rank on the epaulettes, which is traditionally done by the parents of cadets, was done by instructors and staff of the IMA because of restrictions imposed due to Covid-19 protocols. Parents and family members of the passing out cadets could not attend the event.Among the Indian pass-outs, 315 were from the regular course and 26 from the technical course.

Modi's BJP is another opposition party in Punjab.Sisodia alleged that Punjab's government schools have poor educational facilities for students and parents prefer to send their children to private schools.The index is an effort to hide the incompetence of the Punjab government in the field of school education, he alleged."Maybe later, the government might release a report saying Punjab's hospitals are best.

13-06-2021||New York||Indian-origin journalist wins Pulitzer Prize for exposing China’s vast infrastructure for detaining Muslims||Megha Rajagopalan, an Indian-origin journalist, along with two contributors, has won the Pulitzer Prize for innovative investigative reports that exposed a vast infrastructure of prisons and mass internment camps secretly built by China for detaining hundreds of thousands of Muslims in its restive Xinjiang region.Rajagopalan from BuzzFeed News is among two Indian-origin journalists who won the US’ top journalism award on Friday.Tampa Bay Times’ Neil Bedi won for local reporting. Bedi along with Kathleen McGrory has been awarded the prize for the series exposing a Sheriff’s Office initiative that used computer modelling to identify people believed to be future crime suspects. About 1,000 people were monitored under the programme, including children.Bedi is an investigative reporter for the Tampa Bay Times.“What Kathleen and Neil unearthed in Pasco County has had a profound impact on the community,” said Mark Katches, Times executive editor. “This is what the best investigative journalism can do and why it is so essential.”              Rajagopalan’s Xinjiang series won the Pulitzer Prize in the International Reporting category.In 2017, not long after China began to detain thousands of Muslims in Xinjiang, Rajagopalan was the first to visit an internment camp — at a time when China denied that such places existed, BuzzFeed News said.“In response, the government tried to silence her, revoking her visa and ejecting her from the country,” BuzzFeed News wrote in its entry for the prize.“It would go on to cut off access to the entire region for most Westerners and stymie journalists. The release of basic facts about detainees slowed to a trickle.”     Working from London, and refusing to be silenced, Rajagopalan partnered with two contributors, Alison Killing, a licensed architect who specialises in forensic analysis of architecture and satellite images of buildings, and Christo Buschek, a programmer who builds tools tailored for data journalists.“The blazing Xinjiang stories shine desperately needed light on one of the worst human rights abuses of our time,” said Mark Schoofs, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News.Minutes after she won, Rajagopalan told BuzzFeed News she wasn’t even watching the ceremony live because she wasn’t expecting to win. She only found out when Schoofs called to congratulate her on the victory.“I’m in complete shock, I did not expect this,” Rajagopalan said over the phone from London.She said she was deeply grateful to the teams of people who worked with her on this, including her collaborators, Killing and Buschek, her editor Alex Campbell, BuzzFeed News’ public relations team, and the organisations that funded their work, including the Pulitzer Center.Rajagopalan also acknowledged the courage of the sources who spoke to them despite the risk and threat of retaliation against them and their families.“I’m so grateful they stood up and were willing to talk to us,” she said. “It takes so much unbelievable courage to do that.”                The three of them set out to analyse thousands of satellite images of the Xinjiang region, an area bigger than Alaska, to try to answer a simple question: Where were Chinese officials detaining as many as 1 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities?For months, the trio compared censored Chinese images with uncensored mapping software. They began with an enormous dataset of 50,000 locations.Buschek built a custom tool to sort through those images. Then, “the team had to go through thousands of images one by one, verifying many of the sites against other available evidence,” BuzzFeed News wrote in its prize entry.They ultimately identified more than 260 structures that appeared to be fortified detention camps. Some of the sites were capable of holding more than 10,000 people and many contained factories where prisoners were forced into labour.The groundbreaking technological reporting was also accompanied by extensive old-fashioned “shoe leather” journalism.Barred from China, Rajagopalan instead travelled to its neighbour Kazakhstan, where many Chinese Muslims have sought refuge.There, Rajagopalan located more than two dozen people who had been prisoners in the Xinjiang camps, winning their trust and convincing them to share their nightmarish accounts with the world.Pulitzer prizes are awarded yearly in twenty-one categories.
