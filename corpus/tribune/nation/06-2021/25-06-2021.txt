25-06-2021||New Delhi||India under ‘Modi-gency’ for seven years: Congress||After Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled the “dark days” of Emergency and called for strengthening the country’s democratic spirit, the Congress hit back alleging India is under “Modi-gency” for seven years where institutions have been undermined and democracy trampled.Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said the time has come when people rise in unison to assess the “annihilation of the very foundation of democracy in India by an arbitrary Modi regime”.His comments came after Modi in a tweet said “the dark days of Emergency can never be forgotten”.“The period from 1975 to 1977 witnessed a systematic destruction of institutions.“Let us pledge to do everything possible to strengthen India’s democratic spirit, and live up to the values enshrined in our Constitution,” Modi said.Today is the 46th anniversary of the Emergency. On this day in 1975, the then prime minister Indira Gandhi had imposed Emergency in the country.Hitting back at Modi, Surjewala tweeted, “Says a PM, who is synonymous with three ‘S’ - Suppress, Stifle and Subjugate.”“A PM-who has undermined Parliament, A PM-who has disdain for Constitution, A PM-who has eroded Institutions, A PM-who has trampled Democracy, shouldn’t preach, for India is under ‘Modi-gency’ for 7 years,” he alleged.The Congress leader said that in seven years of Modi rule, “Emergency has now derived a new meaning—that is Modi-gency”.He said in the last 73 years, for the first time the Supreme Court judges are forced to hold a press conference to air their grievances including the murder of a judge and for the first time, Parliament has come to a halt with pandemic being used to do away with the parliamentary oversight of the government.“From Election Commission to CAG to CVC, all institutional oversight mechanism over the decisions of the executive have been stifled and subjugated. The agencies of the government like the CBI and Income Tax have become BJP revenge machines against political opponents,” he alleged.“Elected governments have been brutally sidelined with scant regard for majority and people’s mandate. A unitary authoritarian regime led by two people—the prime minister and the home minister rule by force and dictatorship and not by law and the Constitution,” Surjewala further alleged.“We live in a regime which reminds of ‘brutal Nazi style dictatorship’. Yet the prime minister speaks about Emergency. The entire discourse is a sham and time has come when people rise in unison to assess the annihilation of the very foundation of democracy in India by an arbitrary Modi regime,” he claimed.

25-06-2021||Mumbai||Kangana seeks permanent exemption from court appearance in defamation case filed by Akhtar||Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut on Friday moved a plea seeking permanent exemption from appearing before a magistrate court here in a  defamation complaint lodged by veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar.In her plea, filed through advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, Ranaut has sought permanent exemption from court appearance on the ground that she needs to travel to different parts of India and also overseas to fulfil her professional commitments. The plea further said attending the court on a regular basis will require the actor to travel miles to Mumbai from different work locations, thereby causing her undue hardships.The applicant will thus not only be unable to meet her professional commitments, but also both she and production houses will incur huge financial losses, it added. The court allowed her to skip in-person appearance for the day (June 25) and posted the permanent exemption plea for hearing on July 27.Akhtar (76) had filed the complaint in the magistrate's court last November claiming the actor had made defamatory statements against him in a television interview, which allegedly damaged his reputation.In his complaint, Akhtar claimed that had made defamatory comments against him in an interview by dragging his name while referring to a "coterie" existing in Bollywood, following the death of filmstar Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year. The magistrate had directed the Mumbai police to carry out a preliminary probe into the complaint.In February, the police submitted a report to the court, saying an offence of defamation was made out against Ranaut. On March 1, magistrate R R Khan had issued a bailable warrant against Ranaut after she failed to appear before the court as per earlier directions. Later, her warrant was cancelled after Ranaut furnished a cash bail of Rs 20,000 and a surety of Rs 15,000.Earlier, she had also moved the sessions court to quash the legal proceedings and summons issued against her by the magistrate court.  The sessions court had dismissed her application. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-seeks-permanent-exemption-from-court-appearance-in-defamation-case-filed-by-akhtar-273913

The actual oxygen consumption claimed by the Delhi government (1,140MT) was about four times higher than the calculated consumption as per the formula based on bed capacity (289 MT).”During the meetings of the sub-group, it was repeatedly noted that there was a “gross discrepancy” in the data recorded from proformas, it said, adding the Delhi government made claims for allocation of 700 MT oxygen on April 30 of medical grade Oxygen using a “wrong formula”.Overruling the Centre’s contention that experts have pegged Delhi’s requirement at 415 MT oxygen, a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud had on May 5, ordered the Centre to maintain supply of 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi which had sought 900 MT oxygen for peak caseload of 95,000 patients on May 3. The Delhi High Court too had pulled up the Centre on the issue.The panel prepared its report after analysing oxygen consumption data received from 183 hospitals on three parameters -- actual consumption, requirement as per Centre’s formula and requirement as per Delhi’s formula.The Delhi Government had claimed that the oxygen requirement in 183 hospitals was 1,140 MT, but as per information received from the hospital, the actual oxygen consumption was only 209 MT, it noted.If the Centre-recommended formula for oxygen allotment was adopted, the requirement would have been 289 MT and 391 MT as per the Delhi government formula, it stated.The panel said tankers in Delhi were not able to off-load oxygen and were lying idle as Oxygen tanks in various hospitals were completely filled.Four model hospitals in Delhi—Singhal Hospital, Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital, ESIC Model Hospital and Liferay Hospital—claimed extremely high Oxygen consumption with very few beds and the claims appeared to be clearly “erroneous, leading to extremely skewed information and significantly higher Oxygen requirement for entire state of Delhi”, it pointed out.Some hospitals could not differentiate between KL (Kilo Litre) and MT (Metric Tonne) and the same was not examined while projecting 700 MTs”, it said.The report said Controller of Explosives, PESO has informed that Oxygen supply to Delhi and Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tankers level are being monitored on daily basis and as per 8am report on May 13, most of the LMO tanks were filled with more than 75 per cent, while few tanks are completely filled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-panel-indicts-kejriwal-government-for-inflating-oxygen-requirement-273912

25-06-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala Women's commission chairperson resigns after sparking a row||A day after her alleged insensitive remarks sparked a row in Kerala, the Women's Commission chairperson MC Josephine resigned on Friday, as women activists of the opposition Congress and BJP took out protest marches against her comment.Josephine, a central committee member of the ruling CPI(M), had courted controversy when she spoke harshly to a woman complainant of domestic violence during a live television programme of a Malayalam channel on Wednesday, causing embarrassment to the Marxist party.The matter was discussed at the state secretariat, which met on Friday, and attended by top party leaders, including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.She explained her stand with regard to the comments in the state secretariat and expressed willingness to step down from the post, which was duly accepted by the party, CPI(M) state secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan later told reporters."Her comments were not appropriate. She expressed regret. The state secretariat discussed the matter today where Josephine explained her stand and expressed regret on the lapses on her part.She also expressed willingness to step down from the post as chairperson of the commission. The party accepted that," he said.Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, V D Satheeshan said the chairperson's decision to quit was appropriate and should have been done earlier as she had constantly "engaged in making such disparaging comments affecting the sanctity of the office".BJP statepresident K Surendran said there was no other option before her but to resign.She faced the wrath of the public for her insensitive comment towards a complainant, he said in a statement.Josephine, while attending the television show asked the woman, who alleged that she was being harassed by her husband and mother-in-law, if she had filed a police complaint against them.When the woman replied in the negative, Josephinecould be seen reacting angrily, and asked her to "suffer" for not approaching the police.The woman told her that she was married since 2014 and had no children and alleged she was constantly being assaulted by her husband and mother-in-law.The video of the women panel chief's behaviour on live TV has gone viral on social media, with demands pouring in for her resignation, even from netizens with Left-leaning, on her insensitive attitude.She later expressed regret for her comments following widespread condemnation over the remarks.Mahila Congress workers took out a protest march in front of theAKG centre where the state secretariat was proceeding this morning.Protesters were arrested and removed by police.BJP women workers also took out a march to the commission's office here and burnt Josephine's effigy.The chairperson's remarks had come days after the state had witnessed the shocking incident of dowry-related death of a 24-year-old woman, Vismaya, who was found hanging in her husband's house hardly a year after her marriage.A couple of similar incidents have been reported in the state in the past few days.Meanwhile, the CPI(M) has decided to launch a state-wide 'Streepaksha Keralam' campaign starting from July 8 on gender justice.Vijayaraghavan said a campaign would be organised in the state from July 1 for seven days against the anti-women attitude that is now taking shape in the society.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-womens-commission-chairperson-resigns-after-sparking-a-row-273903

25-06-2021||Dehradun||Chardham yatra to open partially for locals from July 1||Uttarakhand Cabinet on Friday decided to partially open the Chardham yatra for locals in limited numbers from July 1.Briefing reporters about the cabinet’s decision, state government’s spokesman Subodh Uniyal said Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri will be opened for residents of Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi districts respectively from July 1 with a cap on the number of pilgrims to visit the temples daily.Bringing a negative RT-PCR/Rapid Antigen test report will be mandatory for every pilgrim and the SOPs to be followed by them while visiting the temples will be issued separately, Uniyal said.A senior official will be appointed for each of the four Himalayan temples who will coordinate with the district administration concerned about the arrangement for pilgrims, he added.  Asked whether the Chardham yatra will open for pilgrims from across the state from July 11 as planned earlier, the spokesman said it will depend on the overall Covid situation.“There are predictions about the third wave and the Delta mutant of the pandemic. That will have to be taken into account before we go ahead with the decision to open the yatra for the whole of the state. The Cabinet will sit again to take a call on that,” Uniyal said.Uttarakhand High Court had recently reprimanded the state government for the “haste” being shown in opening the Chardham yatra and asked it to either suspend or defer it. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chardham-yatra-to-open-partially-for-locals-from-july-1-273899
25-06-2021||New Delhi||IAF Chief Bhadauria directs WAC commanders to keep operational readiness at highest level||Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria has lauded the Western Air Command (WAC) for its swift response in the face of the bitter border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh and directed it to keep the operational readiness at the “highest level”, officials said on Friday.The Chief of Air Staff was addressing a two-day conference of the top commanders of the WAC which looks after the security of the country’s air space in the sensitive Ladakh sector as well as various other parts of north India.In his remarks, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria directed the commanders to ensure that the operational readiness of all platforms, weapon systems and assets are kept at the “highest level”, the officials said.The commanders deliberated extensively on security challenges facing the country along the northern border during the deliberations that concluded on Friday.In his remarks, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria emphasised the need for critical analysis of the evolving security matrix, enhancing operational preparedness and ensuring robust physical and cybersecurity infrastructure.“The Chief of Air Staff appreciated the swift response and high commitment shown by all bases in WAC in the recent standoff on our Northern frontiers despite the constraints posed by the ongoing pandemic,” the IAF said in a statement.Following the escalation in tension in eastern Ladakh in mid-June last year, the Indian Air Force (IAF) deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft as well as its attack helicopters in the key air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the Line of Actual Control.Since last September, newly-inducted Rafale jets too started carrying out sorties in various forward areas in eastern Ladakh as part of measures to give a boost to India’s combat readiness in the region.The Chief of Air Staff also appreciated the aerospace safety record of the WAC and urged the commanders to continue their efforts towards a safe operational environment.“He underlined the future of IAF by enhancing operational capability through force structuring along with self-reliance and indigenisation with an aim to transform the IAF into a potent aerospace power,” the IAF said.India and China were locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year. However, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points. India has been particularly pressing for disengagement of troops in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.According to military officials, each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control in the sensitive sector.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach on it at the 11th round of military talks.Last month, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane said that there can be no de-escalation without complete disengagement at all friction points in eastern Ladakh and that the Indian Army is prepared for all contingencies in the region.Gen Naravane also said that India is dealing with China in a “firm” and “non-escalatory” manner to ensure the sanctity of its claims in eastern Ladakh, and that it was even open to initiating confidence-building measures.

25-06-2021||---||SBI-led consortium gets over Rs 5,800-crore in Mallya loan default case: ED||New Delhi, June 25A State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium that lent loans to fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Friday received Rs 5,824.5 crore in its accounts after shares of UBL, earlier attached under the anti-money laundering law, were sold recently, the ED said.Mallya is accused in a multiple banks loan default case of about Rs 9,000 crore.The disputes resolution tribunal (DRT) had sold these shares on June 23 after the Enforcement Directorate had transferred shares worth about Rs 6,624 crore of UBL to the SBI-led consortium on the directions of a special PMLA court that is hearing the case involving Mallya in Mumbai.These shares were attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by the ED, a central probe agency.“Today, SBI led consortium received Rs 5824.5 crore in its account from the sale of shares of United Breweries Limited.”                “The sale had taken place on 23.06.2021 as sequel to the transfer of the shares to the Recovery Officer by ED,” the central agency tweeted.The rest of the shares worth about Rs 800 are “expected” to be sold and realised in the accounts of the SBI-led group of banks by June 25, it had earlier said.The ED had issued a statement on Wednesday stating that about 40 per cent of the money lost by banks in alleged frauds perpetrated by fugitive businessmen Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Mallya has been recovered so far due to its “swift” action in attaching and freezing their assets.Mallya, who fled to the UK, is being probed by the ED and the CBI for a Rs 9,000 crore alleged bank fraud linked to the operations of his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.On Wednesday, the ED had said the banks had “recovered” Rs 1,357 crore by a similar sale of shares in the case against Mallya.The liquor baron has lost his case against extradition to India and as he has been denied permission to file appeal in the UK Supreme Court, his extradition to India has become final, the ED had said.Commenting on the development, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had tweeted on Wednesday that “Fugitives & economic offenders will be actively pursued; their properties attached & dues recovered”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sbi-led-consortium-gets-over-rs-5-800-crore-in-mallya-loan-default-case-ed-273889
25-06-2021||New Delhi||Govt extends I-T compliance deadlines; exempts tax on employee’s Covid treatment||The government on Friday extended deadlines for various income tax compliances and also exempted from tax the amount given by an employer to employees for Covid-19 treatment.Also, ex-gratia payments received from employers by family members in case of employees’ death due to Covid would be exempt from income tax in fiscal 2019-20 and subsequent years. The limit for such tax-exempted payment would be Rs 10 lakh in case it is received from any other person.“In view of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, taxpayers are facing inconvenience in meeting certain tax compliances and also in filing response to various notices. “In order to ease the compliance burden of taxpayers during this difficult time, reliefs are being provided...,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement.The tax department said many taxpayers have received financial help from their employers and well-wishers for meeting their expenses incurred for treatment of Covid-19. “In order to ensure that no income tax liability arises on this account, it has been decided to provide income-tax exemption to the amount received by a taxpayer for medical treatment from employer or from any person for treatment of Covid-19 during FY 2019-20 and subsequent years,” it added. In case of taxing capital gains arising out of transfer of residential house property, the CBDT said for relief in taxation, the re-investment deadline would be September 3, 2021, for such capital gains.Section 54 of the Income Tax Act provides that in case there is capital gain on account of transfer of a residential house property, such capital gain can be exempt from tax if the taxpayer invests the capital gain amount into another house property within 2 years (in case of purchase of new house) or within 3 years (in case of construction of a house) from date of transfer of original house property.The CBDT circular now provides that in case any such time period of 2 / 3 years is expiring between April 1, 2021 to September 29, 2021, it will be extended to September 30, 2021.Besides, the deadline for making payments under the Vivad Se Vishwas direct tax dispute resolution scheme has been extended by two months till August 31. However, taxpayers have the option to make payments till October 31 with an additional amount of interest. The last date for PAN-Aadhaar linking too has been extended by three months to September 30, 2021, while the same for furnishing Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) certificate in Form 16 to the employees by employers has been extended till July 31, from July 15, 2021. The due date for furnishing TDS statement for the last (January-March) quarter of the 2020-21 has been extended to July 15, from June 30, 2021.The quarterly statement in Form 15CC to be furnished by an authorised dealer for remittances made for the June quarter would have to furnished by July 31.Also, the deadline for furnishing Equalisation Levy Statement in Form No. 1 for the financial year 2020-21, has been extended by a month till July 31, 2021, while for processing Equalisation Levy returns, the time limit has been extended by 3 months till September 30, 2021.Commenting on the measures, Nangia & Co LLP Partner Shailesh Kumar said this would give much needed tax relief to taxpayers, who have received monetary help from their employer, friends and extended families, either for treatment of Covid-19 or on account of death of a family member from the coronavirus infection.  “Though the relief is granted retrospectively from FY 2019-20 onwards, since the due date for filing ITR for FY 2019-20 has already expired, it would be important to see whether the government revives the time limit for filing ITR for FY 2019-20,” Kumar added.The extension of various due dates, be it for PAN-Aadhaar linking, payment of tax/ penalty under Vivad se Vishwas scheme, completion of assessment proceedings, completion of penalty proceedings, registration of charitable trusts and institutions for income tax exemption etc, will provide additional time, both to taxpayers as well as tax authorities, he added.

25-06-2021||New Delhi||Pregnant women can be vaccinated against Covid-19, says Union Health Ministry||The Union Health Ministry on Friday said that pregnant women can be vaccinated against Covid-19.While addressing a press conference on behalf of the Union Health Ministry, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava said, “The Ministry of Health has given guidelines that the vaccine can be given to pregnant woman.”“The vaccine is useful for the pregnant women and it should be given,” Dr Bhargava said.Dr Bhargava said that in terms of administering Covid-19 vaccines to children is still debatable until relevant data is available.“There is only one country that is giving vaccines to children at the moment. Whether very small children will ever need vaccines, is still a question. Till such time, we have more data on vaccination of children, we would not be in a position to vaccinate children at large,” the ICMR director said.“However, we have started a study on children between 2 years to 18 years and we will have a result on it by September,” he added.During the conference, Director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Dr SK Singh informed that a total of 48 cases of Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 have been detected in the country so far.Dr Singh said, “Eight states are important where we have found more than 50 per cent of the variant of concern. These are Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Telangana, and West Bengal.”“Covishield and Covaxin work against the variants of SARS CoV 2 -- alpha, beta, gamma as well as delta. Delta Plus is present in 12 countries. As many as 48 cases have been identified in India but more importantly, they have been very localised,” Dr Bhargava said regarding the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19.Delta Plus or AY.1 will always remain a variant of concern (VoC) as it is mutated from the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), which is also a VoC, he added.Meanwhile, Joint Secretary of the Union Health Ministry Lav Agarwal informed that the recovery rate has increased to 96.7 per cent.“In the 4th week of May, 531 districts of the country were reporting more than 100 cases.

We have administered over three crore doses so far, and with increased pace, Maharashtra can vaccinate its entire eligible population in the next three months,” he said.“Maharashtra has the capacity to administer 10 lakh doses per day. If the Union government increases its supply to match the state's capacity, we can vaccinate the entire population in three months,” he said. As of Friday afternoon, Maharashtra had administered 3,00,27,217 vaccine doses.   Tope also said he has requested Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar to increase the budgetary allocation for the health department. “The NITI Aayog has recommended an expenditure of five per cent of the GDP for the health sector. In reality, it is only 0.9 to 1 per cent. I have asked the government to increase the allocation so that more infrastructure can be developed,” he said. There is scope to increase the number of primary healthcare centres, rural hospitals and sub-centres, the minister said, adding that the state health department was going to fill all 17,000 sanctioned posts soon. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-crore-doses-administered-in-maha-govt-says-can-vaccinate-everybody-in-three-months-273877
25-06-2021||New Delhi||ED to probe money laundering angle in UP religious conversion case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a criminal case of money laundering in connection with alleged conversion of some deaf students and poor people to Islam in Uttar Pradesh with purported funding from Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, officials sources said on Friday.An Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), the ED equivalent of a Police FIR, has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), they said.The matter came to light after the UP Police anti-terrrorist squad (ATS) arrested two men, residents of Jamia Nagar in Delhi, earlier this week. The UP Police had identified the arrested accused as Mufti Qazi Jahangir Alam Qasmi and Mohammad Umar Gautam.The ATS claimed that they ran an outfit, named Islamic Dawah Center, that purportedly had access to funds from Pakistan’s inter-services intelligence (ISI) and other foreign agencies to carry out their alleged illegal activities.The ED studied this FIR and registered the money laundering case.Its probe will be focused on the allegation that illicit funds were received from abroad and domestic sources and laundered by the accused and their associates, official sources said.The agency has powers to attach assets of the accused during the investigation stage and file charge sheet against them before a PMLA court later for prosecution and award of punishment that can range between three and seven years as prescribed under law.After the arrest, Uttar Pradesh Police ADG (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar had told the media that Gautam, who himself is a convert to Islam from Hinduism, boasted to the police of having converted at least 1,000 people to Islam, luring them with marriage, money and jobs.The officer said that the ATS had been working on the case after it obtained intelligence that some people were getting funds from ISI and other foreign agencies for converting poor people to Islam and spreading communal enmity in the society.The two were booked on various charges under the IPC and Uttar Pradesh’s stringent anti-conversion law.They, at present, are in police custody.

Some of the victims had complained about vaccine vials used in the camps having broken seals. Considering the danger in which the accused put people at these camps, we have slapped section 308, which is for attempt to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, apart from other IPC provisions,” said Vishwas Nangre Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order).The Joint CP, addressing a press conference, said at least nine such camps were held in Mumbai between May 25 and June 6, and seven cases have been registered at various police stations here so far.He said the police had received information about a camp that was held for over 500 people on April 24, adding that all such inoculation events where the beneficiaries did not receive certificates will be checked starting from April 24.“So far, the police have recorded the statement of at least 200 people, and have recovered 114 duplicate certificates which were uploaded on CoWin app. The accounts of main accused Mahendra Pratap Singh, who owns an event management firm, and Manish Tripathi, who has a nursing institute, have been frozen. Singh’s firm was actively involved in organizing such camps and it was manned by students from Tripathi’s institute,” the Joint CP informed.He said the vaccine vials were provided by Shivam Hospital in Charkop in Kandivali, and Dr Shivraj Pataria and Neeta Pataria have been arrested in this connection. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccination-camp-fraud-sit-formed-doses-had-saline-water-273874

25-06-2021||New Delhi||PM's meeting with J-K leaders 'positive' step; Centre must restore statehood before assembly polls: Karan Singh||Describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with top political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir as a "very positive step", veteran Congress leader and former J&K governor Karan Singh on Friday said statehood must be restored before holding assembly polls there and asserted that such a move would go a long way in helping to "heal the wounds" of the people.Singh, the son of Maharaja Hari Singh who signed the terms of Kashmir's accession in 1947, also said his personal opinion is that prima facie the revocation of special status under Article 370 seems "irreversible" but asserted that the matter was before the Supreme Court and it must be decided by the top court.In an interview with PTI, the last Sadr-e-Riyasat and first governor of the erstwhile state also demanded that the Centre must provide a "financial-cum- developmental package" to the people whose livelihoods were badly affected during the last two years following the Centre's move to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories and revoke its special status.His remarks come a day after Modi held talks with top political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir and told them that the Centre's priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy there for which delimitation has to happen quickly for polls to be held.Reacting to the prime minister's meeting with 14 political leaders of Jammu and Kashmir, including four former chief ministers, Singh said, "I definitely think it is a very positive step. First of all, because everybody was involved and people who once were discarded as anti-national, they all came -- National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party both." "I believe everybody spoke their mind very frankly and the prime minister listened very attentively to everybody. Three and a half hours of the meeting was there and my own view is that it is a very positive move because something was needed to break the ice," the former Union minister said.The whole situation after the change of status had become "ossified politically", Singh said, adding that the meeting was the start of a political process that is to be welcomed.Asked about the demand of most of Jammu and Kashmir leaders of restoration of statehood, he said it was a unanimous view because after being in special status for 70 years suddenly to be demoted to not even a state down to a Union Territory is "something nobody in Jammu and Kashmir has appreciated"."So statehood is a universal demand, the question is timing. Now as I understand the situation, the first step now is delimitation. The delimitation commission is already working, they should submit their report very soon. After delimitation then the next step is elections. My own view is that...we should have elections as a full state," Singh said.He asserted that full statehood for Jammu and Kashmir should definitely be restored before assembly elections because if it goes to polls as a Union territory and then becomes a state, that would not make any sense because the situations are different with difference in status."As soon as possible, we should get statehood, I mean if we get it tomorrow there is nothing like it but in any case when we fight the next elections we must fight them as a full-fledged state," the 90-year-old leader said.Singh also lamented that it was a "strange irony" that his father signed the instrument of accession for the whole state and "today we are having to fight for statehood".Asked if statehood could reduce "dil ki doori' -- a term used by Prime Minister Modi at the meeting, Singh said restoring statehood will go a long way to help "heal the wounds"."By itself, it won't be enough but it would definitely be a major step," he added.Asked about calls from a section for restoring Article 370 provisions that granted special status to J&K and were abrogated in 2019, Singh said, "My personal belief in this is that it seems to me prima facie that the changes are irreversible but the matter is before the Supreme Court so we shouldn't unnecessarily make any detailed comment on it what should be done and what should not be done." The veteran Congress leader urged the Supreme Court to take up the matter soon, asserting that it was a very crucial and important issue that should be given priority.  Asked about divergent views struck by Congress leaders on the Article 370 issue, Singh said he was not a Congress spokesperson and would not want to speak on behalf of the party."I expressed my personal view that it did not seem to me that Article 370 can be restored...My view may be slightly divergent from others. But the consensus is what Ghulam Nabi (Azad) said" and the matter is before the Supreme Court and they will decide on it.Asked what were his expectations from the Centre on J&K going forward, Singh said he expected that they would move forward as they say on delimitation, elections and statehood.Demanding a financial-cum- developmental package for the people of J&K, Singh said for two years the state suffered very heavily."The whole Kashmir Valley, the horticulture was destroyed, tourism which is our mainstay was destroyed so tens of hundreds of crores of losses were suffered," he said, adding that in Jammu also heavy losses were incurred."So they should first compensate those people who lost during those two years," he said.Modi's J&K outreach saw the prime minister conveying to the 14 political leaders from the union territory during their face-to-face meeting here that he wanted to end the 'Dilli ki Doori' as well as 'Dil ki Doori' (distance from Delhi as well as the distance of hearts) with Jammu and Kashmir, which has witnessed a prolonged spell of militancy and unrest.The four former chief ministers of the erstwhile state who participated in the discussions were Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah of the National Conference, Congress' Ghulam Nabi Azad and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti.Four former deputy chief ministers were in attendance too - Congress' Tara Chand, People's Conference leader Muzaffar Hussain Baig and BJP's Nirmal Singh and Kavinder Gupta.CPI-M leader Mohammed Yusuf Tarigami, Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) chief Altaf Bukhari, Sajjad Lone of the People's Conference, J-K Congress head G A Mir, BJP's Ravinder Raina and Panthers Party leader Bhim Singh also formed part of the delegation.This was the first interaction between the top leadership of the Union government and mainstream parties in J&K since August 5, 2019, when the Centre revoked its special status provided under Article 370 and bifurcated the border state into Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pms-meeting-with-j-k-leaders-positive-step-centre-must-restore-statehood-before-assembly-polls-karan-singh-273865
25-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC declines to stay release of film based on Sushant Rajput’s ‘exceptional life’||The Delhi High Court on Friday declined to stay the release of movie ‘Nyay: The Justice’, purportedly based on late Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s life, in cinema halls and on OTT platforms, saying there is no “unholy interest” in the story of the man’s life which was “exceptional”.A Vacation Bench of Justices Anup Jairam Bhambhani and Jasmeet Singh said there is nothing to show that there would be “any detrimental effect” on Rajput’s reputation by production of movies about his life based on “what is available in public domain”.Rajput’s father Krishna Kishore Singh had challenged a single judge’s order refusing to stay on the film or to restrain anyone from using his son’s name or likeness in movies.The high court said there was no written script or story which has been used by the filmmaker and refused to pass any interim order on the appeal by Sushant’s father.“There is nothing that they (makers) have or they could have had used except what is available in the public domain. There is no unholy interest in the life story because the man’s life was an exceptional life which is a plausible theme for a movie and they have made a movie,” the court said.The high court issued notice and sought response from the movie’s director Dilip Gulati and producers Sarla Saraogi and Rahul Sharma and others while posting the matter for hearing on July 14.The Bench noted the submission of senior advocate Chander Lal that the film has been released on website and a mobile app on June 11 as scheduled.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Rajput’s father, argued that the producer and the director of the film have commercially exploited life story of the actor who allegedly committed suicide at his Mumbai home last year.Salve argued that the single judge has misdirected, misapplied and misinterpreted law laid down by the Supreme Court in Puttaswamy case (Right to Privacy).At the outset, the counsel appearing for the director of the movie told the court that the film has been released on the OTT platform named Lapalap original as scheduled.Salve, however, said: “This is some obscure platform and only God knows what kind of website is this.”He said the movie is going to infringe upon the right to privacy and the right to a fair trial and with each passing day, it is causing damage to the reputation of the actor.“The film is trying to portray his life. What exactly happened to him is still under investigation. You cannot jump the gun,” Salve said.The high court had earlier sought to know whether ‘Nyay: The Justice’, purportedly based on Rajput’s life, has been released as scheduled on June 11 after both the director of the film and the actor’s father gave contradictory statements on the aspect.The single judge had on June 10, refused to stay the release of several movies, including ‘Nyay: The Justice’, saying these films are neither portrayed as biopic nor factual narration of what transpired in his life.“Posthumous privacy right is not permissible,” it had said in its interim order on a plea by Rajput’s father to restrain such films.The single judge had earlier said it found merit in the submissions of producers and directors that if information of events which have occurred is already in the public domain, one cannot plead any violation of right to privacy on a movie inspired from such events.Some of the upcoming or proposed movie projects based on his son’s life include, ‘Suicide or Murder: A star was lost’, ‘Shashank’ and an unnamed crowd-funded film.The court had directed the filmmakers to render complete accounts of the revenue earned from the films, if any case of damages is made out in future and listed the suit for completion of pleading before the joint registrar.It had said the producers and directors claimed the films to be fictional rendition of true events surrounding the lives of film/TV personalities, including Rajput who was found dead at his home in Mumbai. The investigation is still on.The high court said it did not find merit in the plaintiff’s contention to restraint on the strength of his right to fair trial relating to the unnatural death of his son, saying no foundation is set up to demonstrate how the films would impair the trial.It had termed as misconceived plea that the content of the film is defamatory and will damage his and his son’s reputation.The suit has claimed that in case a “movie, web-series, book or any other content of similar nature is allowed to be published or broadcasted, it would affect the right of the victim and deceased for a free and fair trial as it may cause prejudice to them”.It has also contended that Rajput being a well-known celebrity, “any misuse of his name/ image/ caricature/ style of delivering dialogues also amounts to infringement of the personality right vested with the plaintiff besides amounting to acts of passing off”.The contentions of Rajput’s father have been opposed by the filmmakers of the upcoming and proposed movies.

25-06-2021||New Delhi||Narada scam: SC annuls HC order refusing to accept replies of Mamata Banerjee, law minister||The Supreme Court Friday annulled the Calcutta High Court's June 9 order refusing to take on record the reply-affidavits of West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and state Law Minister Moloy Ghatak on their role on the day of arrest of four Trinamool Congress leaders on May 17 by CBI in Narada scam case.  A vacation bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari asked the high court to decide “de-novo” the fresh pleas, to be filed by Banerjee, Ghatak and the state government on or before June 28, before proceeding with the main petition of the CBI seeking transfer of the scam case to the high court itself.“We are of the opinion that the Petitioners (State, CM and Law Minister) ought to have given an application to take their respective affidavits on record especially when the submissions of the parties were going on and had progressed substantially.“At this stage, suggestion was made by this court that the matter could be remanded back to the High Court to be decided afresh. On the basis of the reasons given in the application which is filed by the Petitioners. Counsel of the parties have graciously agreed..,” the bench said in its order.Taking note of the fact that the high court is scheduled to hear the case on June 29, the bench directed the Banerjee and others to file their fresh applications for bringing on record their replies on or before June 28 after serving advance copies to CBI and other necessary parties.“The CBI and other parties, if they so desire, may file their counter affidavits to the applications (of CM, Law Minister and the state) by June 29 after serving advance copies of the same by June 28.“We request the High Court to first decide the applications of Petitioners herein before proceeding to decide the merits. We may further add that as prejudice is caused to the parties, the order of June 9 stands annulled,” the bench ordered, adding the issue be decided ''de-novo ".The CBI has alleged that Banerjee, Ghatak and other TMC leaders had played a key role in stopping it from performing legal duty after arresting four leaders in the case.It claimed that while Banerjee sat on a dharna at the CBI office in Kolkata soon after the arrest of the four accused, Ghatak had been present at the Banshall Court premises during the virtual hearing of the case before the special CBI court on May 17.The high court had on June 9 refused to accept the reply-affidavits of the state, the chief minister and the law minister on their role, saying it would consider this aspect later.Ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, Trinamool Congress MLA Madan Mitra and former mayor of Kolkata Sovan Chatterjee were arrested by the CBI which is investigating the Narada sting tape case on a 2017 order of the high court.At the outset on Friday, the vacation bench said it would hear the lawyers for five minutes each to decide whether a full-fledged hearing was needed or the matter can be remanded to high court for a “de-novo adjudication”.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for Banerjee and Ghatak, said the replies were needed to be taken on record for proper and just adjudication of the CBI's petition.Bringing the replies on records became necessary as CBI is praying for transfer of the case to the high court by referring to the gathering of people in the trial court complex and outside the CBI office at the time of arrest, Dwivedi said.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the state, said that as per the high court rules, the permission to file affidavit was not necessary and the state sought it as a courtesy which was denied.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, opposed the pleas for bringing on record the replies saying the probe agency had moved a plea for transfer of trial and declaration of proceedings in the trial court, granting bail to the four accused, as nullity on various grounds.“Trial court had granted the bail. We were unable to produce the accused due to certain circumstances, so we moved to high court,” Mehta said, adding that the Advocate General had accepted the notice on behalf of the state on May 27 itself.“I had objected to the filing of the affidavits saying that they were filed to fill up the lacunae. They have taken a calculated risk..,” he said.The bench however decided to send the issue for de-novo adjudication by the high court.The CBI, which has filed an application seeking transfer of the Narada sting tape case from the special CBI court to the high court, has made the chief minister and the law minister parties in its plea there.The five-judge bench of high court, comprising ACJ Bindal and justices I P Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Arijit Banerjee, had granted interim bail on May 28 to the four Narada scam accused.The special CBI court had granted them bail on May 17 itself, but the order was stayed by the high court, which remanded them to judicial custody.They had been placed under house arrest on May 21 by the high court, modifying its earlier order of stay on the bail.The Narada sting operation was conducted by journalist Mathew Samuel of Narada News, a web portal, in 2014 wherein some people resembling TMC ministers, MPs and MLAs were seen receiving money from representatives of a fictitious company in lieu of favours.At that time, the four arrested politicians were ministers in the Mamata Banerjee government.The sting operation was made public ahead of the 2016 assembly elections in West Bengal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narada-scam-sc-annuls-hc-order-refusing-to-accept-replies-of-mamata-banerjee-law-minister-273861
25-06-2021||New Delhi||Have cancelled Class 12 board exam, will declare result by July 31, Andhra tells SC||The Andhra Pradesh government on Friday told the Supreme Court that it has cancelled Class 12 examination which was to be conducted by the state board and would declare result of internal assessment by July 31.A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari was informed by senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for Andhra Pradesh, that he had discussed the matter with the chief minister on Thursday and the state government has decided to cancel the exam.The apex court had on Thursday told the Andhra Pradesh government that it was not convinced of the precautionary measures suggested by the state for holding Class 12 board exams and had said unless satisfied that there will be no fatality due to Covid, it will not allow them.The bench was hearing a plea seeking directions to state governments not to hold board exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Considering the matter and the way it has progressed, although we had made full preparations for the examination …. looking at the sentiments expressed by the court, I had a discussion with the chief minister yesterday and I advised them. They have also decided to cancel the exam,” Dave told the bench during the hearing conducted through video-conferencing on Friday.Dave said in 10 days, a high-powered committee which will be constituted would devise the assessment scheme.“We will follow the timeline of July 31 and declare the results,” he said, adding that if the examination was conducted then the declaration of results would have gone in August.Dave said if the entire country is going in one direction, then state of Andhra Pradesh would also go the same way.“We appreciate the practical and very pragmatic stand taken by the state. We wish you could have appeared before us earlier,” the bench said, adding that “probably” what was discussed yesterday was “avoidable”.Dave said the bench was right and if something unforeseen would have happened, then it would “weigh on our hearts”.“This is very unpredictable and very harsh,” the bench said.Dave, while referring to election rallies and Kumbh mela in Uttarakhand, said that no one has taken the responsibility and common people have suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic.“We can end this proceeding on the note that all is well that ends well,” the bench observed, adding that the state has taken a decision which is good for everybody as the entire humanity is facing it.The bench was told that a notification regarding cancellation of state board examination in the state would be issued shortly.The top court said it was reiterating its direction passed on Thursday that all state boards would declare the results of internal assessment of Class 12 examination by July 31, as done in the matter of CBSE and CISCE.The bench had on Thursday said that state boards were free to formulate their own assessment scheme for evaluating students and there can’t be a “fit-all” scheme.The apex court had said it would not pass any direction for a uniform assessment scheme across the country for students whose board exams have been cancelled amid the Covid-19 pandemic.It had directed the state boards to ensure that schemes are formulated and notified at the earliest and not later than 10 days from Thursday.The bench, which had posed tough questions to the Andhra Pradesh government on its decision to hold Class 12 board examinations, had asked the state’s counsel to place before it the “snapshot of the file” giving reasons to hold the test.Later on Thursday, the Andhra Pradesh government announced the cancellation of the year-end examinations for Class 10 and intermediate.In its affidavit filed earlier in the apex court, the Andhra Pradesh government had said that it will be able to conduct Class 12 exams successfully as there are no reliable alternatives to assess the state board students.

25-06-2021||Kochi||Kerala High Court grants anticipatory bail to Ayesha Sulthana in sedition case||The Kerala High Court on Friday granted anticipatory bail to Lakshadweep filmmaker Ayesha Sulthana in a sedition case registered against her by the Kavaratti police.A case was registered on June 9 under Sections 124-A (sedition) and 153-B (hate speech) of the IPC on the basis of a petition lodged by a political leader from Kavaratti.Granting bail, Justice Ashok Menon said there was no apparent indication in her statement, which amounted to imputations or assertions prejudicial to the national interest, nor did it propagate any class of persons against another group of persons.The court said in the event of her arrest, she would be released on bail on execution of bond for Rs 50,000 with two solvent sureties each for like amount to the satisfaction of the officer arresting her.Following the registration of the FIR in Lakshadweep, Sulthana had approached the Kerala High Court seeking anticipatory bail.Last week, the high court had granted her interim anticipatory bail for a week, while reserving orders on her anticipatory bail application.The court had directed her to comply with the notice given by Kavaratti police to appear before them for interrogation on June 20 in connection with the case.The court had ordered that she be granted interim anticipatory bail if she is arrested.The allegation is that the filmmaker, while participating in a debate telecast by a Malayalam news channel on June 7, had said the Centre used biological weapons against the people of Lakshadweep.When the anticipatory bail plea came up, her counsel had submitted that Sulthana had clarified her remarks later and tendered an apology for making the statement.Sulthana submitted that she never realised that usage of the word bio-weapon is an offence and the remark was made not intending to create hatred in the minds of the people.She said she was ready to appear before police for questioning but sought protection from arrest.Opposing her anticipatory bail plea, the Lakshadweep administration had said Sulthana promoted separatism and communalism even in the minds of schoolchildren by making such a statement.Sulthana was interrogated by the Kavaratti police on Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday in connection with the case.Emerging from the police station at Kavaratti, after nearly a three-hour-long interrogation on Thursday, Sulthana had claimed, "Everything is over. I am told that I can go back to Kochi. I will reach Kochi tomorrow or the day after."

Post-reinstatement, he was heading the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the crime branch and handling high profile cases, including the fake TRP case, fake social media followers case, among others.

We remember all those greats who resisted the Emergency and protected Indian democracy," he tweeted while sharing a link about several draconian measures taken by the then Congress government. The #DarkDaysOfEmergency can never be forgotten.

25-06-2021||New Delhi||Complaint registered in UK against Mehul Choksi’s lawyer||Complaint against Michael Polak, lawyer of Indian fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi, has been registered to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) in England and Wales for having no evidence for his claim regarding the case of his client.According to Writeups 24, the complaint asserted that Polak had no evidence on what he told to the media or registered a complaint to the Scotland Yard and War Crimes Unit regarding the suspected abduction of Choksi.The complainant suggested that doing a KYC (know your customer) on a client is extremely important in the United Kingdom. At the same time, it appears that Polak failed at conducting KYC and AML (anti-money laundering) checks on his client Choki, who is a wanted fraudster by India.Writeups 24 further said that the SRA might initiate an inquiry against Polak and his company seeking KYC, AML, source of funds and payment gateway in which he has been paid by billion-dollar fraudster Choksi currently arrested in Dominica.Along with that, an inquiry is also expected to take strict actions against his statements and publications by Justice Abroad Limited defaming several people without furnishing appropriate proof fabricating the evidence.Choksi, who is currently in Dominica facing trial, went missing from Antigua on May 23 and was caught in Dominica. He was charged with illegal entry into Dominica by police after he allegedly fled Antigua and Barbuda in a possible attempt to avoid extradition to India.The images and videos released by Choksi’s legal team purportedly show individuals including Indian-origin men involved in an elaborate operation to take Choksi from Antigua to Dominica on May 23, Antigua News Room reported.Justice Abroad, the law firm has claimed Choksi was kidnapped with the help of a female acquaintance and men who gagged and tied him to a wheelchair and used at least one unmarked boat to transport him from Antigua to Dominica.Polak had said the intention behind the entire episode was to “whisk away” Choksi to India by shortening the legal process. “The evidence, in this case, shows that Choksi was kidnapped from Antigua, where he had outstanding cases before the courts, and unlawfully renditioned to Dominica.”“We believe that the aim was for him to be whisked away to India bypassing the proper legal processes in Antigua and Dominica,” Antigua News Room quoted Polak as saying.Citing the media reports, the Caribbean news portal further reported that in documents and photographs, the legal team fighting the case in Dominica shows a few men who appeared to be of Indian origin on the deck of a boat that was allegedly used to transport Choksi from Antigua.Two videos shared by the legal team show an unnamed boat allegedly carrying Choksi moving faster than the permissible limit of 8 kmph.The legal team of Choksi claims that he came to the beachfront villa in Antigua of his recent acquaintance Barbara Jarabik in the evening of May 23 and soon was overpowered by a group of men who “rushed out and beat him”. He was “gagged and tied to a wheelchair” at knifepoint and placed on the unmarked boat.Choksi’s team has been claiming that he belongs to Antigua as he acquired citizenship of that island in 2018. Meanwhile, Indian authorities told the Dominica High Court in their affidavit that Choksi is an Indian citizen and noted that he is erroneously claiming renunciation of citizenship under the Citizenship Act, 1955.The 62-year-old fugitive is wanted in India in connection with the Rs 13,500 crore fraud in Punjab National Bank.

25-06-2021||Los Angeles||Judge keeps India terror attack suspect Tahawwur Rana in US custody||A former Chicago businessman will remain in the United States as a federal judge in Los Angeles weighs whether he will be extradited to India for his alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack that killed more than 160 people.Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-born Canadian, is wanted by Indian authorities for his alleged involvement in the deadly attacks that are sometimes referred to as India's 9/11. An Indian warrant for his arrest was issued in August 2018.Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Chooljian on Thursday ordered the defence attorneys and prosecutors to file additional documents by July 15. Rana will remain in federal custody.Indian authorities allege that Rana conspired with his childhood friend David Coleman Headley to assist the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba in the orchestration of the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people, injured more than 200 and caused USD 1.5 billion in damage.Headley and Rana attended military high school in Pakistan together. Rana's immigration law centre in Chicago, as well as a satellite office in Mumbai, was allegedly used as a front for their terrorism activities between 2006 and 2008, prosecutors say.Rana's attorneys said their client was not aware of Headley's terrorism plot and was merely trying to help his childhood friend and set up a Mumbai business office.They also said Headley is a serial liar who has deceived the US government multiple times in several criminal cases, and his testimony should not be viewed as credible. The attorneys alleged that Headley had used Rana to further his terrorism efforts without Rana's knowledge.Rana's two daughters attended the hearing. They declined to comment, as did his lawyers.Rana wore a white jumpsuit and black glasses, as well as a mask at the hearing. His ankles were shackled.Only one of the 10 Mumbai terrorists survived the four-day rampage and went on trial. He was convicted, sentenced to death in India and hanged.

We are only now seeing the first cases of the Delta variant in Israel - about 200 of those - so we will know more soon," she told reporters on Wednesday.An analysis by Public Health England (PHE), where the Delta variant is more widespread, found that both the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines provide more than 90% protection against hospitalization from the Delta variant.In Israel, more than half the 9.3 million population has received both Pfizer shots and a steep drop in cases has prompted most economic restrictions to be lifted.But confirmed cases have risen in the past few days and health authorities have urged parents to vaccinate their 12-to 15-year-olds, who were made eligible this month.Alroy-Preis said around 65% of Israel's population was protected against COVID-19, either by vaccination or by recovering from the disease, a figure she said was still far from providing "herd immunity." - Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pfizer-says-covid-vaccine-highly-effective-against-delta-variant-273411

We all agreed that we must work for the democracy. The prime minister has assured that he will do everything to make Jammu and Kashmir a zone of peace rather than a zone of conflict,” Baig told reporters after the meeting.Baig said the government side conveyed that the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir will be held after the completion of the ongoing delimitation process.“We were conveyed that the delimitation process will be completed first and thereafter a call will be taken on holding the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.However, he said, no time frame has been given on holding the polls.“Almost everyone at meeting raised the demand for restoration of statehood of Jammu and Kashmir,” he said, adding the prime minister carefully listened to every issue raised by the political leaders.Earlier, fourteen leaders of mainstream J-K mainstream parties arrived at the PM’s residence to attend the meeting with everyone having welcomed the resumption of talks—the first outreach by the Centre since the Abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into the UTs of JK and Ladakh.The meeting had no specific agenda, with leaders free to raise what they want.Before entering the meeting, Chairman of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration and National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah again hailed the PM’s initiative and distanced himself from PDP president Mehbooba Mufti’s remarks that the Centre should also talk to Pakistan for the resolution of the Kashmir issue.“I don’t want to talk about Pakistan. I will talk to my own Prime Minister,” Abdullah said when asked what he thought of Mufti’s remarks being her ally in the PAGD.Abdullah said Mufti has her agenda and party and he, in the NC, had his separate agenda.“The meeting is a very welcome step, much needed for easing tensions in JK. We are going with an open mind,” he said.The meeting is being attended by four former CMs Farooq Abdullah, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti; four former JK deputy CMs Nirmal Singh, Kavinder Gupta, Tara Chand, Muzaffar Baig present along with chiefs of mainstream JK parties including state Congress president GA Mir, BJP state chief Ravinder Raina, JK Panthers Party chief Bhim Singh, Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari, People’s Conference chief Sajjad Lone.The Congress and PAGD have sought restoration of JK statehood ahead of the meeting with Abdullah saying the alliance would disclose what it raised once the meeting concluded.The government meanwhile is expected to hear all parties first and then impress upon the critical importance of the ongoing delimitation in JK.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said during the last Parliament session that the election in JK will be held once theThe delimitation exercise is over and the EC declares elections.On statehood, Home Minister Amit Shah has said it will be restored at an appropriate time.Kashmir parties have been wary of the delimitation and feel it’s an attempt to alter the demography of the area and undermine the significance of the Valley in the overall electoral process.NC had boycotted the first meet of the delimitation commission in February this year saying it cannot participate in the exercise that flows from the JK Reorganisation Act which it has challenged in the apex court.Twenty-two petitions against the law (passed by Parliament on August 5, 2019 bifurcating the state and abrogating special status) are pending hearing before a Constitution Bench of the SC. — with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-committed-to-democratic-process-pm-modi-tells-j-k-leaders-273371
