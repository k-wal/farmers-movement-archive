01-06-2021||New Delhi||IUML moves SC against  move to grant citizenship to minorities from three neighbouring countries||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has moved the Supreme Court against the Centre’s move to grant citizenship to minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh currently residing in 13 districts in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Punjab. In an application filed in the top court, IUML accused the Centre of going back on the assurance given to the court which is seized of its petition challenging the validity of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019. The Centre had said staying the CAA wasn’t necessary as the rules had not been framed, it pointed out.IUML urged the top court to stay any further proceedings pursuant to the May 28 MHA notification during the pendency of petitions against the CAA.Notified on January 10 last year, the CAA relaxes norms for grant of Indian citizenship by naturalization to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist and Jain and Parsi victims of religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who came to India before December 31, 2014. The top court had on January 22, 2020, refused to stay the operation of the CAA and the National Population Register (NPR) and indicated that ultimately a five-judge Bench might have to decide these issues.The Centre had defended the CAA, contending it won’t affect the legal, democratic or secular rights of citizens.The MHA had on Friday issued a notification for immediate implementation of the order under the Citizenship Act 1955 and Rules framed under the law in 2009 even though the rules under the CAA 2019 were yet to be framed.Terming it manifestly illegal, IUML said if the Centre’s notification was implemented and citizenship was given to persons on the basis of their religion, and, thereafter, if this Court struck down the Amendment Act and rules providing citizenship on the basis of religion was declared void, it would be impossible to implement the order. “In exercise of powers conferred under Section 16 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby directs that powers exercisable by it for registration as citizen of India under Section 5, or for grant of certificate of naturalisation under section 6 of the Citizenship Act 1955 in respect of any person belonging to minority community in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, residing in the districts mentioned and the states mentioned below,” the MHA notification read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iuml-moves-sc-against%C2%A0-move-to-grant-citizenship-to-minorities-from-three-neighbouring-countries-261801

This double tick will appear after verification of vaccination status from the CoWIN portal.Vaccination status can be updated through the mobile number used for CoWIN registration.“On taking the self-assessment on Aarogya Setu, those users who have taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine will get the tab of ‘partially vaccination/vaccinated (unverified)’ on the home screen of Aarogya Setu.“This is based on the declaration of vaccination status given by the user during the self-assessment. The unverified status becomes verified after an OTP based check from the CoWIN backend,” the statement said.The home screen of Aarogya Setu will read “You are vaccinated” after 14 days of the second dose.“This would make easy checking of vaccination status possible for travel and access to various premises,” it said.Over 19 crore people in India are using Aarogya Setu app. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-individuals-can-update-vaccination-status-on-aarogya-setu-app-261800
01-06-2021||New Delhi||Ramdev has irreparably damaged govt’s efforts to contain pandemic: IMA||Guru Ramdev has “irreparably” damaged the government’s efforts to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and people creating confusion during such a time are “anti-national”, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said on Tuesday.The doctors’ body in an open letter to citizens, also alleged that Ramdev thought it fit to launch his tirade against national Covid treatment protocols and the vaccination programme to look for an opportunity to “market” his products. Ramdev has “irreparably damaged the Indian government’s efforts to contain the pandemic”, the IMA said.“People creating confusion during an epidemic regarding national treatment protocols and the national vaccination programme are traitors and anti-nationals. They are anti-people and anti-humanity. They deserve no mercy,” it said.The IMA has extended support to the black ribbon protest called by the Federation of Resident Doctors Associations (FORDA), and other medical and resident doctors’ associations of the country against Ramdev.The IMA said modern medicine is in the frontline of the fight against the pandemic and 1,300 doctors have sacrificed their lives for the nation.Starting from medical students and resident doctors to critical care and emergency care physicians, every single doctor has been deployed in the defence of the people, it said in the letter.“Creating confusion in the minds of the people against the national Covid protocols and national vaccination programme is an anti-national act of heinous proportions. The IMA has demanded to deem it as sedition and prosecute him (Ramdev) under the Disaster Management Act,” the association said.“His calling modern medicine a stupid science is a totally different criminal act. Inaction from the government would seriously hurt the doctors who are fighting the pandemic,” it said in the letter.Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust on May 22 denied allegations by the IMA that the yoga guru has misled people by making “unlearned” statements against allopathy and defamed scientific modern medicine       Citing a video circulating on social media, the IMA had said Ramdev is seen saying that “allopathy ek aisi stupid aur diwalilya science hai... (allopathy is such a stupid science)”.       Ramdev has “utmost regards” for doctors and support staff who have been working day and night during such a challenging time of the pandemic, the Haridwar-based Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust had said in a statement.“Swami jee has no ill-will against modern science and good practitioners of modern medicine. What is being attributed against him is false and nugatory,” the statement signed by Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust General Secretary Acharya Balakrishna had said.Ramdev later withdrew his statement on allopathy after a strong-worded letter from Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.Alleging that Ramdev’s supporters have attempted “diversionary tactics of malicious attacks” on the IMA and its national president, the doctors’ body said nothing will deviate it from its resolve to nail “this anti-national”. The IMA’s activities are within the four corners of the law, it said. “The total number of Covid-19 patients in the country so far is 2.78 crores and 2.54 crores have recovered. Our case fatality rate remains 1.16 per cent. Even with the limitations of official statistics it can be seen that Indian doctors, nurses and health care workers have fought tirelessly,” it said. “Countless children and family members of doctors have been infected. To trivialise these martyrs and the warriors is a sacrilege. IMA beholds to the nation to draw its own conclusions. History will record the services of its doctors. Posterity will also name the criminals,” the IMA said in its letter. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramdev-has-irreparably-damaged-govts-efforts-to-contain-pandemic-ima-261796

01-06-2021||New Delhi||Nation needs to save younger generation by vaccinating them, says Delhi HC||The younger generation which has lost so many lives to Covid-19 should have been vaccinated first as it is the nation’s future but the jabs were prioritised for the elderly who have lived their lives, the Delhi High Court observed on Tuesday.The court made it clear however that it was not at all saying the lives of older people are not important as the emotional support which the elderly persons provide to a family cannot be discounted.Justice Sanghi, speaking for himself, said that in the second wave of Covid-19, it was the younger generation which was more affected and they are not getting vaccines and added “I don’t understand this vaccination policy at all”.“I can speak for myself... You have announced the vaccination policy for 18 to 44 years old persons now but you don’t have vaccines. Then why you have to announce and make a declaration when you don’t have the vaccines? We have to invest in the future and we are sidelining them,” Justice Sanghi said.“We have to secure our future for that we need to vaccinate our younger generation and here we are giving priority to 60 plus who have lived their lives. It is the younger lot which is the future, we are on our way out,” he added.The judge pointed out that so many young people have lost their lives to Covid-19.He added that in this time of crisis, if a choice has to be made, “we have to choose the younger one” because an 80-year-old person has lived his live and he will not take the country forward.“Ideally, we should be able to save everyone but if we have to choose, we have to save younger people,” the judge said.When the Centre’s counsel said only God can help us now, the judge said this is the area where even God cannot help us if we do not act ourselves, noting the facts and figures.“Why are you feeling shy? It is the duty of the government to lay down the way forward. Other countries have done it. In Italy, they said sorry for old people we do not have beds,” Justice Sanghi said.The court’s observations came while hearing pleas relating to management of Covid-19 crisis in Delhi, including shortage of medicine to treat black fungus patients.

A deliberate attempt has been made to keep the principal Opposition party, the Congress, out of GoM set up by the Centre after the Council meet on May 28,” said Gehlot in a social media post. Keeping out the Congress members is most unfortunate and strikes at the very roots of cooperative federalism, he added.Gehlot also took up cudgels on behalf of Mamata Banerjee and Stalin and said their Finance Ministers, who like their counterparts from Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Rajasthan, were kept out of the GoM because they had taken a stand contrary to that of proposed agenda at the GST Council meet on May 28. Kerala too had taken a similar position as the Congress but its Finance Minister has been included in the GoM.The GoM will submit its report on June 8.“We request the eight members of the GoM to reflect on the exclusion of the Congress Finance ministers before they proceed with their deliberations. We also urge the members of GoM to take into account views expressed by Rajasthan and other mentioned states, wherein we had asked for a zero tax rate for Covid-related supplies in public interest,’’ he said.At the GST Council meet, several opposition Finance Ministers had favoured zero duty on Covid related items including vaccines. But Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman held on to her earlier position that GST had been suitably reduced and any further reduction may not benefit patients.Who all are in GoM—Convenor, Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma—Gujarat Deputy CM Nitinbhai Patel—Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar—Goa Transport Minister Mauvin Godinho—Kerala Finance Minister K.N.

It is one based on international law and the UN Charter, that recognizes the sovereign equality of all States, and respects their territorial integrity while displaying mutual respect for interests and concerns of all," he said."It is only by conducting our policies in accordance with these principles that we can expect to bring about the change we desire," he added.Jaishankar said the BRICS, has over the years evolved its unique model of engagement that is based on consensus and that its collective endeavour is also to ensure that global decision-making reflects contemporary realities."To this end, we have identified four key deliverables for our chairship -- reform of the multilateral system, counter-terrorism cooperation, using digital and technological solutions to achieve SDGs, and enhancing people-to-people cooperation," he said."I am very happy to note that we have made substantial progress on each of these areas in the past five months with the continued cooperation and support of our partners," he added.The BRICS brings together five of the largest developing countries of the world, representing 41 per cent of the global population, 24 per cent of the global GDP and 16 per cent of the global trade.In his comments, Wang expressed solidarity with India as it has been dealing with a severe second wave of the coronavirus pandemic."Let me begin by expressing my sympathy to India over the severe impact of the new wave of COVID-19 infections.

In June last year, 90 foreign cadets had passed out.With current strength of 222 foreign trainees, almost every fourth cadet at the IMA is from a foreign Army reflecting the stellar international standing of the academy and its reputed training regime.The academy has been pursuing a visionary transformation of its infrastructure and training methodology towards preparing the young military leaders for the complexities of the future battlefields.The Covid pandemic posed serious challenges for the IMA but the extremely pro-active measures and strict enforcement of requisite protocols ensured a largely Covid-free environment at the academy, which progressed uninterrupted training over last 16-18 months to fulfil its mandate of training future combat leaders.Since its raising in 1932, a total of 60,384 Indian cadets and 2,572 cadets from 34 friendly foreign countries have been trained and commissioned as officers in their respective militaries from the IMA.Lieutenant General RP Singh, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, Chandimandir, will be the reviewing officer of the passing out parade that will be held in the backdrop of the famous Chetwode Hall.Various events associated with the passing out parade will commence on June 11 with a solemn wreath laying ceremony at the IMA war memorial to pay homage to 889 alumni who have made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty.Due to the prevailing Covid situation, parents and family members of the passing out cadets will not be able to attend the event and the pipping of cadets, traditionally done by parents, will be done by the Instructional staff posted at IMA and the parade will be live streamed on social media.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/425-cadets-to-pass-out-as-officers-from-ima-on-june-12-261764
01-06-2021||Mumbai||PMLA court allows restoration of Mallya’s properties to banks||A special PMLA court in Mumbai on   Tuesday allowed the restoration of properties of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya that were seized by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to a consortium of banks that had provided him loans.This was the second such order passed by Special Judge JC Jagadale in over a week.The combined value of property to be restored to banks runs into several crore rupees, a lawyer representing Mallya said.Mallya is an accused in a bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines.A consortium of 17 banks that gave Mallya loans, led by State Bank of India, had sought restoration of his properties seized by the ED.The properties as described in the application are hereby restored to the applicant banks through the recovery officer, the court said.The court rejected Mallya’s application seeking a stay on the order.The said order is a conditional one in which the concerned recovery officer has been directed to submit an undertaking as per provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering (Restoration of Property) Rules, 2016, the court said.The court added that, obviously, it will take time to submit such an undertaking, and in the meantime, the aggrieved party may challenge the said order, and, therefore, there is no need to stay the order.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pmla-court-allows-restoration-of-mallyas-properties-to-banks-261762
01-06-2021||Mumbai||HC asks Maharashtra to address security concerns raised by SII CEO Adar Poonawalla||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday said the Maharashtra government must assure the Serum Institute of India’s (SII) CEO, Adar Poonawalla, of requisite security in the wake of alleged threats to him over the supply of the Covishield vaccine manufactured by his company.A vacation bench of Justices SS Shinde and Abhay Ahuja said by manufacturing the anti-Covid-19 vaccine, Poonawalla was doing a great service to the nation and the state government’s highest functionaries must look into the issue of his security.It said the state’s top officials must personally speak to Poonawalla, who recently went to London, and assure him of his safety upon his return to India.The bench was hearing a petition filed by lawyer Datta Mane, seeking Z-plus security for Poonawalla.The Union government has already granted ‘Y’ category security to the Pune-based industrialist.The petitioner, through his counsel Pradip Havnur, told the HC that as per news reports, Poonawalla had been living in fear due to constant pressure from politicians and some others demanding that he provide more supply of the Covishield vaccine to their states.Mane’s plea said Poonawalla had left for London due to such threats.Notably, Poonawalla had said in a recent interview to The Times that he has been receiving threats and pressure from ‘powerful people’ seeking vaccine doses on priority.On Tuesday, the Maharashtra government’s counsel, Deepak Thakare, told the HC that the state had provided Y- category security to Poonawalla as per which, some CRPF personnel and two gunmen from the state police will remain available for his security round-the-clock.He further said the state was taking stock of the situation and would consider providing Z-plus security to Poonawalla upon his return to the country.At this, the bench said the state must not consider the petition as an adversarial litigation.“Mr Poonawalla is doing a fabulous job. He is doing a great service. He is serving the nation,” the HC said.It further said Poonawalla was now trying to enhance the production of the vaccine.“The court’s expectation is that someone from the state government must speak to him and assure him that all safety arrangements will be made, and security will be provided to him whenever he is in Maharashtra,” the HC said.Mumbai is the economic capital of the country, and Maharashtra is a progressive and modern state, it observed.“If Mr Poonawalla has expressed any concerns, the state must address them,” the court said.The bench directed advocate Thakare to speak to the state government officials and convey the court’s concerns.“Please speak to the highest state functionaries, maybe the state Home minister, and assurance must be given to him (Poonawalla) from the top. They should talk to him personally,” the HC said.It directed the state government to make a statement before the HC on June 10 on the security provided to Poonawalla, the number of CRPF personnel that will remain on guard for him and other related issues.

01-06-2021||Jaipur||Media report alleging vaccine wastage in Rajasthan ‘false’: State government tells Centre||A day after the Centre flagged a media report on Covid-19 vaccine wastage in Rajasthan, Health Minister Raghu Sharma on Tuesday said the wastage in the state is less than 2 per cent, well below the “national average of 6 per cent”.The state minister termed the media report cited by the Centre in its letter “false”.In the letter to Sharma on Monday, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said a media report has highlighted that more than 500 vials of Covid-19 vaccines were found dumped in the waste bins at 35 vaccination centres in the state, which is “not acceptable” and must be investigated.In almost all districts of Rajasthan, vaccine wastage is more than the national average, which is less than 1 per cent, Vardhan had said.In a video message, Sharma said, “The vaccine wastage in Rajasthan is less than 2 per cent, which is well within the 10 per cent limit set by the government of India. The average national wastage is 6 per cent”. There is zero vaccine wastage in the 18-44 age group, he said.So far, Rajasthan has administered 1.70 crore Covid vaccine doses and the state has remained a front runner in vaccinating people since the beginning of the inoculation drive, he added.In a letter to Vardhan, Sharma said the data given in the news report is “not correct”.“I would like to inform you that the matter has been thoroughly enquired by our officers and it has been established that the news mentioned in your letter is misleading, false and not based on facts,” Sharma said.“The statements recorded from all the concerned medical staff involved in vaccination in the health institutions mentioned in the news (report) clearly show that the facts are totally contrary to the news report and similar modus operandi was adopted to collect vaccine vials by misrepresentation,” he said.At the health institutions, Sharma said, the media persons introduced themselves as officials from the state directorate of medical and health and as WHO representatives, he claimed.“They managed to get the vaccine vials from the concerned health institutions by coercing the staff. The media persons took the vaccine vials from the used vials collected at the institution for disposal as per GoI guidelines for biomedical waste disposal,” he said.Sharma further claimed that not a single vial was found in waste bins as mentioned by the media persons in their story.“The act by the media persons is against the Central Pollution Control Board Guidelines for biological waste disposal, which state that the used/partially used vaccine vials can’t be taken out of the concerned health institution without properly disinfecting them for disposal,” he said.A Covid-19 vaccine vial has to be discarded after four hours of opening. Sometimes, after opening a vial, the required number of beneficiaries does not turn up for vaccination and it has to be discarded in accordance with the government of India’s operational guidelines, Sharma said.“It leads to some amount of wastage,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media-report-alleging-vaccine-wastage-in-rajasthan-false-state-government-tells-centre-261752
01-06-2021||New Delhi||HC quashes Air India’s decision terminating pilots, orders reinstatement||Coming to the aid of all Air India pilots, permanent as well as on contract, whose services were terminated last year, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday quashed the national carrier’s decision and directed their reinstatement.The direction was issued by Justice Jyoti Singh who also ordered that back wages would have to be paid to the reinstated pilots.The court said that the back wages, including allowances, have to be paid at par with what in-service pilots were receiving and in accordance with the government rules.The court also said that extension for the contractual pilots would be at the discretion of Air India in view of their satisfactory performance.The court said the detailed judgement would be available only on Wednesday.The order was passed in over 40 petitions by pilots whose services were terminated by Air India on August 13 last year.The terminated pilots, a large chunk of whom were represented by advocates Ravi Raghunath and Nilansh Gaur, had initially moved the court in July last year seeking directions to Air India to accept the withdrawal of the resignations tendered by them.However, on August 13, 2020, Air India issued termination letters to several pilots including those who had wanted to withdraw their resignations.Subsequently, the pilots moved the high court against the August 13, 2020, decision of Air India.Some of the pilots had initially tendered their resignations over delay by Air India in disbursing pay and allowances.They had also contended that neither were their notice periods reduced nor any no-objection certificate issued to them after receipt of resignation.They had further contended that the resignations were subsequently withdrawn, but the withdrawal was not accepted by Air India.

What is the procedure for helping the patient get this medicine," he said on Twitter."Instead of providing treatment, why is the Modi government embroiling the public in formalities," he also asked, but did not elaborate.After thousands of cases of black fungus were reported among Covid-19 patients in the country, the Centre on May 20 urged all states and union territories to declare it as a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act to ensure mandatory surveillance to tackle the "new challenge".The government had said that the shortage of Amphotericin B shortage will be resolved soon as five more pharma companies have got new drug approval for producing it in India, in addition to the existing six pharma companies. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-attacks-pm-on-gdp-unemployment-261748

01-06-2021||Pune||Maharashtra: Over 9,900 minors contracted Covid-19 in Ahmednagar in May||Over 9,900 minors tested positive for coronavirus at Ahmednagar in Maharashtra last month, but the district administration claimed that around 95 per cent of them were asymptomatic, and the situation was not alarming.In May this year, atotal of 86,182 Covid-19 cases were reported in Ahmednagar, district Collector Rajendra Bhosale told PTI."Out of them, 9,928 were minors (aged below 18), which comes to about 11.5 per cent of the total cases reported last month," Bhosale said.He said out of the 9,928 minors who contracted the viral infection, 6,700 were in the age group of 11 to 18, 3,100 were in 1 to 10 years age bracket, while some were also below the age of 1 year."Since around 95 per cent of them were asymptomatic, there is nothing to worry. However, considering the threat of a possible third wave of Covid-19, it has now become paramount to take utmost care of children," the collector said.Ahmednagar's paediatric task force member Dr Sachin Solat said though the number appeared big, the situation was "not alarming at all" as about 95 per cent of the minors who contracted Covid-19 were asymptomatic.He also said 350 to 370 patients were currently admitted to the district's civil hospital and out of them, only five to six were children.Dr Solat also said that on Monday, around 1,000 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the district and out of them, 97 were minors.Asked about the reason for such a big number of children contracting the disease, he said, "In most of the cases, theinfection to minors comes from their parents or other adult members of the family."Generally adult members of a family test positive and during high risk contact-tracing, when children from the same index family are tested, they too test positive, he said.Dr Solat also said considering the possibility of a third Covid-19 wave which may affect children, a task force comprising 10 senior paediatricians has been formed in the district.A 100-bed facility equipped with oxygen and ICUs is being prepared at the Ahmednagar Civil Hospital, he said.Necessary training was being impared to health staff, paediatricians, local doctors, ASHA (accredited social health activist) and anganwadi workers at tehsil and village levels, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-over-9-900-minors-contracted-covid-19-in-ahmednagar-in-may-261730
01-06-2021||London||UK's Heathrow Airport opens terminal for ‘red list' countries like India||London's busy Heathrow Airport opened a dedicated new terminal on Tuesday for arrivals from countries designated as "red list", such as India, for a higher risk of Covid-19 transmission.Travellers on direct flights from such destinations will now go through Terminal 3 and then move directly to a government-approved quarantine facility booked at the passengers' own expense.It comes after the London airport's staff had raised fears for their safety because of overcrowding, amid concerns that travellers arriving from red list countries – from where travel is effectively banned except for British and Irish nationals or limited exceptions – were mixing with those from green and amber."Red list routes will likely be a feature of UK travel for the foreseeable future as countries vaccinate their populations at different rates,” a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said."We're adapting Heathrow to this longer-term reality by initially opening a dedicated arrivals facility in Terminal 3 from 1 June for red list passengers arriving on direct flights. While opening this facility will be logistically very challenging, our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list. Until then, the current red list system will remain in place,” the spokesperson said.Currently, there are 43 countries on the UK government's red list to cover regions linked with high-risk Covid-19 variants such as India, Brazil and South Africa.Under the UK government's coronavirus rules, anyone who has been in a red list country is required to pay for hotel quarantine for 10 nights after their arrival.According to officials, the latest system has been designed with several layers of Covid-19 security, including mandatory negative Covid-19 tests for all international arrivals, mandatory use of face coverings, social distancing, segregation and enhanced cleaning regimes and ventilation in immigration halls."We will move this facility to Terminal 4 as soon as operationally possible," the Heathrow spokesperson said.A UK government spokesperson said the enhanced borders regime was to reduce the risk of new variants being transmitted."As we reopen international travel safely, we will maintain 100 per cent health checks at the border and the new dedicated terminal at Heathrow for arrivals from red list countries will enable passengers to be processed as safely and as efficiently as possible, before being transferred to a managed quarantine facility," the spokesperson said.The move comes as the UK coronavirus cases exceeded 3,000 on Monday for a sixth day in a row, with this figure not having been surpassed since April 12.The highly transmissible B1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and now named 'Delta' by the World Health Organisation, is believed to be largely behind this spike in infections with scientists advising caution before all Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are completely lifted as planned for June 21.The coronavirus has killed 128,045 people in the UK, along with 45,03,231 confirmed cases so far, according to Johns Hopkins University. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uks-heathrow-airport-opens-terminal-for-red-list-countries-like-india-261728
01-06-2021||New Delhi||Govt should print money, increase spending: Chidambaram||Former finance minister and Congress veteran P Chidambaram on Tuesday said that India had recorded negative annual growth for the first time since 1979-80 and asked the government to print money to enhance liquidity and spending.In a statement, Chidambaram said there are no surprises in the note issued by the National Statistical Office on the provisional estimates of Annual National Income for 2020-21.“As expected, the GDP at constant prices recorded a negative growth of (-) 7.3 per cent, the first time India has recorded negative annual growth since 1979-80. Three numbers of GDP at constant prices will highlight the parlous state of the economy: 2018-19: Rs 140,03,316 crore; 2019-20: Rs 145,69,268 crore; 2020-21: Rs 135,12,740 crore. The increase in 2019-20 was modest at 4.0 per cent, but the decline in 2020-21 was severe at -7.3 per cent. The net result is that the GDP in 2020-21 is lower than the GDP of two years ago (2018-19). 2020-21 has been the darkest year of the economy in four decades,” the ex-minister said.He said the first two quarters of 2020-21 witnessed a recession (-24.4 and -7.4 per cent).“The performance in the third and fourth quarters did not herald a recovery. The estimated rates of 0.5 per cent and 1.6 per cent were due to a very low base of 3.3 and 3.0 per cent in the corresponding quarters of the previous year,” he added.Chidambaram also noted that when the first wave of the pandemic appeared to subside last year, the Finance Minister and her Chief Economic Adviser began to see “green shoots” when no one else did.“They predicted a V-shaped recovery. It was a false story and we had expressed our strong reservations and warned there were no signs of a recovery. We had pointed out that what the economy needed was a strong dose of stimulus, including increased government expenditure, direct transfers of cash to the poor and liberal distribution of free rations. Our pleas fell on deaf ears, and the result is negative growth of (-) 7.3 per cent,” the Congress leader said.He described as “most worrying” that the per capita GDP fell below Rs 1 lakh, to Rs 99,694.In percentage terms, it is a decline of (-) 8.2 per cent over the previous year. It is lower than the level achieved in 2018-19 (and maybe even 2017-18), Chidambaram said.He concluded that most Indians today were poorer than they were two years ago abs though the current state of the economy is largely due to the impact of the pandemic, it has been compounded by the "ineptitude and incompetent" economic management of the BJP-led NDA government.“Good advice by distinguished economists and renowned institutions has been rebuffed. World-wide experience has been ignored. Suggestions on fiscal expansion and cash transfers have been turned down. Hollow packages like Atmanirbhar have fallen flat, Chidambaram rued.The ex-minister sought fiscal expansion, including cash transfers to the poor citing research of Aziz Premji University that 23 crore people have been pushed below the poverty line and into indebtedness.Chidambaram said as advised by Nobel Laureate, Dr Abhijit Banerjee, the government should print money and increase spending.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-should-print-money-increase-spending-chidambaram-261727

01-06-2021||Namkhana (WB)||Dead fish, flooded fields, submerged homes in cyclone—ravaged Sunderbans, fight for life and livelihood||"Why is God so angry with us?" asked Manik Pradhan, pointing to the vast tracts of cropland inundated with dead fish floating around, as nearby ponds have overflown with saline water breaching the embankments.Picking up a large dead 'catla' fish, which would have fetched anywhere between Rs 1,000-1,500 in the wholesale markets of Kolkata, Pronab Mondal said, "Our condition is also like this fish, it died as saline water entered the pond and we are as good as dead after back-to-back disasters.First, it was cyclone Amphan, then COVID and now, Yaas." Jana and Mondal are among thousands of people living in the Namkhana block -- one of the worst-affected in the Sunderbans region in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district who have lost their homes and livelihoods due to the cyclone.Jana, who lives in the Narayanpur village, was planning to cast the roof of his house this summer with the grant provided by the government."I started working on the house last year, completed the structure and got the first tranche of Rs 60,000. A few weeks back, I bought the construction materials and hoped to cast the roof but then the cyclone hit. Everything got washed away," he said."I planted brinjal and sponge gourd this season. Everything is destroyed. I don't know what will we do for the next one year," he said, trying hard to hold back his tears.The highway, which leads to Namkhana and ends at the beach in Bakkhali, was lined with trucks and pick-up vans that came from far and wide with relief materials -- the efforts led mostly by community clubs.Tapas Banerjee was part of one such group that came with dry food and other relief materials from Asansol, around 300 km away."We collected relief materials from the people of our area in Burnpur and came here. As part of Nababikash Club, we try to help people throughout the year. Besides, we have given Rs 1 lakh to the state government for the relief efforts," he said, managing a large queue of people that had gathered for packets of puffed rice, flattened rice and baby food, among others."At first, we went to Mousuni Island. What we saw there was horrific -- nothing was left. The tourist camps have been swept away. Seawater entered the water bodies where prawns were cultivated, killing all the produce."Don't really know how these people will survive," Banerjee said, as someone nearby prompted, "We bought 15 kg prawn on our way back at Rs 150 a kg. We couldn't resist, prawns of this size would usually cost Rs 600-650 per kg." Mousuni Island, which has become a popular camping destination over the years, is the most-affected of the seven panchayat areas in Namkhana, Block Development Officer Shantanu Singha Thakur told PTI."The population of the block is around 2 lakh as per the 2011 Census and almost 50 per cent of the population is affected. More than the cyclone, the astronomical tide caused by the full moon that day has impacted the area. It is now under control and we are working round the clock," he said."We shifted 62,000 people to rescue centres ahead of the cyclone following all COVID protocols. We are operating 162 community kitchens at present to provide cooked food twice a day, and also giving them snacks," Thakur said.Thakur's office, the field station for the rescue and relief efforts, was also underwater till two days back. Most parts of the complex were still inundated with officers often stumbling upon fish such as 'koi' and 'shoal'."In the last one week, we barely had time to make out whether it's day or night outside. We have been working, eating and napping here," said an officer, pointing to the makeshift bed in his cabin."We are trying to reach out to people with all the help as fast as possible. Hopefully, the situation will improve as 'Mora Kotal' or low tidal variation has set in," he said, refusing to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.Overhearing the conversation, a man who worked at the BDO office said, "You should have asked him why is there such a situation every time? Why couldn't the embankments be made of concrete?"They will build mud embankments every year and those will be breached. What is the use? We will continue to live like this throughout our lives it seems," he said before rushing out to help an officer with some work.Outside the complex, a truck stood with a machine that was churning out drinking water pouches.If operated from 7 am to 11 pm, it can produce 80- 90,000 pouches of 200 ml each. It has come all the way from Burdwan, said the supervisor as he kept a log and prodded the workers to ensure zero wastage.Besides, 2,000-litre tankers are being sent to the villages on motor-operated vans as a drinking water crisis has engulfed the area.Shibshankar Mondal, who drives one such van, said though the job was painstaking, it gave him some satisfaction that he was helping people who are facing such hardships."I live in Kakdwip block and my house is also underwater. But, I could manage to save my van," said Mondal, who otherwise ferries people."These tanks are used during the Gangasagar Mela, and were lying in the store. It's good that someone thought about using it now," he said, adding that he was being paid Rs 1,500 per day along with sufficient petrol -- a boon given that he earned Rs 700-800 a day earlier, but that stopped owing to the lockdown.Thakur said drinking water was being provided to 60-70 per cent of the area, as the tube wells were damaged due to the saline water."I won't say that allegations over the embankments are absolutely false. The work is done by the Irrigation Department. We have raised the issue with them. The fact is, a cyclone has hit the area every six months in the last three years; so we couldn't get the minimum time for implementing a long-term solution," he said."However, the department has been told that new embankments should sustain for long. Also, apart from the breaches, the tidal waves were so huge that water overflowed into the villages. The tidal waves were around 12-13 feet high, and to deal with that, we need to build embankments as high as the Great Wall of China," the BDO said.Towards the end of the highway at Bakkhali sea beach, around 25 km away, a few shops selling cold drinks and cigarettes had mounds of sand to fend with."The sea waves almost touched the shops one kilometre away. See the mounds of sand inside the fridge. I don't know how to clean this, and the machine has now stopped working."I invested Rs 20,000 for the fridge. If it becomes non-functional, what will I do?" said one of the shopkeepers, as he got busy with a group from Bhangore that went to the beach to bath, after distributing relief materials.

He was released on bail from the police station in the early hours of Tuesday, the official said.The Goregaon police received a call from their control room about the incident around 11 pm on Monday, he said.The police went to the actor's house and brought him to the police station.His wife Nisha Rawal, who is also a TV actor, lodged a police complaint against him after they had a fight, the official said.A case was registered against Mehra under IPC sections 336 (endangering human life or personal safety to others), 337 (causing hurt by an act which endangers human life), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation), he said.After the completion of legal formalities, the actor was released on bail from the police station, he said.Opening up on the incident, Karan's friend and colleague, actor Rohan Mehra, says he never realised there was a problem between the couple."He was head over heels in love with his wife. They both are very close to me. We have travelled together, too. That was long back. We have spoken on Instagram. I never thought that there is a problem. But no one can say if there is a problem between husband and wife," he told IANS.Rohan says Karan was not a violent person."He was not like this. On Bigg Boss, too, he never raised his voice. He never hurt anyone. It's very strange. One can't say what is going on in someone's personal life. But he has never done anything like this. Otherwise, he is a gem of a person," says Rohan.Mehra is known for his role in the TV serial "Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai".Meanwhile, according to an earlier report in Spotboye, an FIR was lodged against Karan Mehra at Goregaon Police station on Monday night. Karan and Nisha's marriage has reportedly been on the rocks for some time now.

We have no doubt that his citizenship will ultimately be revoked because he did not disclose material of information,” he said.Spotting a window of opportunity in the arrest of Choksi in Dominica where he was “detained” for illegal entry, India dispatched a jet with documents related to cases against Choksy which landed at Douglas Charles Airport in Dominica on May 28.The team of officers are in Dominica to bring back Choksi and coordinate with the local prosecutors to put forward its best case before the high court.The team is arguing that Choksi continues to be an Indian citizen with an Interpol Red Notice against him.Browne has also said that his citizenship is under contest in court as Choksi had not revealed complete information about him.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi had fled India in the first week of January 2018, weeks before Rs 13,500 crore scam in Punjab National Bank rocked Indian banking industry.The duo allegedly bribed the officials of state-run bank to get Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) on the basis of which they availed loans from overseas banks which remained unpaid.The alleged corrupt officials did not enter these LoUs in the core banking software of the PNB thus evading any scrutiny. The non-payment of these LoUs or bank guarantees worth Rs 13,500 crore resulted in default and became a liability on bank.Modi escaped to Europe and was finally held in London where he is contesting his extradition to India while Choksi took citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 where he had been staying since his escape from Delhi.

It had affected the morale of doctors, who are fighting day in and day out in the (Covid-19) pandemic. We demand an unconditional public apology from him or action against him under the Epidemic Diseases Act," a senior FORDA official said.The RDAs that have already joined the stir are from AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Hospital, Hindu Rao Hospital, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, B R Ambedkar Hospital and more will join later in the day, he said."Many doctors are wearing black armbands or black ribbons to symbolise the protest," the FORDA official said, adding, "Doctors in other cities are also joining the stir."

It started on January 16.Ramdev was recently forced to withdraw a statement made in a viral video clip, in which he was heard questioning some of the medicines being used to treat the coronavirus infection and saying that "lakhs have died from taking allopathic medicines for Covid-19".The remarks were met with vociferous protests, following which Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan asked him to withdraw the "extremely unfortunate" statement.A day later, the yoga guru posed 25 questions to the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in an "open letter" on his Twitter handle, asking if allopathy offered permanent relief from ailments.His remarks had irked the medical fraternity, upsetting both the IMA and the Delhi Medical Association (DMA). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramdevs-remarks-forda-members-begin-black-day-protest-at-delhi-hospitals-261704

01-06-2021||New Delhi||Reports of certificates not issued post Covid vaccination incorrect, unfounded: Health ministry||The Union health ministry on Monday dismissed as “incorrect and unfounded” media reports claiming that certificates were not issued to some people post Covid vaccination."There have been some unfounded media reports on no certificates issued post Covid vaccination. These reports are incorrect and are not supported by full information on the matter," the ministry said.The CoWIN platform facilitates registration, scheduling of appointments, vaccination and certification of beneficiaries during the Covid vaccination process, it said.Even though a beneficiary is registered online or on-site on CoWIN, the most important step after the person gets the jab is to update the status on the platform on the day of the vaccination, it said.If it is not possible to update the status on the same day, the data entry of that session can be done the next day till 5 pm on CoWIN portal, the ministry said in a statement.Thus, there is extended scope for data entry of vaccination on the next day too. This utility is provided to obviate the need for backlog data entry of vaccination, it said.The web link for Covid vaccination certificate is available in the SMS sent to the beneficiary after the successful updation of the vaccination status on CoWIN.Further, the Union government has also issued advisories from time to time that vaccination certificates are to be issued to everyone on the same day of administration of the dose and before they exit the vaccination centre, it said.Covid vaccination certificate can also be downloaded from CoWIN portal, or Arogya Setu/Umang mobile application. It can be downloaded after each dose (provisional certificate after first dose and final certificate after second dose), the ministry said."It may be possible that the beneficiary's vaccination status has not been updated by the vaccinator at the time of vaccination, this may lead to a person to not get a vaccination certificate from the CoWIN system. To eliminate this issue, CoWIN system will soon provide features to remove such errors," the ministry said.However, citizens are also advised to check if they received the confirmation SMS post administration of a vaccine dose, the ministry underlined.Receipt of confirmation SMS denotes that the status has been updated by the vaccinator. The citizens are also advised to check the certificate through the link provided in the confirmation SMS or by logging in to the CoWIN portal.In case any errors are noticed in the certificate, the same should immediately be brought to the attention of the vaccinator, who can then rectify it, the ministry said.The central government has been supporting the efforts of the states and UTs for an effective vaccination drive under the 'whole of government' approach since January 16, this year, the ministry said.In order to streamline the availability of the vaccine doses, the central government has been constantly in touch with the vaccine manufacturers and has opened up different procurement options for states and UTs since May 1, it said.

As a result our commercial schedule had to be curtailed accordingly," Ashim Mittra, Senior Vice President – Flight Operations, IndiGo, said in an email to pilots of the airline.Due to the reduced capacity, the airline will have to institute an LWP programme for all employees which would range from 1.5 to 4 days depending on the employee group, he noted.Employees in Band B and Band I have not been touched under this LWP programme. Majority of the employees of the airline are in Band B and Band A, which are the lowermost bands.Mittra stated, "All pilots would undertake 3 days of LWP for the next 3 months effective 1st June, 2021."The domestic air travel has significantly reduced in the country during the last couple of weeks. On February 28, around 3 lakh domestic air passengers travelled in India. On May 30, domestic flights operated in India with around 70,000 passengers approximately.Mittra said in his email, "We have been focusing on our vaccination drive and we have been able to facilitate vaccination for our employees at various stations. As on date, approximately 80 per cent of our eligible pilots have been administered their 1st dose of vaccine." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indigo-announces-leave-without-pay-scheme-for-senior-employees-to-tide-over-impact-of-covid-2nd-wave-261696

Retired IAS officer and former Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi said, “The government should remember that it has more important jobs at hand.”Former Tripura DGP KS Subramanian said the Union Government's decision to “unilaterally move the Chief Secretary on central deputation has severely dented the Centre-state relations”.Bengal row: ‘Govt misused power’The Centre misused its power by recalling Bandyopadhyay without consulting the state. He was given extension in service for pandemic management. It was sheer humiliation. —Jawhar Sircar, Forme IAS officerHe said, “IAS and IPS officers are recruited, transferred and posted by the Centre. But once posted, they are answerable to the respective state government and their shifting should not be done without consulting the state.”The Centre's latest move has complicated the matters relating to the transfer/posting of officers, Subramanian said, adding that if politicians "do not behave maturely and responsibly”, it would be become difficult to govern a “diverse and complex” country like India. Terming the Centre's move “misuse of power”, former IAS officer Jawhar Sircar said, “There is another order dated May 24, 2021, for pandemic management and his (Bandyopadhyay's) extension. Without superseding that order, the officer was asked to come to Delhi. It amounts to sheer humiliation.”Another former IAS officer alleged it was a “petty-minded” act to recall the officer without consulting the state government.

This is the first full-year GDP contraction in the past four decades since 1979-80, when it had shrunk by 5.2 per cent.The GDP, however, grew at 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter and 0.5 per cent in the third quarter. The first two quarters of the financial year saw negative growth.According to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Monday, India’s real GDP contracted to Rs 135 lakh crore in 2020-21 from Rs 145 lakh crore at the end of March 2020. To regain Rs 145 lakh crore size, the economy will have to grow by 10-11 per cent in 2021-22, but the second Covid wave disrupted the momentum of economic activity and many expect the GDP may not touch double-digit growth rate.Lockdown impactGDP growth (FY 2020-21)April-June -23.9%July-Sept -7.5%Oct-Dec 0.5%Jan-March 1.6%Rs135 lakh crore real GDP in FY21Rs145 lakh crore in FY2010-11% growth needed for recoveryThe impact of the second wave is yet to be recorded, but Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian said it would hit recoveries made in the third and fourth quarters.

How will you address this digital divide? —Supreme CourtThe Bench, which was hearing a suo motu PIL on Covid management, posed a series of questions to the Centre on the Covid vaccine procurement policy and pointed out that states such as Punjab and Delhi were in the process of issuing global tenders to procure foreign vaccines.1,52,734  FRESH CASESACTIVE CASES 20,26,092TOTAL DEATHS 3,29,100“The Centre says it gets a low pricing since it buys in bulk.

We want clarity on this and rationale behind this policy,” the Bench said.Asking the Centre to file an affidavit on the issue, it posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.The top court also sought clarifications on the need for mandatory registration on the CoWIN app for people to get vaccinated without keeping in mind the real “digital India” situation, observing that the policymakers must have an ear to the ground. “Right now, the policy is such that it is completely exclusionary of the rural areas,” the court said.“You keep on saying digital India, digital India, but the situation is actually different in rural areas...” it told Mehta.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccination-for-all-by-year-end-says-govt-as-sc-questions-dual-pricing-policy-261286
01-06-2021||United Nations/Geneva||WHO names Covid-19 variants 1st found in India as 'Kappa' and 'Delta'||The B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 variants of the Covid-19, first identified in India, have been named as 'Kappa' and 'Delta' respectively by the WHO as it named various variants of the coronavirus using Greek alphabets to simplify public discussions and also help remove stigma from the names.The World Health Organisation's move on Monday came nearly three weeks after India objected to the B.1.617 mutant of the novel coronavirus being termed an "Indian Variant" in media reports, with the Union Health Ministry pointing out that the UN's top health organ has not used the word "Indian" for this strain in its document.The UN health agency named the B.1.617.1 variant of the Covid-19 as 'Kappa' while the B1.617.2 variant was dubbed 'Delta.' Both the variants were first found in India.Taking to Twitter, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical Covid-19 lead, on Monday said: "Today, @WHO announces new, easy-to-say labels for #SARSCoV2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) & Interest (VOIs). They will not replace existing scientific names, but are aimed to help in public discussion of VOI/VOC”.The WHO, while announcing the new naming system “making them simple, easy to say and remember”, said that it is “stigmatising and discriminatory” to call the variants by names of the nations they are first detected in.“The labels do not replace existing scientific names, which convey important scientific information & will continue to be used in research. The naming system aims to prevent calling Covid-19 variants by the places where they are detected, which is stigmatizing & discriminatory,” the WHO said in a tweet on Monday.The Geneva-based global health agency encouraged countries and others to adopt these names as they will ease public discussions about the global Covid-19 Variants of Concern and Interest.The B.1.1.7 strain first detected in the UK will be known as “Alpha”, while the B.1.351 variant detected in South Africa is now ‘Beta', P.1 variant first found in Brazil is “Gamma” and the P.2 variant is “Zeta”. The strains found in the US are “Epsilon” and “Iota”.“No country should be stigmatised for detecting and reporting variants. Globally, we need robust surveillance for variants, incl epi, molecular and sequencing to be carried out and shared. We need to continue to do all we can to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (sic),” Infectious Disease Epidemiologist and Covid-19 Technical Lead at the WHO Kerkhove said in a tweet.“The labels don't replace existing scientific names, which convey (important) scientific info and will continue to be used in research… These labels will help with public discussion about VOC/VOI as the numbering system can be difficult to follow,” she said.In order to assist with public discussions of variants, the WHO convened a group of scientists from the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group, the WHO Covid-19 reference laboratory network, representatives from GISAID, Nextstrain, Pango and additional experts in virological, microbial nomenclature and communication from several countries and agencies to consider easy-to-pronounce and non-stigmatising labels for VOIs and VOCs."At the present time, this expert group convened by the WHO has recommended labels using letters of the Greek Alphabet, i.e., Alpha, Beta, Gamma, which will be easier and more practical to discuss by non-scientific audiences,” the WHO added.On May 12, India's health ministry dismissed as "without any basis and unfounded" media reports that used the term "Indian variant" for the B.1.617 mutant strain, which the WHO recently said was a "variant of global concern"."Several media reports have covered the news of the World Health Organization (WHO) classifying B.1.617 as a variant of global concern. Some of these reports have termed the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus as an 'Indian Variant'," the ministry said in a statement in New Delhi."These media reports are without any basis, and unfounded," it said.The WHO said that the "established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango are currently and will remain in use by scientists and in scientific research." The WHO and its international networks of experts are monitoring changes to the virus."If significant mutations are identified, we can inform countries and the public about any changes needed to react to the variant, and prevent its spread,” it added.Globally, systems have been established and are being strengthened to detect “signals” of potential VOCs and VOIs and assess these based on the risk posed to global public health.National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern, it added.China reported the first Covid-19 case in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and since then the deadly disease has become a pandemic. China had also reacted angrily after former US president Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as “China virus”.According to Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus has so far infected more than 170,585,200 people and killed over 3,546,900 people across the world.On Tuesday, India reported 1,27,510 fresh Covid-19 cases, the lowest in 54 days, taking the country's tally to 2,81,75,044, according to the Union Health Ministry.The Covid-19 death toll climbed to 3,31,895 with 2,795 fresh fatalities, the lowest reported in 35 days, and the active cases were recorded below 20 lakh after 43 days. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-names-covid-19-variants-1st-found-in-india-as-kappa-and-delta-261287

He was granted bail by the top court on May 21.Bench takes a DIGWe saw a picture of a body being thrown in river. I do not know whether a sedition case has been filed against the news channel for showing that. The Bench“We are of the view that provisions of 124A (sedition) and 153 (promoting enmity between classes) of the IPC require interpretation, particularly on the issue of the rights of press and free speech,” the Bench said.It also restrained the Andhra Pradesh Police from taking any coercive action against the channels’ employees in with the case. The top court asked the AP government to file its response in four weeks to the petitions filed by the two media houses that have sought quashing of the sedition case.They described it as an attempt to create a “chilling effect” on news channels in the state to dissuade them from hosting any content critical of the government.Section 124A says a person commits the crime of sedition if he/she brings or attempts to bring in hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the government established by law in India.

The philosophy of inclusion, envisaged by Dr BR Ambedkar in the Preamble, also included the concept of ‘Economic Justice’.The Bench added: “To achieve this ideal of the Constitution as wished about by one of the greatest makers of this country, especially in such precarious times that we live in, it becomes imperative upon the administration to safeguard such institutions that protect the livelihood.”What Bench saidSays privatisation is not a panacea for all the ills.

It seems that after successfully not projecting a chief ministerial candidate in Assam during campaigning, the BJP is now considering the experiment in other poll-bound states to beat the anti-incumbency factor.The states going to polls next year include UP, Uttarakhand, Goa, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, all ruled by the BJP.Apparently, a key point of the ongoing saffron parleys is to decide whether to go in for the incumbent CM as its face in the upcoming election campaigns. Sources say in elections held in different states between 2014 and 2021, the leadership found that the anti-incumbency factor tended to dominate if it was the second consecutive term of a CM, like in Haryana.Rs 30 lakh for kin of those who died during poll dutyBesides, projecting an incumbent may also be counter-productive because then other hopefuls and contenders tend to pull back. Keeping this factor in mind, the BJP did not opt for incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal in Assam and kept open the field for hopeful Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is now the CM.Besides, ever since the second wave of Covid-19, BJP CMs, especially UP’s Yogi Adityanath, are facing additional issues, including people’s anger over “mismanagement”. By not declaring the CM, the BJP may be able to take care of some of this anger, it is believed.
