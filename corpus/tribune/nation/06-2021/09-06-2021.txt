Hence, the present writ petition from Malarkodi.Justice S Vaidyanathan, before whom the petition came up for hearing recently, observed that the matter has to be referred to a larger bench to arrive at a finality.Due to continued live-in relationship, whether a woman attains the status of a wife to get pensionary and other terminal benefits due to the deceased person were among the issues that needed to be looked into, the judge said pointing out women are to be respected and protected.The registry was directed to place the matter before the Chief Justice to constitute a bench for deciding the issue.

However, the firm failed to take adequate safety precaution and an investigation is needed in that direction," said the prosecution.Seeking custody, the prosecution told the court the police need to investigate if the firm had informed the industrial safety department and the health department about the stock of sanitizers at the plant, located  in the Pirangut MIDC area of Mulshi tehsil on the outskirts of Pune city.An inquiry committee report has also pointed out that sanitizer aggravated the fire while the dark smoke caused by sodium chloride burning made it difficult for the victims to find a way out of the blaze-hit site, it said.Inflammable raw materials were stored at the same place where the fire broke out, the prosecution said.The Pune district administration had found 20,000 to 30,000 bottles of sanitizer in the firm's inventory.The chemical firm apparently used to source sanitizer liquid from outside and sell them after re-packaging, officials had said earlier. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fire-tragedy-owner-of-pune-company-in-police-custody-till-june-13-265958

In this noise, I felt a very important message got lost which is we are not against 5G. In fact, we are welcoming of it. Please do bring it. All we are asking is that the authorities certify 5G safe,” Chawla said in a video message.S P Kochhar, director general, Cellular Operators’ Association of India had told PTI that any concern around the adverse impact of 5G on health is “totally misplaced”.

09-06-2021||New Delhi||Twitter to appoint chief compliance officer within a week||Social media platform Twitter is learnt to have written to the government that it is in advanced stages of finalising chief compliance officer as per the new IT rules and additional details will be submitted to the government within a week, according to an official source.Twitter in its reply to the final notice of the government dated June 5, said that it is making all efforts to comply with the new guidelines but has been unable to do so because of the global impact of Covid-19 pandemic.“...We are in advanced stages of finalising the appointment of the role of chief compliance officer and we plan to provide additional details to you in the next several days, and at the latest within a week,” Twitter said.According to the source, the letter was sent on June 7 to the Ministry of Electronics and IT.When contacted, a Twitter spokesperson said, “Twitter has been and remains deeply committed to India, and serving the vital public conversation taking place on the service. We have assured the Government of India that Twitter is making every effort to comply with the new guidelines, and an overview on our progress has been duly shared. We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian government.”The new IT rules for social media companies that came into effect last month mandate large platforms like Facebook and Twitter to undertake greater due diligence and make these digital platforms more accountable and responsible for the content hosted by them.Under the rules, significant social media intermediaries—those with over 50 lakh users—are required to appoint a grievance officer, a nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel have to be residents in India.Further, social media companies will have to take down flagged content within 36 hours, and remove within 24 hours content that is flagged for issues such as nudity and pornography.The new social media guidelines came into effect from May 26, 2021 but Twitter did not comply with the rules.In its final notice, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had said that Twitter’s refusal to comply with the rules demonstrated the micro-blogging site’s “lack of commitment and efforts towards providing a safe experience for the people of India on its platform”.The ministry notice warned the social media firm of consequences for not following the new rules but gave one last chance to Twitter to “immediately comply with the rules, failing which the exemption from liability available… shall stand withdrawn and Twitter shall be liable for consequences as per the IT Act and other penal laws of India”.Twitter in its latest reply said that it understands the importance of new regulations and “have endeavoured in good faith to comply with the guidelines, including with respect to hiring personnel in India”.The micro-blogging site said that the guidelines were notified on February 25, 2021, and the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for it to make certain arrangements that are necessary to comply with the rules within stipulated time-frame.“For example, similar to other significant social media intermediaries operating in India, in order to comply with the underlying intention behind the guidelines, we have appointed a nodal contact person and resident grievance officer on a contractual basis while we recruit to fill the positions on a permanent basis,” Twitter said in the letter.The social media firm that remains committed to serving the people of India by providing a platform to serve the public conversation in India, especially during critical moments and emergency situations.The social media firm has had several faceoffs with the government since the start of farmers’ protest in Delhi and later when it tagged political posts of several leaders of the ruling party BJP as “manipulated media”.Several ministers from the government and officials joined Indian rival of Twitter, Koo which is backed by former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai.

09-06-2021||New Delhi||Forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ inside Tihar, ‘ISIS man’ tells court||An alleged ISIS member arrested for planning suicide attacks and serial blasts across the country, approached a Delhi court on Wednesday claiming that he was beaten up by other inmates in Tihar jail and forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’.The accused, Rashid Zafar, was arrested in 2018 on the allegations of being member of an ISIS-inspired group who were planning suicide attacks and serial blasts, targeting politicians as also government installations in Delhi and other parts of north India.Advocate MS Khan claimed in the application, which is likely to come up for hearing on Thursday, that the incident was disclosed by the accused to his father telephonically from Tihar jail.“The accused was beaten up and forced to chant religious slogans like ‘Jai Shri Ram’ by his inmates,” the application said.The plea, moved by advocate Qausar Khan, requested that “appropriate directions may be passed to the Jail Superintendent to look into the matter”.The accused was arrested along with nine others in December 2018 after NIA carried out searches, in coordination with Special Cell of Delhi Police and Anti-Terrorism Squad of Uttar Pradesh Police, at six places in Jafrabad, Seelampur in Delhi, and 11 places in Uttar Pradesh—six in Amroha, two in Lucknow, two in Hapur and two in Meerut.The searches and the arrests came a month before the Republic Day celebrations on January 26.According to NIA, a locally-made rocket launcher, material for suicide vests and 112 alarm clocks to be used as timers were recovered from the searches.The agency also said it recovered 25 kg of explosive material—Potassium Nitrate, Ammonium Nitrate and Sulphur.The group allegedly had also purchased remote control cars and wireless doorbells to use their circuits in assembling remote-controlled improvised explosive devices.Besides, the NIA also recovered steel containers, electric wires, 91 mobile phones, 134 SIM cards, 3 laptops, knife, sword, ISIS-related literature during the searches.The probe agency had initially rounded up 16 persons of the group ‘Harkat ul Harb e Islam’, which loosely translates into war for the cause of Islam.Of the 16 detained, 10 were later arrested—five from Amroha, in UP and five from Seelampur and Jafrabad localities in north-east Delhi, the agency had said.

09-06-2021||Kolkata||Mamata says aims to ‘remove Modi’, promises to rally Oppn-ruled states behind agitating farmers||In a move that may take her political battle against the BJP into the Hindi heartland, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday promised to rally opposition-ruled states in support of the agitating farmers, and said she aims to “remove the Narendra Modi government from power”.At a meeting with farmer leaders led by Rakesh Tikait and Yudhvir Singh here during the day, the TMC chief said there should be a platform where states could converse on policy issues.“Bulldozing states is not good for the federal structure,” she said.The farmer leaders had come to elicit her support for their agitation against the farm laws passed by the BJP-led central government and in favour of a nationwide law bringing in a guaranteed Minimum Support Price for agricultural crops.Banerjee’s support for the north India-based farmers’ unions comes within days of the Trinamool Congress announcing that the party would spread its footprints outside West Bengal’s geographical boundaries.The Bhartiya Kisan Union led by Tikait and Singh had supported the ‘No vote for BJP’ campaign ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections and have plans to extend that in other upcoming state elections as well, including in Uttar Pradesh which the saffron party rules in alliance with smaller parties.Banerjee announced after the meeting that her “support for the farmers’ movement will be there” and added in an obvious jibe at the Centre that “India is hungrily waiting for policies which help in fighting COVID-19, assist farmers and industry.”The chief minister rhetorically asked, “...why is it so difficult to talk to the farmers?”She was referring to the breakdown in communication between the Centre and the farmers who have been camping at Delhi’s borders for over six months against three farm laws passed by the Parliament.The agitators feel the new laws will commercialise agriculture without adequate protection to small farmers from exploitation by large retail chains and industry.“The BJP rule has been disastrous for all sectors from healthcare to farmers to industry. India is suffering...we are facing both natural and political disasters,” said Banerjee, who has been reaching out to other opposition-led states in trying to forge a united front against her perceived grievances against the Centre.The chief minister said that the agriculturist leaders have requested her to talk to other state leaders on the farmers’ issue and organise a dialogue with farmers’ unions.“The farmers’ movement is not just for Punjab, Haryana or Uttar Pradesh. It is for the whole country,” she said.TMC vice president and former Union finance minister Yashwant Singh, who was also present at the meeting, said, “It is necessary to stop the trend towards commercialisation of farming. We are with the farmers...we want the three laws to be withdrawn and a new law on MSP brought in.”Banerjee’s support for the agitation which has drawn on the farming community in rural north India, is being viewed as a potential boost for the stir which has been flagging in recent weeks.Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the BKU, told PTI ahead of the meeting, “We want to congratulate Mamata Banerjee for her electoral victory and to elicit her support for the move to give farmers a fair MSP for their crops.”Singh said he wants states to come up MSP for fruits, vegetables and milk products. The lack of a specified MSP and glut in produce often leads to farmers suffering from extremely low prices which results in huge losses, often leading to farmer suicides in many parts of the country.Banerjee has a long history of being involved with farmers’ stirs.She had earlier built up her challenge against the Left Front government in West Bengal leading agitations in Nandigram and Singur against moves by the then state administration to compulsorily acquire land from farmers for a chemical hub and a car factory respectively.Analysts speculated that the TMC, which wants to spread to other parts of the country, may be hoping to gain a political foothold in the Hindi heartland by handholding the farmers’ movement and taking advantage of the opposition vacuum in the country.Banerjee’s statement that she will remove Modi from power had earlier been made during her election campaign for the West Bengal assembly elections held in March-April this year, where she had promised that she would take the political battle to Delhi.Since her landslide victory, there have also been talks of her becoming the opposition face for the 2024 general elections, a question to which she has not given any answers yet.

09-06-2021||---||'Antilia' bomb scare-Hiran murder case: NIA gets 60 days more to file charge sheet||Mumbai, June 9 A special court in Mumbai on Wednesday gave 60 days extension to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to file its charge sheet in the case of an explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house and the subsequent murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran.The deadline for filing the charge sheet was to end on June 10. Former police officer Sachin Vaze, arrested on March 13, is a prime accused in the case. Besides Vaze, three other former policemen—Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane, Vinayak Shinde, and a bookie, Naresh Gor—are also accused in the case. Under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), the probe agency can seek time up to total 180 days since the day of the arrest of the accused, to submit the charge sheet. The NIA had earlier moved the special court seeking an extension of 90 days to file the charge sheet. The agency had said that extension was required to complete the probe against all the accused. The NIA, in its plea, stated that due the coronavirus-induced restrictions in the state, the witnesses were not available for the examination or for collection of documentary evidences. Moreover, the documents collected during the investigation are voluminous and hence their analysis requires more time. "The five  accused persons, in furtherance of the larger conspiracy along with others, had placed a threat note along with the gelatin sticks (explosives) inside the vehicle in order to threaten the Ambani family, and subsequently a threat letter emerged demanding money by Jaish-ul-Hind, which is a very serious act," the NIA's plea said. The involvement of Jaish-ul-Hind and its demand for money need deeper probe, it added. The NIA's plea was objected by the laywers of the accused, saying that the provisions of the UAPA were not applicable to them. Appearing for Vaze, Sudip Pasbola argued that the gelatin sticks cannot explode without a detonator, hence there was no threat to the society. All the articles are already recovered and nothing is left behind for probe, he said. No specific reasons are mentioned in the application for extension of period for filing of charge sheet, he added. Pasbola argued that the ground mentioned in the application is not sustainable in the eye of law, and hence the plea should be rejected. However, after hearing all the submissions, special court judge P R Sitre gave the NIA another 60 days to file the charge sheet. "The offence is investigated in various dimensions. There are many folds in which investigation is carried out...it requires more time for a thorough probe," the court said.The "tentacles of the investigation are deep-rooted", hence, it requires more time to search out each and every cause, the judge said. An explosives-laden was found parked near Ambani's multi-storey residence 'Antilia' in south Mumbai on February 25 this year.  Hiran, a Thane-based businessman, was found dead in a creek on March 5. He had earlier claimed that the SUV with explosives found near Ambani's house had been stolen from his possession. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/antilia-bomb-scare-hiran-murder-case-nia-gets-60-days-more-to-file-charge-sheet-265941
09-06-2021||New Delhi||Two women Army officers selected to train as combat pilots||In a historic move, the Army has selected two women officers to train as combat helicopter pilots for its aviation wing, officials said on Wednesday.The selection came six months after Army Chief General MM Naravane cleared a proposal to induct women as pilots.As of now, women are allowed in air traffic control and ground duties in the Army aviation wing.The two women officers will undergo training at the Combat Army Aviation Training School at Nashik in Maharashtra, the officials said.Fifteen women officers volunteered to join the Army aviation wing. However, only two have qualified through the stringent selection process, the officials said.The two women officers will join flying duties by July next year on a successful completion of the training period, they added.In 2018, Flying Officer Avani Chaturvedi of the Indian Air Force scripted history by becoming the first Indian woman to fly a fighter aircraft solo. She flew a MiG-21 bison in her first solo flight.Chaturvedi was part of a three-member women team commissioned as flying officers in July 2016, less than a year after the government decided to open the fighter stream for women on an experimental basis.Last year, the Navy announced deploying its first batch of women pilots on the Dornier maritime aircraft.In a significant move, the Army in 2019 began the process of inducting women into the military police.The role of the military police includes policing cantonments and Army establishments, preventing breach of rules and regulations by soldiers, maintaining movement of soldiers as well as logistics during peace and war, and extending aid to civil police, whenever required. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-women-army-officers-selected-to-train-as-combat-pilots-265938

Scindia and Prasada have left for the BJP, while Pilot and Deora seem to be upset over certain issues in the party and repeatedly called for course correction. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-must-reclaim-position-as-indias-big-tent-party-milind-deora-after-jitin-exit-265924

She also said that Jain continued to hold her assets—the jewellery she got from her family and friends, her clothes and even some of her own assets—in his possession.“I would also state that I have solely borne the expenses for my sister’s education and my family’s well-being from day one as they have been my responsibility. I need not use or keep anyone’s Credit Card, who (sic) I am not related to anymore. This too can be backed up by evidence,” she said.“The one who claims to be ‘rich’ and ‘been used by me’ has been taking money from my account by accessing my bank accounts illegally and by illegitimate means at odd-hours of the night, even post separation. I have already taken this up with the concerned Banking Authority and a Police Complaint shall be filed shortly,” she said in her statement.  “Being rich does not give the man the right to act as (sic) a victim and belittle the woman alone in this society,” her statement said.Here’s a screenshot of her statement in full.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-mp-nusrat-jahan-claims-marriage-with-husband-invalid-under-indian-law-265921

Once data from the final analysis of phase III studies are available, Bharat Biotech will apply for full licensure for Covaxin,” Bharat Biotech informed ANI on WednesdayRegarding the efficacy of the vaccine, Bharat Biotech said: “Vaccine efficacy refers to the ability of a vaccine to bring about the intended beneficial effects on vaccinated individuals in a defined population under ideal conditions of use. When it comes to efficacy and safety, the efficacy data of Covaxin have been reported at overall efficacy is 78 per cent and efficacy against hospitalizations is 100 per cent”.The company said, “Whole virus Inactivated vaccines have demonstrated one of the best safety records globally”.There are already several approved inactivated vaccines against polio, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, hepatitis A, and several vaccines under development such as chikungunya, zika, dengue and polio.In a recent preliminary pre- peer-reviewed study about vaccine efficacy report, Bharat Biotech has clarified that it has undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety and efficacy monitoring in Indian vaccines history.“A recent comparative report on an evaluation of immunogenicity responses to spike protein after the first and second dose of Indian manufactured vaccines study had lots of flaws. The journal that stated the comparative report said more antibodies produced by Covishield than Covaxin. This is not a peer-reviewed publication nor is it a statistically and scientifically designed study. The study design and conduct reflect an ad hoc analysis, rather than a predetermined hypothesis,” the company said.The indigenous whole virion inactivated SARS-Cov-2 virus vaccine company has also said that Covaxin will even undergo phase 4 trials to check the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines.“Bharat Biotech is also doing phase 4 trials to check on the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines, and to ensure its vaccine met every rigorous scientific standard for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization,” the company added. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-phase-3-full-trial-data-will-be-made-public-in-july-bharat-biotech-265919

The tug was deployed by Afcons to tow the barge GAL Constructor, which has also lost its anchors, drifting it away and ran aground near Palghar, Maharashtra, according to the FSUI.So far, 86 people have been confirmed dead.Mumbai Police, at Yellow Gate Police station, has registered a case of negligence against the captain of the barge following a complaint by an engineer.“This (police investigation) seems to be a planned ploy to get out of the responsibility by ONGC and its contractor, Afcon.“The Union feels that there are some hidden agenda of the shipowners and contractors and request your good self to kindly take necessary steps to pin the responsibility and find the lapse in this incident for which we request you to order a high Level and speedy judicial inquiry,” FSUI General Secretary Naresh Birwadkar said in the letter.Stating that such a probe could bring out the lapses like whether all the vessels were following mandatory international maritime rules and regulations, he said.“We also request the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, to do the needful to conduct marine auditing on the subject vessels. We also request suitable death compensation, as per the MLC/ILO Minimum wages norms and considering the special circumstances,” Birwadkar stated in the letter.Following the incident, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural announced the setting up of a 3-member high-level committee, comprising Director General Hydrocarbon, Director General Shipping and a Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Defence to inquire into the drifting of several vessels into the sea.Besides, the DGS is carrying out the statutory “casualty investigation” to find out the people responsible for the incident which resulted in so many deaths. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-barge-tragedy-fsui-seeks-speedy-judicial-inquiry-suitable-compensation-265912
09-06-2021||Kathmandu||Nepal has not issued any formal ban order against Patanjali's Coronil: Official||Nepal's government has not issued any formal ban order against Patanjali's Ayurveda-based Coronil in the country, a health ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.Yoga Guru Ramdev had introduced Ayurveda-based Coronil tablets on June 23 last year, when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak in India.Health Ministry Spokesperson Dr. Krishna Prasad Poudyal refuted media reports that the Nepal government has banned Coronil in the country."The government has not issued any formal ban order against the medicine," he said.He said that any type of medicines which are supposed to be distributed to the general public needs to be registered at the Department of Drug Administration under the Ministry of Health and Population first.A packet of Coronil was gifted to Nepal's then Health Minister Hridayesh Tripathi some time ago, Poudyal said."Other than that I have no information regarding the matter,” he added.There is no proof that Coronil can cure corona disease, said a Health Ministry official on condition of anonymity.There are many Ayurvedic medicines available in Nepal, which can boost immunity of individuals and may also help to get rid of corona infection. However, the World Health Organisation has not yet approved any medicine that can cure corona, he added.Last month, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) asked The Haridwar-based Patanjali Yogpeeth to withdraw a "misleading" advertisement from all platforms endorsing "Coronil kit", a product of his firm, as an effective medicine for Covid-19, failing which it said an FIR and a criminal case will be lodged against Ramdev.Nepal on Tuesday reported 3,870 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of cases to 5,95,364. The Health Ministry also said 108 new deaths were reported, including figures from the past few days based on the statistics from the Nepal Army. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-has-not-issued-any-formal-ban-order-against-patanjalis-coronil-official-265905
09-06-2021||Lucknow||UP govt refuses to share information on compulsory retirement of Amitabh Thakur||The Uttar Pradesh government has refused to share information with former IPS officer Amitabh Thakur regarding his compulsory retirement, saying the documents are "highly confidential".Thakur called this denial "improper and suspicious", saying initially he was given compulsory retirement in an "arbitrary manner" and now he was being denied information related to his livelihood.UP cadre IPS officer Thakur was given compulsory retirement on March 23 following a decision taken by the Union Home Ministry.He had sought documents related to the decision through a letter on May 26."Amitabh sought a copy of note sheet, correspondence, minutes, etc. of the file related to his compulsory retirement. These documents cannot be provided because they are highly confidential documents related to the discussion and approval at the highest level," stated an order issued by Special Secretary of the Home Department Kumar Prashant on June 3.Previously, the Ministry of Home Affairs had also denied sharing the information under the RTI Act.Thakur was compulsorily retired with immediate effect in "public interest" on March 23, 2021.Thakur was "not found fit to be retained for the remaining tenure of his service", an order from the Union Home Ministry had said."In the public interest, Amitabh Thakur is being given premature retirement before completion of his service with immediate effect," it stated.In 2017, Thakur had urged the Centre to dispose of his request for change of cadre to any state other than UP, saying the 'bias' against him did not exist anymore after the then ruling Samajwadi Party was routed in the assembly polls.The officer was suspended on July 13, 2015, days after he accused SP patron Mulayam Singh of threatening him.A vigilance enquiry was also initiated against him.However, the Lucknow Bench of Central Administrative Tribunal stayed his suspension in April 2016 and ordered his reinstatement with full salary with effect from October 11, 2015.

No forward movement has happened since, except that the Congress high command stands further weakened after the May 2 losses of the party which was reduced to a naught in West Bengal, failed to dislodge the incumbents BJP and the Left in Assam and Kerala, respectively, and frittered Puducherry away. The Congress only made it in Tamil Nadu as a marginal alliance partner to the DMK which looking back could have won on its own too.A shrinking electoral fortune coupled with inability of the Central leadership to assert changes and sustain them is compounding the party’s woes, with several young leaders unable to see a future here.Internal wounds have been allowed to fester for too long, as in Rajasthan where Pilot and his loyalists continue to languish on the margins under Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot despite the AICC forming a panel to address concerned of leaders, as a negotiation for Pilot to stay in the Congress and await a rehabilitation.Deora has long been speculated to be veering towards the BJP unable to find a future in the Congress.First @JM_Scindia now @JitinPrasada - huge blows for @incindia as we lose leaders who gave & still had much to give to the Party. Agreed, they shouldn’t have abandoned INC esp during troubled waters. But Congress needs to identify & empower mass leaders to win back states.  Even in Punjab, sitting Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is under attack from his own party men, with the Congress recently allowing disgruntled elements to voice grievances before a panel — a move publicly seen as weakening the Chief Minister in an election year.Likewise, in Karnataka former Chief Minister Siddharamaiah and current party chief DK Shivakumar are at loggerheads, with both vying for a leadership role ahead of polls.Sources also say the Congress political strategy and narrative are becoming matters of concern, with several leaders publicly voicing concerns when the party allied with the radical ISF in West Bengal and similar forces in Assam and Kerala.Congress veteran Anand Sharma then publicly questioned the party for compromising its secular credentials.Several leaders feel that there’s lack of adequate dialogue and discussion on the wider communication strategy the party should adopt on major issues, including Covid management, vaccines and other major issues.Lack of a clear chain of command also remains a problem with Rahul Gandhi continuing to make key appointments, even as his mother performs the role of party president.A section of leaders do not rule out exits from G-23 and says “patience is running thin”.Meanwhile, Congress organisational changes and internal elections stand postponed until Covid situation resolved, with timelines unclear and hazy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jitin-prasadas-exit-could-signal-a-season-of-defections-in-congress-265891
09-06-2021||New Delhi||Priyanka slams Uttar Pradesh govt over Agra hospital ‘mock drill’||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday attacked the Yogi Adityanath dispensation over the reported “mock drill” at a private hospital in Agra in which oxygen supply was allegedly cut off for five minutes, and asked if the Uttar Pradesh government will bring out the truth and punish those guilty.The Agra administration on Tuesday ordered a probe after a video clip surfaced in which the owner of a private hospital there was purportedly heard saying that he conducted a “mock drill” in which oxygen supply was cut off for Covid patients for five minutes.In the video which went viral on social media, the owner of the hospital is also heard saying that bodies of some patients started turning blue after the oxygen supply was cut off.Tagging media reports on the incident, Gandhi tweeted, “Amidst severe shortage of oxygen, the Uttar Pradesh government kept on saying ‘there is no shortage’. People across the state struggled and lost their lives. The administration in Agra is also saying ‘there was no shortage of oxygen’.”            Will the state government bring out the truth of the “Agra mock drill” and punish the guilty, the Congress general secretary in-charge Uttar Pradesh asked.Agra District Magistrate Prabhu N Singh had told reporters that action will be taken against the owner of the hospital under the Pandemic Act.In the April video, Dr Arinjay Jain allegedly claims that there was acute oxygen shortage at the hospital during the second wave of coronavirus.“We talked with families of the patients but no one was ready to discharge their patients. So we decided to conduct a mock drill so that we could segregate the critically ill patients. After shutting off oxygen supply for five minutes, bodies of 22 patients started turning blue,” Jain had said.He said that families of the remaining 74 Covid patients were asked to arrange for oxygen cylinders.However, the district magistrate has said there was no scarcity of oxygen at the hospital and that no patient died due to oxygen shortage at the hospital.

09-06-2021||New Delhi||Rahul Gandhi loyalist Jitin Prasada joins BJP ahead of 2022 UP polls||In a major setback to the Congress party, a prominent face from poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, Jitin Prasada, joined the BJP giving the saffron party on Wednesday a leg-up in caste equations while it prepares for Assembly elections next year. Welcoming him into the saffron fold in the presence of Union minister Piyush Goyal, BJP’s chief spokesperson, and MP Anil Baluni said Prasada was joining the party as he was “impressed” with the working style of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Goyal too heaped praises on Prasada, lauding him as a leader of stature whose induction will boost the BJP and help him serve the society.In his first statement from the BJP podium, Prasada applauded Prime Minister Modi and called Home Minister Amit Shah ‘karmyogi’. “If there is any political party or a leader standing for the interests of the nation today it is BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Prasad said. He said he was joining the BJP that it was the only national party that worked in an institutional way, while others were all about a few people or confined to specific regions.“The BJP is the only party that is truly a national party, other parties are mostly regional or individual based/oriented,” he said.Pointing that politics is for public service, Prasada said he realised he cannot do it in Congress. “If we cannot help people, protect their interests, there is no point being in politics. I was not being able to serve people (in Congress)”, said the 47-year-old former Union minister who comes from a well-known Brahmin family of UP.His father Jitendra Prasada was a noted Congress leader.“This is a new chapter of my life. I have been associated with three generations of Congress. I have taken the decision after a lot of consideration. The question is not which party I am leaving but the party I am joining. Only BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi can take the country forward and I want to be part of the new India PM Modi is trying to build,” he said.With the Congress in the doldrums in UP, his decision to join the BJP may help him politically at a time when the saffron party is trying to ramp up resources to keep together all sections of the society. Apart from “mismanagement” during the second wave of Covid-19 and anti-incumbency, Yogi Adityanath is also facing allegations of “favouring” the Thakur community at the cost of Brahmins. Prasada’s inclusion is expected to assuage some of such feelings.While it remains to be seen what he brings to the table, politically, (he had lost the Lok Sabha polls) observers say it is “more about perceptions”. Last year he had launched the ‘Brahmin Chetna Parishad’ to give voice to the community. However, for Prasada, who stuck his neck out by aligning with what is known as 'G-23', it may be a win-win situation. He has been trying to resurrect his career and already there are speculations of a “settlement” for him in the Adityanath government.For Congress, the development comes as another blow. The party appears to be struggling to stop promising young leaders from leaving it. Prasada follows Jyotiraditya Scindia and sources claim many prominent leaders from other parties are in line to join the BJP in the run-up to Assembly elections, next year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-loyalist-jitin-prasada-joins-bjp-ahead-of-2022-up-polls-265876

I'm also not following list of fraudsters so I haven't been aware of his real name and background until last week. And I believe most people in Antigua...I don't think anyone knew his name or background," Barbara Jabarica told ANI.She also disclosed that Choksi had introduced himself as Raj to her. She said, "I know him (Mehul Choksi) since last August and met with him in Jolly Harbour when I rented Airbnb accommodation near where he also lives. He introduced himself as Raj. Between August to April, he was always texting me but I replied to him once a month."According to Barbara, Choksi made a lot of effort to convince her to join the diamond business with him. She also spoke to ANI about the much talked about ring, which he reportedly gifted to her.She said, "I wouldn't say he gifted me, we had a conversation between April and May, he wanted to convince me that I should get involved, we should do business, he will arrange for me and I sell jewellery, diamonds and designs online. He said he had some higher quality diamonds, if I have any private client in New York or the middle east then he can supply and we can have a good profit share.""I think, one of the main purposes from his side, the reason why he gave me this jewellery, he wanted to convince me to get involved with his jewellery business," said Barbara."He lied to his country, clients, to me about his name, background, jewellery and so on. I would question and many people would question now that has he ever said the truth about anything," added Barbara.Talking about her relations with Choksi, she said, "I made this clear in a few interviews that I wasn't his (Mehul Choksi) girlfriend and he's not my sugar daddy or anything like that. I've my own income and business. I don't need his cash, support, hotel booking, fake jewellery, or anything like that."Earlier, Barbara also talked about Choksi's plan to escape to Cuba.However, Choksi's family and lawyers rubbished the theory and made a counterclaim that he was abducted and also accused Barbara of plotting the abduction of the fugitive diamantaire.In his recent complaint to the Antiguan Police Commissioner, Choksi claimed that he was attacked by eight to 10 men while he was on his way to meet a woman named Barbara Jabarica, with whom he claimed to have 'friendly terms'.Choksi had gone missing from Antigua on May 23 and was caught in Dominica. He was charged with illegal entry by the police in Dominica after he allegedly escaped from Antigua and Barbuda in a possible attempt to evade extradition to India.The 62-year-old fugitive is wanted in India in connection with a Rs 13,500-crore fraud in the Punjab National Bank.

09-06-2021||New Delhi||'Baba' back to dhaba after restaurant fails||Kanta Prasad, the owner of Baba Ka Dhaba eatery in Delhi, who had shot to fame last year after a YouTuber highlighted octogenarian's grim financial condition due to the coronavirus pandemic, had to shut down his new restaurant that he had opened in Malviya Nagar in December 2020 using the donation money, owing to losses.Also read: Owner of ‘Baba ka Dhaba’ opens new restaurantThe 80-year-old is now running his famous 'Baba Ka Dhaba' eatery and wishes to continue to running this Dhaba as long as he is alive.In December last year, Kanta Prasad had started a new restaurant in Malviya Nagar. The name of Kanta Prasad's new restaurant was also 'Baba Ka Dhaba' and was just a few minutes away from his old Dhaba."I had shut that new eatery on February 15. The heavy expense of around Rs 1 lakh was involved in running it and we had to pay Rs 36,000 per month to workers working there and the rent of that shop was Rs 35,000 per month. Other expenses included electricity bill, water bill, etc. As compared to the investment, the returns were less so it was necessary to close it because we were incurring losses," Prasad told ANI.According to Kanta Prasad, the menu of his restaurant included Indian and Chinese food.He said that his old eatery is more profitable since the investment and maintenance cost is less and he makes good profits."I am able to earn more through this shop (old eatery) since most of our customers know this place. Not many knew about our new shop," he further said.After the video, in which 'Baba Ka Dhaba' owner tearfully talked about the loss of business due to the Covid, went viral, hundreds of people queued up outside his eatery in south Delhi to buy their food. The eatery became an overnight success and people from across the country had also made generous donations to Kanta Prasad. Later, he started a restaurant with this money.Kanta Prasad said he still has Rs 20 lakhs left for his future."I will run this Dhaba till I am alive. The day business sees a slump, I will shut it. We have kept Rs 20 lakhs for me and my wife from the money we received as donations last year," he added.

09-06-2021||Washington||Indian-Americans regularly encounter discrimination: Survey||Indian-Americans, who constitute the second-largest immigrant group in the US, regularly encounter discrimination and polarisation, according to a survey released on Wednesday.The report, ‘Social Realities of Indian Americans: Results from the 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey' draws on the Indian-American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) -- a collaboration between the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins-SAIS, and the University of Pennsylvania.The findings of the report are based on a nationally representative online survey of 1,200 Indian-American residents in the US -- the 2020 IAAS -- conducted between September 1 and September 20, 2020, in partnership with the research and analytics firm YouGov, it said in a statement.“Indian-Americans regularly encounter discrimination. One in two Indian Americans reports being discriminated against in the past one year, with discrimination based on skin colour identified as the most common form of bias.“Somewhat surprisingly, Indian-Americans born in the United States are much more likely to report being victims of discrimination than their foreign-born counterparts,” said the report.According to the report, Indian-Americans exhibit very high rates of marriage within their community.While eight out of 10 respondents have a spouse or partner of Indian-origin, US-born Indian-Americans are four times more likely to have a spouse or partner who is of Indian-origin but was born in the United States.The survey found that religion plays a central role in the lives of Indian-Americans but religious practice varies.While nearly three-quarters of Indian-Americans state that religion plays an important role in their lives, religious practice is less pronounced.Forty per cent of respondents pray at least once a day and 27 per cent attend religious services at least once a week.The report notes that roughly half of all Hindu Indian-Americans identify with a caste group. Foreign-born respondents are significantly more likely than US-born respondents to espouse a caste identity. The overwhelming majority of Hindus with a caste identity -- more than eight in 10 -- self-identify as belonging to the category of General or upper caste. “Indian-American” itself is a contested identity. While Indian-American is a commonly used shorthand to describe people of Indian-origin, it is not universally embraced. Only four in 10 respondents believe that “Indian-American” is the term that best captures their background, the report said.Civic and political engagement varies considerably by one's citizenship status. Across nearly all metrics of civic and political participation, US-born citizens report the highest levels of engagement, followed by foreign-born US citizens, with non-citizens trailing behind.Indian-Americans' social communities are heavily populated by other people of Indian-origin. Indian-Americans -- especially members of the first generation -- tend to socialise with other Indian-Americans.Internally, the social networks of Indian-Americans are more homogenous in terms of religion than either Indian region (state) of origin or caste.The report says that polarisation among Indian-Americans reflects broader trends in the American society.“While religious polarisation is less pronounced at an individual level, partisan polarisation -- linked to political preferences both in India and the United States -- is rife. However, this polarisation is asymmetric: Democrats are much less comfortable having close friends who are Republicans than the converse,” it said.The same is true of Congress Party supporters vis-a-vis supporters of the BJP.“To some extent, divisions in India are being reproduced within the Indian-American community. While only a minority of respondents are concerned about the importation of political divisions from India to the United States, those who identify religion, political leadership and political parties in India as the most common factors,” the report added.Indian-Americans comprise slightly more than 1 per cent of the total US population-and less than 1 per cent of all registered voters.Indian Americans are the second-largest immigrant group in the United States. There are 4.2 million people of Indian origin residing in the United States, according to 2018 data.

09-06-2021||Washington||Quad's commitment to provide a billion vaccines to people in Southeast Asia is on track: WH official||The commitment of the Quad nations to provide a billion Covid vaccines to people in Southeast Asia by 2022 is still on track, despite a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India, a top White House official has said.In March, leaders of the Quad--comprising Australia, India, Japan and the United States–during a virtual summit had committed themselves to provide a billion vaccines to Southeast Asia. These vaccines were to be manufactured in India, but due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic certain quarters are raising doubts if the Quad can meet its commitment by 2022."We have been in close consultations with our partners and with India. Obviously, this is an extremely difficult period for Indian friends. The United States has tried to stand with Delhi and to bring others both in the private and the public sectors to support them," Kurt Campbell, the White House's Indo-Pacific policy director, said."Our discussions with both our partners in the private sector and also in government suggests that we are knock-on-wood still on track for 2022,” he said.Participating in a panel discussion organised by the Center for New American Security, a think-tank in Washington DC, the top White House official said that the most intense efforts right now really are in the short-term.“I think we're feeling relatively confident as we head into 2022, but we recognise that what we are facing right now across Asia, in fact, across the world are new strains that spread more rapidly,” Campbell said.So even countries that did extremely well through social distancing and masking are now facing outbreaks even with tremendous stringency, he said. “So, we understand the only way to be effective to counter this is through vaccine diplomacy. We are trying to step that up more generally,” Campbell said.Campbell said that the goal is to hold an in-person Quad meeting and a “very ambitious meeting” here in Washington, in the fall, he said. “With all leaders in attendance, we will ensure that we've taken the necessary steps on the vaccine deliverable,” Campbell said.“We intend to build on that. We want to do something constructive with respect to infrastructure. We are going to take some other steps to build out the Quad to ensure that as an unofficial gathering, it still is a defining feature of modern diplomacy linking these key maritime democracies in a way that is deeply consequential for the 21st century,” he said.Responding to a question on news reports of expansion of the Quad, he said that the focus is going to be on deepening and increasing familiarity and broaden within governments.“We recognize that our strategic purpose extends beyond vaccines. We're going to look at a number of areas where we think there are some natural arenas for cooperation. This is not a closed architecture. I think we want others to participate with us subsequently and follow through on initiatives,” he said."We are briefing people actively on it. I will say that we are getting interest. People want to learn more,” Campbell said. They want to understand how they can be actively engaged, he said.“We think that's a positive sign. We are focused on really now more than anything else, however, is make sure these foundational members take the necessary steps to support a strong venture,” Campbell said.

This is higher than Rs35,000 cr that was announced in the Budget.Vax nod likely for Pregnant womenAIIMS (Delhi) Director Randeep Guleria, part of the government’s expert group on vaccine plan changes, said India was awaiting safety data and once it was out, approval may be granted to vaccinate pregnant women.Also, the government today issued an order capping the prices for administration of three approved vaccines in private hospitals across India. The maximum price that can be charged per dose by private vaccine centres is Rs 780 for Covishield, Rs 1,410 for Covaxin and Rs 1,145 for Sputnik V. The Health Ministry has written to all states informing them of the price caps. The final costs are based on price per dose declared by manufacturers (Rs 600 Covishield; Rs 1,200 Covaxin and Rs 948 Sputnik V), plus GST at the rate of 5 per cent and maximum service charge of Rs 150 per dose.

The govt is driven by headlines, not deadlines.“From August onwards, the challenge will not be vaccine availability, but absorption. We will need to speed up vaccinations,” Paul said as India recorded 86,498 daily Covid cases, the lowest since April 3 and a 79% decline from the May 7 peak of 4.14 lakh cases.The developments coincided with the Health Ministry today issuing revised Covid vaccine guidelines under which states would not have to spend anything on jabs.Paul also dismissed the Congress’ accusations that the PM’s announcements were rooted in adverse apex court remarks on the government’s vaccine policy.“We respect the Supreme Court’s concerns, but the government has been evaluating the decentralised procurement model ever since it was implemented on May 1. The PM held two review meetings on May 15 and 21 and directed that an alternate model be developed. On May 24, we met vaccine manufacturers and discussed the nuances.

The gangs believed the system was secure because the phones did not have voice or camera functions, and the app was encrypted. “We have been in the back pockets of organised crime,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said, adding, “All they talk about is drugs and violence.” — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/operation-trojan-shield-sting-ensnares-many-in-global-drug-trade-265524

Currently, Choksi has got interim relief from immediate deportation to India by the Dominican court, which adjourned the hearing on his detention.Local media outlet Loop Jamaica News has quoted the Dominica PM as saying: “The matter with this Indian citizen is before the courts, the courts will decide what happens to this gentleman and we allow the court process to go through.”“His rights will be respected as have been done thus far and let the courts decide what has to happen in that regard. We have no interest in the issues in Antigua and the issues in India. We are part of a whole community and we have to recognise our duty and our responsibility,” Skerrit said.Sources in Indian agencies here, however, said it was “quite encouraging” to hear the Dominican PM, who recognised Choksi as an Indian citizen. “Once the trial gets over and the court pronounces its judgment, chances of bringing Choksi back have become more real,” said a senior official.Choksi had gone missing from Antigua on May 23 after going out for dinner and was soon caught in Dominica. The 62-year-old fugitive is wanted in India in connection with the Rs 13,500-crore PNB fraud. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/choksi-indian-citizen-court-to-take-call-dominican-pm-265560

I am really impressed with the way you kept track of happenings in the country and the concern that you have displayed for the well-being of people in the wake of the pandemic.“I am sure you will grow-up into an alert, informed and responsible citizen who will contribute immensely towards nation building,” the CJI wrote back wishing the best and all-round success to the little girl.Joseph, a student of Kendriya Vidyalaya at Thrissur, also enclosed in her letter a drawing depicting discharge of duties by the apex court where a judge is seen hammering down coronavirus and has the tricolour, national emblem and smiling portrait of father of the nation.“I was much worried about the deaths in Delhi and other parts of the country due to Corona. From the newspaper I understood that your honourable court has intervened effectively at the sufferings and death of ordinary people in the fight against Covid-19.“I am happy and feel proud that your honourable court has moved orders for supply of oxygen and saved many lives. I understood your honourable court has initiated effective steps in bringing down Covid-19 and the death rate in our country especially in Delhi. I thank you, your Honour for this. Now I feel very proud and happy..,” Joseph wrote to CJI Ramana towards the end of May when Delhiites were facing tough times due to the deadly second wave of coronavirus.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday that the central government will provide free coronavirus vaccine to states for inoculation of all above the age of 18 from June 21 and this led to an intense debate in the media as to who and what triggered the decision.As per news reports, while Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan thanked the Centre for the decision, the Delhi government credited the Supreme Court for the decision announced by the Prime Minister in his address to the nation.Some reports also said the Centre had initiated the decision-making process and the ground work before the apex court’s remarks.Few days before the Prime Minister announced free Covid inoculation for those above 18 years of age from June 21, the Supreme Court, in its May 31 order which was uploaded two day after the hearing, had asked the Centre to review its vaccination policy saying it was “prima facie arbitrary and irrational” for allowing states and private hospitals to charge people of 18-44 age group for the jabs.

09-06-2021||Mumbai||Centre says door-to-door vaccination not possible; favours ‘near-to-door’ system||The Centre told the Bombay High Court on Tuesday that a door-to-door COVID-19 vaccination programme for senior citizens, specially-abled, bed-ridden and wheelchair-bound people is currently not possible, but it has decided to start “near-to-door” inoculation centres.The Union government in its affidavit filed in the HC said the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration (NEGVAC) has considered the issue of door-to-door vaccination and opined that “near-to-door” vaccination would be an appropriate solution, and not door-to-door vaccination.Read alsoEarly Covishield 2nd dose permitted for Olympic participants, students and job applicants abroadCentre places orders for 44 crore doses of Covishield & Covaxin after PM announces new vaccine policyHope to grant Covid vax approval for pregnant women soon: AIIMS chief The court noted that almost 25 crore people have been vaccinated in India.“Which other country has been able to do so with so much population. The government can do this (door-to-door vaccination) too. You (government) need to find your own way,” Chief Justice Dipankar Datta said.A division bench of Chief Justice Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni last month directed the NEGVAC to consider if door-to-door vaccination programmes can be started for senior citizens, specially-abled people and those who are wheelchair-bound or bed-ridden.The order was passed in a public interest litigation filed by two lawyers  Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari  raising concerns over how several people would not be able to travel to the vaccination centres.The Centre in its affidavit filed on Tuesday said the issue was discussed by the NEGVAC in its meeting on May 25.“All the members/experts, who participated in the meeting, unanimously agreed that the Covid-19 vaccine cannot be given at home due to issues and risks cited by the expert committee,” it said.However, the NEGVAC agreed that since the elderly and specially-abled people have limited mobility, there is a need to increase access by bringing the vaccination services closer to such communities while maintaining all necessary precautions and safety measures.The affidavit said the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare formulated standard operating procedures (SOPs) related to the ‘Near to Home Vaccination Centres’ on May 27.These vaccination sessions can be conducted in non- health facilities and will be linked to an existing Covid-19 vaccination centre, it said.The HC noted that while it appreciates the efforts taken by the committee and the Union government, the concerns raised by the panel on why door-to-door vaccines cannot be started do not seem to be very serious.“The concerns raised by the expert committee on why door-to-door vaccination cannot be started are not very serious. These can be overcome if the government wishes to,” it said.The court noted that the risks the committee mentioned for door-to-door vaccination will be there at the inoculation centres as well.The Centre’s affidavit claimed that till May, 25,309 cases of adverse reaction after vaccination were reported out of which 1,186 were serious. “475 deaths were reported following Covid-19 vaccination till May 28, 2021,” it said.The court will continue hearing the matter on Wednesday.

09-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre places orders for 44 crore doses of Covishield & Covaxin after PM announces new vaccine policy||A day after prime minister Narendra Modi announced the decision to revert to centralised procurement of Covid-19 vaccines for free supply to states from June 21, the Government placed an order of 44 crore doses—25 crore with the Serum Institute of India and 19 crore with Bharat Biotech—for supplies starting August.Member, Health, NITI Aayog VK Paul said the country already had 53.6 crore doses available for administration until July and the two Indian manufacturers have been given 30 per cent advance funds to supply 44 crore doses for the national programme from August until December.Responding to the narrative that the PM announced a return to centralised procurement in the wake of apex court orders on the Indian vaccine policy, Paul said the government respected the SC orders but the return to the old policy was a result of internal review meetings the PM took on May 15 and 21. “Review of the policy started from May 1 when it was implemented. Thirteen states and UTs requested the PM to revert to the old system, among them Punjab, Kerala, Rajasthan and Odisha,” said the expert.Early Covishield 2nd dose permitted for Olympic participants, students and job applicants abroadThe placement of new vaccine orders came simultaneously to the Ministry of Health on Tuesday issuing revised Covid vaccine guidelines under which states would not have to do any procurement.The Centre will buy 75 per cent monthly vaccines produced in India and supply these free to states for further free administration to the following priority groups—health and frontline workers, 45 plus people, those whose second doses are due and those above 18 years.Free doses will be administered at government centres across states which will have the freedom to sub-prioritize the 18 to 44 year age group. Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday said it will first inoculate mothers whose kids are under 5 years old.The government Monday also announced a special provision of electronic vouchers which people can buy for anyone they want to support in private vaccination. Vaccine manufacturers will continue to supply up to 25 pc of monthly production to private hospitals with the Centre today saying that the states would have to aggregate the demands of private hospitals to ensure a regional balance.Right now 9000 private hospitals are conducting vaccinations while India has over 25000 private facilities.Hope to grant Covid vax approval for pregnant women soon: AIIMS chiefThe private hospitals will not charge more than Rs 150 a dose as service charge and the manufacturers will have to make advance declaration of prices before private procurement of jabs.Paul assured people on Tuesday that vaccine availability won’t be an issue starting August.“The challenge then would be the absorption of doses and enhancement of the pace of vaccination,” Paul said, adding that the government had confidence in SII and Bharat Biotech’s ability to deliver the doses.New treatment guidelines drop ivermectin, zinc, vitamins, hydroxychloroquineThe government also said prices for procurement of vaccines would now be renegotiated.“All citizens irrespective of income status will be entitled to free vaccines. Those who have the ability to pay are encouraged to use private hospital vaccine centres. If someone wants to help anyone get vaccinated in the private sector, a non transferable e voucher will be made available. People can buy the voucher in the name of a certain person who can use it to get private vaccination,” Paul said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-places-orders-for-44-crore-doses-of-covishield-covaxin-after-pm-announces-new-vaccine-policy-265440

09-06-2021||Johannesburg||Mahatma Gandhi's great granddaughter jailed for 7 years in South Africa for Rs 3.3 crore fraud||A 56-year-old great-granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi, who was an accused in a six-million rand fraud and forgery case, has been sentenced to seven years in jail by a Durban court.Ashish Lata Ramgobin was found guilty by the court on Monday.She was accused of defrauding businessman SR Maharaj after he advanced R6.2 million to her for allegedly clearing import and Customs duties for a non-existent consignment from India. He was promised a share of profits.Lata Ramgobin, who is the daughter of noted rights activists Ela Gandhi and late Mewa Ramgobind, was also refused leave to appeal both the conviction and the sentence by the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court.When trial in the case against Lata Ramgobin started in 2015, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had said that she allegedly provided forged invoices and documents to convince potential investors that three containers of linen were being shipped in from India.At that time, Lata Ramgobin was released on a bail of 50,000 rand.On Monday, the court during the hearing was informed that Lata Ramgobin had met Maharaj, director of the New Africa Alliance Footwear Distributors, in August 2015.         The company imports and manufactures and sells clothing, linen and footwear.Maharaj's company also provides finance to other companies on a profit-share basis.Lata Ramgobin had told Maharaj that she had imported three containers of linen for the South African Hospital Group NetCare."She said she was experiencing financial difficulties to pay for import costs and customs and she needed the money to clear the goods at the harbour,” NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara said on Monday."She advised him (Maharaj) that she needed R6.2 million. To convince him, she showed him what she claimed was a signed purchase order for the goods.  Later that month, she sent him what seemed to be a NetCare invoice and delivery note as proof that the goods were delivered and payment was imminent," she said.Lata Ramgobin “further sent him confirmation from NetCare's bank account that payment had been made”, Kara said.Because of Ramgobin's family credentials and NetCare documents, Maharaj had entered into a written agreement with her for the loan.However, after Maharaj found out that the documents were forged and NetCare had no arrangements with Lata Ramgobin, he laid criminal charges.Ramgobin was founder and executive director of the Participative Development Initiative at the NGO International Centre for Non-Violence, where she described herself as “an activist with focus on environmental, societal and political interests.”     A number of other descendants of Mahatma Gandhi are human rights activists and among them are Lata Ramgobin's cousins Kirti Menon, the late Satish Dhupelia, and Uma Dhupelia-Mesthrie.Ramgobin's mother Ela Gandhi in particular has been internationally recognised for her efforts, including national honours from both India and South Africa.
