10-06-2021||New Delhi||May records 2nd highest rainfall in 121 years; no significant heat wave spell: IMD||May received the second highest rainfall in 121 years, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its monthly report on Thursday, attributing two back-to-back cyclones and western disturbances for the record precipitation.It also said that at 34.18 degrees Celsius, the average maximum temperature over India this May was the fourth lowest since 1901.The lowest ever temperature recorded for May was 32.68 degrees Celsius in 1917. The temperature was lowest since 1977 when it was of 33.84 degrees Celsius, the IMD said.There was no significant heat wave spell observed during the month over any parts of India, he said.Rainfall over the country as a whole for the month of May 2021 shows that it has recorded 107.9 millimetres which is 74 per cent more than its Long Period Average (LPA) of 62 mm.“Rainfall over India during the month of May was second highest since 1901. The highest ever rainfall occurred in the year 1990 (110.7mm),” the IMD said in its monthly report for May.May saw formation of a cyclone each in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.Tauktae formed over the Arabian Sea and developed into an ‘extremely severe cyclonic storm’. It hit the Gujarat coast on May 17 after battering states along the western coast.Cyclone ‘Yaas’ developed over the Bay of Bengal and intensified into a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’. It hit the Odisha coast on May 26 and also affected West Bengal.These two systems brought rainfall not only over the states along the western and eastern coasts but also to other parts of the country. For instance, as Cyclone ‘Tauktae’ weakened, it headed towards north India and brought rains over several parts of north India.   Similarly, ‘Yaas’ brought rains over east India including Jharkhand, Bihar as it weakened.The IMD said that in all three months of the summer of 2021, frequencies of western disturbance activities over north India were higher than normal.In March, April and May 2021, it was seven, nine and eight respectively against normal of 4-6 WDs, the IMD added.Western disturbances are cyclonic storms that originate in the Mediterranean, traverse across Central Asia and hit the north India. They are critical to northwest India as they are a major source of snow and rainfall during the winters.Like in March and April 2021, heat wave conditions in May 2021 were occasional and also for shorter periods over very small region.“No significant heat wave occurred during the month over the country except northwest Rajasthan where it was observed for two days on May 29 and 30,” the IMD said.

10-06-2021||New Delhi||India blasts Pakistan for making unsubstantiated claim on seizure of ‘radioactive’ material||India hit out at Pakistan on Thursday for making an unverified claim that some material seized recently in Jharkhand’s Bokaro was uranium and described it as an attempt by Islamabad to malign the country.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the material seized was not uranium and asserted that India maintains a stringent law-based regulatory system for internationally-controlled items, which is reflected in its “impeccable” non-proliferation credentials.“The Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India, after due evaluation and laboratory analysis of the material sample, has stated that the material seized last week is not uranium and not radioactive,” MEA Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.“The gratuitous remarks about India by Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, drawing upon a media report, indicate their disposition to malign India without caring to check or verify facts,” he said at a media briefing.Bagchi was replying to a question on Pakistan’s official remarks in response to a media report on the seizure of the suspicious material in Bokaro last week.“Let me also reaffirm that India maintains a stringent law-based regulatory system for internationally-controlled items, which is reflected in our impeccable non-proliferation credentials recognised by the international community,” he said.Last week, Pakistan’s foreign ministry called for a probe into what it called the seizure of nuclear material.Asked about reports of security concerns at the Indian High Commission in Pakistan, Bagchi did not give a direct reply but said the MEA maintains contacts with local authorities regarding the safety and security of its diplomatic premises.“The MEA maintains contact with local authorities regarding the safety and security of all our diplomatic premises, which we believe is the responsibility of the host government,” he said.

10-06-2021||Hyderabad||IT jobs double in Telangana in seven years||The jobs in the Information Technology (IT) sector in Telangana have nearly doubled in the last seven years, IT Minister KT Rama Rao (KTR) has announced. “Despite the pandemic and the testing times, Telangana’s employment in the IT sector and its allied sectors has doubled as compared to 2014. Each direct job in the IT sector leads to 2.5 jobs in other sectors.” IT exports from Telangana has also touched a new high of Rs 1.45 lakh crore for the year 2020-2021.This was disclosed by IT Minister KT Rama Rao (KTR) while releasing the annual reports of the Industries and IT departments here on Thursday.This amounts to an increase of 13 per cent over the last year’s IT exports of Rs 1.28 lakh crore. This spectacular achievement has become a reality despite the pandemic, Rao said.The IT exports were Rs 57,000 crore when the new state of Telangana came into being in 2014.“Since the formation of Telangana, we have been able to achieve a CAGR of 14.25 per cent, from Rs 57,000 crore to Rs 1.45 lakh crore,” he said. “Telangana once again boasted a phenomenal growth in the IT/ITeS sector with an increase of 12.98 per cent in IT exports over the previous year, recording a total of Rs 1.45 lakh crore. Telangana has seen more than double the estimated average national growth rate,” he said. The report reads that the employment in the IT/ITeS sector has also increased by eight per cent to reach 6,28,615 during 2020-21. Telangana, despite the Covid situation, has added 46,489 net new jobs in the IT/ITeS sector, the minister highlighted. The number was 3.23 lakh when Telangana came into being. On net, the state has added over three lakh new IT/ITeS jobs over the last seven years. This apart, there will be about 2.5 times more indirect jobs created. “Friends in the STPI, SEZ and industry body Nasscom tell that the eight per cent growth in IT employment in Telangana for 2020-21 is significantly higher than the national average, which is close to two per cent as per STPI numbers,” KTR said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-jobs-double-in-telangana-in-seven-years-266417
10-06-2021||New Delhi||End-term exams must for final and intermediate year law students: Bar Council of India||Ending weeks of confusion created due to the second wave of Covid-19, the Bar Council of India (BCI) on Thursday said end-term examinations are mandatory for law students enrolled with law schools, universities and centres of legal education across the country.The BCI – which regulates legal profession and legal education in India – however, said law schools, universities, and centres of legal education were free to determine the mode of examination.The decision is based on the report of a high-level committee set up by the top bar body under the chairmanship of former Allahabad High Court Chief Justice Govind Mathur to consider the issue.Several vice chancellors of national law universities and some private universities were part of the committee.Universities or centres of legal education will conduct examination for intermediate and final year students as per their own dispensation, depending upon the availability of resources and the impact of Covid-19 in that region, the BCI said, adding it has accepted the report and decided not to issue guidelines on its own on holding of examinations for intermediate semester or final semester.While recommending that end-term examinations must be mandatorily conducted for intermediate and final year students, the panel permitted online, offline, blended, online open book exams, assessment-based evaluation or research papers as modes of evaluation.The committee was set up after a large number of law students and heads of law schools wrote to the BCI for clarity and guidance and the issue of examinations.Many students wanted alternate methods of assessment in view of Covid-19 situation.Earlier, a group of students from Faculty of Law of Delhi University had moved the Delhi High Court demanding cancellation of fourth semester examinations. They had urged the committee to allow assignment-based assessment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/end-term-exams-must-for-final-and-intermediate-year-law-students-bar-council-of-india-266415
10-06-2021||New Delhi||India pushes for complete disengagement at remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh||India on Thursday once again called for completion of the disengagement process at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh to pave the way for both the Indian and Chinese troops to consider de-escalation and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity in border areas.At a media briefing, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, referring to the last rounds of military and diplomatic talks, said both sides agreed on the need to resolve the outstanding issues in an expeditious manner in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols.“We have repeatedly stressed that completion of disengagement in other areas would pave the way for the two sides to consider de-escalation of forces and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity and enable progress in bilateral relations,” he said.Bagchi was replying to a question on the status of the talks between the two sides on the border standoff.The 11th round of Corps Commander-level talks was held on April 9 while the last edition of diplomatic negotiations under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs took place on March 12.“During these meetings, both sides agreed on the need to resolve the outstanding issues in an expeditious manner in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols,” Bagchi said.India and China are locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year.However, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks. The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach towards this end at the 11th round of military talks.Last month, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane said there can be no de-escalation without complete disengagement at all friction points in eastern Ladakh and that the Indian Army is prepared for all contingencies in the region.Gen Naravane also said that India is dealing with China in a “firm” and “non-escalatory” manner to ensure the sanctity of its claims in eastern Ladakh, and that it was even open to initiating confidence-building measures.  India has been insisting on complete disengagement at the remaining friction points to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ladakh.

10-06-2021||Mumbai||Narendra Modi is top leader of country and BJP: Shiv Sena leader Raut||Days after the one-on-one meeting between Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday said Modi is the top leader of the country and the BJP.He made the statement in response to a question on whether he felt that Modi’s popularity is on a downslide as media reports suggested that RSS is contemplating to project state leaders as the face in the state elections.“I don’t want to comment on this...I don’t go by the media reports. There is no official statement about this... The BJP owes its success to Narendra Modi in the last seven years and currently he is the top leader of the country and his party,” Raut said.The Sena’s Rajya Sabha member, who is currently on a tour of north Maharashtra, was speaking to reporters in Jalgaon.The Shiv Sena’s stand has always been that a prime minister belongs to the entire country and not a particular party, he said, adding, “Hence the PM shouldn’t get involved in election campaigning as it puts pressure on the official machinery.”To a question on Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil’s remarks that his party would make friendship with tiger (Shiv Sena’s symbol) if Modi wished, Raut said, “No one can make friendship with a tiger. It is the tiger that decides whom he wants to be friends with.”When asked about his tour of north Maharashtra, he said it was part of the Shiv Sena’s efforts to strengthen the organisation. “All Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies have a right to expand their base and strengthen the parties. It is also the need of the hour. We are also holding meetings on strengthening our coordination among each other,” he said.

10-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre urges citizens to recommend names for Padma awards, last date Sept 15||The Centre Thursday said it was committed to transform the Padma awards into “People’s Padma” and urged all citizens to make nominations and recommendations, including self-nomination, for the prestigious civilian honours.The Union Home Ministry said online nominations or recommendations for the awards, to be announced on the eve of Republic Day, 2022, are open, with the last date being September 15, 2021.The ministry said in a statement that such nominations and recommendations will be received online only on https://padmaawards.gov.in.The Padma awards, namely, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, are amongst the highest civilian awards of the country.The government is committed to transform the Padma awards into “People’s Padma” and all citizens are therefore requested to make nominations, recommendations including self-nomination, the statement said.The nominations and recommendations should contain all relevant details specified in the format available on the portal, including a citation in narrative form (maximum 800 words), clearly bringing out the distinguished and exceptional achievements, and the services the person rendered in her or his respective field or discipline, it said.The Central government has already asked all states to set up a special search committee to find out prospective awardees who have so far been left out of consideration despite their exceptional services.Since 2014, the Modi government has been conferring the Padma awards on many “unsung heroes” who have contributed to the society in different ways.The home ministry has requested all central ministries, departments, states and UT governments, Bharat Ratna and Padma Vibhushan awardees and institutes of excellence that concerted efforts may be made to identify talented persons from amongst women, weaker sections of the society, SCs, STs, ‘divyang’ persons who are doing selfless service to society and whose excellence and achievements really deserve to be recognised, the statement said.Often many such people may get overlooked primarily for the reason that they may not seek publicity or attention in the public domain, the home ministry had said in a letter sent recently to states.“It is, therefore, requested to make concerted efforts in identifying such persons whose excellence and achievements deserve to be recognised and make suitable nominations in their favour. It goes without saying that recognition of such deserving persons will only add to the prestige of these awards.“In the above background, I request you to kindly send suitable nominations for the Padma awards to be announced on the occasion of Republic Day, 2022. In this regard, it is suggested that you may constitute a Special Search Committee for identifying, considering and finalising your recommendations or nominations,” the letter written by home ministry Joint Secretary R K Singh had said.The states were told that while finalising recommendations, they should keep in mind that the persons recommended are pre-eminently worthy of the awards, looking at their life-time achievements.The criteria for selection should invariably be ‘excellence plus’ and the highest standards should be applied while recommending persons for these awards. The existence of an element of public service in the achievements of the person recommended for the award would be a desirable factor, the letter said.Through the Padma awards, the government seeks to recognise ‘work of distinction’. They are given for distinguished and exceptional achievements or service in all fields or disciplines, such as, Art, Literature and Education, Sports, Medicine, Social Work, Science and Engineering, Public Affairs, Civil Service, Trade and Industry etc.All persons without distinction of race, occupation, position or sex are eligible for these awards.

We saw women workers too.“We came to know that he had launched the venture two years ago but suffered losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic and cyclone Yaas,” Brigadier Kumar, also the president of the Ramgarh Cantonment Board, told PTI.Mahto had decided to make agriculture his profession after failing to get a job.He took the 25-acre land on lease at an annual rent of Rs 5,000 per acre and undertook watermelon cultivation on six acres with an investment of Rs 15 lakh.“However, there were no buyers during the lockdown.The crop started to rot. Nobody in the village was ready to buy it even for Rs 2 per kg. We sought help from various circles but to no avail.“Finally, I decided to offer the produce to our brave soldiers for free and approached the cantonment,” he told PTI.Mahto has employed around 40 women labourers and also planted capsicum, brinjal and other vegetables.Jharkhand leads in the cultivation of watermelon, tomatoes, peas, beans, cabbage, okra and cauliflower.

The 25-metre-tall structure, being set up to improve air quality in a radius of around 1 km, was supposed to be ready by June 15.“The Covid-19 pandemic delayed the construction work of the smog tower, the first-of-its-kind in India, at Baba Kharak Singh Marg. The work is being expedited. The ambitious project will be ready by August 15,” Rai told reporters here.“China also has such smog towers, but this one works on different technology. The ones in China suck the polluted air from the bottom and release the clear air from the top, whereas this smog tower works in the opposite direction,” he said.The smog tower at Connaught Place will be able to purify 1000 cubic metres of air per second, the minister said.He also said many experts have different views about the efficacy of smog tower.“This is a pilot project. Experts will study its outcomes and thereafter, the government will take a call on building more such structures,” he said.Tata Projects Limited (TPL) is implementing the Rs 20-crore project on the ground with technical support from IIT-Bombay.The National Building Construction Corporation India Ltd. has been appointed as project management consultant.

The reason I left the Congress was because there is a rising disconnect between the party and the people. And that is the reason, its vote share is shrinking in Uttar Pradesh and there is no plan to revive the party,” Prasada told PTI Thursday.Underlining that his decision to join the BJP was taken after discussions and deliberations, he said he wants to serve his people, his state and the nation.He could not protect his people’s interests while being in the Congress, he said, asserting the BJP is the only institutionalised national party in the county.

He expressed confidence that the spirit of the Indian Military Academy will guide them in their future courses of action.Among the foreign cadets from nine countries, 43 were from Afghanistan, 18 from Bhutan and 13 from Tajikistan. Mauritius and Vietnam had sent four and two cadets, respectively, while Maldives, Kyrgyzstan, Tonga and Srilanka had sent one each.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/commandants-parade-held-at-ima-as-prelude-to-final-passing-out-event-266378

The question is will he get ‘prasada’ from BJP or is he just a ‘catch’ for UP elections,” Sibal asked on Twitter.“In such deals if ‘ideology’ doesn’t matter changeover is easy,” the former union minister also said.Read also: Left Cong not due to any individual or for any post: Jitin PrasadaIn a tweet, Tharoor asked, “Can politics be a career devoid of principle? Politics has to be about ideas, or it’s nothing. Can a person of conviction change political parties the way a cricketer changes IPL teams.”In an article on the larger issues in Prasada’s defection to the BJP, Tharoor said his decision a year after his “older brother” Jyotiraditya Scindia did the same thing, is “deeply dismaying”.“I say this without any personal bitterness,” he said.“Both Scindia and Prasada were amongst the most eloquent voices against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the dangers its communal bigotry posed to the India they cherished. Today, they are both happily sporting the colours of the party they once reviled more than any other.“The obvious question this provokes is: what do they really stand for? What beliefs and values animate their politics? Or are they in politics only for self-advancement and power? Can politics be a career devoid of principle,” Tharoor asked in the article.“When you enter politics, then, you don’t choose a party the way a graduate chooses the company that makes him the best placement offer. You choose a vehicle for your convictions.“Your party reflects not merely the institutional framework for your personal ambitions, but the set of principles, beliefs and ideas that you are pledged to promote and defend in the course of your political career,” he wrote.Prasada, a member of the group of 23 Congress leaders who wrote to Sonia Gandhi seeking an organisational overhaul and elections at all levels last year, quit the Congress Wednesday to join the BJP ahead of next year’s assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Both Sibal and Tharoor are also a part of the group of 23 who wrote to the Congress chief.

On the same day, we started from Antigua and cleared the customs the next day on May 24," he told the website.Choksi, in his complaint, has alleged that he was picked up from Antigua on May 23 evening and taken on a yacht, which took him to the waters of Dominica the next day around 10 am, where he was handed over to the Coast Guard of Dominica on boat.Their plan was to go to St Lucia from Dominica but Bhandal, who claimed to be a regular sailing aficionado, said he got "sea sick" en route and dropped any further sailing plan after reaching Dominica.Bhandal said he and Singh "often go sailing together" in the Mediterranean Sea, but this time, they decided to do it in the Caribbeans."We took a charter from there (Dominica) to Barbados," the website quoted him as saying.Asked about Jabarica, Choksi's friend who is allegedly involved in the abduction plot, Bhandal said he does not know her but keeps meeting hundreds of people while taking flights in the Caribbeans."There were 21 flights to the Caribbeans, but during Covid, there are only two flights in a week now, so this increases the possibility that we bump into the same people again and again," he said.In the telephonic interview to the website, Bhandal claimed that he has been sailing with Singh in the region since April, when he had stayed for four days in Antigua, a day in Dominica and four days in St Lucia.In May, they were on a second yachting trip in the region, but could not book the boat that they used on their first trip, so they booked the Calliope of Arne yacht online.Choksi, wanted in a Rs 13,500-crore bank fraud case in India, had mysteriously gone missing on May 23 from Antigua and Barbuda, where he has been staying as a citizen since 2018.He was detained in the neighbouring island country of Dominica for illegal entry, after a possible romantic escapade with his rumoured girlfriend.Choksi's lawyers alleged that he was abducted from Jolly Harbour in Antigua by policemen looking like Antiguan and Indian, and brought to Dominica on a boat.

10-06-2021||New Delhi||Cong's top leadership must see ideological commitment while promoting leaders: Moily on Jitin's exit||A day after Jitin Prasada switched to the BJP, senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily on Thursday said the Congress needs to undergo a "major surgery" and not depend just on legacy, asserting that the top leadership must give primacy to ideological commitment while giving responsibility to leaders.Alleging that Prasada had placed "personal ambition" over everything else, Moily said the Uttar Pradesh leader's ideological commitment was suspect from the beginning and the party winning zero seats in West Bengal under his charge showed that he was incompetent.In an interview with PTI, Moily also said the top leadership should make a proper assessment of leaders in the party, asserting that "one cannot make people leaders when they do not deserve it". The Congress has to rethink and re-strategise some of these things and then only the party can come up, the former Union minister said."Properly reorganise the party with proper people in positions and not put incompetent people (in positions of responsibility) who cannot deliver. This is a lesson, the Congress needs to make an introspection in the face of the developments," Moily said, making suggestions for the party's high command.Asked if Prasada's exit from the Congress has a message for the party top brass, he said they must give importance to leaders' antecedents, ideology and their approach to the common people while appointing them to positions of importance.Moily, who had suggested after the 2019 polls debacle that the Congress has to undergo major surgery to be competitive, said the party had long delayed that major surgery and it was "needed right now, there is no tomorrow"."Next year we are facing assembly elections in seven states and then immediately parliamentary polls will be there after that (in 2024). If we don't perform well in the seven elections we will have more difficulty in the general elections," Moily told PTI."The Congress should not just hinge upon legacy, but we need to readjust ourselves and prepare ourselves for competitive politics played by (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi. It is not that Modi is undefeatable, he can be defeated by putting our party back on track. Major surgery is needed right now, there is no tomorrow," he asserted.Moily was among the group of 23 leaders along with Prasada who had written to interim President Sonia Gandhi in August last year urging an organisational overhaul of the party. However, he had distanced himself from the Jammu meet of the G-23 and has backed the leadership of the Gandhi family.Asked if the question mark over the leadership issue in the party with Sonia Gandhi being the interim chief since August 2019 was posing problems for the party, Moily said that with Sonia Gandhi at the helm, she can inspire and take decisions. "We have a leader, so that is not an issue. With Sonia ji at the helm, there is no vacancy. She has to step up and perform the major surgery on the party. She has the determination, capacity and she can inspire the cadres," Moily said.He asserted that while youngsters need to be promoted in the party, ideological orientation should be looked at in giving responsibilities. "Their (the leaders') history will have to be seen, their commitment will have to be seen, their dynamism, approach and experience needs to be given weightage," Moily asserted.Youngsters need to be encouraged but their ambition should be within the confines of the ideology of the party, he added. Moily stressed that leadership should not be given to opportunists who can betray the party and are not capable of delivering.Talking specifically about Prasada's switch to the BJP, he said it was only a question of personal ambition in Prasada's case."He (Prasada) could not make a mark in UP even though the Congress had picked him up as a young leader. He did not come up to the expectations," Moily said.On Prasada being made the AICC in-charge of West Bengal last year, Moily said if a person with no ability is selected, "ultimately the result will be zero". "Sometimes we also make a mistake and select wrong leaders who are not capable of delivering. Just because they speak in good English we think they are good leaders. We want mass leaders who can speak the language of the masses, which some of the leaders like  Jitin Prasada were not speaking," he said."By choosing such people as state in-charges, that is how the party suffers. It was a totally wrong choice (to name Prasada as West Bengal in-charge). I knew that in such a big state like West Bengal with the Congress in a bad shape, a man without any experience and mass base, without a proper approach, who cannot articulate the Congress ideology, if given the charge, there would be failure," Moily said.The saga of defections in the Congress, which began ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, continues unabated with Prasada jumping ship on Wednesday, triggering speculation of further exits. Prasada followed in the footsteps of his former Congress colleague Jyotiraditya Scindia who quit the party to join the BJP in March last year.

These bogus claims are only an attempt to present a wrong picture of my husband,” added Priti.Moreover, as per my information, her last name is Jabarica and I guess she is not telling her location to anyone, so how can her version be credible at all? asked Priti.Mehul Choksi earlier had also alleged that Jabarica did not attempt to help her while he was being beaten up and placed on a small watercraft. He stated that the manner in which Barbara Jabarica conducted herself clearly indicated that “she was an integral part of this whole plan to abduct him”.Jabarica in interviews to Indian media confirmed that she had met Mehul Choksi over breakfast on the day he was allegedly abducted, but left for the airport and was on the other side of the island that day.Mehul Choksi went missing from Antigua on 23 May and was caught in Dominica. He was charged with illegal entry by police into Dominica after he allegedly fled Antigua and Barbuda in a possible attempt to avoid extradition to India.Meanwhile, the Dominica Ministry of National Security and Home Affairs had declared Mehul Choksi a “prohibited immigrant” on May 25th.It directed necessary actions to be taken under prohibited immigration as well as not permitted to enter the Commonwealth of Dominica and the Chief of Police was instructed to take all the necessary actions to have him repatriated, said an official order of Rayburn Blackmoore, Minister for National Security and Home Affairs.The 62-year-old fugitive is wanted in India in connection with the Rs 13,500 crore fraud in Punjab National Bank. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/barbara-jabaricas-claims-are-bogus-says-mehul-choksis-wife-priti-266340

10-06-2021||Washington||India will receive a share of 80 million US vaccines through COVAX: State Dept official||India will be receiving a share of the 80 million (8 crores) unused COVID-19 vaccines through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme that President Joe Biden has announced, according to a senior State Department official.On June 2, President Biden announced that the US will allocate 75 per cent - nearly 1.9 crores of the first tranche of 2.5 crore doses - of unused COVID-19 vaccines from its stockpile through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme to countries in South and Southeast Asia as well as Africa.The move is part of his administration's framework for sharing 80 million (8 crores) vaccines globally by the end of June.According to a White House fact sheet, nearly 19 million vaccines will be shared through COVAX.“I don't have the specific details on when the shipment of vaccines will be arriving in India. Of course, India will be in receipt of a share of those 80 million vaccines and through COVAX, I believe there were some six million vaccines destined for the region,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday.COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access, abbreviated as COVAX, is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the World Health Organisation.“We know that India has suffered tremendously with this pandemic and as we have done in the case of these vaccines, but also as we did even prior to this vaccine sharing announcement. We have demonstrated our commitment to work closely with our partners in India to help see the way out of this epidemic,” he said.In recent weeks, the US has so far supplied seven planeloads of life-saving supplies worth approximately USD 100 million.“This is also in addition to the tremendous generosity that we have seen from the private sector and the diaspora here in this country that has donated some 400 million additional dollars. So, that's half a billion dollars that the United States government and the people here in the United States have committed to help our friends and to help our partners in India recover from this pandemic,” Price said.Responding to a question, he said the Biden administration is absolutely continuing with its commitment to help the government and the people of India emerge from this pandemic.“We remain engaged with the private sector as we have spoken of our commitment of vaccines to India, of our commitment of planeloads of life-saving supplies, doing all we can not only on our part but also to galvanize action on the part of other non-governmental actors here in the United States to help our friends in India,” Price said.India is currently witnessing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

They will be instrumental in delivering my vision for the #PresidencyOfHope," Shahid tweeted.Hussain is the Permanent Representative of the Maldives to the United Nations and Ambassador to the United States. Naidu described his appointment as the PGA-elect's Chef de Cabinet as a “privilege” and said he looks forward to a “presidency of hope”, which Shahid has set as a cornerstone of his upcoming year-long tenure at the world organisation.“The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. Comprising all 193 Member States of the UN, it provides a unique forum for multilateral discussion of international issues including peace and security," Naidu said."It is indeed a privilege and an opportunity to serve under the leadership of President-elect Abdulla Shahid. We are looking forward to a Presidency of hope,” Naidu told PTI.Shahid, accompanied by Naidu, met current General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir on Wednesday to thank him for his support during the election and discuss the next steps. “Thank you Mr President, for sharing your insights and your experiences with me. We are both committed to a smooth and seamless transition to #UNGA76," he tweeted.Bozkir tweeted that he was “very pleased" to meet Shahid. “We spoke about the importance of strengthening the Office of the President of the General Assembly and I reassured him of my full support to ensure a successful transition.” Shahid has said his “immediate priority” will be recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and working to ensure “vaccine equity” to restore hope from a year characterised by “disease, despair and devastation.”  The President of the General Assembly is elected every year by a secret ballot and requires a simple majority vote of the General Assembly. India had already voiced its strong support for Shahid's candidacy, saying he was best equipped to preside over the General Assembly of 193 nations of the world.Congratulating Shahid after his election victory, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had tweeted that “this is a testimony as much to his own stature as to the standing of the Maldives. We look forward to working with him to strengthen multilateralism and its much-needed reforms.” India, currently serving the 2021-22 term as a non-permanent member of the powerful UN Security Council, will assume the Presidency of the 15-nation UN organ in August. According to the established rules of regional rotation, the President of the 76th session of the General Assembly was to be elected from the Group of Asia-Pacific States.  The Presidency of the General Assembly rotates among the five regional groups - the Group of Asian States, the Group of Eastern European States, the Group of Latin American and the Caribbean States, the Group of African States, the Western European and Other States Group. Turkish diplomat Bozkir is UNGA President for the 75th session that came amid the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.

In fact, the robot does not need human intervention,” he said.Regarding the SHR, he said, “Basically, it is a humanoid robot, which can be used to give a more human-like experience to the patients. Apart from delivering food, water and medicines it can interact with patients not only vocally but also physically. The robot can dance, shake hands, give a high-five, wave goodbye and can help in entertaining the people in quarantine.”The DMR can carry a weight of up to 200 kgs.“It can also carry patients from ambulances to the hospitals or quarantine centres and back, and those with physical disabilities to the restroom and back,” Santosh said.Santosh has been working in the field of robotics for the last 20 years. “I have designed 48 robots and have developed 18 such robots,” he said.

10-06-2021||Johannesburg||Extradition treaty between South Africa, UAE ratified paving way for trial of Gupta brothers||An extradition treaty between South Africa and the UAE have been ratified paving the way for Indian-origin businessmen Gupta brothers to be returned to the African nation from Dubai to stand trial for allegedly looting billions of Rands from state-owned institutions.Former South African Justice Minister Michael Masutha had signed the treaty in 2018.The UAE, however, signed the treaty on Tuesday, its embassy in Pretoria said in a statement.“The treaties will enable the two countries to assist each other in the investigation and prosecution of crimes through mutual legal assistance and the extradition of fugitives,” the statement said without referring to the Gupta brothers.Negotiations on the treaty started in 2010 but were reportedly hampered by issues raised by the UAE in the past three years that forced South Africa to turn to the UN and Interpol for assistance in bringing the Gupta brothers to book.Atul, Rajesh and their elder brother Ajay Gupta are accused of siphoning billions of rands from state and parastatal agencies through their close association with former president Jacob Zuma, who is himself facing criminal charges.The ratification of the treaty came ahead of a protest planned by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation outside the UAE Embassy in Pretoria on Friday.Nishan Balton, the executive director of the foundation, said, “We welcome the ratification of the extradition treaty and now call on the UAE authorities to act swiftly in sending these criminals back to South Africa so that all citizens here can see them get their just desserts for the hard-earned taxpayers’ money that they looted.”  Last week, the National Prosecuting Authority here had asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice against Atul and Rajesh Gupta, their wives and business associates to bring them to South Africa so that they stand trial for their alleged role in an R25 million fraud and money laundering case linked to the failed Estina Dairy Farm project in Free State province.The US and the UK have already imposed sanctions and seized assets of the Gupta brothers and a close associate, Salim Essa, who is also believed to have fled to Dubai.Another associate, Iqbal Meer Sharma, once a top government official and later a businessman, was arrested last week and has been refused bail until his trial for fraud and corruption resumes on July 5. His assets have also been seized by the NPA.“The writing is on the wall for the Guptas and their cronies. All these legal steps have brought a palpable sense of relief to South Africans just as they were getting a sense of despair about whether the criminals would ever be brought to book,” Balton said.

10-06-2021||Washington||Indian-Americans face discrimination regularly: Survey||Indian-Americans, who constitute the second largest immigrant group in the US, regularly encounter discrimination and polarisation, according to a survey released on Wednesday.The report, ‘Social Realities of Indian Americans: Results from the 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey', draws on the Indian-American Attitudes Survey (IAAS), a collaboration between the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins-SAIS and the University of Pennsylvania.The findings of the report are based on a nationally representative online survey of 1,200 Indian-American residents in the US conducted between September 1 and 20, 2020, in partnership with the research and analytics firm YouGov, it said in a statement.“Indian-Americans regularly encounter discrimination. One in two Indian Americans has reported being discriminated against in the past one year, with the discrimination based on skin colour identified as the most common form of bias.“Somewhat surprisingly, Indian-Americans born in the United States are much more likely to report being victims of discrimination than their foreign-born counterparts,” said the report.According to the report, Indian-Americans exhibit very high rates of marriage within their community.While eight out of 10 respondents have a spouse or partner of Indian-origin, US-born Indian-Americans are four times more likely to have a spouse or partner who is of Indian-origin but was born in the United States.The survey found that religion plays a central role in the lives of Indian-Americans but religious practice varies. While nearly three-quarters of Indian-Americans state that religion plays an important role in their lives, religious practice is less pronounced.Forty per cent of respondents pray at least once a day and 27 per cent attend religious services at least once a week. The report notes that roughly half of all Hindu Indian-Americans identify with a caste group. Foreign-born respondents are significantly more likely than US-born respondents to espouse a caste identity. — PTI2 charged for racist video targeting PatelLondon: Two men were charged on Wednesday with sending a grossly offensive message related to a racist social media video targeting UK Home Secretary Priti Patel.

All Chief Ministers should be together. If an individual state is harassed by them (Central government) then all other states will fight against the step,” Banerjee said.Banerjee, who has been having a running feud with the Narendra Modi-led government on a series of issues, was talking to mediapersons after a meeting with Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders Rakesh Tikait and Yudhvir Singh at the state secretariat “Nabanna” here.The farmer leaders, who were present at the press conference, wanted the West Bengal CM to talk to other non-BJP chief ministers for supporting their agitation against the three controversial farm Bills.Banerjee said she would get in touch with those chief ministers who were friend with her and try to organise a virtual conference to extend support to the agitating farmers. She would also try to persuade likeminded CMs to draw up a letter before the Lok Sabha elections extending support to the agitators, she added.“I am ready to support the agitating farmers till their demands were wholly met,” Banerjee added. Criticising the Centre for not trying to talk to the protesters, she said the farmers were also countrymen and the Central government should not keep ignoring them.“If farmers are not interested, then why impose the new farm laws on them. I shall like to urge the Central government to withdraw the farm laws,” Banerjee said.She also took on the Centre on GST on Covid-19 vaccines. “Imposing GST on vaccines is like playing with the life and death of people,” she said. She demanded that 25 per cent of the supply meant for private hospitals should also be routed through the respective state governments.On the restrictions imposed on retired security and intelligence officials prohibiting them from publishing books without prior clearance, Banerjee said such a gag order was not in keeping with the spirit of democracy.Banerjee said to save democracy she would like to appeal to all anti-BJP forces as well as BJP old-timers and even the new entrants in the BJP who are disillusioned with Modi to join hands and fight to save the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didi-vows-to-rally-opposition-ruled-states-behind-farmers-266205

We demand repeal of the 3 laws and a legislation to guarantee MSP.At the Cabinet briefing today, Tomar said the government respected the agitating farmers which was why it organised 11 rounds of talks with them.“The Government of India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a lot of respect for farmers and that is why the government will be ready for talks with the farmers whenever they want to talk. But, we have repeatedly urged farm unions to logically point out objections to relevant provisions of the law and we will listen to them and also attempt a resolution to their concerns,” the minister said.Narendra Singh Tomar, Agriculture MinisterGovt for farmersThe decisions taken in the last seven years to raise the income of farmers are unprecedented.He said the government had held talks with farmers 11 times and asked them what their objection to the laws was and which provision of the laws they deemed unjust.“But, neither any political party responded to the matter in the House, nor any farm union leader stated what the objection was. This is why the talks did not move forward,” Tomar said.Earlier today, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hailed the farmers’ fearless agitation and said 500 farmers had died for the cause of justice.Gandhi sought the repeal of farm laws, saying that was the only way out.Later, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate mentioned Tomar’s previous remarks that the government was willing to talk to the farmers about anything except the repeal of laws and said, “What else will the farmers discuss with the government if not the laws? Will they discuss the weather? The Agriculture Minister must be removed for his insensitive remarks.”Tomar defended the government record on farmers, saying the country had witnessed the commitment of the PM towards farmers.“The decisions taken by the Modi government in the last seven years to raise the income of farmers and increase agriculture profitability are historic and unprecedented. No one is in a position to dismiss them. As far as Rahul Gandhi’s tweets go, even the Congress does not take them seriously. I need not comment,” Tomar said.He said all political parties wanted to enact agriculture reform laws but did not have the courage to do so.“The Modi government took this huge step to benefit the farmers and bring reforms in the farm sector, the benefits of which have gone to the farmers at many places. In between, the farmers’ agitation started. The government respects the farmers and that is why it spoke to them 11 times,” the minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ready-for-talks-if-farmers-raise-logical-objections-to-laws-narendra-tomar-265963

The MSP for grade A paddy too has been hiked by Rs 72 to take it to Rs 1,960 a quintal.The per quintal MSP for tur and urad has been increased by Rs 300, taking it to Rs 6,300, while that of groundnut by Rs 275 to take it to Rs 5,550.Elaborating on the decisions by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated the Central Government’s commitment towards farmers. “We always said the MSP will remain and the increase in support prices of kharif crops is a proof of our commitment,” he said.The Centre said over the past few years, concerted efforts had been made to realign the MSPs in favour of oilseeds, pulses and coarse cereals to encourage farmers to shift to larger area under these crops. The added focus on nutri-cereals is to incentivise its production in areas where rice-wheat cannot be grown without long-term adverse implications on groundwater table.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/paddy-msp-up-rs-72-meagre-say-farmers-266012

Welcoming him into the party fold in the presence of Union Minister Piyush Goyal, BJP’s chief spokesperson Anil Baluni said Prasada was “impressed” with the working style of PM Narendra Modi.Goyal too heaped praises on Prasada who applauded the PM and ‘karamyogi’ Union Home Minister Amit Shah, claiming the BJP was the only party that was truly national, the other parties being mostly “regional or individual-centric.” The 47-year-old former Union Minister comes from an influential Brahmin family. His father Jitendra Prasada was a well-known Congress leader.His joining the saffron party comes at a time when the latter is struggling to retain the support of various sections of society. Besides ‘mismanagement’ during the second Covid wave, CM Yogi Adityanath faces allegations of “favouring” the Thakur community. Prasada had launched the ‘Brahmin Chetna Parishad’ to give voice to the community. Ever since Prasada chose to align with the Congress’ G-23, he had been trying to resurrect his career. Already there is speculation of his getting a place in the Yogi ministry.Prasada’s exit may signal the start of a season of defections in the Congress reeling under electoral setbacks and mounting internal problems. Like Prasada, who said he was finding it difficult to serve the people in the Congress, several other party leaders are at the exit door.Those who could switch sides are Rajasthan Deputy CM Sachin Pilot, ex-MP Milind Deora and some from the G-23 group which in October last had urged Congress president Sonia Gandhi to set the house in order by holding organisational elections.

These are the main issues, and this why we are protesting, and we will keep protesting. We are prepared to continue till 2024.Read also: Centre increases MSP for Kharif crops, paddy support price hiked by Rs 72 per quintalDifferences between farmers and govt over farm laws can be resolved by talks: SS Johl“Our stand remains the same. Repeal the three laws, give us a written guarantee on MSP, if the government is ready to talk on this, then we are ready. Now, it is up to the government to decide about the meeting,” said farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday said the government is ready to resume talks with protesting farmers but asked the unions to point out their objections to the provisions of the three farm laws with sound logic.Kakka, however, pointed out that the problems with laws had already been pointed out in the 11 rounds of talks that had happened between the government and the farmers.“The government does not want us to tell the problems with the laws. That we have already done. It essentially wants to talk to us only if it is about anything besides the black laws. We have sacrificed more than 555 farmers, and have sat in protest for over six months, so the agriculture minister’s statement today is strange and irresponsible,” the farmer leader said.The last round of talks was held on January 22 to break the deadlock and end the farmers’ protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.Talking about the government’s approach towards resolving the deadlock on the farmers’ issue, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) in a statement on Wednesday said that the government’s attitude towards resolving the issue was “anti-farmer”.“While the prime minister superciliously says that the government is just one call away, the real anti-farmer attitude of the government is very apparent. Protesting farmers repeat and reiterate that the government’s attitude is unjustifiable and unreasonable, and is resting on ego and optics’ games. Farmers demand a full repeal of the three central laws and a new legislation to guarantee MSP for all farmers,” the SKM said in a statement.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for more than six months in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP. The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions.

10-06-2021||Vibha Sharma||Centre increases MSP for Kharif crops, paddy support price hiked by Rs 72 per quintal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 9The Centre on Wednesday increased the Minimum Support Price of all mandated Kharif crops for marketing season 2021-22.The price of common grade paddy has been increased from Rs 1,868 a quintal to Rs 1,940 a quintal, a rise of Rs 72 a quintal. For grade A the support price has been increased from Rs 1,888 a quintal to Rs 1,960 a quintal, again an increase of Rs 72 per quintal.Elaborating the decisions by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Centre always said that the MSP will remain and the increase in support prices for Kharif crops is proof of that commitment.Read also: Differences between farmers and govt over farm laws can be resolved by talks: SS JohlThe expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in the case of Bajra (85%) followed by urad (65%) and tur (62%). For the rest of the crops, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be at least 50%, he said. The cost of production for common grade paddy is Rs 1,293 a quintal, Tomar said, adding that the farmers will be getting a return of over 50% over the cost of production for 2021-22, which is Rs 1,293 a quintal.“The government has increased the MSP of Kharif crops to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce. The increase in MSP for Kharif Crops for marketing season, 2021-22 is in line with the Union Budget 2018-19 announcement of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the All-India weighted average Cost of Production (CoP), aiming at reasonably fair remuneration for the farmers,” he said. The highest absolute increase in MSP over the previous year has been recommended for sesamum (Rs 452 per quintal) followed by tur and urad (Rs 300 per quintal each). In the case of groundnut and nigerseed, there has been an increase of Rs 275 per quintal and Rs 235 per quintal respectively in comparison to last year. The differential remuneration is aimed at encouraging crop diversification, he said.Regarding the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three central farm laws, Tomar said the Modi government will remain committed to the betterment of farmers.“We always said the MSP was there and will remain,” he said.“All political parties wanted to bring the farm laws but could not,” he added.“The Narendra Modi government is committed to farmers. It is because of our commitment and respect for farmers that we held 11 rounds of talks with union leaders and offered them several alternatives, including putting on hold the laws for one-and-a-half years.“The government is always ready for talks with the unions. We have always said if there are issues with some provisions, unions should explain with reasons and suggest alternatives, which they could not. There are no shortcomings in the laws still we gave them alternatives but they did not agree,” the Agriculture Minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-increases-msp-for-kharif-crops-paddy-support-price-hiked-by-rs-72-per-quintal-265904
