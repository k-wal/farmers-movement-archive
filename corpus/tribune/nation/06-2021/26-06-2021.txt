I will hand over all these documents as proof of the scam related to land and corruption by the BJP and the members of the trust to him,” Singh said.He further said that even though the alleged corruption in the land deal is in the public eye, “where are all the investigation agencies and why are they not acting”.“The prime minister (Narendra Modi) convened a meeting with the members of the trust today. Did he ask why the scam happened and why is the construction of the temple halted?” the Rajya Sabha MP posed.Singh and Pandey had alleged money laundering in the deal and demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust’s general secretary Champat Rai strongly dismissed the allegations, claiming the land was purchased at a price much lower than the prevailing market rate. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sought-time-from-rss-chief-to-hand-over-proof-of-scam-in-ram-temple-trusts-land-deal-sanjay-singh-274446

Holding that Covid-19 Vaccination policy was “prima facie arbitrary and irrational”, a three-judge Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud had on June 2 asked the Centre to place on record all relevant documents and file notings along with purchase history till date of all jabs, including Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik V.Asserting that the Government has made every effort possible to ensure that the people of India have access to safe and  effective vaccines at the earliest, it said, “Two vaccines (Covishield & Covaxin)  have been a part of the vaccination program since January 2021. Another Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V developed by M/s Gamaleya Institute,  Russia, has received Emergency Use Authorization by the DCGI, India in  April 2021 and is now being administered in India.“In addition, some other domestic vaccines such as those from  Biological E and Zydus Cadila are in the late stages of clinical trials and  subject to the regulatory approvals, will further increase the availability of  vaccines. The production capacity of the vaccines under the vaccination  drive is being ramped-up as much as possible and as fast as possible and expected to further increase in the next few months,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/digital-divide-not-a-problem-in-covid-19-vaccination-drive-centre-tells-sc-274443
26-06-2021||New Delhi||Congress demands immediate restoration of dearness allowance||The Congress on Saturday demanded immediate release of dearness allowance (DA) to 115 lakh government employees, including armed forces personnel, that was suspended last year in view of the Covid pandemic.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the government should not be insensitive towards its employees and armed forces, and not play jokes with them at a time when salaries are decreasing and inflation is rising.Hitting out at the government, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said it is a crime to “loot” Rs 37,500 crore from soldiers, government employees and pensioners.“Even in the Covid epidemic, instead of increasing the morale of 113 lakh employees engaged in the service of the country, the central government is trying to snatch their hard-earned money,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.“It is a crime to loot Rs 37,500 crore from soldiers, government employees and pensioners,” Gandhi added.Singhvi said the government should pay the actual arrears of DA to employees as per 7th Pay Commission and not play jugglery or pull wool into the eyes of the common man.“This frequent shadow boxing by the central government, in respect of dearness allowance can only highlight and underline the mischievous, the malevolent and the Machiavellian approach of the government towards lakhs and crores of central government employees and lakhs of Army-related employees and pensioners within that category,” he said at an online press conference.“This non-payment highlights and underlines the clear hypocrisy, the clear double standard of the government, which speaks in two voices, forked tongues about nationalism. We demand an immediate restoration of the DA that was suspended last year,” he added.Singhvi said on April 23, 2020, the “government hit people’s stomach with a kick by cutting Rs 37,500 crore”, which was payable as dearness allowance by the 7th Pay commission to 115 lakh government employees.He said these include 41 lakh persons either serving or retired pensioners within the armed forces, the balance 65-70 lakh are central government employees.The Congress leader demanded that the government pay them three instalments of DA due on January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021.“Please, don’t do your usual jugglery and pull in the wool over the Aam Aadmi’s eyes. Make sure that what you give back by way of arrears is actual real arrears,” he said, adding that the government makes sure the rate increase fully covers and compensates them.He said from July 1 this year everything should be restored on parity as intended and envisaged by the 7th pay commission.“These are cruel jokes, insensitive government, as I said a mischievous, malevolent and Machiavellian approach, which needs to be immediately rectified, at least from July 1 forthwith,” Singhvi said.The Congress leader said the cut made retrospectively in April last year citing Covid was “a very weird irony and paradox”, as one cannot think of a more “absurd reason” that the government slapped its employees with a cut of Rs 37,500 crore instead of helping them.He alleged that the government did not stop the Central Vista project which is over half this money.“Not a penny was cut there because somebody’s ego is paramount,” Singhvi said.“This is a strangest, weirdest approach and definition, where you are attacking your own armed forces. You are doing a surgical strike on your own armed forces. You are speaking on a forked tongue of nationalism, in the same breath,” Singhvi claimed.The Congress spokesperson said while the inflation is touching new highs, the government has not even given a direct fiscal incentive to boost the economy in Covid times, whereas some countries have given a direct boost to their economy.

26-06-2021||Mumbai||Vaze collected Rs 4.7-cr cash from bar owners for ‘No.1’: ED||Suspended police officer Sachin Vaze has told the ED that he “collected” Rs 4.70 crore cash from Mumbai bar owners and “handed it over” to the personal assistant of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, the central probe agency claimed on Saturday.It also claimed that Vaze, the former head of crime intelligence unit (CIU) of Mumbai police, informed the bar owners and managers that this money “will go to No.1 and crime branch and social service branch of Mumbai Police”.He further told the agency that “he was getting direct instructions from Anil Deshmukh, the then home minister in a number of police investigations”.The ED made these allegations in its remand application field before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Mumbai seeking custody of Deshmukh’s aides, personal secretary Sanjeev Palande (51) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde (45) whom it had arrested early on Saturday.The court sent them to ED custody till July 1.The ED had arrested them after it raided multiple locations in Nagpur, Mumbai and Ahmedabad including the residences of Deshmukh in a money laundering case related to an alleged multi-crore bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to his resignation in April.The former cop recorded his statement with the ED saying he was “called for a meeting at the official residence of Maharashtra home minister wherein he was given a list of bar and restaurant owners”.In the meeting, Vaze said, he was asked “to collect Rs 3 lakh per month from each bar and restaurant”.“Vaze has also stated that he had collected approx. Rs 4.70 crore from various bar owners between the months of December, 2020 to February, 2021 and handed over the same to Kundan Sambhaji Shinde, the PA of Anil Deshmukh, the home minister on the instruction of Anil Deshmukh in two installments in the month of January and February 2021,” the ED alleged.The agency said it questioned and recorded the statement of Vaze twice at the Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai where he is in custody in connection with a case of alleged parking of an explosives-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai.This Rs 4.70 crore was collected from various orchestra bar owners and managers for “smooth functioning of their bars after restricted hours without the restrictions of performance artist” and interference by the police, the ED said.The ED said Vaze’s statement was “further confirmed” by two police officers who were also questioned by it.“They categorically mentioned that they were told by Vaze about collection of money from various bar owners and both were called by Palande, the PS of Anil Deshmukh who inquired about the number of bars and collections from the various bars,” the ED claimed.The agency claimed that a part of this alleged cash bribe money was sent through hawala to four “paper” or shell companies located in Delhi that later “diverted” about Rs 4.18 crore funds “in the garb of donations” to a Nagpur based charitable trust whose chairman is Deshmukh.The ED said during the scrutiny of bank statements of the charitable trust identified as Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha “a number of cheque entries in the recent past amounting to Rs 4.18 crore” were received by it from four Delhi-based shell companies.The owners of these alleged fake companies told ED that they were contacted by a Nagpur-based person seeking transfer/adjustment of funds in the garb of donation to the said charitable trust.“Money was received in form of cash from said (Nagpur based) person on the instruction of Deshmukh family and same was channelised through web of various companies to the said trust in the garb of loans/donations”     “A total of about Rs 4.18 cr,ore were thus diverted to the said trust in the garb of loans or donations,” the ED said quoting the statements of the promoters Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Jain.It is apparent, the ED said, that Deshmukh “by virtue of his earlier position as home minister of Maharashtra government has received amounts to the tune of Rs 4.70 crore from the orchestra bars owners and managers for smooth functioning of bars and the said bribe money was apparently used by him through his son Hrishikesh Deshmukh for providing cash to Delhi based paper companies and after layering the same routed to the charitable trust in the form of donation,” the agency alleged.It said Shinde was “instrumental in collecting cash from Vaze on behalf of Deshmukh”.Describing the role of Palande, the ED alleged, he was “instrumental in passing instructions of Deshmukh with regard to transfer, postings and collection of monies from orchestra bar owners and further analysing and assessing the work of collection of tainted monies through police officials and assisted Deshmukh in money laundering”.It said both the aides of Deshmukh have emerged as “important cogs in the wheels” of this case and they have also “received the money in cash”.The ED told the court that as an allegation of collection of about Rs 100 crore have been made in this case the entire money trail requires to be established in order to bring the guilty to the book. “The involvement of foreign angle many not be ruled out at this stage,” it said.The ED case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI first carried out a preliminary inquiry followed by a regular case being filed on the orders of the Bombay High Court.The court had asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to look into the allegations of bribery of Rs 100 made against Deshmukh by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaze-collected-rs-4-7-cr-cash-from-bar-owners-for-no-1-ed-274436

26-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre opposes in SC pleas for ex-gratia compensation to families of Covid victims, says using resources rationally||The Centre has told the Supreme Court that though there was no issue of "fiscal affordability" with it, but ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the families of those who have died of Covid cannot be paid keeping in mind the "rational, judicious and optimum usage of resources of the nation".The Centre's additional affidavit has been filed in pursuance of the direction of the apex court which, on June 21, had reserved its verdict on two PILs seeking ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the dependents of those who died of Covid and easing the procedures for issuance of death certificates to these victims specifying the pandemic as the reason of demise.Terming Covid as "once in a lifetime pandemic inflicted on the entire world", the Centre, in the 39-page written submission, said various steps to strategise the nation's response to the pandemic have been taken and not just the funds of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), but even the funds of Consolidated Fund of India are being utilised according to advice of experts."It is submitted that, as specifically pleaded before this Hon'ble Court, the issue is not of fiscal affordability, but rather of the most rational, judicious and optimum usage of fiscal and all other resources of the nation," the Centre said.It said the guidelines, meant for 2015 to 2020, recommended expenditure for providing financial relief against 12 specific identified disasters on the national level that is "cyclone, drought, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloudburst, pest-attack, frost and cold wave" and the Covid-19 is not included."Additionally, the respective state government had been given the flexibility to use up to 10 percent of annual allocation under SDRF, for providing relief to the victims of natural disasters, so notified in the local context," the affidavit stated."It is submitted that information has been received from all the States and UTs in this respect. However, as per information received, it is clarified that no State/UT has provided any ex-gratia to Covid-19 victims from SDRF," the Centre said.It further said that in accordance with the recommendations of 15th Finance Commission and the experts, the Union of India devised the strategy to deal with, the extremely contagious, volatile and ever changing impact of the mutations of the virus Covid-19, in the best possible manner utilising all the financial, human and infrastructural resources of the nation, rationally and judiciously.The affidavit states that the central government has already declared Covid as a "disaster" under the Disaster Management Act."However, on the issue of 'ex-gratia' assistance on account of loss of life, the guidelines provide that the norms provided by government of India (Ministry of Home Affairs) for assistance from SDRF should be the Minimum Standards of Relief," it said.Referring to the recommendations of 15th Finance Commission, it said that while considering the disasters of public health such as pandemics, the commission had observed that it feels that financing of preventive and relief measures for such disasters should be left out of the SDRF and NDRF.The central government said that currently there is no guideline/policy/ scheme in NDMA which relates to National Insurance mechanism that may be used to pay for disaster-related deaths due to COVID-19."In this regard it is submitted that the 15th Finance Committee has proposed four Insurance interventions which need to be studied further by the NDMA and relevant ministries for their feasibility," it said.With regard to simplification of process and redressal mechanism for recording reason of death, the affidavit said that the Registrar General of India will be asked to examine the matter in consultation with all the stakeholders for taking appropriate action in the matter.While reserving the verdict, it had asked the parties to file written submissions in three days and specifically directed the Centre to simplify the process of grant of death certificates to the dependents of those who have died of Covid-19.Earlier, on June 11, the Centre had told the top court that issues raised in the pleas, seeking directions for ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4,00,000 to the families of those who have died of Covid-19, are "genuine" and are under consideration of the government.However later, the government said that paying ex-gratia compensation was beyond the fiscal affordability and the finances of central and state governments as they were under severe strain.The apex court is hearing two separate pleas filed by lawyers Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal seeking directions to the Centre and the states to provide Rs 4 lakh compensation to the families of coronavirus victims as provisioned under the Act, and a uniform policy for issuing death certificates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-opposes-in-sc-pleas-for-ex-gratia-compensation-to-families-of-covid-victims-says-using-resources-rationally-274430
26-06-2021||---||In open letter, group of retired IPS officers lauds Centre’s Kashmir initiatives||New Delhi, June 26Underlining the Centre’s decisive efforts in making attempts to resolve “the complex Kashmir issue”, a group of retired IPS officers on Saturday wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed hope that the government would fulfill the promise of bringing economic development to Jammu & Kashmir with all the robust investment plans that have been finalised.Lending support to the government’s decision abrogating the special status accorded to the erstwhile state under Article 370 and its reorganisation into two UTs of J&K and Ladakh, they contended that now Pakistan has started calling for the reinstatement of statehood, “which amounted to accepting that J&K is an integral part of the Union of India”.“It is a matter of national pride that over these years, the Central Government tried all means possible to achieve this goal. The momentous decision to annul Article 35A and read-down Article 370 was efficiently implemented, with all necessary precautions to prevent the loss of life and property,” said the letter undersigned by the group, including members like former UP DGP Vikram Singh, former J&K DGP SP Vaid and former CBI Director Prakash Mishra.The other signatories of the letter are retired IPS officers AK Singh, Badri Prasad Singh, Geeta Johri, K Aravinda Rao, K Rajendra Kumar, KB Singh, Nageswara Rao, PP Pandey, RKS Rathore, Shivanand Jha, SK Rout and Vivek Dube.They said that the complete integration of Kashmir with the Union of India was a long-pending unfinished task since India adopted the Constitution of India in 1950. Now, a citizen of Kashmir can proudly call himself/herself Indian and receive all benefits that the Indian state bestows on its citizens, they added.The letter then went on to highlight the achievement of the government in J&K. It said that in August, 2019, the government passed the J&K Reorganisation Bill in Parliament and completely integrated the territory with the Union of India.“This decision gave representation and residency rights to a number of diverse groups, including refugees from West Pakistan and Paharganj-speakers, who were hitherto denied rights to welfare and electoral processes. As a result, over 20,000 refugees from west Pakistan, Gorkhas and women married to non-J&K residents also became legitimate domiciles eligible to buy land and get jobs in J&K,” the letter read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-open-letter-group-of-retired-ips-officers-lauds-centres-kashmir-initiatives-274426
26-06-2021||New Delhi||Citing ‘privileges’, Kerala government moves SC to drop suits against Left leaders||Citing legislative privileges, the Kerala Government has moved the Supreme Court seeking permission to withdraw criminal cases against Communist Party India (Marxist) leaders, including the state’s Education Minister V Sivankutty, for alleged vandalism on the floor of the assembly in 2015, when the party was in the opposition.In its petition filed in the top court, the Pinarayi Vijayan government has challenged the March 12 order of the Kerala High Court refusing to give its nod for withdrawal of cases. The petition is likely to come up for hearing by a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud on June 29.Kerala Assembly had witnessed bedlam on March 13, 2015, as LDF members tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani—who was facing allegations in the bar bribery scam—from presenting the state budget. The CPI (M) MLAs had allegedly vandalised the Speaker’s dais, uprooted his chair, pulled out the mike system, and computers.Refusing to allow withdrawal of cases, the Kerala High Court had said elected representatives were expected to uphold the prestige of the House or face consequences. Earlier, Thiruvananthapuram Chief Judicial Magistrate had denied permission to withdraw prosecution against the accused, including sitting ministers.Now, citing legislative privileges under Article 194, the Kerala Government has contended: “The act of the accused persons being in relation to their function to protest as members of the legislative assembly the MLAs who are accused in this FIR, entitled to get protection under the Constitution,” argued the state government.According to Article 194(2): “No member of the Legislature of a State shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in the Legislature or any committee thereof, and no person shall be so liable in respect of the publication by or under the authority of a House of such a Legislature of any report, paper, votes or proceedings”.The Kerala Government argued that Articles 105(3) and 194(3) of the Constitution confers certain privileges and immunities to the members of Parliament and state legislature.“Therefore, it is not proper for the Secretary of Legislative Assembly to file cases against the MLAs with regard to an incident happened on the floor of the House during the protest made by the opposition members, that too without the consent of the Speaker of the Assembly,” it said seeking a stay on the high court’s order.“The FIR registered by the Secretary Legislative Assembly without the consent of the Speaker is wrong and therefore the application filed under section 321 CrPC is liable to be allowed,” it further submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/citing-privileges-kerala-government-moves-sc-to-drop-suits-against-left-leaders-274420

26-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP holds statewide protest to demand OBC quota in local bodies||The Maharashtra unit of the BJP on Saturday held 'chakka jam' or road blockade protests across the state demanding restoration of reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in local governing bodies which was quashed by the Supreme Court in March this year.The party had announced that it would hold agitation at 1,000 locations across the state.Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis participated in a protest in his home district Nagpur, while Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar took part in an agitation in Thane, due to which traffic on the road connecting the city with Mumbai affected for some time.Addressing BJP workers in Nagpur, Fadnavis said his party will restore reservation for OBCs in local bodies if given power, and if not, he will retire from politics."The fact is that this issue can be resolved at the state level. The state government can restore the reservation by formulating a law. There is no need for any act of the central government. That is why OBC reservation is prevalent in other states except in Maharashtra. You (MVA) will have to make a law. We will not stop until we expose their lie. This protest is held to condemn this government on the issue," he said.Fadnavis, who represents Nagpur South-West seat in the Assembly, said OBCs are being purposely deprived of the political reservation.  "I want to appeal to all the OBC ministers in the MVA government. There is no enmity between us and them. If you are honest towards the cause of the OBCs then regardless of party lines we are ready to stand with you. I want to tell you with full confidence that within the next three to four months we can bring back the OBC reservation. If you give us power...I want to tell you with confidence that if I fail to bring back the political reservation for OBCs, I will retire from politics," the former chief minister said.Former minister Pankaja Munde, who led a protest in Pune, said if the BJP's demand are not met, the party will launch bigger protests in future.The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state has failed to retain political reservation for the OBCs, which is necessary for the community's uplift, she said.Munde alleged the state government kept deferring various elections, including those in the cooperative sector, when the case regarding the OBC reservation was pending in the court, and it was only after the court scrapped the quota, the elections were announced."We are demanding that the OBC reservation be restored and till then no elections should be held. We want the government to approach the Election Commission along with us with a demand to postpone elections," she said."If the elections are held without the OBC reservation, then we will resort to bigger protests. This ‘chakka jam' protest is just a trailer," she added.Munde alleged the state government was trying to muzzle the voice of OBCs by depriving them of quota in local bodies. "The Supreme Court's decision should not be viewed as a defeat. We will continue our battle for the quota and try to get it back by mounting pressure on the state government,” she said. Former minister and BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said the BJP has decided to intensify the agitation in the coming days. "We will not retreat even if more than 1,000 party workers are arrested by the state police,” he said. Another BJP leader and former state minister Girish Mahajan and MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha held a protest outside Mantralaya, the state secretariat in Mumbai, over the issue.The BJP-Shiv Sena government in 2019 had allotted political reservation to OBCs in local governing bodies, but in March this year, the Supreme Court had read it down.The BJP has alleged that the case was lost only because of the inaction of the Shiv Sena-led MVA government, in which NCP and Congress are partners.The State Election Commission had announced bypolls at Dhule, Nandurbar, Washim, Akola and Nagpur districts, and there are 85 seats of Zilla Parishad and 144 panchayat samiti seats for which elections is going to be held. The BJP on Friday demanded that the state government approach the Supreme Court immediately requesting that the ZP bypolls be deferred in five districts.Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil challenged OBC leaders in the state government for a public debate with Fadnavis on the issue "so that truth will come out". “Senior leaders and ministers like Chhagan Bhujbal who have been the face of the OBC community for some years should debate why the OBC quota was read down by the Supreme Court in March this year. He should join a debate with Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis at a public function so that everyone will come to know what the truth is,” Patil told reporters in Kolhapur. Patil said state OBC welfare minister Vijay Wadettiwar or state Congress chief Nana Patole can join the debate, if it is not possible for Bhujbal to participate. "People will come to know who made the mistake,” he added.“This MVA government did nothing during the last 15 hearings before the Supreme Court (on OBC quota issue). It did not submit the empirical data hence the court verdict went against the OBC reservation. The state can still set up a backward commission and prepare empirical data," he said.Patil said this government had taken several decisions that went against various communities and groups. "The government has lost cases for OBC and Maratha quotas in the Supreme Court. This government also cancelled the reservation quota in promotion in the state administration,” he added.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-bjp-holds-statewide-protest-to-demand-obc-quota-in-local-bodies-274406

If so, then this raises a big question on pilferage of Covid vaccines from the government stock and this cannot happen without complicity of top civic authorities. If these were not Covid vaccines, then immediate investigation needs to be done,” Adhikari said in the letter on Friday.The Kolkata Police arrested Deb (28) on Wednesday for allegedly posing as an IAS officer and organising a Covid-19 vaccination camp in Kasba area, and formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) led by the joint police commissioner (Crime).The SIT will investigate how the main accused organised Covid-19 vaccination camps where around 2000 people were suspected to have administered fake doses, a senior officer had said.Actor and Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty, who had taken her Covid-19 vaccine shot at one of the camps set up by Deb, was the first one to raise the alarm as she did not receive the customary SMS that is sent to people after they have taken the jab.“Public health frauds like this in the midst of a raging global pandemic are making common people skeptic... I sincerely urge you to order a thorough investigation by concerned central agencies into this vaccination fraud and punish the guilty.“An impartial investigation by central agencies, undaunted by any pressure from the state’s ruling party or the government, is the need of the hour to restore credibility of the entire Covid vaccination process in West Bengal,” Adhikari wrote to the Union health minister.The incident triggered a political storm after purported photographs and videos of the arrested person along with several TMC leaders and ministers at various programmes came in the public domain.PTI could not independently verify the authenticity of the photographs or videos.Adhikari claimed that the main accused held illegal vaccination camps decorated with “trademark blue and white balloons characteristic of the TMC government events”.“While Kolkata Police has reportedly started investigating into the fraud, several incriminating photos suggestive of the accused’s influence in the ruling party of West Bengal have come to the fore,” the BJP leader said.The TMC leadership, however, denied any involvement in the matter.Adhikari on Friday led a BJP delegation to Swasthya Bhawan, the state health department headquarters, and questioned officials how a person impersonating as an IAS officer has been organising vaccination camps remained off the radar of the police and the department for so long.He had also claimed that it was a conspiracy of the TMC as the ruling party in West Bengal was trying to tarnish the BJP-led Union government with a claim that the Centre has provided fake vaccines.“We apprehend that the West Bengal government and the ruling party have hatched a large conspiracy to implicate the Centre. They are helping people with disputable identity to organise camps where fake jabs were administered to defame the Narendra Modi regime.“If there was any adverse impact on people who were inoculated, the TMC will blame the Centre for providing fake vaccines,” the BJP leader had said.According to police officials, Deb allegedly had financially duped several people in Kolkata by impersonating as a joint commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC).On his social media accounts, he had posted several pictures of organising medical camps and participating in government programmes. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fake-vaccination-bengal-bjp-leader-writes-to-union-health-ministry-demands-probe-by-central-agencies-274399
26-06-2021||New Delhi||India, Greece recognise threat of radicalisation, cross-border terrorism||India and Greece on Saturday called for following fundamental international principles of rule of law and respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and denounced radicalisation, violent extremism, and terrorism, in a clear signal of their growing convergence on key geopolitical challenges.The issues figured prominently during talks between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Greek counterpart Nikos Dendias in Athens.Jaishankar is on a three-day visit to Greece from Friday, the first tour by an Indian foreign minister to Athens in the last 18 years.The two sides also noted with satisfaction the convergence of each other’s vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific ensuring connectivity and growth for all in the region, the Ministry of External Affairs said after the talks that covered key bilateral, regional and global issue.Jaishankar and Dendias also agreed to work towards the establishment of a strategic partnership while deliberating on boosting cooperation in several areas such as trade and investment, science and technology, culture, academics and people-to-people relations.In a tweet, Jaishankar described the talks as “productive bilaterally” and insightful on many regional and global issues, adding it was agreed to step up the pace of engagement and work towards a strategic partnership.The external affairs minister also paid a courtesy call on Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister of Greece.The MEA said the Greek foreign minister signed an agreement making Greece part of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), an initiative of India aimed at promoting renewable energy and sustainable development.It said the two ministers shared views on regional and global issues of mutual interest in the context of new geopolitical and geo-economic realities, including the Indo-Pacific.“Both sides noted with satisfaction the convergence of each other’s vision for a free, open, inclusive and cooperative Indo-Pacific ensuring connectivity and growth for all in the region,” the MEA said, adding they also discussed the recent developments pertaining to the Eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus and Libya.It said India and Greece also agreed that the rule of law and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity are fundamental principles of international relations that must be observed by all.The assertion came amid growing global concerns over China’s increasing military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere.“Both countries recognised the threat posed by radicalisation, violent extremism, as well as terrorism, including cross border terrorism. They emphasised that there can be no justification for these in any form or manifestation,” the MEA said in a statement.The reference to cross-border terrorism is seen as an oblique reference to Pakistan’s support for cross-border terrorism against India.The two countries also conveyed their deep commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based international order.Reaffirming the importance of the urgent reform of the UN, including expansion of the UN Security Council, and other multilateral institutions, the two sides said such a step was necessary to make these institutions more inclusive, transparent, accountable, and better reflective of contemporary geopolitical realities.“The Greek side reiterated its support for permanent membership of India in a reformed UNSC,” the MEA said.It said the talks also focused on the coronavirus pandemic globally and the process of economic recovery.“They agreed on the need for joint efforts to combat the disease and to work together for consolidating economic and commercial activities during and immediately after the pandemic,” it said.Jaishankar also unveiled a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Athens.“The statue will act as a strong symbol of friendship between the two countries,” the MEA said.“India and Greece enjoy close and friendly relations which have been strengthened by the shared values of democracy, rule of law, pluralism, equality, freedom of speech, and respect for human rights,” it said.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-greece-recognise-threat-of-radicalisation-cross-border-terrorism-274397

Recruit me for the cancelled flights.” Along with the image, he wrote, “Wicked wit.”               Responding to it, BJP MLA and Deputy Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Rajendra Rathore said, “Wow! What a wonderful timing...CM @ashokgehlot51 ji’s economic affairs advisor is now playing a role of political advisor also. Lack of political advisor in CM’s camp is worrying. By the way, one pilot is enough to trouble the government.”                  In another tweet, he added, “What will be the circumstances when more pilots without license come in? The pilot in the cartoon may not have the qualification and license, but the pilot who has become a problem for the government has both, qualification and license. In such a situation, recruitment of pilots without qualification and license can be a thorn in the flesh for the government.”               Mayaram later clarified and wrote, “My post isn’t political. It is a reflection on the state of sundown economy with destruction of over 1 crore jobs. Demand has also been destroyed. That’s why flights are being cancelled all the time. Wake up and smell coffee”.Dissidence has resurfaced in Rajasthan’s ruling party nearly a year after it managed to stave off a rebellion by the Pilot camp. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-bjp-takes-swipe-at-congress-over-gehlot-aides-hiring-pilots-tweet-274390

This came after the police sought more time to make submissions on his pre-arrest bail plea.Sidhana had earlier denied involvement in the Republic Day violence.Several cases had been registered against him in Punjab and he was jailed many times. He had also unsuccessfully contested the 2012 state Assembly polls.

The trials and evaluation would be done by the IAF on AN-32 aircraft at one of its bases.The RTATS is required to be compatible with the Global Navigation Satellite System of India’s GAGAN regional satellite navigation system and Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), as well as America’s Global Positioning System, using both standard positioning services as well as restricted services.GAGAN was conceived by the Ministry of Civil Aviation for management and surveillance of the Indian airspace, while NavIC has a wider footprint, covering south Asia, south-east Asia, China, the Middle East, south-western Europe and the Indian Ocean region, including the eastern coast of Africa and Western Australia. Both these systems have been developed by ISRO.  Many military as well as civilian organisations across the globe use various kinds of RTATS for tracking aircraft movements as well as managing airspace. Contemporary tracking systems use a network of satellites and ground receiving stations. Flight data transmitted from an aircraft is captured by an overhead satellite and beamed to the earth, where it is recorded and disseminated to the stakeholders. It can also be used to transmit distress signals in an emergency.The IAF is also equipping some of its larger transport aircraft with the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a new generation, highly accurate satellite-based aircraft positioning and tracking system, the use of which has already become mandatory in some countries.Real-time tracking using ADS-B and other open source information is also available to aviation enthusiasts and the general public though many websites and mobile applications. These give out an aircraft’s flight path, location, speed and altitude. Though primarily focused on civilian aircraft, some military aircraft also show up on these applications.The IAF had earlier installed emergency beacons in some of its transport planes, but these are activated only in case of an accident to transmit the location of the site and do not beam flight data.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-isro-developing-real-time-aircraft-tracking-system-for-transport-fleet-274383

Let us together make a system so no one faces shortage of oxygen in third wave,” Kejriwal said in his tweet in Hindi.“There was an acute shortage of oxygen in the second wave. It should not be so in the third. Corona will win if we fight with each other. The nation will win if we fight together," he added.While AAP leaders accused the BJP of "cooking up" the report, the saffron party charged the Delhi government with "criminal negligence".Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that the "bogus" and "misleading" report was "cooked up" at the BJP's office and submitted by the Centre in the apex court.

26-06-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan seeks ‘civilised' and ‘even-handed' relationship with US like the one that exists between America and India: Imran||Pakistan is seeking a "civilised" and "even-handed" relationship with Washington like the one that exists between the US and the UK or with India "right now", Prime Minister Imran Khan has said, underlining the role Islamabad could play in the region, including in Afghanistan after America leaves the war-torn country.Khan made the comments during an interview with The New York Times in which he also expressed his disappointment that his bid to normalise ties with India did not make any progress though he approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon after assuming office in August 2018.In the interview that comes as US President Joe Biden had his first face-to-face meeting with his Afghan counterpart Ashraf Ghani at the White House on Friday, Khan recalled that Pakistan had had a closer relationship with the US than other nations in the region, such as India, and was a US partner in the war against terrorism, Dawn newspaper reported."Now, after the US leaves Afghanistan, basically Pakistan would want a civilised relationship, which you have between nations, and we would like to improve our trading relationship with the US,” he said.Asked to elaborate his concept of a civilised relationship, Khan said he was seeking relations like the one that existed "between the US and Britain, or between US and India right now. A relationship which is even-handed"."Unfortunately, the relationship during the war on terror was a bit lopsided," he said."It was a lopsided relationship because the US felt that they were giving aid to Pakistan, they felt that Pakistan then had to do US' bidding."And what Pakistan did in terms of trying to do the US bidding cost Pakistan a lot … 70,000 Pakistanis died, and over $150 billion were lost to the economy because there were suicide bombings and bombs going on all over the country," he said.The main problem with this lopsided relationship was that "Pakistani governments tried to deliver what they were not capable of," and it led to a "mistrust between the two countries", Khan said."And people in Pakistan felt they paid a heavy, heavy price for this relationship. And the US thought Pakistan had not done enough."The prime minister said that his government wanted the future relationship to be based on trust and common objectives, including a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.In the interview, Khan also claimed that Pakistan would have had a better relationship with India if it had a different government and they would have resolved all their differences through dialogue."When I assumed office, the first thing I did was I made this approach to Prime Minister Modi (to seek) a normal, civilised trading relationship...We tried but didn't get anywhere," he said."Had there been another Indian leadership, I think we would have had a good relationship with them. And yes, we would have resolved all our differences through dialogue," Khan claimed.The strained ties between India and Pakistan deteriorated further after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into union territories in August 2019.On the Status quo in Kashmir, Khan said, "I think it's a disaster for India because it will just mean that this conflict festers on and on… and (prevents) any relationship—normal relationship—between Pakistan and India."      India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with it in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.Khan said the US assumption that India would be the bulwark against China is wrong. "I think it would be detrimental for India because India's trade with China is going to be beneficial for both India and China."Pakistan, he said, is "watching the scenario unfold with a bit of anxiety”.

26-06-2021||New Delhi||Third wave of coronavirus unlikely to be as severe as second: Study||A third wave of Covid - if it occurs - is unlikely to be as severe as the second wave given the extent of spread of coronavirus infections that has already taken place in the country, according to a study.The study, based on mathematical modelling analysis published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR), highlights that the emergence of a third wave of coronavirus could be substantially mitigated by the expansion of vaccination.Presenting a vaccine ramp-up scenario where 40 per cent of the population has received two doses within three months of the second wave peak, and further that the effect of vaccination is (conservatively) to reduce severity of infection by 60 per cent, the study said it  illustrates how vaccination could substantially reduce the overall burden during the possible third wave.‘Plausibility of a third wave of Covid in India: A mathematical modelling-based analysis’ has been authored by Sandip Mandal, Balram Bhargava and Samiran Panda from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and Nimalan Arinaminpathy from the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, School of Public Health, Imperial College, London, UK.Using a deterministic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, four potential mechanisms - waning immunity restores previously exposed individuals to a susceptible state, emergence of a new viral variant that is capable of escaping immunity to previously circulating strains, emergence of a new viral variant that is more transmissible than the previously circulating strains and release of current lockdowns affording fresh opportunities for transmission - for a third wave were examined, the study said.Considering the four hypotheses for the emergence of a third wave, the study said infection-induced immunity may decay over time, permitting re-infection of those previously exposed, even if the circulating virus remains unchanged.Previous works have shown how partially waning immunity could cause future waves of SARS-CoV-2 to be more benign, but the focus here was on the possibility of a third wave that may cause substantial public health burden, the study noted.Therefore, a scenario where waning immunity results in a full loss of protection, rendering immune individuals susceptible again was considered, and a range of scenarios for the rate of waning were examined, it added.Considering the hypothesis of an emergence of a full immune escape variant, the study said even if immunity remains life-long, it is theoretically possible for a new variant to emerge that is capable of escaping the immunity induced by the previously circulating strains.

While we must enhance capacities of the former, the international community must collectively call out the latter and hold them accountable.”        The remarks appeared to be an apparent reference to Pakistan.Tirumurti also emphasised the need for international collaboration to counter financing terrorism, support and strengthen the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and provide greater funding to UN Counter-Terrorism architecture.

26-06-2021||Sandeep DikshitTRIBUNE NEW SERVICENEW DELHI||Pakistan remains on FATF grey list||The global Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has decided to keep Pakistan on the grey list of nations requiring constant monitoring till it demonstrates that terror-financing investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups, FATF Chairman Marcus Pleyer told the media on Friday.“Though the Pakistan government has made substantial progress and largely addressed 26 out of the 27 action points, it is still failing to implement global FATF standards in a number of areas. This means the risk of money laundering remains high in turn fuelling corruption and organised crime,’’ said Pleyer at the end of the FATF’s virtual plenary that ended today.Pakistan also remains the subject of investigation by FATF’s regional body, the Asia Pacific Group (APG) regarding “serious issues” on money laundering and terror-financing. The implication is that even if Pakistan completes all 27 action points given by FATF, it will also have to clear the APG hurdle. Pakistan will also be subjected to on-site investigations by both FATF and APG before it is cleared.FATF is the second international body where the issue of Pakistan’s mollycoddling of UN-designated terrorists, including from LeT and JeM, has been tabled. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) meeting of National Security Advisors on Wednesday, Ajit Doval, had proposed an action plan against LeT and JeM.Doval also pressed for full implementation of UN resolutions and targeted sanctions against UN-designated terrorist individuals and entities as well as adoption of international standards to counter terror-financing, including an MoU between the SCO and FATF.An attempt by Pakistani journalists to corner India on the issue of its police unearthing stolen uranium could not materialise. Pleyer said he was aware of the media reports in this regard but “will not comment on something in India we haven’t assessed”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-remains-on-fatf-grey-list-274057

The period from 1975 to 1977 witnessed a systematic destruction of institutions,” the PM said on Twitter.He urged everyone to pledge to do “everything possible to strengthen India’s democratic spirit, and live up to the values enshrined in our Constitution”.Sharing a related BJP post on the Emergency, the PM added, “This is how Congress trampled over our democratic ethos. We remember all those greats who resisted the Emergency and protected Indian democracy. #DarkDaysOfEmergency.”The post asks people, “Can you believe this was banned during the Emergency” and then answers — “Movies on Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh; Kishore Kumar songs; quotes of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore and protests.”The Congress hit back with party media head Randeep Surjewala tagging the PM’s tweet and noting, “Says a PM synonymous with three ‘Ss’ Suppress, Stifle and Subjugate.”“A PM who has undermined the Parliament, who has disdain for the Constitution, who has eroded institutions, who has trampled democracy, shouldn’t preach. India has been under Modi-gency for seven years,” Surjewala retorted.Earlier, BJP chief JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah also attacked the Congress with Shah saying, “On this very day in 1975, the Congress in its lust for power had murdered the largest democracy of the world by imposing an Emergency.

They are facing the prospects of imminent deportation to the country of their origin as they have either attained the age of 21 or about to reach that age, after which they can no longer be dependent on their parents’ visas. A significantly large number of these parents are in a decades’ long wait for a Green Card.Senators, Congress members movedA Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently in the US.The young Indians, led by Dip Patel, a clinical pharmacist in Illinois, surprised many of the Congressmen and senators, who greeted them at the Capitol last week, as they were probably the first batch of lobbyists at the US Congress, after the recent lifting of social distancing restrictions by the Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC).Patel, 25, is founder of Improve The Dream, a youth-led organisation bringing awareness for children who face ageing out and self-deportation, was joined by Pareen Mhatre, 21, a senior at the University of Iowa majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in Business Administration; Naga Raghav Sreeram, 21, a senior at the University of California, Davis majoring in Computer Science. “Great to hear from some young advocates with @ImproveTheDream outside of the Capitol!

26-06-2021||New Delhi||Kejriwal govt inflated Oxygen demand 4 times during peak: Supreme Court panel||A Supreme Court-appointed panel has indicted the Delhi Government for allegedly inflating the oxygen requirement by four times during peak of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, thus adversely affecting the supply to 12 other states.Need vs demand1,140 MT of oxygen was demanded by the Delhi Government during the peak of second wave289 MT was the actual need, as per the formula based on bed capacity, the panel saidThe panel, a sub-group set up by the top court on May 6 to audit oxygen consumption in Delhi hospitals, concluded that the Kejriwal government “exaggerated” the consumption figure to claim 1,140 MT of oxygen. This was four times the figure (289 MT) calculated using the formula based on bed capacity.AAP, BJP clash over audit reportThe AAP and BJP clashed on Friday over the audit report. After the BJP accused the AAP government of playing politics, the AAP trashed the allegationsIn its interim report to the SC, the five-member panel, led by AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, said, “There was a gross discrepancy (about four times). The actual oxygen consumption claimed by the Delhi Government (1,140 MT) was about four times higher than the calculated consumption as per the formula based on bed capacity (289 MT).”It said the Delhi Government demanded 700 MT of oxygen on April 30 using a “wrong formula”.Overruling the Centre’s contention that experts have pegged Delhi’s requirement at 415 MT, a Bench, led by Justice DY Chandrachud, had, on May 5, ordered the Centre to maintain a supply of 700 MT to Delhi, which had sought 900 MT of oxygen for peak caseload of 95,000 patients on May 3. The Delhi HC also pulled up the Centre on the issue.The panel prepared its report after analysing oxygen consumption data received from 183 hospitals on three parameters—actual consumption, requirement as per Centre’s formula and requirement as per Delhi’s formula.The Delhi Government had claimed that the oxygen requirement at 183 hospitals was 1,140 MT, but as per information received from the hospitals, the actual consumption was only 209 MT, it noted.If the Centre-recommended formula for oxygen allotment was adopted, the requirement would have been 289 MT and 391 MT as per the Delhi Government formula, it said.The panel further said tankers were not able to offload oxygen as tanks at various hospitals in Delhi were completely filled.Four model hospitals in Delhi—Singhal Hospital, Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital, ESIC Model Hospital and Liferay Hospital—claimed extremely high oxygen consumption with very few beds and the claims appeared to be clearly “erroneous, leading to extremely skewed information and significantly higher oxygen requirement for entire Delhi”, it said.Some hospitals could not differentiate between KL (kilo litre) and MT (metric tonne) and the same was not examined while projecting 700 MTs, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kejriwal-govt-inflated-oxygen-demand-4-times-during-peak-supreme-court-panel-273919

The measures were suggested by Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.Cases in Patiala and Ludhiana, Punjab alertedChandigarh: With Punjab reporting first two cases of the Delta plus variant in Patiala and Ludhiana districts, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan has, in a letter to state’s Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan, asked the state to take up immediate containment measures as the variant was highly transmissible. The Centre has also suggested sending adequate samples to the designated INSACOG laboratories for genome sequencing.Sujeet Singh, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Director, said 22 had been found in Maharashtra, nine in Tamil Nadu, seven in MP, three in Kerala, two each in Punjab and Gujarat, and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, J&K, Haryana and Karnataka. The cases have been found in 45,000 samples sequenced so far.No tax on Covid ex gratiaThe government on Friday announced tax exemption for expenditure incurred on Covid treatment as well as on ex gratia up to Rs10 lakh received on death due to the pandemic.The Delta variant of concern, meanwhile, has emerged as the dominant Covid mutation circulating in India with presence in a whopping 80 per cent of the samples genome sequenced so far to study viral mutations. Of the 21,109 variants of concern detected in India after studying 65,000 samples until now, 16,238 are Delta, first detected in Maharashtra last year and now present in 80 countries.“Delta is a stronger variant than B117, first detected in the UK. Among all variants of concern found in India, Alpha (B117) accounts for 3,969 cases, Beta (detected in South Africa) 149 and Gamma (detected in Brazil) one case. We have found 48 cases of the Delta plus mutation and are studying them for public health implications,” National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Director SK Singh said today.The NCDC data shows the Delta variant spread across 174 districts in 35 states with the highest numbers reported from districts in Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, Punjab, Telangana, Bengal and Gujarat. Of the 21,109 variants of concern, Maharashtra has highest 3,117, Delhi 2,973, Kerala 2,382 and Punjab 1,431.The NCDC chief said even the proportion of cases with variants of concern in India had risen from 10.31 per cent in May to 51 per cent on June 20. The spread of Delta in India has been dramatic—from presence in one district in late December 2020 to 52 districts in late March and 174 today.Although overall the second wave was receding and 565 districts today had below 5 per cent positivity rate, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said 74 districts still had over 10% positivity rate and 92 districts had 5 to 10% positivity. “States must impose strict restrictions wherever case positivity is above 5%,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/51-delta-plus-cases-across-12-states-2-in-punjab-1-haryana-273920

Both sides agreed on the need to find an early resolution to the remaining issues in eastern Ladakh keeping in view the agreement reached between the two Foreign Ministers in September 2020.In this regard, the two sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through the diplomatic and military mechanisms to reach a mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement from all friction points so as to ensure full restoration of peace and tranquility to enable progress in the bilateral relations. They also agreed that in the interim, the two sides will continue to ensure stability on the ground and prevent any untoward incident, said the MEA release.The Indian delegation was led by Additional Secretary (East Asia) from the Ministry of External Affairs. The Director-General of the Boundary & Oceanic Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs led the Chinese delegation.The meeting took place days after the two Foreign Offices blamed each other for the amassing of troops and military equipment along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Thursday had hit back at its Chinese counterpart Zhao Lijian for stating that the high level of troop and military equipment was a “normal defence arrangement” to prevent and respond to encroachment and threats on China's territory.Bagchi had replied by stating that it is “well recognised that it has been the Chinese actions over the last year, including amassing of a large number of troops close to border areas in the Western Sector, and trying to unilaterally alter the status quo along the LAC, which have seriously disturbed peace and tranquility in the border areas’’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-agree-to-maintain-stability-at-lac-to-prevent-untoward-incidents-273883
26-06-2021||New Delhi||FATF keeps Pakistan on grey list, asks it to prosecute terror masterminds||The global Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has decided to keep Pakistan on the grey list of nations requiring constant monitoring till it demonstrates that terror financing investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups, FATF Chairman Marcus Pleyer told the media on Friday."Though Pakistan government has made substantial progress and has largely addressed 26 out of 27 action points, it is still failing to implement global FATF standards in a number of areas. This means the risk of money laundering remains high in turn fueling corruption and organised crime," said Pleyer at the end of the FATF’s virtual plenary that ended today.Pakistan also remains the subject of an investigation by FATF’s regional body, the Asia Pacific Group (APG) regarding "serious issues" on money laundering and terror financing. The implication is that even if Pakistan completes all the 27 action points given by FATF, it will also have to clear the APG hurdle. Pakistan will also be subjected to on-site investigations by both FATF and APG before it is cleared.FATF is the second international body where the issue of Pakistan’s mollycoddling of UN designated terrorists, including from LeT and JeM, has been tabled. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) meeting of National Security Advisors on Wednesday, Ajit Doval, had proposed an action plan against LeT and JeM.Doval also pressed for the full implementation of UN resolutions and targeted sanctions against UN designated terrorist individuals and entities as well as the adoption of international standards to counter terror financing, including an MoU between SCO and FATF.   An attempt by Pakistani journalists to corner India on the issue of its police unearthing stolen uranium could not materialise. Pleyer said he was aware of the media reports in this regard but "will not comment on something in India we haven’t assessed"."The routine mutual evaluation of India and some other countries had been delayed due to the pandemic and it will be held as soon as there is an improvement in the situation,’’ said Pleyer.Another attempt to plead Pakistan’s case for exiting the grey list because it had completed all but one of the FATF’s action points also came a cropper. "All deficiencies must be addressed," replied Pleyer while adding that such a practice will discourage countries that have completed all their action points. "We treat all countries equally. This is our expectation from the Pakistan government," he added.The FATF plenary also deliberated on a new addition—money laundering from environmental crime—which generates billions in illicit profits each year. This includes illegal mining, illegal logging, illegal land clearing, and waste trafficking."There has been limited action.  As a result, environmental crimes have become 'low risk, high reward' activities that provide a safe source  of  income  for  criminals,  while  causing  devastating  damage  to  the  world’s  ecosystem," it noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fatf-keeps-pakistan-on-grey-list-asks-it-to-prosecute-terror-masterminds-273879

26-06-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad accuses Twitter of denying him access to his account||Union Minister For Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad accused Twitter of deliberately blocking access to his handle over alleged violations of copyright laws—the latest incident to come in an escalating standoff between the microblogging site and the central government over the latter's controversial new IT rules.His account was unblocked after a warning, he said. In a series of tweets, Ravi Shankar Prasad accused Twitter of using the copyright law to retaliate against the central government’s insistence that the site must abide by the new IT laws.   He said he was briefly denied access to his account without any prior notice for almost an hour on the premise that there was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of USA, and said that his statements had “clearly ruffled” some feathers.“Friends! Something highly peculiar happened today. Twitter denied access to my account for almost an hour on the alleged ground that there was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the USA and subsequently they allowed me to access the account,” he said in the first of a series of tweets.“Twitter’s actions were in gross violation of Rule 4(8) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 where they failed to provide me any prior notice before denying me access to my own account.”“It is apparent that my statements calling out the high handedness and arbitrary actions of Twitter, particularly sharing the clips of my interviews to TV channels and its powerful impact, have clearly ruffled its feathers.”“Further, it is now apparent as to why Twitter is refusing to comply with the Intermediary Guidelines because if Twitter does comply, it would be unable to arbitrarily deny access to an individual’s account which does not suit their agenda. Furthermore, in the past several years, no television channel or any anchor has made any complaints about copyright infringements with regard to these news clips of my interviews shared on social media.”“Twitter’s actions indicate that they are not the harbinger of free speech that they claim to be but are only interested in running their own agenda, with the threat that if you do not toe the line they draw, they will arbitrarily remove you from their platform,” he said, adding that there will be no compromise on following the controversial new rules.“No matter what any platform does they will have to abide by the new IT Rules fully and there shall be no compromise on that,” he said.The blocking of the IT Minister's Twitter account comes at a time when the US digital giant has been engaged in a tussle with the Indian government over the new social media rules.The government has slammed Twitter for deliberate defiance and failure to comply with the country's new IT rules, which has led to the microblogging platform losing its intermediary status in India and becoming liable for users posting any unlawful content.

26-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt, BJP spar over Supreme Court panel report on oxygen utilisation||Delhi’s oxygen needs were “exaggerated” by four times during the second Covid wave, a Supreme Court-appointed panel report said, prompting the BJP to charge the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation of “criminal negligence”, while the AAP dispensation accused the saffron party of “cooking up” such a report.Also read: Covid-19: SC panel indicts Kejriwal Government for ‘inflating’ oxygen requirementResponding to the accusations, Kejriwal on Friday said his only “crime” was that he “fought for the breath of two crore people” of Delhi.His deputy Manish Sisodia claimed that no such report has been approved by the committee members.He alleged that the “bogus” and “misleading” report has been”cooked up” at BJP’s office and submitted by the Centre in the apex court.“The real truth about this report is that it does not exist. This alleged report which is being used by BJP leaders to senselessly slam CM Arvind Kejriwal does not exist. It is bogus and misleading. The Bhartiya Janata Party is lying and shirking accountability,” Sisodia alleged.Several Union ministers, including Prakash Javadekar, Piyush Goyal and Nirmala Sitharaman, took to Twitter to hit out at the Delhi government over the report.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also slammed the Delhi government, terming it to be a “heinous crime”.The Delhi units of both the BJP and the Congress demanded the resignation of Kejriwal, saying that due to “exaggerated demand of oxygen” by his government, supply of the live-saving gas to 12 other states was affected.Delhi was hit severely by a brutal second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April and May, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with a shortage in oxygen supply at various city hospitals adding to the woes.The sub-group constituted by the Supreme Court to audit oxygen consumption in hospitals in the National Capital during the second wave of Covid-19 said the Delhi Government “exaggerated” the consumption of oxygen and made a claim of 1,140 MT, four times higher than the formula for bed capacity requirement of 289 MT.The five-member panel headed by AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said the Delhi Government had made the claims for allocation of 700 MT oxygen on April 30 of medical grade oxygen using a “wrong formula”.Taking to Twitter, Kejriwal said his only “crime” was that he “fought for the breath of two crore people”.“My crime—I fought for the breath of my two crore people. When you were doing an election rally, I was awake all night arranging for oxygen. I fought, pleaded to get oxygen for people.”“People have lost their loved ones due to lack of oxygen. Don’t call them liars, they are feeling so bad,” Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.Dismissing the existence of the report at a press briefing, Sisodia said, “Upon speaking to members of this Oxygen Audit Committee, the truth came out. Members of this committee have informed the Delhi Government that no such report has been approved, signed or released.“When no such report has been approved by the Oxygen Audit Committee, then which report is being used by the BJP to yet again malign the Delhi Government? Where has this report come from?” “The real truth about this report is that it does not exist. It is bogus and misleading. It is absolutely shameful and despicable that BJP leaders, sitting at their party headquarters, cooked up some misleading facts and fabricated an alleged report to shift accountability from themselves,” he alleged.Union ministers and senior BJP leaders also hit out at the Delhi government citing the report.Railways Minister and senior BJP leader Piyush Goyal said on Twitter, “Hope accountability is fixed for disrupting oxygen supply across India”, citing the SC-appointed oxygen audit committee’s report.Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar alleged that due to the Delhi Government, other states had to face the loss during the second wave of Covid-19, adding that someone should learn from the AAP dispensation on how to make noise.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also tweeted: “…actual oxygen consumption claimed by the Delhi government…was…four times higher than the calculated consumption as per the formula based on bed capacity...National Capital Territory of Delhi…had surplus oxygen…affecting…supply to other states.”             Addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra cited the SC-appointed panel report to note that the Delhi government had demanded 1,140 MT of the life-saving gas during the peak of the second wave even though it could utilise 209 MT.Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Anil Chaudhury also blamed the Chief Minister for the deaths of people during the second Covid wave.“It is clear from the ‘Oxygen Audit Committee report’ that due to Kejriwal, the supply of the life-saving gas to 12 other states of the country was affected.“The lack of storage and tankers in Delhi and the fault of some private hospitals led to the oxygen crisis. “People died because of Kejriwal”. Killer Chief Minister leave the chair,” he said in a tweet in Hindi. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-govt-bjp-spar-over-supreme-court-panel-report-on-oxygen-utilisation-273841
26-06-2021|| New Delhi||ED raids premises of former Maharashtra HM Deshmukh in Nagpur, aides in Mumbai||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday conducted searches at the premises of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in Nagpur and his associates in Mumbai as part of a money-laundering probe against the politician on Rs 100 crore bribery charges, officials said.They said the raids are being carried out under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the locations include Deshmukh's residence at GPO Chowk in Nagpur and that of his personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde in Mumbai.Deshmukh (71), sources told PTI, is in Mumbai and the agency is expected to question him there.Palande was brought by the sleuths to the ED office in Ballard Estate area of Maharashtra's capital city for questioning around noon, they said.The central probe agency had registered a criminal case under the anti-money laundering law against Deshmukh and others last month after studying a CBI FIR.The ED case came about after the CBI first carried out a preliminary inquiry followed by filing a regular case on the orders of the Bombay High Court that asked it to look into the allegations of bribery made against Deshmukh by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh.Officials said the search teams are looking for additional evidence that can be important for their probe.The teams are trying to gather evidence and record statements to substantiate the claims made by about 10 bar owners to the ED that they paid about Rs 4 crore "bribe" in cash that was allegedly handed over to the former home minister.Official sources said these claims have been recorded by the agency under the PMLA and it is trying to corroborate it with additional evidence.Deshmukh, who had to resign from his post in April following the allegations, has denied any wrongdoing.The agency's probe is focused on the allegation that illicit funds were generated in the transfer, posting of police personnel in Maharashtra and if illegal extortion was done by the cops as claimed by Singh in his complaint.The ED has powers to attach assets of the accused during the investigation stage and later file charge sheets against them before a PMLA court for trial.Singh was shunted out from the post after the role of policeman Sachin Vaze surfaced during investigation of the explosive-laden SUV that was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai.In his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the Police Commissioner's post, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked Vaze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants of Mumbai.Deshmukh, a leader of the NCP, was the home minister of the state in the MVA government headed by Thackeray.The CBI booked Deshmukh and others under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections related to criminal conspiracy and section of Prevention of Corruption Act for "attempt to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of public duty"."The preliminary enquiry prima facie revealed that a cognisable offence is made out in the matter, wherein the then home minister of Maharashtra, Shri Anil Deshmukh and unknown others have attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty," the CBI FIR had alleged.The CBI enquiry found Vaze, assistant inspector of Mumbai Police, had been reinstated into the police force after being out of service for more than 15 years.Vaze was entrusted with some of the most sensational and important cases of Mumbai city and Deshmukh was in knowledge of the said fact, the CBI FIR alleged.It alleged that Deshmukh "and others" exercised undue influence over the transfer and posting of officials and thereby exercising undue influence over the performance of government duties by the officials, it claimed.After registering the FIR on April 21, the CBI had also carried out searches in Mumbai and Nagpur at premises linked to the former minister who resigned after the high court had ordered a CBI probe against him in connection with this case.‘Targeting opponents’The NCP on Friday slammed the BJP, saying that it has the “habit” of using the investigative agencies and “targeting” the political rivals.Talking to reporters at Osmanabad, NCP’s Maharashtra unit chief Jayant Patil said: “The BJP has the habit of using the investigative agencies and its leaders are now passing resolutions in their state body meetings regarding inquiries. They have no work left now”.“The BJP is now very much in the habit of using investigative agencies, like CBI and others. So much so that the Maharashtra body of their party is passing resolutions to seek inquiry,” he said after holding a meeting to review the irrigation projects in Osmanabad district. Patil asked why BJP leaders don’t speak about the issues like Covid-19 or the development of the state.“The BJP’s state unit is passing resolutions to reach out to the CBI for inquiry into any allegation. They have this habit of using the investigative agencies and people of Maharashtra are watching,” he added.NCP MP Supriya Sule condemned the ED action against Anil Deshmukh and said such “misuse” of central investigative agencies was prevalent only during the Emergency.“Political vendetta was unheard of in Maharashtra until now. BJP is indulging in targeting of political rivals, rather than holding deliberations regarding ideology, prevailing political issues and the problems being faced by the people, in its state executive meeting,” she said in response to a question on the BJP’s resolution against Ajit Pawar and Anil Parab.“No matter what, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) will not only continue for five years, but for 25 years by focusing on politics of development,” Sule said.Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-raids-premises-of-former-maharashtra-hm-deshmukh-in-nagpur-aides-in-mumbai-273806
