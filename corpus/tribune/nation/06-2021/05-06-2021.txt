05-06-2021||New Delhi||Government’s vaccine distribution policy not fair, has inequalities, alleges Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that the government’s vaccine distribution has inequalities and is not fair.“I have been saying that the vaccines should be procured by the Centre and distributed by the states.“In the absence of a fair policy for vaccine distribution, the inequality in the Modi government’s policy will give such results,” he said citing a media report highlighting the inequalities in vaccine distribution.The report claims that nine private hospitals got 50 per cent and six cities 80 per cent of Covishield and Covaxin stocks and alleged disparities in vaccine distribution.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the government, alleging shortage of beds during the second wave of coronavirus and asked why did it not upgrade health facilities and instead is carrying forward the central vista project.“In January, when the Prime Minister was making false declarations of ‘winning the war against corona’, the number of oxygen beds in the country was reduced by 36 percent, the number of ICU beds by 46 percent and the number of ventilator beds by 28 per cent,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.“He ignored the advice to improve health facilities. Who is responsible,” she asked.She also asked why did the government ignore the advice of experts and from its own Parliamentary Committee on Health and did nothing to fulfil the promise of upgraded medical facilities in every district.“Why has not even a single new AIIMS become functional since 2014, while the Central Vista project, declared an ‘essential service’ moved at lightning speed? Is the prime minister’s vanity project more important than providing hospital beds to the public,” she also asked. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/governments-vaccine-distribution-policy-not-fair-has-inequalities-alleges-rahul-263919
05-06-2021||New Delhi||Petition in SC seeks probe into hateful posts on Twitter during Covid-19 first wave||Amid controversy over non-compliance of the government IT Rules by Twitter, a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a CBI/NIA probe into alleged hateful and "Islamophobic"  posts on the social networking platform last year during the first wave of Covid-19.Petitioner advocate Khaja Aijazuddin has challenged a Telangana High Court order refusing the pass any specific orders. The high court had asked the Centre to consider his representation for registering of an FIR against Twitter and its users posting communal and hateful messages.He submitted that the high court was "unjustified" as the alleged "Islamophobic" posts hurting the feelings of a particular community amounted to a criminal offence under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act, 2000.An independent probe by the CBI or the NIA should be ordered into the alleged inflammatory posts, he demanded.No steps were taken by the authorities to register a complaint against Twitter despite the criminal nature of the alleged posts, Aijazuddin contended.He urged the court to direct the Centre to frame guidelines under the Information Technology Act, 2000, to deal with hate messages against any religious community on social media platforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petition-in-sc-seeks-probe-into-hateful-posts-on-twitter-during-covid-19-first-wave-263918

05-06-2021||New Delhi||Environment Day: Climate change, toxic air remain issues of deep concern for India, say experts||As the world celebrated Environment Day on Saturday, climate change and toxic smog remained issues of deep concern for India, with environmental experts emphasising that clean air must not be considered "a luxury but a basic human right".Experts said while air pollution was a leading cause of asthma, stroke, lung cancer and premature deaths, climate change has a sizable impact on health too as it acts as a driver of disease migration affecting the lives of many."Let's not make clean air a luxury. It's a basic human right. People are being forced to breathe in polluted air and are faced with a terrible health crisis. We have witnessed how air pollution and climate crisis continues impacting human lives even in this Covid pandemic," said Avinash Chanchal, Senior Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India.World Environment Day is celebrated on June 5 every year.According to the latest report on India's state of environment, the year 2020 was the eighth-warmest year on record and 12 of the warmest years were recorded in the last 15 years.Besides the rising temperatures, India saw more than two-times increase in the deaths attributable to ambient PM 2.5 over the past two decades with one out of every four deaths due to toxic air in 2019 alone.As per the 'State of India's Environment 2021' report, poor air quality was the fourth leading risk factor for early death worldwide in 2019, surpassed only by high blood pressure, tobacco use, and poor diet. Over the past two decades, deaths attributable to ambient PM2.5 in India has increased by 2.5 times, the report said, adding that between 1990 and 2019, deaths due to household pollution has increased by over 40 per cent, the report said."Indeed, climate change has a sizable and serious impact on health. It affects the most basic health requirements like clean air, clean and safe water, sufficient food and adequate shelter. It acts as a driver of disease migration affecting the lives of many, which makes it a critical public health problem as it makes many existing diseases and conditions worse," said Akanksha Malviya, an advocate working for health rights, environmental justice and climate change.While climate change displaced as many as 50 lakh people in India in 2019, air pollution took 16.7 lakh lives the same year, the report said.Speaking about the impact of air pollution, Chanchal said it was a serious health hazard and needs immediate attention and implementation of a comprehensive clean air action plan."We need to tackle air pollution because it's a serious public health hazard and a leading cause of asthma, stroke, lung cancer and premature deaths."The air pollution crisis became a key concern for the people across the country. We are witnessing its impact in our everyday lives. There are many cities across the country that are just as polluted as Delhi. This indicates that air pollution is a regional issue and the solution to this crisis also needs immediate attention and implementation of a comprehensive clean air action plan at regional levels rather than only focusing on a few cities like Delhi," he said.As many as 66.7 lakh people died in the world due to air pollution in 2019 out of which 16.7 lakh people died in India alone, making it the second highest after China where 1.85 million died due to air pollution, according to the report.It also said in 2019, toxic air caused 60 per cent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease deaths, 43 per cent of lower respiratory infection deaths, 35 per cent of ischemic stroke deaths and 32 per cent of lung cancer deaths.Just five states — Uttar Pradesh (3.5 lakh), Maharashtra (1.39 lakh), Bihar (1.26 lakh), West Bengal (1.23 lakh) and Rajasthan (1.13 lakh) — account for half of the deaths due to air pollution in 2019.Noting that these five states have multiple sources of pollution, Kamal Narayan Omer, CEO, Integrated Health and Wellbeing (IHW) Council said while Maharashtra, Rajasthan and parts of Uttar Pradesh are heavily industrialised with poor adherence to regulatory norms, Bihar, West Bengal and parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh are agrarian where use of diesel is high due to subsidies. He said as a country that is home to 22 of the world's 30 most polluted cities, India has a cause to worry about increasing lung cancer incidence in the country. "The pandemic has given us an opportunity where the advantages gained in decades can be gained in the next few years. We must leverage it in every possible way. It is time people take the charge. "Simple steps such as clearing their own garbage and keeping surroundings clean, segregating garbage at home, reducing use of plastic, consuming responsibly and recycling and reusing old materials are some of the ways small changes can happen that will lead to a big impact," he said.Dr Swarupa Mitra, Senior Consultant and Chief of Gynecological and Genitourinary Radiation Oncology at Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre (RGCIRC) said a continuous increase in the number of pollutants in air, water and soil are reasons for the rise in cancer cases in the country. "Cancer is caused by mutated genes. These pollutants could potentially cause cancer by either causing defects in the DNA repair or altering the immune response or by sparking inflammation and new blood vessel formation."Benzene, Asbestos, Vinyl Chloride, Cadmium, Nitrates, Coal tar, tobacco smoke and industrial smoke are some of the known pollutants that are carcinogenic and can cause cancer,” Mitra said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/environment-day-climate-change-toxic-air-remain-issues-of-deep-concern-for-india-say-experts-263893

05-06-2021||Kochi||Coastal areas in Kerala will witness increasing sea surge in coming years: Experts||Marine experts on Saturday warned that coastal areas in Kerala will witness an increasing trend of sea surge in the coming years due to rise in sea surface temperature.They were speaking at a webinar organised by the Kochi-based Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) as part of observing World Environment Day today.Voicing concern over the calamities faced by the coastal community due to high waves and sea erosion, the webinar sought restoration of coastal vegetation laying emphasis on mangrove forestation, which, according to the experts, act as bio-shield to the coastal belt in protecting the lives of residents in the region.The webinar pointed out that the entire Kerala coast recently witnessed 'storm surge' during the two cyclonesTauktae and Yaas, a CMFRI release said here.Experts are of the view that such storm surges are likely to occur in the coast increasingly in coming years with the rapid warming of the waters in the Indian Ocean, according to the release.Cyclonic winds help form storm surge in the waters which results in high waves, sea erosion and flooding in the coastal hamlet. This was evidently seen recently, especially in coastal areas like Chellanam, they said.Kerala's coastal region could be protected from the wrath of the sea to a great extent through restoration of mangroves and other biodiversity in the region, CMFRI Director Dr A Gopalakrishnan said."Conservation of coastal biodiversity, which is in deterioration owing to many reasons including constructions, is the best long-term natural option for protecting the lives of coastal people from sea turbulence," he said, adding that mangroves act as a model bio-shield to the coastal stretch."A recent study revealed that mangroves protect coastal wave actions and severe surges based on observations done in Mumbai coastal region. There are lots of ideal areas along the coastal stretch in Kerala which can be conserved for mangrove forestation,"  Gopalakrishnan said.The webinar, which was attended by leading experts from the country who work on mangroves, recommended that restoration of coastal vegetation along the Kerala coast should be planned in a social forestry concept with public participation.Feasibility studies are required for identifying potential areas for mangrove forestation, it proposed.The webinar also suggested awareness programmes among different stakeholders to build a bio-green belt along the coast aimed at protecting the residents in the area.Participants included Dr N Vasudevan, Managing Director of Forest Development Corporation, Maharashtra, PP Pramod, Chief Conservator, Forest Eastern Circle and Custodian, Vested Forest, Kerala, Dr R Ramasubramanian, Director of Coastal Systems Research Programme at M S Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai and Dr Grinson George, Senior Programme Specialist at the SAARC. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coastal-areas-in-kerala-will-witness-increasing-sea-surge-in-coming-years-experts-263887

05-06-2021||New Delhi||BJP props up Union Minister Hardeep Puri to take on Amarinder Singh over vaccine row, farmer protest||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday launched Union Minister Hardeep Puri to take on Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on issues related to Punjab, including “diversion” of Covid vaccines to private hospitals and farmers' agitation against the three central farm laws.Puri, who ripped into the Punjab government claiming that private hospitals in Mohali charged Rs 3,200 and more for a Covid shot that cost much less, also took on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his persistent attacks against the Narendra Modi government with the “where is the vaccine of our children” charge.Stating that “vaccines sold for profit in Punjab were for the 18-44 age group population,” the union minister told Rahul Gandhi that “vaccines for children are being thrown in garbage in Rajasthan and used for profiteering in Punjab”, the two Congress ruled states. There have been allegations of vaccines being “dumped” in dustbins in health centres in Rajasthan. The BJP has also accused the Ashok Gehlot government of “wasting” vaccines, a charge Rajasthan denied.Referring to Punjab Health Minister’s statement that “he was not in charge of vaccines”, Puri wondered who then took the decision and why it was rolled back.  “Why did the government roll back the decision if nothing was wrong with it? Why did the Health Minister say he does not have control over vaccines? Was there an arrangement between the Punjab government and hospitals,” he wondered, adding that he was not raising these questions as a union minister but a ‘karyakarta’ of the party from Punjab.The minister said it was “shameful” that the Punjab government was trying to profit from vaccines meant for people. “When we raised it, the Captain said to withdraw the order, which means it was fishy. Why was the decision taken in the first place?” he said.Puri said as per Punjab government officer and in-charge of Covid-19 vaccination, Vikas Garg, 4.29 lakh doses of Covishield were procured at Rs 13.25 crore, an average amount Rs 309 per dose while 1,14,190 Covaxin doses were procured at Rs 4.70 crore, averaging to Rs 412. If these figures are true then the real amount of profit is not just Rs 2.40 crore, he said.Quoting the Garg’s order, he also questioned how the government is planning to get back the vaccines already administered. The letter signed by Vikas Garg said it “has not been taken in the right spirit and is hereby withdrawn”. It also said that “private hospitals should return forthwith all the vaccine doses available with them. The doses which they have utilised as of date should also be returned once they get supplies from the manufacturers. Puri also slammed Congress for opposition to the three central farm laws and the Central Vista project. The union minister said that the “pro-farmer” Modi government had agreed to all demands by farmers and taken several steps, including DBT on MSP, for their benefit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-props-up-union-minister-hardeep-puri-to-take-on-amarinder-singh-over-vaccine-row-farmer-protest-263880

05-06-2021||Kolkata||MP Abhishek Banerjee appointed national general secy of TMC||TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Saturday elevated her nephew and MP Abhishek Banerjee as the party's all-India general secretary, the second-most important post in the organisation, a senior leader here said.Addressing a press conference here, TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee stated that the working committee has zeroed in on a new policy, under which one person in the party can hold one post, and the decision has been duly ratified by the core committee members."As the party chief, Mamata Banerjee has made MP Abhishek Banerjee the national general secretary of the All India Trinamool Congress," Chatterjee said, following two back-to-back organisational meetings, which was also attended by political strategist Prashant Kishor as an invitee.Kishor was hired by the ruling party as its adviser for assembly elections.The elevation of Abhishek, who is often referred to as the possible successor to Mamata Banerjee in the party, assumes significance as he happened to be the focal point of multiple attacks by the BJP's top leadership during poll campaigns in the state.The 33-year old leader emerged as the number two in the TMC in the run-up to the elections, turning out to be the most prominent campaigner after the supremo, often locking horns with BJP leader and the current Leader of Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, who was a former minister in the Mamata Banerjee cabinet before he switched sides ahead of the polls.The Diamond Harbour MP and Adhikari continue to hurl stinging barbs on one other."We thanked Mamata Banerjee in the meetings for the way she led the election campaigns, addressing 150 to 160 public meetings despite her injury," Chatterjee said.Banerjee had suffered an injury in her leg during electioneering in Nandigram, where Adhikari, however, managed to defeat her by over 1,900 votes.She is likely to contest bypoll from home turf Bhawanipore to get elected to the state legislature.Several other changes were made in the organisation on Saturday, with MP Kakali Ghosh Dastidar being made the women's wing chief, and actor-turned-politician Sayoni Ghosh the youth wing president - a post earlier held by Abhishek.Kunal Ghosh, a spokesperson for the TMC, has been appointed as the general secretary of the party's state committee, Chatterjee said.Similarly, South Kolkata MP Mala Roy has been made the president of TMC's "Banga Janani Bahini".Ritabrata Banerjee, a former CPI(M) Rajya Sabha MP who joined the Mamata Banerjee camp after being expelled by the Marxist party, will head the TMC's state labour wing.Veteran leader Purnendu Basu will helm the Khet Mazdoor cell of the party, and filmmaker Raj Chakraborty has been made TMC cultural cell president.Apart from that, Ashim Majhi, Ashish Chakraborti, Becharam Manna, Arjun Ghosh and two others have been nominated as secretaries in the party's state unit.Chatterjee further clarified that the party did not hold any discussion on turncoats, who had crossed over to the BJP before the polls, and were now willing to rejoin the camp."The issue was not discussed, party chief Mamata Banerjee will take a call on that later," he said.Several leaders, including ministers and local-level functionaries, who had made a beeline for BJP membership ahead of the polls, have now queued up again to return to the TMC fold - prominent among them being former MLAs Sonali Guha and Dipendu Biswas.A few others have also been sending feelers to the TMC leadership about their eagerness to return.Abhishek's visit to a city hospital recently to meet BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy's wife, and effusive praise of the TMC MP by the saffron party leader's son have given rise to speculation about a possible change in equation.Mukul Roy, once the national general secretary of the TMC, was removed from the post in February 2015. Senior leader Subrata Bakshi then replaced him.Senior ministers, including Firhad Hakim and Jyotipriyo Mallick, attended the TMC working committee meeting during the day, which was chaired by its supremo.Later, a virtual meeting was held among the party's core committee members, which also saw the presence of organisational leaders, MPs, MLAs and district-level leaders.Chatterjee said that the leaders during the meetings have decided to demand abolition of GST on vaccines and free-of-cost inoculation for all.He also said that more changes in the district-level leadership are in the offing."The party has decided to work towards gaining foothold in other states," the senior TMC leader added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-abhishek-banerjee-appointed-national-general-secy-of-tmc-263875

He gave me a study table, food, and medicines for my mother, who has recently tested positive for Covid-19. My father doesn't earn much, and we are always reeling under financial crisis. This aid sent by our CM will definitely solve some of our problems."Her father Uttam Das, who works at a private firm, said he was not aware that her daughter had sought help from the chief minister."I was awestruck when a few men from the Chief Minister's Office arrived at our home with a study table for my daughter, medicine for my wife, groceries and food packets.I can't thank the CM enough," he stressed.Sanjay Mishra, the chief minister's media adviser, said Deb is "very active" on social media, as he believes it to be an effective channel to reach out to people."This is not the first time that the CM has responded to any request on social media.

05-06-2021||Mathura||One suspected cattle smuggler killed, five injured in attack by villagers for firing at them: Police||A 50-year-old man was killed, and six others were injured when they were allegedly attacked by unknown villagers for firing at them on being intercepted with a cow-laden truck on the suspicion of being cattle smugglers, police said on Friday.The incident occurred near Tumaula village under Kosikalan police station in Mathura district in the wee hours on Friday when the villagers intercepted a mini-truck carrying six cows and passing by their village road, police said on Saturday.The occupants of the vehicle, however, opened fire at villagers in a bid to drive away, but hearing the gunshots, more people joined the villagers and attacked the alleged cattle smugglers, killing one of them and grievously injuring six others, police said.After coming to know of the early morning incident, the police reached the spot and rushed the injured persons to a hospital, where they are still undergoing treatment.The man killed in the attack was identified as Shera, a resident of Arnia village in Bulandshahr district, while the injured included his son Titu.The five other injured persons were identified as Anish, Rahman, Shahzad, Qadeem and Sonu, all belonging to Bulandshahar district, police said.They said the seven were suspected to be taking cattle from Bulandshahr to Mewat village in Rajasthan via Aligarh and were passing by Tumaula village in Mathura district, avoiding police pickets on main roads, police said.After reaching the crime spot, the police also seized some firearms, besides the truck, and sent all the cows to a cattle shelter in the district.Following the incident, the police registered two counter cases—one on the complaint of Titu, the slain man's son, and another on the complaint of Tumaula resident, Baba Chandrashekhar—, police said, adding they are investigating the matter.No arrests have been made so far in the case, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-suspected-cattle-smuggler-killed-five-injured-in-attack-by-villagers-for-firing-at-them-police-263861
05-06-2021||Jaipur||Environment Day: Tree ambulance in Jaipur working relentlessly for past 7 years to save sick plants, trees||Unnoticed by the public, a tree ambulance in Jaipur has been working relentlessly for the last seven years to serve the needs of plants and trees.As the world celebrates Environment Day on Saturday, the efforts taken by two people years ago are an inspiration for many and prove once again that even small steps count to bring a change in the climate.Now, a group of over 100 volunteers, known as "Team 10" in Vidhyadhar Nagar area here, has planted about one lakh saplings and is taking care of about three lakh trees, without any financial assistance from the government."Though we are a registered society, we have not taken any funding from the government for the cause. My friend Gopal Verma and I started the initiative seven years ago, which has grown into a network of people ready to work to save the environment," Sushil Agarwal, a timber-merchant, told PTI. "As more volunteers joined the group, I used my car as a tree ambulance to carry spades, a water tank, termite killer, manure, etc," he said.Agarwal, 53, said he is working on his dream to make Vidhyadhar Nagar as one of the greenest and cleanest areas of the country."I have travelled to 34 countries and have noticed that India is far ahead of other countries, but people here lack civic sense. It is we who have to decide what we want to give to our future generations—a lot of money or a healthy environment to live in," he said.The group registered as Arpan Lok Vikas Samiti bears about Rs 2 lakh monthly expense for taking care of trees spread in 10-11 square km area with the help of donors.Agarwal said the team gathers at 5.45 am every single day at a selected location to carry out its activities for two to three hours.He said activities are now not confined to planting and saving trees but cleanliness drive, wall beautification work are also carried out by them.The team has put 500 cemented dustbins in the area and guarded trees to make their locality stand apart. "It's not that we want to limit ourselves to a particular area. We are ready to help, but we need active people ready to work consistently," Agarwal said.The team uses a clay pot irrigation system to save water as well as maintain moisture in trees. "We use 16 to 17 water tankers every day to water trees. The clay pot technique helps in maintaining a seven-day supply to a tree, after which we fill it again. We use a drip irrigation system where we have a water connection facility," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/environment-day-tree-ambulance-in-jaipur-working-relentlessly-for-past-7-years-to-save-sick-plants-trees-263853
05-06-2021||Washington||US lawmakers hail move to send Covid vaccines to India, other countries||Top US lawmakers have applauded the Biden administration for its decision to distribute 2.5 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines to India and other countries and urged him to take all necessary measures to ensure their equitable administration across the world.US President Joe Biden on Thursday announced that the US will allocate 75 per cent - nearly 1.9 crore of the first tranche of 2.5 crore doses -- of unused Covid-19 vaccines from its stockpile through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme to countries in South and Southeast Asia as well as Africa.The move is part of his administration’s framework for sharing 80 million (8 crore) vaccines globally by the end of June.India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu had said India will be a significant recipient of US vaccines as India has been included in both the identified categories in the allocation announced today- direct supply to neighbours and partner countries, and under the COVAX initiative.In a tweet, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith said as India fights its Covid-19 crisis, it’s important to continue to share extra US vaccines to help its friend and important ally.“A return to normalcy and an eventual end to this brutal pandemic will require some global cooperation,” Hyde-Smith said.Senator John Cornyn, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus said, “I applaud the Biden Administration’s commitment to getting Covid-19 vaccines to countries that need them most.”   “As Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus, I believe this is an excellent opportunity to help India respond to their current, dangerous surge,” Cornyn said in a tweet.Congressman Dwight Evans said he supports Biden’s plan to send vaccine doses to India and other countries.Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who was recently engaged in discussions with the Indian-American community in Houston over the devastating Covid-19 conditions in India, applauded Biden for the step.The Democratic Congresswoman from Texas urged Biden to increase vaccines and medical equipment to be sent to India as soon as possible, including providing any necessary waivers that did not happen in the last administration.“India is a close friend and our strategic partner. As India had assisted the US during America’s pandemic last year, I urge the Biden Administration to add to its very positive efforts to immediately send surplus vaccines and supplies to India to deal with the devastation of Covid-19 in India,” Jackson-Lee said.“We are all grateful for the vaccines the current administration has already delivered, and thanks again to our local Indian American leaders!” she said. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, a member of the Indian-American Caucus, urged President Biden to take the necessary steps to address the deadly second wave of Covid-19 in India.“Medical supplies and surplus vaccines are needed to get this virus under control across the globe,” he said.Meanwhile, about 40 lawmakers, led by Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi along with Congressman Tom Malinowski, on Friday wrote to President Biden, urging him to take all the necessary measures to ensure equitable administration of Covid-19 vaccines across the world.Other signatories to the letter include Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna.In the letter, Members of Congress called on the White House to take five specific measures — from financial investments to diplomatic efforts — to achieve the goal of a rapid and equitable vaccination programme while mitigating Covid-19 globally.The letter is being sent ahead of the G7 Summit and at a moment in which wealthy countries have administered more than 80 per cent of global vaccines while low-income countries have received just 0.3 per cent.“We urge you to pursue additional steps to advance a bold, comprehensive strategy to vaccinate the world as quickly as possible,” said the lawmakers.“It is imperative that the United States act quickly and deploy every tool in our arsenal. Now is the time to build international cooperation and solidarity in ways we have never seen before, including using the full force of United States diplomacy, economic and commercial leadership, legal authorities, and membership in multilateral institutions.“The fate of our own health and safety in the United States is inextricably connected to the wellbeing and protection of the most vulnerable among us worldwide,” they wrote.The lawmakers urged President Biden to ensure the immediate release of the 80 million doses of the vaccine which the government plans to share with the world, allocating the committed doses based on where surging numbers are greatest while also reassessing our stockpile of vaccines to release even more vaccines immediately to countries around the world.In the letter, the lawmakers urged Biden to convene a global vaccine summit with world leaders to spur cooperation and coordination in the development, production and distribution of vaccines; encouraging research transparency, open access, and global collaboration in engineering and manufacturing with a goal of accelerating universal vaccination.The coronavirus has claimed over 3 million lives across the world so far. There are 1,72,468,843 confirmed infections due to the deadly virus globally, according to Johns Hopkins University coronavirus data.

05-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi to set up genome sequencing labs, paediatric task force to prepare for third Covid wave: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced the setting up of a paediatric task force and two genome sequencing labs as well as a plan to ramp up oxygen capacity to prepare for a possible third Covid wave that could peak at 37,000 cases a day.The government will also create a buffer stock of important medicines, Kejriwal said at an online briefing.The two genome sequencing labs to identify variants of the virus attacking the city will come up at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital and the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), the chief minister said.He said he held a six-hour meeting with officials and experts on Friday to prepare a comprehensive plan for a third wave of the coronavirus.In case the number of daily infections hits 37,000 during the third wave, the government will be prepared.“At the peak of the second wave, 28,000 cases were reported in one day. On the basis of our consultation with experts, we are assuming that during the peak of the third wave, there might be 37,000 cases. Keeping this number in mind, we will ramp up our beds, oxygen capacity and medicines,” he said.The government is buying 25 oxygen tankers and putting up 64 oxygen plants in the next few weeks to ensure Delhi doesn’t face another oxygen crisis as it did during the second wave, he said.“Delhi is not an industrial state and doesn’t have its own tankers but we are buying 25 tankers in order to prepare for the third wave.”      “We are creating an oxygen storage capacity of 420 tonnes to tackle the possibility of another oxygen crisis. We have spoken to Indraprastha Gas Limited and asked them to create a 150-tonne oxygen production plant,” the chief minister added.The government will also be setting up a separate paediatric task force to give recommendations on protecting children during the third wave.Based on their advice, the government will set up ICU and oxygen beds, and procure specific equipment for children, he said.Besides, the government will also create a buffer stock of important medicines and private hospitals will also be given instructions to do so, he said.“We will create a team of doctors and experts to assess which medicines are required for coronavirus. If they inform us about a particular medicine being effective in the treatment of the virus, we will try and procure it. In case they say a medicine does not help in the treatment, we will make people aware about it,” he added.On May 27, the Delhi government set up a 13-member committee to prepare an action plan for a possible third wave after assessing the current status and projected requirement of health infrastructure such as hospitals, oxygen plants and drug supplies.Another eight-member expert committee was set up to devise a strategy for mitigation and management of the third wave.Delhi has been reeling under a brutal second wave of the pandemic that has swept the country and claimed a massive number of lives. The acute shortage of oxygen at various hospitals added to the crisis.  From April 19, both daily cases and the single-day death count rose sharply with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20. This went up to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths, according to official data.The number of cases has shown a downward trend and the positivity rate too has been shrinking in the last several days. The number of deaths per day, has also been showing a decline in the last couple of days.

05-06-2021||United Nations||US, India, China account for 60 pc of 2 billion Covid vaccine doses distributed globally: WHO||Of the two billion Covid-19 vaccine doses distributed globally till now, about 60 per cent have gone to just three countries, the US, India and China, a senior adviser at the World Health Organisation said.Senior Adviser to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Bruce Aylward made the comments at a press briefing on Friday.“This week, we will see over two billion doses… we will probably pass the two billion doses… landmark in terms of the number of doses of the vaccines and new COVID vaccines that have actually been developed. These have been distributed now in over 212 countries,” Aylward said.“If we look at that two billion doses, over 75 per cent of it has gone to just 10 countries. And, in fact, three countries -- China, the US and India -- account for about 60 per cent of those doses,” he said.He said while COVAX has played an important role in distributing the Covid-19 doses to 127 countries and getting several countries to start their vaccination drives, the challenge is in the access to the vaccines.He said the 60 per cent of the two billion doses that have gone to China, India and the US are “all domestically procured and used”.Aylward noted that “at the other end of the spectrum”, only about 0.5 per cent of doses globally have gone to the lowest income countries that account for about 10 per cent of the world’s population.“And even if we look at the lower middle income countries, it’s only fractionally higher than that in terms of the coverage that we’re getting. So we’re increasingly seeing a two-track recovery and rollout of the vaccines,” he said.While there is high vaccine coverage deep into the high risk populations and younger populations in high income countries, “we are still struggling to get sufficient product just to be able to vaccinate the health care workers, older populations” in low income countries “who are really the key to getting out of the health, societal and economic crisis that we are in the midst of.”           Aylward said about 80 million doses have been distributed through COVAX so far and the global alliance for equitable vaccine distribution is about 200 million doses behind where it should be due to the disruption in COVAX supplies as a result of the devastating second wave in India.“The problem now is the supplies are being interrupted. We’re having disruptions because of the problems in India and others and having trouble filling that gap. And as a result, the countries are having trouble getting momentum and getting started well.“We saw how long it took to get the scale up of vaccines in high income countries. It takes a consistent supply of vaccines. So this is the crucial piece that we’ve got to fix in the next two months if we are going to be on track to get out of the pandemic,” Aylward said.He added that through COVAX, “we’ve distributed just about 80 million doses at this point. We’re about 200 million doses behind where we want to be because of the interruption of supply out of India because of the need to redirect them there. And also because of the challenge that we’re having getting other manufacturers to scale up and come online early enough, such as the Johnson and Johnson product.”     He said while there are commitments in principle of about 150 million doses to be donated through COVAX, there are two big problems with that.“Number one, very little of it is committed for the June-July period, which means we’re going to still have this gap. The other problem is just the volume. If we are going to get on track to get at least 30-40 per cent of the world vaccinated this year, we got to get another 250 million people vaccinated between now and the end of September.“We expect India SII (Serum Institute of India) volumes to open up again in the fourth quarter at least,” he said, adding that “countries are going to fail unless they get vaccines early to start rolling out, building community confidence, building their systems. But we’re setting up for failure if we don’t get early doses.”    The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, is the key supplier of AstraZeneca doses to COVAX. However, supply of vaccines from SII to COVAX has been impacted as the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic ravages India.Last month, Ghebreyesus had said that once the devastating outbreak in India recedes, “we also need the Serum Institute of India to get back on track and catch up on its delivery commitments to COVAX.”In response to a question on the situation in India and Nepal, which are seeing devastating surges in Covid cases, he said, “Are we concerned about India and Nepal? Absolutely. We’ve got escalating epidemics in different parts of India still. (It’s) going down overall but some areas are still hard hit.”In Nepal, too, areas are hard hit. “Still real gaps in terms of what they need to be able to save lives in real time, as well as protect people with vaccines so as we look for doses and bringing the doses forward, the goal is to be able to get more doses surged into these places that are being hit, so that we can reduce the risk of death in the face of these escalating outbreaks as well.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-india-china-account-for-60-pc-of-2-billion-covid-vaccine-doses-distributed-globally-who-263820

The Indian Navy wants the vessels to have a technology called air independent propulsion (AIP) which adds to the submergence capabilities, allowing the vessel to remain under water for 12-15 days, much more than the 4-5 days endurance of the existing conventional subs.A foreign manufacturer will tie up with an Indian partner to make these submarines under what is termed as “strategic partnership (SP) model”. This is the first project on which the new ‘SP model” policy is being tried.The DAC, at its meeting on Friday, okayed the move to issue a request for proposal (RFF), in other words an invitation for bids.The RPF will be followed by technical evaluation of bids, cost evaluation and negotiations before a contract is signed.The MoD-owned Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) are the two Indian companies shortlisted to bid for the project. The latter is a private entity and is engaged in making the hulls of the Arihant Class of Indian nuclear submarines.Both bids will reflect their tie-up with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) from the five makers shortlisted by the MoD earlier.The five foreign companies in the race are South Korean company Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, Naval Group of France, Navantia of Spain, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems of Germany and the Rosoboronexport of Russia.India at present has 17 submarines, including one nuclear-powered INS Chakra on a 10-year lease from Russia ending March 2022.The Rs 43,000 crore project for six submarines will be the third make-in-India project from subs. Two submarines from German yard Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) were built by the MDL. These were commissioned in the early 1990s.In 2005, India and France inked a deal to make six submarines. The production started in 2012 at the MDL. The last of the vessels is to be delivered any time now.Meanwhile, the US Department of Defence report — Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020 — talks about a growing threat from China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/decks-cleared-for-six-more-local-made-submarines-263662

Positivity is declining. This has resulted from strong action by way of containment, Covid-appropriate behaviour, generous testing and restrictions. But the situation can again become unacceptable if we reverse our behaviour. When the peak is declining and we suddenly get into the same behaviour as in January, the virus will come back,” Paul cautioned.He said more jabs would be available from June and quoted global data to say that India today overtook the US on the number of people who have received at least one vaccine dose. “In India 17.2 crore persons have received at least one dose. The number is 16.9 crore for the US,” Paul said.SII gets nod to produce Sputnik VThe DCGI has granted permission to the Serum Institute of India (SII) to manufacture Sputnik V vaccine in India for examination, test and analysis with certain conditions, official sources said.Zydus child vaccine on cardsZydus Cadila may seek licence for child vaccine in two weeks, said VK Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog.

Two successive cyclones — Tauktae and Yaas — not only delayed the monsoon in Kerala, but also impacted its current.The southwest monsoon made an onset over Kerala on June 3 against its usual arrival on June 1. The IMD had earlier predicted its arrival on May 31, which it changed later.GP Sharma, chief of meteorology and climate change at Skymet Weather, says Tauktae and Yaas took away “much of the kinetic energy from water bodies, which almost ceased the weather activity in Kerala. The required wind pattern and speed were also absent”.Sushant Puranik from the department of atmospheric and space science at the University of Pune also says Yaas intensified rapidly due to conducive atmospheric conditions, taking away moisture and energy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-back-to-back-cyclones-delayed-monsoon-experts-263407

||Congress not keen on fielding candidate against Mamata||Tribune News Service  Kolkata, June 4 WBPCC chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury is not keen on fielding any candidate against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at Bhabanipur, it seems. Mamata has won the Bhabanipur Assembly seat in 2011 and 2016. After her debacle in Nandigram, Mamata is contesting from Bhabanipur once again.  Though the bypoll date is yet to be announced, Adhir has already announced that the Congress would not field any candidate from Bhabanipur.  The WBPCC chief says after the TMC’s landslide victory, there is no point fielding a candidate against her. However, this is not acceptable to the CPM, which says if the Congress refuses to fight from Bhabanipur, all those voters who are against the TMC will vote for the BJP candidate contesting from the seat.  “That won’t be a welcome development,” CPI(M) Central Committee member Sujan Chakraborty said.   According to the seat-sharing formula decided by the Congress and the CPI(M), Bhabanipur fell in the quota of the Congress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-not-keen-on-fielding-candidate-against-mamata-263408

The measures announced today, in conjunction with other steps taken so far, are expected to reclaim the growth trajectory from which we have slid,” he said, while announcing the decisions of the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).The MPC projected retail inflation at 5.1 per cent for this fiscal, within its target range of 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side, said Das.The MPC kept the interest rate unchanged which means that home and auto buyers who have borrowed on flexible rates will continue availing of the lowest interest rates in two decades.The RBI chief struck a positive note by observing that the “need of the hour is not to be overwhelmed by the current situation, but to collectively overcome it”.Assuring adequate liquidity, Das said the RBI would buy Rs 1.2 lakh crore of bonds under the Government Securities Acquisition Programme (G-SAP) 2.0 in the second quarter.The RBI chief mentioned that a separate liquidity window of Rs 15,000 crore would be opened for the hard-hit contact-intensive sectors such as hotels, tour operators, bus operators, spa clinics and beauty parlours.Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) will be given Rs 16,000 crore in addition to the Rs. 15,000 crore announced on April 7.The Resolution Framework 2.0 for MSMEs announced on May 5 has been expanded to include exposures up to Rs 50 crore as against the earlier Rs 25 crore.The path for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in the debt market has been smoothed with authorised dealer banks permitted to place margins on their behalf for transactions in government securities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-cuts-gdp-forecast-to-9-5-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged-263409

According to this strategy, private sector hospitals are directly procuring Covid-l9 vaccines from the vaccine manufacturers," the letter said."The state government is, therefore, requested to confirm the veracity of this news article and send a clarification to MoHFW immediately in this regard," she said.Under flak from the opposition for "diverting" Covid vaccines to private hospitals, the Punjab government on Friday asked them to return all stock meant for the 18-44 age group.The dramatic turnabout came after opposition parties—Shiromani Akali Dal, Aam Aadmi Party and Bharatiya Janata Party— slammed the Congress government for "selling" to private hospitals doses meant to be administered free."The order of providing one-time limited vaccine dose to 18-44 years age group population through private hospitals has not been taken in the right spirit and is hereby withdrawn," the government note said."Further, it has been decided that the private hospitals should return forthwith all the vaccine doses available with them," Vikas Garg, who is in charge of Punjab's Covid vaccination programme, said in the order.Once they get their own direct supplies from the manufacturers, the private hospitals will also return to the state government the doses they have already used up.Hours before the development Friday evening, state Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said he has ordered a probe into the allegations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-seeks-explanation-from-punjab-government-over-allegations-of-selling-covid-vaccine-to-private-hospitals-263392

05-06-2021||New Delhi||Visas of stranded foreigners extended till August 31||The visas of foreign nationals, stranded in India due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have been extended by the government till August 31 on gratis basis or free of charge.The Union Home Ministry said that due to the non-availability of normal commercial flight operations on account of the pandemic since March, 2020, a number of foreign nationals who came to India prior to that date on valid Indian visas got stranded in the country.Keeping in view the difficulties being faced by such foreign nationals in getting their visas extended due to the lockdown, the Home Ministry had issued an order on June 29, 2020 conveying that the Indian visa or stay stipulation period of such foreign nationals expiring post June 30, 2020 shall be deemed to be valid until 30 more days from the date of resumption of normal international flight operations, on gratis basis.However, such foreign nationals have been applying for extension of their visas or stay stipulation period on a monthly basis, the Home Ministry said in a statement.The matter has now been reconsidered by the ministry in the light of non-resumption of normal commercial flight operations, and it has accordingly been decided that the Indian visa or stay stipulation period of such foreign nationals stranded in India will be considered as deemed to be valid till August 31, 2021 on gratis basis without levy of any overstay penalty, the statement said.These foreign nationals will not be required to submit any application to the FRRO or FRO concerned for extension of their visas.Such foreign nationals may apply for an exit permission to the FRRO or FRO concerned before exiting the country, which would be granted on gratis basis without levy of any overstay penalty, the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/visas-of-stranded-foreigners-extended-till-august-31-263326
05-06-2021||New Delhi||Private jet sent by India leaves Dominica without fugitive Mehul Choksi||India’s multi-agency team that had gone to Dominica to bring back Mehul Choksi is headed back home on a Qatar Airways private jet after the island nation’s high court adjourned the hearing on the fugitive diamantaire’s habeas corpus petition, sources said.Publicly available flight data showed that the jet took off from the Melville Hall Airport in Dominica at 8.09 pm (local time) on June 3 and is travelling towards Madrid.The multi-agency team of officials is also returning, the sources said.The team led by CBI DIG Sharda Raut was stationed in Dominica for nearly seven days to bring back Choksi, who is wanted in the Rs 13,500-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, to India.On Thursday, the Dominica High Court adjourned the hearing on Choksi’s habeas corpus petition.A habeas corpus petition is filed for producing before a court a person who is under arrest or in unlawful detention.It is likely that the next hearing may take place after a month and the businessman will remain in Dominica, local media reported.Judge Bernie Stephenson will decide the next date of hearing after meeting both sides, media outlet Antigua News Room said.The adjournment is to allow lawyers of Choksi and the Dominica government “to agree on the language to be used with respect to the injunction filed to prevent his removal from Dominica”, it said.Thursday’s hearing was conducted through videoconferencing with a group of protesters standing outside the High Court building in Roseau carrying placards with messages seeking to know the truth about the controversy.“Who brought Choksi to Dominica?” read one of the placards, the photo of which was published by many media outlets.The judge had on Wednesday ordered production of Choksi before the magistrate to face charges of illegal entry into Dominica.The 62-year-old wheelchair-bound diamantaire, who has a pending Interpol Red Notice against him, arrived before presiding Roseau Magistrate Court in black shorts and a blue T-shirt from the Dominica-China Friendship Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. His application for bail was rejected.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi had fled India in the first week of January 2018, weeks before the PNB scam rocked the Indian banking industry.The duo allegedly bribed officials of the state-run bank to get Letters of Undertaking (LoU) on the basis of which they availed loans from overseas banks that remained unpaid.The allegedly corrupt bank officials did not enter these LoUs in the core banking software of PNB, thus evading scrutiny. The non-payment of these LoUs or bank guarantees worth Rs 13,500 crore resulted in default and became a liability on the bank.Choksi had mysteriously gone missing on May 23 from Antigua and Barbuda, where he has been staying since 2018 as a citizen since he fled Delhi.He was detained in neighbouring island country Dominica for illegal entry after a possible romantic escapade with his rumoured girlfriend.His lawyers alleged that he was kidnapped from Jolly Harbour in Antigua by policemen looking like Antiguan and Indian and brought to Dominica on a boat.Modi escaped to Europe and was finally held in London, where he is contesting his extradition to India. Choksi took the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-jet-sent-by-india-leaves-dominica-without-fugitive-mehul-choksi-263277
