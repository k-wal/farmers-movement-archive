We have a window period of 6-8 months to immunise everybody in the country. In the coming days, our target is to administer 1 crore doses every day. It is important that people come forward proactively and take the vaccines—that’s absolutely necessary. There are several rumours, misinformation that is spreading in the country. Similarly, people have some vague fear in their minds. They think there may be some side effect or vaccine may be unsafe,” said Dr Arora.He further said, “Scientifically, we have been looking at adverse events during vaccination, 95-96 per cent people have only mild fever or local pain, 4-5 pr cent people have been hospitalised due to an allergy or some get anxious and they have to be hospitalised but otherwise these vaccines are absolutely safe”.Speaking on Zydus Cadila’s Covid-19 vaccine, AIIMS Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria told ANI: “Zydus Cadila is DNA vaccine. It’s a new platform that is being used. It’s something that we should be proud of. A platform for which research isn’t done in past in our country and now making this new type of vaccine, the data is still being collated and one is hoping that they will be able to submit the data to the DCGI for regulatory approval. So, one is hopeful and that will depend on the company that how quickly the company is able to collate the data and give it to the regulatory authority”.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday applauded the country’s commendable momentum on the vaccination front and urged the nation to overcome vaccine hesitancy.Addressing the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme, PM Modi said that India achieved a historic achievement by vaccinating more than 86 lakh people in a day.“The battle we the countrymen are fighting against corona is continuing, but in this fight, together, we’ve achieved many an extraordinary milestone! Just a few days ago, our country accomplished an unprecedented feat. On June 21, when the new phase of vaccine drive began, more than 86 lakh people made a record of receiving free vaccine doses in a day,” he said.He talked to two villagers of Dulariya village in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh who informed about vaccine hesitancy being spread in their village through social media. PM Modi urged the villagers not to believe in rumours and said, “I have taken both doses. My mother is almost a hundred years old, she has taken both vaccines too. Please do not believe any negative rumours relating to vaccines”. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/zydus-cadila-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-above-12-yrs-expected-by-august-says-ntagi-chief-274901
27-06-2021||Islamabad||Imran Khan calling Osama bin Laden a ‘martyr’ was a ‘slip of the tongue’: Pak information minister||One year after Prime Minister Imran Khan described slain Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as a “shaheed” (martyr), Pakistan’s information minister on Sunday clarified that it was a “slip of the tongue” by his boss.Speaking in Parliament on June 25 last year, Khan said the American forces entered Pakistan and killed bin Laden without informing the government after which everyone started abusing his country.“I don’t think there’s a country which supported the war on terror and had to face embarrassment for it. Pakistan was also openly blamed for US’ failure in Afghanistan,” Khan had said.“For Pakistanis across the globe, it was an embarrassing moment when the Americans came and killed Osama bin Laden at Abottabad...martyred him. The whole world started abusing us after that. Our ally came inside our country and killed someone without informing us. And, 70,000 Pakistanis died because of US’ war on terror,” he told lawmakers, drawing criticism from the Opposition as well as from the media.Bin Laden, then the world’s most wanted terrorist, was killed by US Navy Seals in a covert military operation in the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad in May, 2011.Speaking on Geo News programme Jirga, aired on Sunday, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said, “It was a slip of the tongue. He had clarified it,” the minister said while referring to Khan’s controversial remarks. The controversy surfaced again last week when Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi refrained from calling Osama bin Laden a terrorist in an interview with Afghanistan’s Tolo News. When the interviewer quoted Prime Minister Imran as calling bin Laden a “martyr”, Qureshi said: “Well, again. Out of context. He (the PM) was quoted out of context. And, a particular section of the media pair it up”.          Asked if he would disagree, the foreign minister paused for a while and then said: “I will let it pass,” the Dawn newspaper reported.The leading Pakistani in an editorial noted that Qureshi’s refusal to call bin Laden a terrorist in an interview with an Afghan media outlet is perplexing and defies logic.“There are times to be diplomatic and parry sticky questions. However, this certainly didn’t appear to be one of those instances,” the Dawn said.“Mr Qureshi could have used this opportunity to clearly state that Pakistan considers the late Al Qaeda mastermind a terrorist. However, his non-committal comments sent the wrong message to a global audience,” it pointed out.“Pakistan’s top leadership needs to be absolutely clear when it comes to describing fighters like bin Laden,” the editorial stressed.When asked about Qureshi’s remarks by Tolo News anchor, Information Minister Chaudhry said the foreign minister’s refusal to call bin Laden a terrorist might have had to do with his desire to “move forwards, instead of looking at the past”. The information minister said a clarification had been issued last year by Prime Minister Imran’s spokesperson after his remarks. He emphasised that Pakistan had rendered the most sacrifices in the war against terrorism. “Our position is entirely clear,” the senior leader of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) said, adding that “when our own media exaggerate things then, of course, the foreign [media] will pick them up from local sources”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imran-khan-calling-osama-bin-laden-a-martyr-was-a-slip-of-the-tongue-pak-information-minister-274899
27-06-2021||Kolkata||Saga of a conman who spent his own money to run fake vaccination camps||Debanjan Deb was the epitome of success. The coveted IAS tag behind his name, a blue beacon car to ride on, social media posts which showed him off posing with the city’s power elite at various functions, were all his to flaunt.Earlier this year when a Tagore bust in North Kolkata was unveiled by a local library, the plaque below had a list of dignitaries who were present or were involved in siting the bust. Alongside the inscribed names of a member of parliament, state legislators and other dignitaries, was Deb’s name, with the job description of ‘joint secretary’ to the government of West Bengal.For his classmates at the city’s Taki House school, he was a backbench boy to be proud of.However, when news broke on television channels that Deb was a conman, who had held fake vaccination camps and duped people into believing he was an IAS officer and a top official with Kolkata Municipal Corporation, his friends and neighbours were stunned.Celebrities and politicians with whom he had posted pictures on social media started scrambling to distance themselves from the man.“We used to call Debanjan, Debu. He was a very mediocre student. A timid boy who never got into any mischief.When we heard he had gone up in life, we were happy and proud who could imagine that he had actually transformed into a smooth-talking conman,” Deb’s classmate, in Taki House in Sealdah, who did not wish to be named told PTI.“It seems like a dream which went awry and turned into a nightmare, the classmate added.Now none of his friends or neighbours want to own up to being close to him. He has disgraced us, our school we feel jittery about telling anyone we knew him,” the friend said wryly.His father Manoranjan Deb, a retired deputy collector of the state excise department, has taken to bed in shock and refuses to meet anyone, while neighbours have effectively boycotted the family.Deb completed his graduation in Zoology from Charuchandra college and took admission for a masters degree in Genetics at Calcutta University which he never completed.Things started taking a new turn in 2014 when Deb appeared for the civil services examinations.“Debanjan could not crack the UPSC preliminary examinations but told his parents that he was successful and will be travelling for probationer training,” said a police officer investigating the cases against the 28-year-old conman, which now range from cheating to attempt to murder as his fake vaccination camps have administered injections on some 2,000 people, the after effects of which are yet to be ascertained.Instead of travelling to Mussoorie for his training, Deb went to work with an event management firm and during that stint came out with a few song albums. In 2017, he was back and told his parents that his training was over and he had gained a place in the state secretariat.Last year, after the outbreak of the pandemic, the young ‘IAS officer’ started procuring sanitisers, masks, PPEs, gloves and rented a few rooms at a club in Taltala to run his business.“He had made good profit in dealing in goods and in the process started meeting officers in-charge of several police stations, a few politicians and other influential people,” the police officer said.To build a rapport with politicians and top functionaries he started donating consignments of masks, sanitisers and PPE kits, very often in the presence of a local leader. Invariably he would tell politicians, top bureaucrats and policemen that he was a social worker. Photographs of such functions started appearing on his social media posts, which took care to use the term “public servant” to describe him.However, to the public at large he let it be known that he was an IAS officer, a claim he did not make either on his Facebook or Twitter account.He went to great lengths to establish his identity as a government official, printing fake letterheads and identity cards. Even fake email accounts resembling Kolkata municipal corporation accounts were set up. While KMC uses kmcgov.in, Deb used kmcgov.org.Fake bank accounts too were opened using forged identity cards of Kolkata Corporation officials, which were used to rout payments.He opened a new “Urban Planning and Development” company and set up an office in Kasba where he office to resemble a KMC office.“He not only printed several documents bearing fake KMC logos, he also managed to have made writing pad having the state government’s Biswa Bangla logo as well as holograms of the civic body,” the police officer said.Everything could have continued to run its course for some more time, but for his mistake in inviting actress and TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty to take the anti-Covid jab at one of the free vaccination camps run by him. The actress suspected it was a fake for some reason and alerted Kolkata Municipal Corporation officials, who soon found out that Deb was an imposter and had him arrested.While the police officers investigating him say that they understand his desire to make money through his company or gain a fake social standing by posing as an IAS officer, they are still clueless why he did is “charitable free vaccination camps” spending money out of his pocket in buying anti-biotics which were injected and hiring nurses and doctors for the job.Psychologist Debasish Chakraborty who has studied similar cases, says that there is a category of individuals who are willing to run the risk of getting into serious trouble merely to get a kick out of duping people.“It’s a form of pleasure seeing people giving you respect and attention even through false means. This seems to be true in Debanjan’s case,” Chakraborty told PTI. This seems to have led Deb to appear as a social worker and start Covid- 19 vaccination camps free of cost to all, the psychologist said.“He was not even bothered about the medical risks associated with injecting antibiotics like Amikacin, an antibiotic medication used for a number of bacterial infections. He had become desperate for the fame which was not his,” Chakraborty said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/saga-of-a-conman-who-spent-his-own-money-to-run-fake-vaccination-camps-274897
27-06-2021||Dibrugarh (Assam)||Homeless for 70 years, Mising community people of 2 Assam villages stare at uncertainty||About 12,000 people of the Mising community residing at Laika and Dadhia villages inside Dibru-Saikhowa National Park of Assam, after they were rendered homeless some 70 years ago, do not have access to basic facilities like electricity, drinking water and roads even now.It is a tale of negligence, apathy, and suffering due to inaction of the government machinery, they said.Aranya Kasari, a quadragenarian from Laika, said, “Our children trek for miles and cross a river to reach school. There is no provision of minimum healthcare or drinking water supply. We want to move out of here, the sooner the better.”“We have lived for generations here. I don’t want the next generation to go through the same ordeal. Can you imagine a life without even the basic amenities?”“Electricity or a motorable road in the core area of a park is unthinkable. We don’t even have basic human rights. We are cut off from the rest of the world. There is no TV and we hardly get to read a newspaper,” Pranjal Kasari, a villager of Dadhia, told PTI.The plight of a small group of Mising people, the second largest ethnic community of Assam, dates back to 1950 when a change in course of the Brahmaputra river took place after the great earthquake, rendering 75 households of Murkongselek along the Arunachal Pradesh border homeless.The story repeated itself in 1957 with a total of 90 households in the Aukland area of Rahmaria revenue circle in Dibrugarh district becoming homeless due to river erosion and forced to move out and take shelter in the then Dibru Reserve Forest.These displaced agrarian people who prefer to live by the riverside had crossed the southern bank of Brahmaputra and came to this area surrounded by six rivers—Lohit, Dibang, and Disang on the north and Anantanala, Dangori, and Dibru on the south.Flood erosion thus turned an agrarian community dependent on farming and fishing into forest dwellers.With the passage of time, Laika and Dadhia, the two original villages of the 1950s, have now become six settlements with over 2,600 families of around 12,000 people.However, the problem began in 1999 when the forest was declared as Dibru-Saikhowa National Park making human habitation inside the protected area illegal. Since then, different dispensations such as the AGP, Congress, and the BJP, have ruled the northeastern state but no concrete step has been initiated to rehabilitate them.Narrating their plight, Sewali Pegu from Laika said, the villages remain submerged for months during monsoon when the people depend entirely on government relief measures.“Humans and pigs share the same shelter when the area is flooded,” she added.The Laika-Dadhia Rehabilitation Demand Committee chief convenor Minturaaj Morang said that forced by natural calamities, the villagers tried to settle in other places several times, but had to return heeding to government assurances of proper rehabilitation.“During the peak stage of floods in July 2017, around 1,200 people reached Tarani Reserve Forest in Tinsukia and camped next to a school. About 700 people entered the forest to set up houses, but it ended with the then forest minister Pramila Rani Brahma agreeing to find suitable land for rehabilitating us,” he added.Morang said, another attempt was made in 2020 when the Tinsukia district administration identified 320 hectares at Ouguri in Lakhipathar area for settling the Mising people, but it was later withdrawn after the local Moran community, led by the All Moran Students’ Union (AMSU), opposed the proposed move.Meanwhile, an AGP MLA of the ruling alliance Ponakan Baruah wrote to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on May 24 highlighting the condition of the people and pointed out that at least four attempts have been made to relocate the villagers, but they were not successful.He also said that nearly 600 families are living in different camps for months, but no step has been initiated for their rehabilitation.“During the last part of the Sarbananda Sonowal-led government, 908 families of Dadhia were proposed to be relocated in Adhakona of Harmoty forest range in Lakhimpur, but it was rejected by the villagers as the land was low-lying which remains flooded for 8-10 months.”“Instead they said that they are ready to move to Tinkupani area under Namphai forest or the same Ouguri area with the people of Laika village,” Baruah said.The legislator demanded an immediate solution to the 70-year old problem with proper rehabilitation of people of the ethnic community.When contacted, Baruah said that the previous BJP government had earmarked Rs 10 crore for the rehabilitation, but due to the non-availability of proper vacant land they could not be relocated.In January this year, Leader of the Opposition Debabrata Saikia moved the National Human Rights Commission complaining of “gross injustice” being meted out to many members of the ethnic community allegedly by the state government by way of violation of their land rights and basic human rights.Last year, former Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had directed authorities to rehabilitate the people of Dadhia village in Lakhimpur and the residents of Laika in Tinsukia districts. The rehabilitation proposal was sent to the government on January 8 for immediate in-principal approval.Talking to PTI, social worker Jyotish Patir wondered how the national park was notified in 1999 without taking into consideration the future of people who were living there since 1950.“Our views were never taken into consideration before the decision was made,” he added.With no solution in sight, the villagers have resorted to protesting for years now. More than 2,000 people have been camping at Tinsukia city and holding demonstrations on rotation since December 21 last year to push for their decades-old demand. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/homeless-for-70-years-mising-community-people-of-2-assam-villages-stare-at-uncertainty-274892
27-06-2021||Jaipur||Ashok Gehlot writes to PM, seeks his intervention for adequate supply of vaccines to Rajasthan||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal intervention to ensure an adequate supply of coronavirus vaccines to the state to prevent a possible third wave.In a letter to the prime minister, he said the state has created a capacity to vaccinate over 15 lakh people a day, but the pace of inoculation drive is limited to the extent of supplies received from the Centre.“The daily average of vaccine doses received since the start of vaccination drive for 18 years plus has been 3 to 4 lakh only,” Gehlot said.He said that following Covid-appropriate behavior and vaccination are the only ways to effectively counter the threat of coronavirus.“For ensuring 100 per cent vaccination to prevent the Covid third wave and to ensure that people are able to resume their livelihood-related activities, I urge you to intervene personally and direct the concerned to ensure adequate supply of vaccines for the state,” Gehlot said in his letter.The chief minister said the current Covid situation in the state is relatively better with cases coming down sharply, but also mentioned the second wave had a far greater impact on the state.He said the state has done exemplary Covid management during both the first and the second wave, and added that it is equally or even more important to take steps to prevent the occurrence of a third wave.He also said Rajasthan is among the best performer in the vaccination drive.Over 2.36 crore people have already been vaccinated in the state and it has achieved negative (less than 0 %) vaccine wastage, he added.More than 70 lakh people would be due for their second dose by the end of July, he said, requesting the supply of more doses. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ashok-gehlot-writes-to-pm-seeks-his-intervention-for-adequate-supply-of-vaccines-to-rajasthan-274889

27-06-2021||New Delhi||Small-size, stealth make drones lethal threat for strategic installations: Officials||The capability of drones to evade radar, wreak devastation at strategic installations and transport weapons to terrorists has been a continuous concern for the country’s security establishment, and in a maiden incident, these unmanned vehicles were used to strike an IAF base in Jammu on Sunday, officials said.Pakistan-based terrorists used drones to drop two bombs at the Indian Air Force (IAF) station in Jammu’s Satwari area leading to minor damage to a building and injuring two airmen in the darkness of the night.The defence and internal security matrix of the country has been talking about threats posed by small and remote-controlled unmanned vehicles for the last two to three years with occasional incidents of Pakistan-sponsored armed drones being neutralised by the Border Security Force (BSF), the Punjab Police and other agencies along the India-Pakistan border.A clutch of ministries and departments like that of home, civil aviation, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the IAF have been working on plans and technologies to check and combat such attacks at sensitive civil airports and other facilities.The central police think tank called the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) has also held a few multi-stakeholder national conferences on the subject to find out the most effective methods, both technology-wise and monetarily, to jam and neutralise these threats.“We are still to get the most suitable technology to thwart armed drones along the border. The interceptions made till now has been because of the vigilance of troops on duty,” a senior BSF officer said.He said multiple incidents of arms and drugs carrying drones and quad-copters being flown from Pakistan into the Indian side in Jammu and Punjab have been noticed in the last few years and all of them have been thwarted.However, a senior home ministry officer said that there have been incidents when drones were used for surveillance of Indian border assets and positions. But as soon as they were spotted and reaction mounted, the floaters rushed back to base where either terrorist elements or Pakistan military soldiers could be handling the remote, the officer said.Both the International Border and the Line of Control (LoC) region along Pakistan have had their share of such incidents which have been flagged by the Army.Deep inside the country, the tarmac and the city-side of civil airports are vulnerable when it comes to dropping bombs or surveillance by drones.A proper standard operating procedure (SOP) is in the making with the IAF supposed to be the first responder and the snipers of the CISF and the commando force, National Security Guard (NSG), desired to chip in case of an emergent threat.“We need a comprehensive plan and plan of action to check the menace of drones. Every agency, be it at the borders or in cities or airports, needs to have specific responsibility along with required technology tools,” a senior officer in the security establishment said.“The latest Jammu air force station incident has magnified the challenge,” the officer said.A data estimation study conducted by multiple security agencies in 2019 stated that over six lakh unregulated drones, of various sizes and capacities, are present in the country and any of them can be used for launching a nefarious act by disruptive elements.The agencies are looking at specific anti-drone techniques like sky fence, drone gun, ATHENA, drone catcher and Skywall 100 to intercept and immobilise suspicious and lethal remote-controlled aerial platforms.

27-06-2021||New Delhi||Indian missions working on war footing to get medicines for Mucormycosis: Centre to SC||The Centre has told the Supreme Court that Indian missions all over the world have been working on a “war footing” for sourcing medicines like Amphotericin or additional and alternative drugs for the treatment of Covid related Mucormycosis (CAM) in the country.The Union health ministry, in a 375-page affidavit filed in the apex court on Saturday, responded in detail to the query of an apex court bench about the steps being taken to ensure drug availability for Mucormycosis.It said the projected production of L-Amphotericin B by domestic manufacturers in August is likely to be 5.525 lakh units of injections and in order to maintain equitable distribution, states are given the medicines in accordance with the proportion of their reported caseload.Besides ramping up domestic production facilities of medicines like Amphotericin, the government said it has also issued guidance on the judicious use of the drug, and states and UTs have been required to put in place transparent arrangements for allocation to private and government hospitals.“The drug Amphotericin is available both through domestic production and by imports, and both sources have been ramped up. The capacity and supply have had to be increased manifold in a very short period of time to cope with the surge in demand seen for the first time in May and June 2021.“Further, allocation is being made as an interim measure to enable equitable distribution across states, using patient data of Mucormycosis as reported on the portal created for this purpose by MoHFW (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare),” it said.The affidavit said in order to augment domestic manufacturing, the Centre has been continuously engaging with manufacturers to resolve issues related to raw materials.In this regard, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is playing a critical role in reaching out to various manufacturers abroad, and with the active participation of MEA, several important and critical steps have been taken to augment both domestic production and imports.“It may be noted that vide OM dated 16.05.2021, MHFW had requested MEA to explore all possibilities of sourcing Amphotericin B/Liposomal Amphotericin B injection from abroad through Indian Mission.“Accordingly, MEA has also instructed Indian Missions all over the world to immediately identify additional sources of the drug and alternative drugs for the treatment of Mucormycosis. The said exercise is in process at war footing,” it said.In order to augment domestic production, the Department of Pharmaceuticals and the Drug Controller General of India has actively coordinated with the industry for the identification of manufacturers, alternate drugs and expeditious approvals of new manufacturing facilities, the affidavit said.“The DCGI after consultation with the association of Drugs manufacturers has recently issued manufacturing/marketing permission of Amphotericin B Liposomal Injection to eleven companies so as to augment the production which would be available. Some of such 11 companies have already started producing and some are commencing production from July 2021,” it said.The affidavit also dealt with the availability of Remdesivir and said looking at the sudden increase in demand for the patented drug in April 2021, the central government had made efforts to augment the production by the seven licenced domestic manufacturers.“The domestic production capacity was augmented from 38 lakh vials per month to nearly 122 lakh vials per month with the accelerated approval of 40 additional manufacturing sites by the DCGI (Drug Controller General of India) taking the number of sites to 62,” it said.The government also undertook allocation of the drug to all the states and UTs in a move to ensure fair and equitable distribution for an interim period till production was ramped up and the drug became adequately available in the market, it said.Beginning with the first distribution to states and UTs on April 21, 2021 to the last allocation made on May 23, 2021, the total cumulative allocation of 98.87 lakh vials of Remdesivir was made to them, it said.“Meanwhile, noting the slowdown in the demand of Remdesivir…owing to decrease in the number of active cases and sufficient availability of the drug with States/UTs, allocation by Government of India has been discontinued in the end of May 2021, and states / UTs can purchase as per their requirement from the manufacturers,” it said.Dealing with the availability of Tocilizumab, the Centre said, this medicine is listed in the treatment protocol for the management of COVID 19 patients.“Since the drug is not manufactured in India it is sourced from a company Roche in Switzerland and marketed by Cipla Ltd in India.“Till about March 2021, the demand of Tocilizumab by various hospitals across the country was adequately being met until the sudden spike of COVID cases April 2021 onwards whereby the demand for the drug went up hugely,” it said.

27-06-2021||New Delhi||Priyanka slams Centre over fuel prices, asks how much relief given to people from taxes collected||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday slammed the Centre over rising fuel prices and asked why the government is making the taxes on petrol and diesel a means to “loot” the people.In a Facebook post, the Congress general secretary said that in 2013, when the price of crude oil in the international market was USD 101 per barrel, then the people were getting petrol for Rs 66 per litre and diesel for Rs 51 per litre. At that time, the central government used to charge only Rs 9 per litre on petrol and Rs 3 per litre on diesel, she pointed out.“In 2021, the BJP government is charging you Rs 33 in taxes on every single litre of petrol and Rs 32 on diesel. The BJP government has increased the excise duty on petrol and diesel 12 times,” Priyanka Gandhi said.She said the BJP government has recovered about Rs 4 lakh crore in 2020-21 which is 300 per cent more than the amount collected in taxes on petrol and diesel in 2014.“Despite crude oil prices reaching USD 19 per barrel in the international market in April 2020, the central government did not allow its benefits to reach the people of the country but continued to fill their pockets and those of companies,” Priyanka Gandhi alleged.Even today, the oil prices in the international market are much lower than in 2013 , but this year the government has increased the prices of petrol and diesel more than 50 times, she said slamming the Centre.Petrol prices have hit a century in 135 districts of the country, Priyanka Gandhi said.“Since 2014, the BJP government has collected about Rs 21.5 lakh crore from taxes on petroleum products and in the year of pandemic, when your financial condition was not good, the government has collected about Rs 4 lakh crore from you through tax on petrol-diesel,” she said in her message to the people.The Congress general secretary posed several questions to hit out at the BJP over the rising prices.The question is when the prices of crude oil in the international market were low, why was the benefit not passed on to the people of the country, Priyanka Gandhi asked.She also asked if the increase of more than 300 per cent in tax collection on fuel since 2014 is justified.“The central government has collected 21.5 lakh crore from taxes on petroleum products in seven years, but what did the middle class, poor people, and business class get?” Priyanka Gandhi said.During the times of crisis, about Rs 4 lakh crore were collected from the people in the country from taxes on petrol and diesel but how much of it was spent to provide relief to them in a troubled economic situation, she asked.“Why is the government making taxes on petrol and diesel and their rising prices a means to loot the people of the country?” Priyanka Gandhi said.Petrol price soared past Rs 100-a-litre mark in Bihar after fuel prices were hiked again on Sunday on the back of a surge in international oil rates.Petrol price was hiked by 35 paise per litre and diesel by 25 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.The increase, second in as many days and 31st in less than two months, took rates across the country to fresh highs with Bihar becoming the latest state to see petrol cross Rs 100-a-litre mark.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 35 paise per litre each on Saturday.In Delhi, petrol hit an all-time high of Rs 98.46 a litre, while diesel is now priced at Rs 88.90 per litre.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as value-added tax (VAT) and freight charges.While petrol had crossed Rs 100-a-litre mark in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Ladakh, several towns in Bihar saw that level after the steep price hike. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-slams-centre-over-fuel-prices-asks-how-much-relief-given-to-people-from-taxes-collected-274882
27-06-2021||New Delhi||End Covid-19 vaccine shortage: Rahul to PM Modi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should end the “shortage” of Covid-19 vaccines, which should be available to every citizen, and not make excuses to distract from this important issue.He said this after the prime minister in his “Mann Ki Baat” monthly radio address talked about ending vaccine hesitancy.“The only thing to do is to end the shortage of vaccines. The rest are all excuses for diverting attention,” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi using the hashtag ‘Mann ki Baat’.“Just make the vaccine available to all fellow citizens. Then you can also say your ‘mann ki baat’,” he said in another tweet with hashtag ‘VaccinateIndia’.Hitting back at the Congress leader, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan accused him of spreading “misconceptions, confusion and lies” about COVID-19 vaccines due to which many people were “putting their lives in danger” by refusing to take the doses.“Shame on you Rahul Baba, it is prime minister Narendra Modi who is getting people vaccinated and not you.“The prime minister is providing free vaccines to all the citizens of the country, and you are only spreading confusion.“Due to your lies, many people refused to get vaccines,” Chouhan said on Twitter.Urging people to shed their reservations about vaccines against coronavirus, Modi spoke to residents of Dulariya village in MP’s Betul district, and the chat was aired on ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcast on Sunday.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji today spoke to the villagers in Dulariya village of Betul district who were not getting vaccinated due to confusion. Explained it to them in simple words and the villagers started taking the vaccine,” Chouhan said.While the PM had removed the clouds of confusion about vaccination, the chief minister said Gandhi was “putting people’s lives in danger by lying and spreading misconceptions”.Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh accused the prime minister of doing politics over Covid-19 vaccination.“So much politics in vaccine supply to states to make non-BJP ruled states look bad. Typical of this PM. Says one thing and does exactly the opposite,” he said on Twitter.He tagged a tweet of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot that claimed that Rajasthan has been leading among the states in vaccination.“So far over 2.36 crore people have been vaccinated in the state. The state has developed the capacity to vaccinate up to 15 lakh people per day, but on an average, we are getting 3 to 4 lakh vaccine doses per day,” Gehlot said on Twitter.“I request the prime minister that an adequate number of vaccines should be provided to Rajasthan for all those, whose second dose has been due so that we can prevent the possible third wave of Corona,” he also said.

27-06-2021||Guwahati||Fall in oxygen level kills hundreds of fish in Guwahati pond||Environmental degradation leading to depletion of dissolved oxygen level in a pond has claimed the lives of hundreds of fish in Dighalipukhuri in Guwahati, Assam Fisheries Minister Parimal Suklabaidya said on Sunday.A large number of dead fish were found floating in the waterbody since Saturday night following which the minister had directed officials of his department to visit the site and ascertain the exact reason.After examination of samples of the dead fish and the Dighalipukhuri or long pond in Assamese, the officials found that depletion of dissolved oxygen in the waterbody coupled with high organic load were the causes behind the mass fish deaths.“Fish mortality was due to sudden dip in oxygen level and high organic load in the tank. Departmental officers after examination found that the deaths were not due to poisoning, but because of environmental degradation,” Suklabaidya said.As a short-term measure, the oxygen level of water has been increased by showering water through pumps and boating, he added.The dead fish, numbering hundreds, were retrieved since morning and buried at a nearby spot.The Dighalipukhuri, more than 500 metres long, is located in the Ambari area of the state’s largest city.The origin of this dug-out pond is not clear, with some accounts claiming that it dates from the Mahabharata era, while others maintain that it was dug by Ahom rulers.It was originally connected to the Brahmaputra River, which flows along the length of Guwahati, and had served as a naval yard during the Ahom rule.The canal was later filled up during British rule.Dighalipukhuri, which has boating facilities, is a popular tourist spot in the city. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fall-in-oxygen-level-kills-hundreds-of-fish-in-guwahati-pond-274874

27-06-2021||Ranchi||Dhumkkudiya: A tale of shattered tribal dreams, set to pierce hearts at Cannes||It is a tale of shattered dreams. A tale of the horror experienced and lived out daily by thousands of tribal girls who are trafficked to big cities on false promises.Dhumkkudiya - a Jharkhandi film, based on the true story of a 14-year-old minor, will be screened at the prestigious 2021 Cannes Film Festival on July 12.The director of the film, Nandlal Nayak, a Ford Scholar, folk artist, music composer and former Creative Director for United Colours of Benetton, says he is still haunted by the eyes of the girl on whose real life story he based his movie which has already picked up critical acclaim.In an interview with PTI, Nayak says he slipped into a depression on learning the story of the girl, who inspired the movie. She had run away from a Delhi “Kothi” in a posh locality after being sexually assaulted.Dhumkkudiya, shot at pristine and virgin Jharkhand hinterland over 52 days has already won more than 60 prestigious awards in 84 countries.After winning the American Institute of Indian Studies fellowship Nayak, son of Jharkhand’s well-known folk artist Padmashri Mukund Nayak, had returned to his village to traditional tribal folk music sometime around 2003.“I came to a village in Jharkhand to research and document tribal music... Hindustani music has an alphabetical order system as do other literate communities across the world but our (tribal) music has nothing like that. When I went to research this music of ours ... I saw this 14-year-old girl.”               “Native village people used to come to hear my tales but this child was disinterested, disenchanted. I was intrigued by her silence...She was distracting,” Nayak said. He comforted her and slowly won her confidence. “Finally she opened up and narrated her horrific tale of how she was trafficked and sexually abused before she could understand what was happening. Hearing her tale my entire world crashed like a pack of cards,” the director said.He said after she conceived she was confined to a place and delivered the baby by herself in a bathroom and packed the child into a suitcase. Somehow she managed to escape by taking a train to Ranchi. She changed buses and finally walked several kilometers to reach her village.“I decided to adopt her ... I went to the US for a few months and on my return came to know that she had been sold many times and raped more than 100 times before being killed.”“I went into a depression and left my music research and decided to make a movie instead. I had (before this) worked with the best of movie directors, composers and celebrities, but no one came to support my project,” he said.Nayak said he spent his entire saving of Rs 3.5 crore saving in making the movie but could not succeed.“I had worked with top directors. I had directed Sonali Bose’s film. I had worked with Resul Pookutty who got an Oscar. I had worked with contemporary music director Michael GalassoI but I learnt that when you talk about your existence no one stands with you. I completely failed.”           He said the second attempt in 2010 was also a disaster and he slipped into another depression. “Finally Sumit Agrawal came to my rescue and we made the movie. 30,000 girls were trafficked from Jharkhand in ten years in the name of domestic help. But this is not Jharkhand only. You see Bihar, Bengal, Odisha, North East, the tales are the same. Even in Italy I saw how girls from third world countries are forced into prostitution and here there are middlemen like Budhua who talk of Jal, Jangal, and Jameen but his existence depends on consumer market of girls.”    He said this film is the story of handicapped tribal mentality and every girl can relate to it as they suffer thinking it will come to an end.“We adopted the village Lali. 15-20 km from Namkum in Ranchi and cast 1,200 people who didn’t have any exposure to cameras. I converted the village into a studio. The heroine had no previous exposure to the camera but gave a powerful performance,” he said.The character of the protagonist in the film is played by Rinkal Kacchap and that of the antagonist by Pradhuman Nayak.Rupesh Kumar is the director of photography.Apart from Pradhuman Nayak, an alumni of the prestigious National School of Drama and Rinkal Kachhap, the cast includes Rajesh Jaish, Subrat dutta, Vinod Anand and Gita Guha all renowned artists from National School of Drama.The film is produced by Sumit Agarwal and Nandlal Nayak.“The penetrating eyes of the minor Rishu portrayed by Rinkal Katchhap in the movie, her pain, her ordeal and her silence still rips my heart,” said Nayak, adding that he would find some solace if his film “encourages bringing in stricter laws to regulate employment of tribal girls, to safeguard them from the horrific exploitation many of them are still being subjected to.”—     PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dhumkkudiya-a-tale-of-shattered-tribal-dreams-set-to-pierce-hearts-at-cannes-274869
27-06-2021||New Delhi||Time interval for 2nd Covishield dose for Indian contingent in Tokyo Olympics relaxed: Centre to SC||The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the athletes, sportspersons and accompanying staff of the Indian contingent attending the Tokyo Olympics, students undertaking foreign travel for education and persons working abroad will be administered the second dose of the Covishield vaccine prior to the prescribed time interval (after 28 days but before 84 days).Presently, based on the recommendations of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NÉGVAC), the schedule of Covishield under the National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy is to administer the second dose at an interval of 12-16 weeks (after 84 days) from the date of administration of the first dose.In a 380-page affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on Saturday in a suo motu matter on Covid management, the Centre has said the health ministry has received several representations from students as well as states such as Kerala regarding relaxations for the administration of the second dose of Covishield before the currently stipulated 84-day interval for students going abroad for higher studies.On May 31, the top court had slammed the Centre’s Covid vaccination policy, saying it is “prima facie arbitrary and irrational” to allow the states and private hospitals to charge those in the 18-44 age group while the jabs were offered for free in the first two phases of the nationwide inoculation drive, and ordered its review.In the affidavit, the Centre said, “The various representations request for allowing the administration of the second dose of Covishield for such persons who have only taken the first dose and are seeking to undertake international travel for educational purposes or employment opportunities or as part of India’s contingent for the Tokyo Olympic games, but whose planned travel dates fall prior to the completion of the currently mandated minimum interval of 84 days from the date of the first dose”.The Centre said the matter was taken up at a meeting of the Empowered Group-5 (EG-5) on Covid vaccination, “which has recommended administration of second dose of Covishield prior to the prescribed time interval (after 28 days but before 84 days) to provide full coverage of vaccination and facilitating international travel”.It said this special dispensation will be available to “students who have to undertake foreign travel for the purposes of education, persons who have to take up jobs in foreign countries and athletes, sportspersons and accompanying staff of the Indian contingent attending the Olympic games to be held in Tokyo”.The Centre submitted that the time interval between the two doses of Covishield under the vaccination drive has undergone a series of revisions based on the available and emerging scientific evidence under the overall guidance of the NEGVAC.“From four weeks at the start of the vaccination drive to a gap of six to eight weeks, currently, the interval between the first and the second dose of Covishield is 12-16 weeks in view of the emerging evidence documenting higher seroconversion and protection offered at a longer dose interval,” it said.The Centre further said that the matter was discussed by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), which recommended increasing the interval between the two doses of Covishield to 12-16 weeks.It said the requisite facility on the Co-WIN portal for the administration of the second dose in such exceptional cases will be made available shortly and a separate standard operating procedure (SOP) has been issued for the administration of the second dose of Covishield prior to the prescribed time interval.In the SOP, the Centre has advised that vaccination may be availed in such cases through the passport, which is one of the permissible ID documents according to the current guidelines, so that the passport number is printed on the vaccination certificate.“However, if passport was not used at the time of administration of the first dose, the details of the photo ID card used for vaccination will be printed on the vaccination certificate and a mention of the passport in the vaccination certificate is not to be insisted upon,” it has said.It has further said that wherever necessary, the competent authority may issue another certificate linking the vaccination certificate with the beneficiary’s passport number.“This facility shall be available to those who need to undertake international travel for these specified purposes in the period up to August 31,” it said.“This is to clarify that these SOPs have been issued specifically for Covishield because only the time interval between the two doses of Covishield has been increased from six-eight weeks to 12-16 weeks. The period for Covaxin has remained the same i.e four-six weeks and hence, there was no need for any special dispensation for the second dose of Covaxin. It is also clarified that complete vaccination with Covaxin is also sufficient for foreign travel,” the government has said.With regard to the vaccination of crematorium and panchayat workers, the Centre submitted that crematorium workers (regardless of their employment status of being permanent, contractual, outsourced or manpower working with a contractor with or without any designation), who are engaged in working in cremation grounds, and panchayat workers in rural areas involved in Covid control activities are already included in the “municipal workers group” under the “frontline workers category”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/time-interval-for-2nd-covishield-dose-for-indian-contingent-in-tokyo-olympics-relaxed-centre-to-sc-274867

27-06-2021||New Delhi||Railways improves operating ratio to 97.45 pc in Covid-hit 2020-21||Limited train services for most of the year with no subsidies or concessions and severely tightening of expenses have led to the Railways better its operating ratio to 97.45 per cent in the financial year 2020-21 from 98.36 per cent the previous fiscal, according to an RTI reply.Operating ratio is the amount spent to earn every Rs 100. The lower it is the better. It is used to measure the operational efficiency of any organisation. Higher the operating ratio, lower the financial resources available for expansion and growth.The improvement in the running costs of the Railways means the national transporter was able to lower its expenditure and make up for the shortfall in passenger traffic through revenue generated by freight operations.“Operating ratio for the year 2019-2020 was 98.36 per cent... the operating ratio for 2020-21 has been calculated at 97.45 per cent on a provisional basis,” the Railway Board said in reply to an RTI query by Madhya Pradesh-based activist Chandra Shekar Gaur.A railway spokesperson attributed the improved numbers to the strict monitoring of expenses by the national transporter which, he said, is a “combination of initiatives aimed at maximizing revenue receipts and minimizing controllable revenue expenses”.“The expenditure was monitored and regulated strictly in line with train operations. Investments made in the past seven years in electrification helped the Railways not only save substantially in diesel cost but also helped it to be a more environmentally conscious organisation. “Other expenditure control steps included strict economy and austerity measures, improved manpower planning, better asset utilisation, inventory management, etc. These initiatives were further supported by higher freight revenues,” the spokesperson said.However, the Railways was aided in its austerity measures by the fact that it did not operate the highly subsidised passenger segment in full throttle in 2020-21.Till the end of the year, the Railways ran around 65 per cent trains with no concessions for any category of passengers, with the exception of a few, saving crores. It also saw a sharp decline in pension liabilities with the national transporter making an arrangement with the finance ministry to defer this expense.With the electrification of major routes, the Railways also saved Rs 9,500 crore in traction cost over 2019-20. Similarly, savings of Rs 4000 crore were done through rationalisation and optimisation of duties.The Railways also saved Rs 3,000 crore last year as compared to 2019-20 by rationalisation and optimization of contracts and procurement of goods and services.“Other revenue-enhancing measures, inter alia, include targeting progressively higher traffic throughput, expansion of commodity basket, effective and innovative marketing strategies to capture more traffic by business development units at all levels, optimum utilisation of existing rail infrastructure, including rolling stock, enhancement in productivity and efficiency and focus on increasing the share of non-fare revenue sources in Railways’ total revenue,” the spokesperson said.With passenger carrying trains restricted, the Railways reported record freight loading in 2020-21 despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to negative growth in loading during the lockdown.Freight loading in 2020-21 stood at 1,232.63 million tonnes, up 1.93 per cent over 1,209.32 million tonnes the previous financial year, the Railway Ministry said.During 2020-21, revenue from freight loading for Indian Railways stood at Rs 1,17,386 crore, which is 3 per cent higher compared with Rs 1,13,897.20 crore in 2019-2020.

27-06-2021||Ballia (UP)||Another BJP leader criticises Covid handling in UP||Criticising the handling of the Covid-19 crisis in Uttar Pradesh, a ruling party leader has claimed that at least 10 people died in every village during the second wave as no lessons were learnt from the first one.State BJP working committee member Ram Iqbal Singh, who made the remarks on Saturday, is the latest among the party’s leaders who have questioned the management of the coronavirus infection in the state.Speaking to reporters here, Singh said that the Health Department did not learn any lesson from the first wave of Covid-19 which led to a large number of deaths due to the disease in the second wave.“At least 10 people died from every village in the state during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic,” he alleged.The BJP leader also demanded that Rs 10 lakh be given to the kin of those who succumbed to the infection.He lamented that after 75 years of freedom, this district with a population of 34 lakh people has no doctors or medicines.On being reminded that during his visit to Ballia, Chief Minister Adityanath had expressed satisfaction with the arrangements made by the Health Department, Singh said the officials had misled the CM, and the truth was not shown.He also urged the BJP government to give a diesel subsidy to farmers.Earlier in May, BJP’s Sitapur MLA Rakesh Rathore had joined the list of ruling party lawmakers in Uttar Pradesh, expressing resentment over the alleged Covid-19 mismanagement in the state and saying that he feared a sedition charge for speaking up.“What standing do MLAs have? If we speak too much, treason and sedition charges will be slapped on us as well,” Rakesh Rathore had told reporters, according to a video clip.On May 9, Union Labour minister Santosh Gangwar had complained to the chief minister about the situation in his Bareilly constituency, saying officials don’t take calls and government health centres send back patients for ‘referrals’ from the district hospital.In a letter to Adityanath, he had also complained about the “big shortage” of empty oxygen cylinders and the high prices of medical equipment in Bareilly.A day later, BJP MLA from Jasrana in Firozabad Ramgopal Lodhi claimed that his coronavirus positive wife was not admitted to an Agra hospital for over three hours, with officials saying that beds were not available.In April, a ‘confidential’ letter written by UP Law Minister Brajesh Pathak surfaced on social media. Pathak had lashed out at his state’s health authorities, complaining that beds for coronavirus patients were falling short and ambulances took hours to arrive in the state capital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-bjp-leader-criticises-covid-handling-in-up-274853
27-06-2021||Mumbai||Targeting of individuals by central agencies harmful for federal structure: Raut||Shiv Sena Member of Parliament Sanjay Raut said on Sunday that the deliberate targeting of leaders in the ruling MVA alliance in Maharashtra by central agencies was harmful to the country's federal structure. Raut was responding to a query by reporters on the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summoning former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in a money laundering case. Deshmukh was asked to depose before the investigating officer at the ED's office in Mumbai on Saturday in the money laundering case related to an alleged multi-crore bribery-cum-extortion racket, that led to his resignation from the post of home minister in April. However, the NCP leader, whose party shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra, sought a fresh date for appearance before the agency.Talking to reporters, Raut also said Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik's letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray highlighted that the legislator was being unnecessarily harassed by the ED.He said if there are complaints, the state's Economic Offences Wing (EoW) or the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB)  can investigate them."But, central agencies are brought in under pressure to deliberately target...this is out of frustration over the inability to form government here," Raut alleged, and said "this is harmful for the federal structure". Asked about Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis's comment that he would quit politics if he failed to restore the OBC quota in local bodies in the state, Raut said the BJP leader in 2014 claimed he would get quota for the 'Dhangar' community passed in the first cabinet meeting after assuming power. "He was in power for five years, but nothing happened. Whether in power or not, efforts must be taken to resolve issues of the deprived sections of society," the Rajya Sabha member said.Raut said the issue of reservation is for ensuring social equality. "Please don't politicise a social issue. Whether you are in government or opposition, a responsible leader should strive to resolve the issue which the MVA leaders are trying," Raut said. Asked about protests by the BJP and the Congress in different parts of the state on the OBC quota issue, Raut said leaders, in government as well as from the opposition, are expected to behave appropriately at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.Police took action against NCP functionaries for Covid-19 norm violations during an event, Raut said, adding that "everybody is expected to follow rules". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/targeting-of-individuals-by-central-agencies-harmful-for-federal-structure-raut-274846

Our workers helped the needy during the second wave without any trepidation. Many others chose to remain active only on Twitter, quarantining themselves at safe places,” said Nadda.The BJP leader who relishes his connections with the Bihar capital, where he was born and spent his early years, also reiterated the need for reminding the younger generation of excesses committed during the Emergency imposed by the Congress government and the lawlessness that kept Bihar in news when Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi ruled the state for 15 years together.“During Emergency, a mere visit to Jayaprakash Narayan’s house in Kadam Kuan could invite arrest. Our comrades like Ashwini Kumar Choubey (Union minister) faced untold brutalities while in jail. Youngsters of today do not know all this. They should be told about these things, about the sacrifices our generation made for preserving democracy,” said Nadda, who was an active member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in the 1970s.“They must also be reminded of the days under Lalu, when people feared to venture out after sunset and medical practitioners and professionals had begun to migrate out of Bihar fearing the rampant extortion rackets and kidnappings for ransom,” he said.Notably, the RJD and the Congress are old allies and have shared power in the state as well as at the Centre.Mocking the agitations against the new farm laws, the BJP president said, “Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had shared an anecdote that when asked to point out which provisions they find objectionable, the protesters could lay their fingers on none. But they have launched a movement.”     He also urged party leaders to apprise the common public of the work done by the Narendra Modi government for the betterment of farmers, small- and medium-scale industries and every section of the society.He exhorted party workers to put in efforts to ensure the success of the universal vaccination programme against Covid-19 and work with the motto “mera booth- corona mukt, vaccination yukt” (my booth free from corona, fully vaccinated).

The name Lakshadweep in Malayalam and Sanskrit means 'a hundred thousand islands'. India's smallest Union Territory, Lakshadweep is an archipelago consisting of 36 islands with an area of 32 sq km. It is a Uni-district Union Territory and comprises 12 atolls, three reefs, five submerged banks and 10 inhabited islands. The capital is Kavaratti and it is also the principal town.The study published in the current issue of international magazine Elsevier (Regional Studies in Marine Science), has been posted by the Department of Science and Technology on its website. It was conducted on the ten most vulnerable islands of the archipelago and shows that there will be 70 per cent to 80 per cent land loss in eight of the ten islands by 2035. The other two islands will also have a land loss close to 40 per cent."The main problem in conducting the study was that there was neither any 'Tide-Gauge' or 'Water level monitoring system' in Lakshadweep and so we had to depend on the satellite data which was only available from 1993. We also used two best performing climate models - the GFDL Model of USA and Miroc - a Japanese model. With these two models and with the available data we were able to determine the rise of the sea water level in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal," Prasad K. Bhaskaran, a faculty member of IIT-KGP's Department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture and the principal investigator of the project, told IANS over phone."While doing our research we realised that while it had been indicated that the sea level at the 36 islands would rise between .8 mm to 2m by the end of the century, in most islands it had already reached the .78 mm mark. We have projected 70 per cent to 80 per cent land loss in many islands by 2035. There are many small islands in the archipelago that will be reduced to a strip almost. The worst affected will be Chatlat island, where land loss will be over 82 per cent," Bhaskaran said.The study mentions that the rise is much higher in the Arabian Sea than the Bay of Bengal because the latter's salinity is lower because of many fresh water rivers opening into it. Hence, Lakshwadweep islands are at a great risk compared to India's other archipelago, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.It also found that capital Kavaratti will be 70 per cent affected. Deep signs of damage have also been noticed at the islands' lone airport in the southernmost tip of Agatti, which has started getting dangerously inundated."We have suggested that the government take up immediate coastline protection measures by creating artificial barriers and embankments, especially in the Bipra, Minicoy, Kalpeni, Kavaratti, Agatti, Kiltan, Chatlat, Kadmat and Amini islands, to save them from extinction. Since Androth has been projected to be the safest with only a 30 per cent loss to its landmass, the population can be moved there," Bhaskaran said."But this is temporary because the structure can control the erosion of the coastline but it cannot control the rise of the sea level. Naturally the central government will have to think of a new coastal defensive system -- an innovative way to protect the islands from going under the sea," he said, adding that many European countries and some places in the US have developed innovative coastline protection mechanisms and we can also take ideas from them.The study has been conducted by Aysha Jennath, Athira Krishnan, Saikat Kumar Paul, Prasad K Bhaskaran, jointly from the Department of Architecture and Regional Planning and Department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture, IIT Kharagpur, with support from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India under the Climate Change Programme (CCP). — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/major-portions-of-10-lakshadweep-islands-might-go-under-water-in-next-30-years-274837

He was living here in Najafgarh’s Baprolla village, they said.Police said a crime branch team probing the case nabbed Laura from Delhi and he will be further produced before Rohini court for seeking police remand for further investigation.A senior police officer said, “He was found to be involved in the incident at Chhatrasal Stadium here where he engaged in a fight along with others leading to the death of the young wrestler.”  Police said 11 people, including two-time Olympic medallist winner Sushil Kumar, have so far been arrested in connection with the case.Kumar, along with his associates, allegedly assaulted Sagar Dhankar and two of his friends at the stadium on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over an alleged property dispute. Dhankar, 23, succumbed to the injuries later.The police have claimed that Kumar is the “main culprit and mastermind” of the murder and said that there is electronic evidence in which he and his associates could be seen beating Dhankar.Kumar was nabbed on May 23, along with co-accused Ajay Kumar Sehrawat. Till now, he has undergone police and judicial custody of 10 and 23 days, respectively. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-more-arrested-in-chhatrasal-stadium-murder-case-274833
27-06-2021||New Delhi||Delta Plus has more affinity for lung tissues in comparison to other Covid-19 strains: NTAGI chief||The Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 has greater affinity to lung tissues as compared to other strains but it does not mean that it will cause severe disease or is more transmissible, head of coronavirus working group NTAGI Dr NK Arora said.A new viral variant of the coronavirus, Delta Plus, was identified on June 11. It was recently classified as a variant of concern. Till now, 51 cases of Delta Plus have been detected across 12 states, with Maharashtra reporting the maximum cases of this variant.Talking about Delta Plus, chairman of Covid-19 Working Group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) said it has been found that the variant has greater affinity to lung tissues as compared to other strains of coronavirus but clarified that it does not mean the Delta Plus variant will cause more severe disease or is more transmissible.“Delta Plus is having greater affinity to mucosal lining in the lungs, higher compared to other variants, but if it causes damage or not is not clear yet. It also does not mean that this variant will cause more severe disease or it is more transmissible,” Arora told PTI in an interview.He said the impact of the Delta Plus strain will become clear only as more cases are identified but it appears that the disease is generally mild in all those who have got either single or double dose of the vaccine.“We need to keep a very close watch and look at its spread so that it will give us transmission efficiency,” he said.Arora said the number of cases identified of Delta Plus variant may be more as there may be many asymptomatic individuals also—those who do not have any Covid-19 symptoms but they are carrying the virus and spreading it.“But the important point is that our genomic surveillance component has picked it up rightly and early enough. Now what will happen is that states have already been told that it is a variant of concern and it requires action which means that several states have already started making micro plans for the districts where the virus is identified so that their spread can be contained. Obviously, vaccination will have to be increased in these districts,” he said.Responding to a question if the Delta Plus variant can trigger the third wave of coronavirus, Arora said it is difficult to assess that as of now.“Waves are linked to new variants or new mutations so there is a possibility as this is a new variant, but whether it will lead to a third wave it is difficult to answer as it will depend upon two or three things,” he said.“The first thing is we had a ferocious second wave in the last three months and it is still going on, we are seeing for the last 8-10 days the number of cases are stuck at 50,000, while at some places cases continue to come so that wave has not settled down,” he said.He said the second wave will influence the community’s response to another variant and the third wave will depend upon what proportion of the population got infected in the second wave.“If a large proportion is infected then in the next wave people can develop a common cold like illness but may not develop a serious or fatal illness,” he said.“Secondly, another thing that is important is vaccination—the rapidity with which we vaccinate...even single dose is effective and the way we are planning, if we rapidly immunise then possibility of third wave becomes very less because vaccine plus infection plus Covid appropriate behaviour will save us from next wave, mitigate the next wave and the third wave will not be able to cause the damage as was caused in the first two waves,” he added.

27-06-2021||New Delhi||Shed vaccine hesitancy, do not believe in rumours: PM Modi to people||Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly radio broadcast on Sunday made an emotional pitch against hesitancy towards vaccines against the coronavirus.He laced his public appeal against the vaccine-hesitancy and apprehensions by recounting the prophylactic merit of inoculation against Covid disease.He lent substance to his appeal by citing empirical evidence of him and his mother, each availing both the prescribed dosages of the vaccines.Interacting with a tribal of a village in Maharashtra, he urged the public to have trust in country scientists who have developed the vaccines. They should not pay heed to fear mongers, he said.“You know very well…I’ve myself been vaccinated with both doses,” Modi said.“... And my mother is close to a hundred years of age…she too has taken both doses!” “At times, some people develop fever on account of this…but it’s very minor; just for a few hours…See, not getting vaccinated can prove dangerous.”He cautioned not to let the guard drop against Covid-19, saying they mutate in a number of ways like con artist and come via stealth.Lauding the world’s biggest vaccination drive of the Union government, he said that on the launch of the next phase of vaccination campaign on June 21, 86 lakh people were administered vaccine free of cost on a single day. It manifests the country’s strength, he said.He said over 31 crore people have got themselves vaccinated so far.Modi mentioned Weyan village in Bandipora district in Kashmir which has achieved 100 per cent vaccination of the populace above the age of 18 years.Extolling many who have contributed in the fight against the pandemic, he appreciated Taroq Ahmad Patloo of Srinagar, who was infected with corona, and has now converted his houseboat in Dal Lake into an ambulance.Modi stressed on the need for conservation of rainwater.He cited Uttarakhand’s Satchidanand Bharti of Pauri Garhwal village for his public spiritedness on this front.Bharti, a teacher, has created more than thirty thousand water tanks due to which the huge water crisis in the Ufrainkhal area of ​​Pauri Garhwal has come to an end.Modi lauded Tamil language, saying it is the world’s first language and was proud that it is of India.He referred to the forthcoming National Doctors’ Day and National Chartered Accountants’ Day on July 1.Mentioning about the coming Independence Day, he urged people to associate with the ongoing “Amrut Mahotsav” to commemorate the 75th year of country’s Independence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shed-vaccine-hesitancy-do-not-believe-in-rumours-pm-modi-to-people-274814

The sentence fell short of the 30 years prosecutors had requested. With good behaviour, Chauvin, 45, could get out on parole after serving two-thirds of his sentence.Judge Peter Cahill went beyond the 12-and-a-half-year sentence prescribed under state guidelines, citing Chauvin’s “abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty” shown to Floyd.The reaction was subdued as people debated whether the sentence was long enough. The fired white officer was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against 46-year-old Floyd's neck for over nine minutes on May 25 last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-cop-gets-22-yr-jail-for-murder-of-george-floyd-274465

He, however, ruled out repeal of the laws, as demanded by the protesters. “I want to appeal to the unions to end their agitation. The government has already conducted 11 rounds of talks with the farmers. Agricultural reform laws are going to change the standard of their living,” he said.Tomar said a large section of the country was supporting the laws but if the unions had any objection to any provision, the government was ready to “discuss and find a solution to their concerns”.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 unions protesting at various Delhi border points, claimed the farmers were detained in states like Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana during the protests. The farmers were to submit memorandum of demands to the President through Governors.Terming Tomar’s recent statements as “perplexing and contradictory”, the SKM asserted that farmers were not seeking some “meaningless amendments”, maintaining the laws had “fundamental flaws”.Farmers from various parts of Punjab had gathered at the Amb Sahib Gurdwara in Mohali from where they started marching towards Chandigarh in the afternoon. The police used water cannons and even resorted to mild lathicharge to stop the farmers, but they succeeded in entering Chandigarh after breaking through barricades. Carrying flags of unions and raising slogans against the BJP-led government, the protesters, including women and youths, marched towards Chandigarh on tractors and other vehicles or on foot.Led by union leaders, including Manjit Dhaner, Rajinder Singh Deep Singhwala, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ruldu Singh Mansa and Manjeet Rai, the farmers marched till the Madhya Marg light-point where the Chandigarh Deputy Commissioner came to accept their memorandum.In Panchkula, farmers from several parts of Haryana gathered at Gurdwara Nada Sahib and headed towards Haryana Raj Bhavan, forcing their way through a layer of barricades.

Major bar bodies have been demanding resumption of physical court hearings, saying 95 per cent of lawyers were not comfortable with the virtual court system activated since March last year in view of the pandemic.Bar Council of India – which regulates legal profession in the country – had earlier alleged that the legal profession was gradually being attempted to be hijacked by a few blessed lawyers and selected law firms having high level connections and if the virtual court system was allowed to continue, more than 95 per cent of advocates will become brief less.During a panel discussion on the book, the CJI said the issue of poor digital connectivity figured prominently in the two-day conference of chief justices of high courts that he had held recently.The CJI said he has also written to Prasad, who holds the Law and Justice portfolio as well—to evolve a mechanism to help advocates who lost their livelihood due to Covid-19 pandemic and were in dire need of financial assistance. He said legal professionals and associated functionaries should be declared as frontline workers and they should be vaccinated on a priority basis.Speaking on the book, Justice Ramana said, “Through this book, Justice Raveendran undertakes to explain in simple terms, various deficiencies in the law which require to be overcome, so that common man does not lose faith in the judiciary and the legal system.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/digital-divide-cji-writes-to-ravi-shankar-prasad-to-resolve-poor-connectivity-in-remote-areas-274435
27-06-2021||New Delhi||FATF to set sights on environmental crime||The global Financial Action Task Force (FATF), better known for tackling money laundering and terrorist financing, will now turn its attention to ‘environmental crime’, one of the most profitable criminal enterprises, generating around $ 110 - 280 billion in criminal gains each year.  It covers a wide range of unlawful activities such as illegal logging, illegal wildlife trade and waste trafficking.The FATF has called on all countries to assess their money laundering risks related to the illegal wildlife trade and to ensure that there is a robust legal framework to go after the finances of wildlife traffickers, and to pursue financial investigations.These activities can have far-reaching implications for the environment, economy, and public health and safety. The FATF is focussing on the link between environmental crime and money laundering.  This work aims to raise awareness about the financial flows that fuel environmental crime and how they are laundered, FATF Chairman Marcus Pleyer said.The FATF’s work on environmental crime will build on its earlier work on how countries can combat money laundering from the illegal wildlife trade. The illegal wildlife trade is a major transnational organised crime, which generates billions of criminal proceeds each year.One of the most effective ways to identify the broader criminal networks, and take the profit out of this crime, is to follow the financial trails of wildlife traffickers. FATF’s report on environmental crime is expected to be published next month and will inform possible future policy development. The study will identify the common methods used by wildlife traffickers to launder their money.  It will also highlight proposed actions that countries and the private sector can take to combat this trade.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fatf-to-set-sights-on-environmental-crime-274433

She is also suffering from hypertension. The doctor who attended to her said her illness cannot be immediately linked to the fake vaccine as she already had a liver problem,” the sources said.Chakraborty, whose alertness led to the busting of a fake vaccine racket organised by a conman posing as a civic official in Kolkata, was scheduled to undergo a test during the day to ascertain any possible adverse effects of the jab.In a video message on Thursday, she had asked people not to panic.

27-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi oxygen row: AIIMS chief Guleria terms audit report interim, says oxygen needs change from day to day||The apex court audit on Delhi’s oxygen demand is an interim report and not the final word, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said on Saturday as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, under fire for purportedly exaggerating the city’s needs, insisted the acute shortage of oxygen during Covid’s second wave was real. He also appealed for an end to political bickering and for everyone to work together so no one suffers in the third wave.The virus will win if there is a fight among stakeholders, Kejriwal tweeted, a day after his Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP hit out at each other over the report that said Delhi’s oxygen needs were “exaggerated” four times over during the second Covid wave.The five-member Supreme Court appointed panel was headed by Guleria who told PTI, “It is an interim report. The oxygen needs are dynamic and change from day to day. The matter is sub-judice.” While the BJP charged the Delhi government with “criminal negligence” after the report came into the public domain on Friday, AAP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that the “bogus” report was “cooked up” at BJP’s office.“May we work now if your fight over oxygen is finished? Let us together make a system so no one faces shortage of oxygen in third wave,” Kejriwal said in his tweet in Hindi a day later.“There was an acute shortage of oxygen in the second wave. It should not be so in the third wave. Corona will win if we fight with each other. The nation will win if we fight together,” he added.Dubbing the BJP the “Bharatiya Jhagda Party”, his deputy Sisodia said its leaders know only how to have fights and have nothing to do with either oxygen or the third Covid wave.“When the third wave will start, they will be causing fights someplace else...,” he tweeted in Hindi.The report of the Supreme Court constituted sub-group to audit oxygen consumption in hospitals in the national capital during the second wave in April-May said the Delhi government “exaggerated” the consumption of oxygen and made a claim of 1,140 MT, four times higher than the formula for bed capacity requirement of 289 MT.The panel said the Delhi government had made the claims for allocation of 700 MT oxygen on April 30 of medical grade oxygen using a “wrong formula”.Two members, B S Bhalla, Delhi Government’s Principal Home Secretary, Home, and Max Healthcare’s Sandeep Budhiraja, questioned the conclusions.The report has an annexure of communication sent by Bhalla on May 31 in which he said a reading of the draft interim report makes it “painfully apparent” that the sub-group, instead of focussing on the task, delineated from the terms of order of the Supreme Court dated May 6.The manner in which the proceedings of the sub-group were conducted, he said, suggested that the purpose of proceedings was to satisfy a “preconceived and predetermined conclusion and narrative to recommend a lower quantity of LMO to Delhi”. It was also aimed at further portraying an impression that the assessment by the GNCTD (Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi) before the high court and the Supreme Court was “exaggerated or not genuine”, Bhalla added.He objected to the finding of the sub-group that medical oxygen consumption as per actual bed occupancy was 250 tonnes in late April, 470-490 MT in the first week of May and 900 MT as claimed on May 10.“This para should be deleted as it is neither correct nor based on verified data. With the number of new positive cases peaking in the first week of May, and hospital bed occupancy continuing to rise even after that, the Oxygen requirement based on occupancy was around 625 MT at the end of April and 700 MT in the first week of May,” he said.Regarding the finding that the Delhi government made “exaggerated” oxygen requirement claims, Bhalla said the GNCTD clarified that the calculation for 700 MT has been made in accordance with standard oxygen requirement specified by the government of India/ICMR, which is 24 litres per minutes (LPM) for ICU beds and 10 LPM for non-ICU beds.“Doubts about the percentage of non-ICU beds that need oxygen can only be resolved through an actual on-ground audit of hospitals, which the audit sub-group is yet to do,” he said.Budhiraja said in his comments that a decision was taken in the first meeting itself to get actual details of oxygen consumption from all the hospitals of NCT Delhi.“After repeated corrections (as hospital medical Superintendent used a different format), the total calculation of Oxygen consumption (based on actual consumption data of 214 hospitals) came to around 490 MT. This did not take into account, oxygen cylinder refilling and non-Covid requirement of hospitals,” Budhiraja said.He also brought to the notice of the sub-group that he did not attend the May 18 meeting. He said he gave prior information to the group on WhatsApp that minutes of the previous meeting (held on May 15) should be circulated prior to the fixing of the next meeting.“This was never done,” he had said and added that his comment be added in the interim report.Besides Guleria, Bhalla and Budhiraja, the panel comprises Subodh Yadav, joint secretary in the Jal Shakti Ministry, and Sanjay Kumar Singh, controller of explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO).

We saw some people chasing Vinay who was running for his life," said Jyoti, the owner of the building in which the couple were living.Around 9.30 pm on Thursday, the police received a call which said a couple had received gunshots injuries.Vinay received four bullet injuries around his stomach and chest, while his wife Kiran (19) received a wound on her neck, police said.The victims were rushed to Venkateshewara hospital where Vinay was declared brought dead.    Kiran, who tried to escape through the terrace, is undergoing treatment at the hospital."We were having dinner when the incident took place. When I heard the first shot, I thought it was a small cylinder blast. But when the shots continued, I was sure that the bullets were being fired. We were in our house with our children so we closed the doors as we got scared."We did not see anyone go upstairs. Vinay came downstairs and ran towards the street to save his life. The men followed him and shot him on the street. Later, people called the police and took the victim to hospital," Jyoti said.Kiran was also taken to the hospital when people got to know that she too had sustained bullet injury, the owner said.Jyoti said on June 20, the couple took the flat on rent."Three days ago, they moved here on the second floor.
