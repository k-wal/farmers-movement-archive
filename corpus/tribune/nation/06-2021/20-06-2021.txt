20-06-2021||Mumbai||Under ED scanner, Sena MLA asks Uddhav to consider reconciliation with BJP||Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, who is under the Enforcement Directorate's scanner for alleged money laundering, has written a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray appealing to him to reconcile with the BJP "before it is too late".In the letter dated June 10, Sarnaik said even though the alliance with the BJP has broken, personal and harmonious relations between leaders of the 'yuti' (Shiv Sena-BJP) remain. "It is better to reconcile before it is too late," the MLA said in the letter. Notably, the Sena forged an alliance with the NCP and Congress and formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra in 2019 after the Uddhav Thackeray-led party fell out with the BJP. In November last year, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided premises linked to Sarnaik in Maharashtra in  connection with a money laundering case being probed against a security service provider company and others. The Shiv Sena had called the raids a "political vendetta" and said the Maharashtra government or its leaders will not surrender to pressure from anyone. Noting that municipal corporation polls are due soon in several Maharashtra cities, including Mumbai, Sarnaik in his letter to the CM said, "I believe fighting a war like Arjun, instead of sacrificing oneself like Abhimanyu or Karna. This is the reason that I have been fighting my legal battle for the last seven months alone without getting any help from our leaders or our government ."  Sarnaik, who is an MLA from neighbouring Thane district, also alleged that the Congress and NCP were creating divisions in the Shiv Sena ranks. "It is better to join hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi again as Shiv Sainiks feel that would save the Sena leaders like me, Anil Parab and Ravindra Waikar from problems," he said. Notably, former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya had accused the three Sena leaders of indulging in corrupt practices. Sarnaik, in his letter, did not name Somaiya, but said a leader "who has become a 'former MP' because of the Sena" is  maligning the party. Sarnaik also claimed that Shiv Sena MLAs feel only the work of Congress and NCP legislators is being done and not of those from his party. "Shiv Sena MLAs wonder whether the MVA has been formed, by breaking the alliance with the BJP, to help the Congress and NCP grow," he said. Sarnaik also said in the letter that while CM Thackeray was focusing only on COVID-19 eradication, the Congress was talking of going alone in next elections and the NCP was busy "breaking" Shiv Sena workers and inducting them into the Sharad Pawar-led party. Meanwhile, reacting to Sarnaik's letter, Somaiya said the Sena MLA seems to be worried about jail now and so, he has asked  CM Thackeray to join hands with PM Modi and the BJP. "All corrupt leaders of the Shiv Sena - Pratap Sarnaik, Anil Parab, Ravindra Waikar - will have to be in jail," the BJP leader said in a statement. Somaiya also said he had lodged a complaint at a police station in Thane about Sarnaik  "missing" for last 100 days. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/under-ed-scanner-sena-mla-asks-uddhav-to-consider-reconciliation-with-bjp-271441

Due to the pandemic-induced lockdown, Baba had to close the restaurant due to non-availability of customers and no income generated, following which he again returned to his old dhaba.Recently, Gaurav Vasan and Kanta Prasad buried the hatchet where the elderly man apologised to the YouTuber. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/baba-ka-dhaba-owner-kanta-prasads-health-improves-taken-off-ventilator-support-271439

I spent the next one year practising and in 2016 I made two records," he said.His second record was for fastest typing of all alphabets blindfolded in 6.71 seconds in 2016 followed by a record for fastest typing in 6.09 seconds.Chaudhary, who has a master’s degree in Sociology, in 2017 made a record of typing all alphabets within 18.65 seconds holding a stick in his mouth.He broke his own record in 2018 by achieving the same feat in 17.69 seconds, and then in 2019 in 17.01 seconds.In 2019, Chaudhary made another entry in the Guinness book for fastest typing with one finger, where he punched all alphabets in 29.53 seconds."My aim is to make over 19 entries in the Guinness book, a record held by veteran cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. I keep looking for new ideas and practising for them," he added.The Nangloi resident says he wants to want to run a full-fledged computer institute which does not have any infrastructure limitations and can provide free training to the needy."Right now I run it at home. I have few computers where students can practice, but I have my own limitations financially. I plan to expand the centre some day," he said.Chaudhary said his latest record was not for typing, as he wanted to try something new."My last record is for maximum touching of hand by a tennis ball within one minute. I could do it 205 times. This is the first such record in the Guinness book. When I proposed, they gave me a target of 180," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-just-punching-data-jnu-computer-operator-holds-nine-guinness-records-for-typing-skills-271419
20-06-2021||Kolkata||Man declared dead in 2010 rail accident found alive||A 38-year-old man, declared dead in the Jnaneswari train accident in 2010, has been found alive after 11 years.The mystery was unravelled when the CBI detained a man, namely Amritavan Chowdhury, from Jorabagan in North Kolkata on Saturday evening. The man was 27 years old at the time of the accident.Chowdhury was listed among the passengers who died in Jnaneswari train accident -- one of the most dreadful accidents allegedly conducted by the Maoists on May 28, 2010 in West Midnapore when the Mumbai-bound Jnaneswari Express derailed and had a head-on collision with a goods train killing 148 passengers.Based on preliminary findings, the CBI officers said they had reason to believe that the train accident victim declared dead on May 28, 2010 and whose identity was established through DNA profiling was still alive. The family in return managed a compensation of Rs 4 lakh and a Central government job as announced by the Railways at the time of the accident.All these years, his sister Mahua Pathak, who is presently posted as "assistant signal" in Sealdah division of South Eastern Railways had allegedly been engaged in a Central government job that she received as part of the compensation for her brother's death. His parents are said to have accepted ex-gratia as part of the compensation package. Amritava Chowdhury, his sister Mahua Pathak and their parents Mihir Kumar Chowdhury and Archana Chowdhury have been named in the FIR, and unknown government and private officials have also been kept in the ambit of the FIR."We received a complaint from the office of general manager (vigilance), administrative branch of the South Eastern Railway on August 11 last year based on which a discreet inquiry was started. The preliminary findings suggest that the person in question, Amritava Chowdhury, against whose death his family was compensated by the government, is still alive," said a CBI officer."The body was handed over to the family after matching the DNA profiling. This means there was some tampering with the DNA report because now we find that the so-called dead person is alive and that body that was handed over to the family was not that of Amritava Chowdhury," said a CBI officer.According to senior police officers of the state the bodies that were in a recognizable condition were handed over to the families after examining the documents but there were many bodies that were mutilated and it could not be identified. In those cases, the bodies were handed over to the family members after DNA matching."It was apparent that the Chowdhury family in alleged connivance with some government officials had tampered with the DNA profiling report and proved that the DNA of one of the bodies of the victims of the train accident matched with that of their family member's," a senior police officer said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-declared-dead-in-2010-rail-accident-found-alive-271416

20-06-2021||New Delhi||Reform is not achieved by questioning something one has 'taken advantage of': Khurshid slams G-23||Taking a dig at some of the G-23 leaders who have renewed their call for reforms in the Congress, senior leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday asked whether those calling for organisational polls have got to where they are in the party in the same manner, and asserted that reform is achieved by sacrificing, not by suddenly questioning something that one has "taken advantage of" over the years.Days after G-23 leader M Veerappa Moily stressed the need for a "major surgery" on the party to make it electorally more competitive, Khurshid said these "wonderful phrases" are not the answer as party leaders need to sit down and come up with solutions to the challenges that have arisen in the last 10 years.In an interview with PTI, Khurshid also said that it was for Rahul Gandhi to decide whether he wants to contest the party's presidential polls or not, but asserted that with or without being party president he remains "our leader".Asked about Kapil Sibal's call for widespread reforms across all levels of the organisation and Moily calling for a "major surgery" on the party, the former Union minister took a dig saying, "I am quite happy for the major surgery but what do you want to remove—my liver, kidney, just somebody tell me what surgery you want to do." Khurshid, who is among the leaders considered close to the Gandhi family, said the "surgery" should be done on the party, but it must be made clear what one will lose and what one will achieve by it."These wonderful phrases are not the answer, we need to get to the bottom (of the problem), we need to get to the inside, before surgery, we need to do X-rays, ultrasounds," the 68-year-old said using medical analogies.The senior Congress leader said he doesn't understand when people say "let us do surgery, reform, bring about a fundamental change" and wishes that they would clearly explain what they mean by it."If they mean that there should be a reshuffle and they should be given the top positions, then that is not reform or surgery. That is just saying 'I want the job'. So, I think there should be a conversation," he said.Khurshid asserted that the leaders calling for reform should have had a discussion with other leaders as well."Why hasn't somebody talked to me and said let us do this for the party?...(it is as) if only they exist and want reform," he said referring to the 'Group of 23' leaders who had written to party chief Sonia Gandhi and sought extensive organisational revamp last year.But since then, out of that group, Jitin Prasada has switched over to the BJP while many have apparently distanced themselves from the group.Pointing out that the 'Group of 23' leaders, which included the likes of Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Moily and Sibal, had sought major organisational revamp, he said they only said there should be elections in the party."Nobody is against the election, there should be an election. It would have been very nice if they had reminded us of which election they won to get where they are. If they reminded us of that it would be easy for us to understand," he said, taking a swipe at the G-23 leaders."But someone who talks about elections who has never got anywhere with elections in the past I think is being a little unfair to us," Khurshid said.Talking further about the G-23 leaders' demand for organisational polls, he said they want elections at all levels and "I just want to know -- is that the way they have got to where they are"."Which party has elections at all levels in India? Elections at all levels in India, how useful, difficult and hurtful they have been, panchayat elections...We will have to have a separate election commission of the power that the Election Commission of India has because the Congress party is a huge party," he argued.There are many questions and leaders need to sit and talk about it, he said, adding that they certainly need not go to the press seeking reforms.On criticism that the Congress is in decline as it is not taking the path of reforms, he said many people who expressed dissatisfaction have done very well out of the system that the party has.Noting that every party has to reform from time to time, Khurshid said every reform doesn't come by suddenly questioning something that "you have taken advantage of"."Reform comes when you give up what you have received...say that I need to make a sacrifice because I want some change to happen. Therefore, the first thing that I will do is to give up what I have received to make an example to people, otherwise people think you are being hypocritical," he said in an apparent dig at the G-23 leaders."You have got something, enjoyed it, and now you want more and therefore you are talking about reform. Reform means when everybody has to sit down" and think about what is required, he said.Asserting that there is no shying away from that election, Khurshid said it would happen but this is not the time to collect 5,000 people and get them to come and vote.On whether polls should be conducted for the Congress Working Committee (CWC), Khurshid said the Constitution of the party will dictate what is to be done and "we will abide by it"."I want to know how many people who want elections for the CWC were in the CWC by an election in the past," he said."I am waiting for my leaders to take a call, they know what is good for the party, what is good for the country. I am not in a hurry," he asserted.Khurshid also pointed to the impact of coronavirus on the party for not going ahead with organisational polls and cited the loss of senior leaders such as Ahmed Patel and Motilal Vora to Covid as reasons for slowing down the process.He also hit out young leaders such as Jitin Prasada for crossing over to the BJP, saying they probably still have faith in the Congress ideology, but their ambition may have prompted them to make the switch. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reform-is-not-achieved-by-questioning-something-one-has-taken-advantage-of-khurshid-slams-g-23-271408

A wonderful journey of the monkey. Monkey in a #Metro – but reasonably well behaved!” tweeted a user and shared the viral video.Another user said: "WHY IS THIS MONKEY RIDING THE METRO THE CUTEST THING he's just found a pal and is fascinated by the outside world AW (sic)".But, a few netizens jocularly asked the monkey to "put a mask on".While one user made a reference to a Hollywood film and captioned his post "Ek Bander, metro ke andar", another one wrote, "A monkey found enjoying the free metro ride....But following the all metro etiquette!!".Delhi Metro services are operating since June 7 after the lockdown, but with strict Covid safety norms, and just 50 per cent of seating capacity, with standing not allowed for commuters.A monkey in the Delhi metro.

20-06-2021||New Delhi||Irrespective of co-morbidities, classified as deaths due to Covid: Centre||The Centre has told the Supreme Court that all deaths with a diagnosis of COVID-19, irrespective of co-morbidities, are to be classified as deaths due to COVID-19.The MHA in its affidavit said: "All deaths with a diagnosis of COVID-19, irrespective of co-morbidities, are to be classified as deaths due to COVID-19. The only exception could be where there is a clear alternative cause of death, that cannot be attributed to COVID-19 (e.g. accidental trauma, poisoning, acute myocardial infarction, etc), where COVID-19 is an incidental finding."The MHA submitted for the recording of Covid-19 deaths, that there is a statutory mechanism in place either by way of an Act of Parliament or guidelines having the force of mandate and the law. Any breach of the guidelines mentioned hereunder would be a criminal offence as stipulated under section 188 of the IPC. The affidavit said broad guidelines for recording COVID-19 related deaths in India were prepared by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)."The guidelines clearly state positive deaths, implicate deaths related to COVID-19. Further, these guidelines are in sync with the WHO Mortality Coding", said the affidavit.The affidavit said the ministry of health had released guidelines on the distinction between 'death audit' and 'death certification'. The Centre said the primary goal of certification of cause of death (death certificate) is to identify and correctly classify all deaths due to a medical condition (e.g., COVID-19) and to eliminate any discrepancy in coding to obtain true estimates of the burden of COVID-19 deaths. On the other hand, 'death audit' is an administrative exercise to identify gaps that contribute to the deaths of patients. The aim is to improve the quality of healthcare services by suitable corrective measures to prevent/minimize future deaths. "It is however submitted that, States/UTs may continue using their State-specific death audit proforma, provided it broadly captures the parameters as the indicative proforma", added the affidavit.The MHA said in May, 2021, the Office of the Registrar General of India (ORGI) has also issued guidelines regarding registration of deaths and recording of the cause of death, wherein it was advised that the death of the person should be registered within the stipulated time within 21 days.On May 24, the top court had suggested there must be a uniform policy and also some guidelines for issuance of death certificates for those affected with Covid-19. A bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and M.R. Shah had said many a time reasons given in a death certificate can be a heart attack or lung failure, but these could be triggered by Covid-19. The bench asked Centre's counsel, "So, how are death certificates being issued?" The Centre filed an affidavit in response to the petitions filed by advocates Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal citing Section 12(iii) of the Disaster Management Act (DMA) providing for ex gratia monetary compensation for the families of those who died during a notified disaster.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/irrespective-of-co-morbidities-classified-as-deaths-due-to-covid-centre-271405

We expect there will be some clarity on Monday," an official said.The Centre has fixed the price of the vaccine at Rs 1,145 per dose. The maximum price of Covishield for private COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) has been fixed at Rs 780 per dose, while that of Covaxin is Rs 1,410 per dose.Russia's Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology has developed Sputnik V and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is marketing it globally.Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories, the marketing partner for the vaccine in the country, has been importing the shots from Russia. Over a period of time, the vaccine is also going to be manufactured in India. Sputnik V uses two different viruses that cause the common cold (adenovirus) in humans. It employs a different vector for each of the two shots, given 21 days apart.According to Gamaleya and the RDIF, Sputnik V has demonstrated an efficacy rate of 92 per cent.

In the process, the tempo ran over Kansara, who died on the spot, the police said.The tempo driver fled leaving behind his vehicle, from which 11 animals were rescued, the police said.An FIR was subsequently lodged at Dungri police station and 10 people, including the tempo owner, driver, and others involved in the illegal transportation of cattle, were arrested from different places.They were booked under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code, and  provisions of the Gujarat Essential Commodities and Cattle (Control) Act and the Motor Vehicles Act, the police said.Out of the 10 accused, five people were arrested in the past also in cases of illegal transportation of cattle in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the release said.The accused have been identified as Asgar Ansari, Javed Sheikh, Jamil Sheikh, Khalil Sheikh (all from Bhiwandi in Maharashtra), and Ansar Sheikh, Hasan Ali, Ali Murad Jamal, Dharmesh Ahir, Kamlesh Ahir, and Jayesh Ahir (from Valsad district), it said.

20-06-2021||New Delhi||Covid pandemic result of degradation of natural areas, species' loss, exploitation: UNEP India||The Covid-19 pandemic is a result of degradation of natural areas, species' loss and exploitation, UNEP country head Atul Bagai said, underlining that countries, including India, must intensify their efforts to prevent and reverse ecosystem degradation.He also highlighted that climate change, pollution and loss of biodiversity are three crises facing the entire planet and India, and are interconnected.India has taken the path of short-term economic interest over decades and this has diminished the ability of ecosystems to provide and support both humans and other life forms, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) official said while speaking to PTI."The Covid-19 pandemic is a result of the degradation of natural areas, species' loss and exploitation. This needs to change. India is already making a concerted effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and be part of the global effort to reach net-zero emissions by 2050," he said. "India must intensify these efforts and participate actively in the UN Decade for Ecosystem Restoration that was launched on the World Environment Day, 2021, to prevent, halt, and reverse the degradation of ecosystems," Bagai said. Several actions on this front are relevant for India, which include taking policy and legislative action, raising awareness and making smart choices, he said."For a better future, India must work towards creating food systems that work with nature, reduce waste, and are adaptive to change and resilient to shocks. This could also take the form of halting purchases of products that are not certified as sustainable or pledging and donating for restoration initiatives," the UNEP official said. Bagai said that a barrier to restoration is limited awareness of the negative effects of ecosystem degradation. This can be rectified in many ways that include discussions on the value of ecosystems, campaigns that draw attention to climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, empowering small-scale farmers and women farmers, changing patterns of consumption, challenging social norms and business practices, and capacity building and education, he said."We need to inculcate in India a culture that respects nature and cares for it. A healthier respect for nature will give us a healthier country and healthier people," Bagai said.On the role of the youth on the climate change issue, he said they are part of the larger international youth movements demanding drastic and visible action in the face of global warming and climate justice, biodiversity loss, and development at the cost of the environment. "My best advice to young people who are concerned about environmental issues is two-fold -- get informed and get involved. There is a wealth of opportunities to make a difference. Often the best place to get started is in your local community. There is much to be done, and we need everyone involved," he added.In recent years, he said there has been a surge in global attention on marine litter and plastic pollution."However, scientific knowledge on marine plastic litter and effective countermeasures remains insufficient. Keeping this in mind, the UNEP is implementing two major projects in India that focus on plastic waste management and reduction of marine plastic pollution," Bagai said.  UNEP, with the support of the governments of Japan and Norway, is undertaking a multiyear assessment of how plastic finds its way into riverways, and ultimately the ocean through the 'CounterMEASURE' project and the India Norway Marine Pollution initiative. Both projects aim to reduce marine litter and other pollutants from land-based sources and track plastic waste leakage from land into rivers. 'CounterMEASURE' has been working in Agra, Haridwar, Allahabad, Patna and Mumbai to address the problem of plastic waste. Technical studies have been conducted, including analysis of microplastics, macroplastics and mapping of plastic pollution hotspots in these cities and in the river Ganga, Bagai said. The new phase of the project will look at the impact of plastic pollution on migratory species as well. "We've also trained relevant stakeholders and conducted outreach for raising awareness and behaviour change. The UNEP is further supporting India by developing a national roadmap on marine plastic litter and hosting policy dialogues,” he said.Talking about the concept of inclusive wealth, Bagai said it is a measure of the social value, not dollar price, of all its capital assets, including natural capital, human capital and produced capital."It can provide insights into whether current growth is sustainable or is based on overexploiting natural capital. This information can help develop policy better suited to sustaining growth while better managing human and natural capital,” he said.On the other hand, he said the shortcomings of gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of social well-being are now well known. GDP was introduced as an index of the size of a country's economy – an accounting measure of all goods and services produced in a country over a given period of time, Bagai said."Over time, however, it began to be used not just as a measure of market activity but a measure of a country's overall well-being. In doing so, GDP ignores the value of human capital, the non-market values of natural capital, and the economic value of environmental externalities, such as pollution,” he said.

20-06-2021||New Delhi||More info sought as funds parked in Swiss banks ‘rise’||The government has requested for more information from the Swiss authorities as also the possible reasons for media reports suggesting a huge rise of funds by Indians in Swiss Banks. However, the government feels there does not appear to be any significant possibility of increase of deposits in the Swiss banks due to undeclared incomes of Indian residents.This is because India and Switzerland are signatories to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement, which have a significant deterrent effect on tax evasion through undisclosed assets abroad, stated the official release.These instruments enable automatic exchange of information between the two countries. Since the signing of these pacts, exchange of financial account information for citizens of both countries has taken place in 2019 as well as in 2020, it added.Reports stated that deposits by Indians had risen to over Rs 20,700 crore at the end of 2020 from Rs 6,625 crore at the end of 2019, reversing a two-year declining trend. They also state that this is also the highest figure of deposits in the last 13 years.However, customer deposits have actually fallen from the end of 2019. The funds held through fiduciaries have also more than halved from the end of 2019. The biggest increase is in "Other amounts due from customers". These are in form of bonds, securities and various other financial instruments. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-info-sought-as-funds-parked-in-swiss-banks-rise-271037

Children from non-military backgrounds are making the cut, with 1,409 cadets having joined the NDA during the same period. This is 75.67 per cent of the 1,862 cadets.About 18.9 per cent of the cadets at the NDA were from families of Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) or jawans.Earlier, the number of children of officers used to be high at the NDA. It was considered a matter of pride for cadets to get commissioned into the same regiment as their fathers’. Over the past 15 years, the numbers have been coming down steadily despite better salaries and assured one rank, one pension on retirement, said a functionary.High aspirations:1,862 Total cadets in six batches5.47% From officers’ families75.67% Non-military background18.9% Children of JCO/jawans||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cadets-from-non-military-families-make-the-cut-at-nda-271041

Keeping in view the safety, health and well-being of students, their parents and family members, teaching faculty and all stakeholders, the notification issued by CBSE calling off the Class XII Board Examinations due to Covid-19 should be given widest interpretation so as to include all categories of students, and not just regular ones.According to the CBSE formula accepted by the top court on June 17, classes X, XI and XII marks will be considered in 30:30:40 ratio to prepare the final results of Class XII students will be declared by July 31. Marks in the best of three subjects will be considered for the purpose for classes X, XI and XII.While 30 per cent weightage will be given for classes X and XI, for Class XII the weightage will be 40 per cent, for Class XII, the marks obtained by a student in his/her unit test/mid-term/pre-Board examinations will be considered while 20 marks will be given for practical in Class-XII, the formula accepted by the court envisaged.The CBSE had said if a student wasn’t able to meet the qualifying criterion; he/she would be placed in “essential repeat” or “compartment category”. However, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) had proposed a different set of criteria to compute marks based on performance of students in the last six years and declare results by July 20. The court is to take up the matter again on Monday.30:30:40 formula30% for Class X Board30% for Class XI exam40% pre-board assessmentWhat the plea saysPetitioners said the CBSE had attempted to give an unequal treatment to private/patrachar/second chance compartment candidates of classes X and XII, thereby creating a classification that had no reasonableness, rationale and hence, “is prima facie, unfair, unjust, arbitrary, and unreasonable and violative of the principles of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-152-students-move-supreme-court-want-compartment-exam-cancelled-271196

He said the officers passing out today were fortunate to be joining the IAF at this juncture. “The pilots will get to fly fighters carrying an array of potent weapons. The transport and helicopter fleets are well-equipped and capable of contributing effectively in war,” he said.“Flight controllers will have to adapt to vectoring fighters in large formations using digitised and networked systems,” Bhadauria said.He said the induction of 36 Rafale aircraft into the Indian Air Force would take place by 2022.

The vaccination coverage must be ramped up quickly. Covid-appropriate behaviour and their ability to prevent crowding,” said Guleria, as India continued to report a decline in daily cases, which fell to 60,753 on Saturday with active cases dropping to a 74-day low of 7,60,019. He, however, reiterated there was no evidence so far to suggest that children would be affected more in the next wave.Terming as “worrying” the reduction in the gap between fresh Covid waves, Guleria said the currently dominant Delta variant was much more transmissible and could cause a faster spread of infection.He said the first wave did not witness a rapid spread because the original strain was not that infectious. It had now changed, the AIIMS chief said, asking the states to go for micro-containment and lockdown in areas reporting more than 5 per cent positivity rate.He called for scaling up of Indian genome sequencing capacities to predict not just the current scale of variants in the country, but also to predict the future spread. — TNS60,753 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS 3,85,137ACTIVE CASES 7,60,0191,647 deaths in 24 hours2.8 cr doses with statesMortality rate dips||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/third-covid-wave-in-6-8-weeks-if-laxity-persists-warns-aiims-chief-randeep-guleria-271181

This may adversely affect the healthcare response system,” Bhalla wrote.The home secretary said in the present circumstances, it has become imperative that strict action be taken against those who assault healthcare professionals.“Institutional FIRs should be registered against assaulters and such cases should be fast-tracked. You may also like to invoke provisions of the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Act, 2020, where applicable,” he said.According to this law, anyone involved in the assault on doctors and healthcare professionals are liable to be punished with imprisonment up to five years, and a fine up to Rs two lakh.This offence may be compounded by the victim with the permission of the court.Further, if an act of violence against a healthcare service personnel causes grievous harm, the person committing the offence will be punishable with imprisonment up to seven years and a fine up to Rs five lakh.These offences will be cognisable and non-bailable.“I would also like to reiterate that a close watch be kept on any objectionable content in social media which may exacerbate such situations. Concerted efforts should be made through posters in hospitals, social media, etc. to emphasise the valuable contribution being made by doctors and other healthcare personnel in the fight against Covid-19,” Bhalla said.

20-06-2021||---||'Superior courts' to decide Kulbhushan Jadhav case: Pakistan||New Delhi, June 19Pakistan has contested South Block’s claim that a recently passed Bill by its National Assembly does not facilitate an effective review of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s case, as mandated by the judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).A statement by the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has suggested over-interpretation by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) when it said on Thursday that the Bill invites the municipal courts in Pakistan to decide whether or not any prejudice has been caused to Jadhav on account of the failure to provide consular access.“This is clearly a breach of the basic tenet that municipal courts cannot be the arbiter of whether a State has fulfilled its obligations in international law,’’ MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said on Thursday.But the MFA, Pakistan, said in line with the ICJ judgment, Islamabad “chose to provide Jadhav the right of review by superior courts of Pakistan’’ through the ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Ordinance, 2020, which is now a Bill.The MFA, Pakistan, also raised another bone of contention between the two sides. It regretted that India has been engaging in a “deliberate campaign’’ to obfuscate the issue of appointment of a lawyer. As a result, the Pakistan government had to initiate proceedings before the Islamabad High Court to request the Court to appoint a lawyer for Commander Jadhav.“The court has repeatedly invited India to clarify its position in this regard but India continues to deliberately politicise the issue,’’ said the statement by MFA, Pakistan.New Delhi’s refusal to avail itself of the legal remedies provided by Pakistan “reveal their nefarious designs to undermine Pakistan’s efforts and discredit the ICJ judgment’’ it added.On the other hand, India has complained that Pakistan is in breach of its international obligations by failing to provide its diplomats unimpeded access to Jadhav.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/superior-courts-to-decide-kulbhushan-jadhav-case-pakistan-270978
20-06-2021||New Delhi||Third wave in 6-8 weeks if Covid-appropriate behaviour not followed: AIIMS chief||If Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed and crowding not prevented, the next wave of the viral infection can strike the country in the next six to eight weeks, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria warned on Saturday.Until a sizeable number of the population are vaccinated, Covid-appropriate behaviour needs to be followed aggressively, he said and stressed on the need for stricter surveillance and area-specific lockdowns in case of a significant surge.Guleria reiterated that till now, there is no evidence to suggest that children will be affected more in the next wave of the infection.Earlier, India’s epidemiologists had indicated that a third wave of Covid-19 is inevitable and is likely to start from September-October.India was hit severely by a brutal second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April and May, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with shortage in oxygen supply at various hospitals adding to the woes.However, the number of cases has shown a downward trend and the positivity rate too has been shrinking in the last several days. From a daily case count of over 4 lakh, the number of new Covid-19 cases has been hovering around 60,000 in the last couple of days.“If Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed, the third wave can happen in six to eight weeks. We need to work aggressively to prevent another large wave till vaccination kicks in,” Guleria told PTI.There needs to be aggressive surveillance strategy in Covid hotspots and lockdowns in case of any significant surge. The moment a significant surge in cases is noted in a particular area and the positivity rate goes beyond 5 per cent, area-specific lockdown and containment measures should be implemented, he said.“However, a national-level lockdown cannot be a solution (to rein in the pandemic) keeping economic activity in mind.”With 60,753 new Covid cases being reported in a day, India’s total tally rose to 2,98,23,546, while the number of active cases stand at 7,60,019, the lowest in 74 days, according to Union Health Ministry data updated on Saturday.The death toll climbed to 3,85,137 with 1,647 fresh fatalities and active cases comprise 2.55 per cent of the total infections, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate has improved to 96.16 per cent, the data updated at 8 am showed.

20-06-2021||New Delhi||'Covid will go away, I'll be alright in 3-4 days', Milkha had said after contracting virus||"It will go away," sprint legend Milkha Singh had told PTI when he first got to know that he had contracted Covid, fully confident that his healthy lifestyle and regimented exercise routine would be enough to beat the dreaded virus.The 91-year-old, who died at Chandigarh's PGIMER hospital on Friday night after battling the infection for a month, was in high spirits when his positive test report came on May 19."Yes Bachcha, I tested positive for Covid yesterday (May 19). But I am fine, I have no problem, no fever, no cough. It will go away. My doctor told me I will be alright in three-four days," he had said when PTI rang him up to check whether the buzz on social media about him testing positive for the virus was correct.A couple of days later, Milkha was hospitalised at Mohali's Fortis hospital as a precautionary measure. While there, he was joined by his former national volleyball captain wife Nirmal Kaur, who died six days ago on Sunday because of Covid complications.The couple shared a room before Milkha was discharged on the family's request. He was subsequently hospitalised again on June 3 after his oxygen saturation levels dipped, this time at the PGIMER where he battled it out till Friday night."Our cook had fever but he concealed it from us. We sent him to his home (native village). After that we thought it's better that all the family members should get Covid tests done," Milkha had said during the May 20 conversation detailing what exactly led to the positive tests."I am surprised. How could I get this infection?" he wondered.At that point Milkha did not feel any symptoms and said that he had even been jogging and exercising."I have been keeping indoors except for morning jogging and exercise. I did jogging just yesterday. Don't worry, I am in good spirits," he asserted."I have been telling people that doing physical exercise and remaining healthy is very important during this Covid times. I am 91 but I have been doing exercise regularly," he had said.And it was this lifestyle that he was banking on to recover."Though I am surprised to have tested positive, I hope to get over it soon."            His wife had, however, spoken about Milkha complaining of slight weakness before his Covid test was done. "This was the first time in my life that he had complained of weakness and body ache," Nirmal, who was negative for virus at that time, had said.The legendary athlete was a four-time Asian Games gold-medallist and the 1958 Commonwealth Games champion but his greatest performance was a near miss, the fourth place finish in the 400m final of the 1960 Rome Olympics.However, his timing at the Italian capital remained the national record for 38 years and he was bestowed the Padma Shri in 1959.

20-06-2021||New Delhi||Milkha Singh: An unmatchable romance with a near miss||The track, to him, was like an open book in which Milkha Singh found the "meaning and purpose of life". And what a life he made for himself. Before his 91-year-old body lost to COVID-19 on Friday after fighting it for a month, Milkha won the kind of battles that not many would have survived, forget about living long enough to tell the world about them. Also read: Flying Sikh Milkha Singh dies of Covid complications at 91In Pics: The inspirational journey of the Flying SikhBollywood mourns demise of Milkha SinghPart of me is still refusing to accept that you are no more: Farhan Akhtar remembers Milkha Singh"Don't worry, I am in good spirits...I am surprised, How could I get this infection?...I hope to get over it soon," Milkha had said in his last interaction with PTI before being hospitalised.One of independent India's biggest sporting icons was a tormented man but refused to let that come in the way of accomplishments which were unheard of in his era.He saw his parents being butchered during partition, indulged in petty crimes to survive in refugee camps of Delhi, went to jail for those and failed three attempts at joining the Army.Who could have thought a man like that would get the sobriquet of 'The Flying Sikh'? But Milkha earned it and earned it with a master-class on how to be bigger and better than one's circumstances.He "revered" the track like "the sanctum sanctorum in a temple where the deity resided." To him running was both his God and beloved as he created his own little fairytale out of what what could have easily been a tale of horrors.To talk of medals, the legendary athlete was a four-time Asian Games gold-medallist and the 1958 Commonwealth Games champion but his greatest performance was a near miss, the fourth place finish in the 400m final of the 1960 Rome Olympics.His timing at the Italian capital remained the national record for 38 years and he was bestowed the Padma Shri in 1959.But more than anything else, Milkha was the one who put Indian athletics on the world map by winning the gold in the then 440 yards race of the 1958 British and Commonwealth Games.He became the first Indian athlete to win an individual gold in a Commonwealth Games, which led to then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declaring a national holiday on his request.Milkha put his career record at 77 wins out of 80 races. He also claimed to have bettered the 'Olympics record' of that time in a race in France, but with sketchy records available, it is difficult to confirm just like his actual date of birth which is officially November 20, 1929.  He lost the race of his life in the Rome Olympics, finishing the 400m final in 45.6 seconds, 0.1 second short of the bronze medal mark. Hard to believe but he had slowed down in a colossal error of judgement as he wanted to preserve himself for the final 150m. He remained tormented by that miss, one of the only two incidents in his life, which he described as unforgettable -- the other being the killing of his parents in Pakistan."The one medal I had yearned for throughout my career had just slipped through my fingers because of one small error of judgement," Milkha wrote in his 160-page autobiography that coincided with the release of a blockbuster biopic on his life 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'.However, his timing at the Italian capital remained a national record for 38 years till Paramjeet Singh broke it in 1998 at a national meet in Kolkata.Milkha had promised to give a cash prize of Rs 2 lakh to the one who breaks his record, he eventually did not because the flamboyant star believed that Paramjeet's feat would have counted for something only if he had achieved it in a foreign competition."Mera record todne wala India mein paida nahi hua (the one who can break my record is not born yet in India)," he had famously said in 1991 and he hung on to that belief even when that record was shattered.A self-proclaimed village 'bumpkin' from the undivided Punjab's Govindpura, Milkha's run for a better life started as a 15-year-old when he escaped from Pakistan to Delhi after witnessing a bloodbath that claimed his parents during the partition. His approach to life in the refugee camp was irreverent. He worked as a boot polish boy, a shop cleaner near the old Delhi Railway Station and in between stole goods from trains to make ends meet.The petty crimes landed Milkha in jail and he was bailed out by sister Ishvar, who sold her jewellery to get him released.Milkha tried to step up in life by making repeated attempts at joining the army. He got through on his fourth attempt in 1952 and that proved to be the turning point which he so desperately wanted and needed. He was posted in Secunderabad and ran his first race -- a cross country of five miles -- there when army coach Gurdev Singh promised an extra glass of milk to those who finished inside top-10.He finished sixth and later got selected for special training in 400m. The rest, as they say, is well-documented history.He won the selection trial the 1956 Olympics despite that he had been brutally assaulted by his rivals a day before that race.Milkha disappointed at the Games as he failed to get past the preliminary heats but benefited from the experience and was able to persuade 400m gold winner Charles Jenkins to share his training methods.In his autobiography, he had claimed that he trained so intensely after that disappointment that he would vomit blood and would fall unconscious on many occasions.His life and career story is incomplete without the 1960 Indo-Pak sports meet where he outran Pakistani Abdul Khaliq before the Rome Olympics.Khaliq was considered the fastest man in Asia at that time, having won the 100m gold in 1958 Asian Games. After winning 400m gold in the same Games, Milkha had also beaten Khaliq in the 200m final.At first, Milkha refused to go to Pakistan as he did not want to return to a country where his parents were butchered but was persuaded by Prime Minister Nehru to face his demons.He beat Khaliq in the 200m race in Lahore and was christened 'The Flying Sikh' by then Pakistan President General Ayub Khan who congratulated him during the awards ceremony.Milkha retired from athletics after the 1964 Olympics, two years after winning the gold in 400m and 4x400m relay events at the Asian Games held at Jakarta.Before that he had already taken up the job of deputy director of sports in the Punjab government in 1961 on the insistence of then chief minister Pratap Singh Kairon. He quit Indian Army and also shifted his residence to Chandigarh from Delhi.In 1991, he introduced a compulsory games period in schools and also set up sports wings in schools in the districts to tap talent at the grassroot level.He got married to Nirmal Kaur, captain of the Indian volleyball team, in 1963. They met for the first time in 1956 in Sri Lanka when they were there for their respective national duties.The couple was blessed with three daughters and a son, golfer Jeev Milkha Singh.It was quite stunning that an athlete of Milkha's stature was offered the Arjuna award, instituted in 1961, only in 2001.He famously turned it down, saying the honour was not of the "stature of the services he rendered to the nation".In fact, Milkha was a sum total of way more than his several races and medals. He was also much more than that near miss in Rome.He was India's love affair with the track, the one that this country can never get over.
