Realising the intensity of the situation, the local sources in the village informed about the same to Assam Rifles,” the official said.Real-time information, swift and bold action of the security forces resulted in the apprehension of the five activists, who were hiding on the outskirts of Kakichhuah village, he said.The accused were later handed over to Lawngtlai police station, he added.Meanwhile, a police officer said that the five ALP activists were produced in Lawngtlai district court during the day with charges lodged in different sections under the Arms Act and Foreigners Act.The court sent them to jail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-myanmar-based-alp-cadres-arrested-with-arms-from-border-village-267442

Once the seams are found, coal is taken out through small holes along the horizontal line of the coal seams.Six co-workers of the trapped miners escaped the tragedy as they were outside the mine at the time of the incident and they have been escorted to their homes in Assam.The police have arrested the owner of the coal mine, Shining Langstang, and charged him with violation of the NGT order banning unscientific mining and transportation of coal.The ‘Sordar’ (mine manager) is on the run and a lookout notice has been issued since he was the one who brought migrant workers from Assam and Tripura to work in the illegal mine, a senior police officer said.Based on the account of the survivors, an FIR was registered.

12-06-2021||New Delhi||Deepening troubles in state units cause jitters in BJP||The BJP’s troubles appear to be increasing by the day. The pandemic period appears to have brought to the fore and underlined the simmering tensions and differences in party units in critical states—Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Karnataka.With a new alliance headed by a former partner, Akali Dal, all set to challenge it in Punjab and the possibility of a grand alliance brewing at the national level, the saffron party’s problems may only be mounting. The meeting between political strategist Prashant Kishor and NCP chief Sharad Pawar has set off furious speculations of a non-BJP, non-Congress national front with regional satraps challenging Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.While leaders dismiss the reports of “tensions, differences or fissures” in state units, including Gujarat—the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah—and Madhya Pradesh, the ‘garh’ (bastion) of Sangh and saffron politics, sources say “various factions are very much in action”.Amid rumblings of intra-party conflicts and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani versus state president CR Patil in the Gujarat BJP, sources say some party legislators have been summoned to Gandhinagar on Tuesday. While leaders call it is a “routine affair”, the sources do not rule out the possibility of a cabinet rejig ahead of assembly elections, next year.Meanwhile, in Karnataka, observers say the BJP may have managed to put a lid on the restiveness with a statement by general secretary in-charge Arun Singh that there is no move to remove Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, the “peace will not last for long”.“They may have bought some time but the anti-Yeddiyurappa faction will mount pressure, again,” they say.Likewise in Madhya Pradesh, the national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has publicly dismissed speculations and backed Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. However, rumour mills are working overtime as close-door meetings between Vijayvargiya, state minister Narottam Mishra, union minister Prahlad Patel and other BJP leaders considered opponents of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan are “continuing”.So far as Rajasthan is concerned, former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has gone “missing” from a new hoarding at the state BJP headquarters, which now has photos of Prime Minister Modi, party chief JP Nadda, state president Satish Poonia and leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deepening-troubles-in-state-units-cause-jitters-in-bjp-267439
12-06-2021|| New Delhi||Gurugram schoolboy killing: SC seeks reply on juvenile's bail plea citing Covid||The Supreme Court has sought reply from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the bail plea of a juvenile who was arrested for allegedly killing a seven-year-old fellow student at a prestigious school in Gurugram in 2017.The accused was a Class XI student at the time of the incident.A bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and M.R. Shah issued notice to the CBI and sought its reply in the matter by July 1.The juvenile, who has been identified as 'Master Bholu' in the case records, was represented by senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra and advocate Durga Dutt.The juvenile sought release from an observation home in Karnal citing threat to his life after several of his fellow inmates tested positive for Covid-19.The petitioner moved the top court challenging the April 28 order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had adjourned his plea to July 27.The petitioner contended that the high court had adjourned the case without appreciating the urgency of the matter, which is 'utter violation' of the right to life in the backdrop of the existing pandemic situation.The petitioner argued that the high court did not consider the alarming Covid situation in the country, with a possibility of a third wave that is likely to affect children and adolescents.The juvenile submitted that he has already been in the observation home for nearly three years and six months, where 25 out of the 200 inmates had tested positive for Covid-19 in May.The plea cited that the CBI had filed a charge-sheet on February 5, 2018, along with the citing of 127 witnesses, and the investigation in the matter is already over.In the chargesheet, the CBI had alleged that the boy killed the student on September 8, 2017, in a bid to postpone the exams and also to cancel a parent-teacher meeting. The victim's body, with his throat slit, was found in the washroom of the school.The plea argued that the November 2018 order of the top court had directed maintaining status quo on the issue, and therefore there is no likelihood of the trial to be taken up soon.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurugram-schoolboy-killing-sc-seeks-reply-on-juveniles-bail-plea-citing-covid-267438
12-06-2021||Ballia (UP)||India couldn’t become Hindu Rashtra due to ‘coward’ Nehru: BJP MLA||In controversial remarks, BJP’s Bairia MLA Surendra Singh here on Saturday said it was due to the leadership of “coward” Jawaharlal Nehru that India could not be declared a Hindu Rashtra at the time of the Independence. Alleging that it was the Congress’ “dirty thinking” that led to the Partition, Singh said had Nehru not been the prime minister, India would have been declared a Hindu nation.“Two nations were formed based on two cultures. But it was because of the leadership of ‘buzdil’ (coward) Nehru that India was not declared a Hindu Rashtra at the time of the Independence,” the BJP MLA said in a statement.He also said if Sardar Patel had become the prime minister in place of Nehru, India would have become a Hindu Rashtra.Referring to Congress leader Digvijay Singh’s purported statement regarding Article 370 in Kashmir, he demanded that the sedition charges be slapped against him. Digvijay Singh had allegedly commented in an audio chat on social media that his party will have a “relook” at the Article 370 revocation and Jammu and Kashmir’s lost statehood if it returns to power.Congress leaders, including former PM Indira Gandhi, remained silent when Brahmins were being displaced from Kashmir, Surendra Singh said and claimed that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi belong to a foreign culture and the party does politics with pro-Muslim sentiment.

12-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC takes exception to SCBA proposal to elevate top court lawyers as HC judges||Days after the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) said that Chief Justice of India NV Ramana has requested chief justices of the 25 high courts to consider top court lawyers for appointment as high court judges, the Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA) has taken strong exception to it.”The attempt to create a distinct class of lawyers practicing before the Hon’ble Supreme Court for being considered for elevation as Judge of the Hon’ble High Court is not only unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory but is likely to create resentment amongst a large number of lawyers in the High Courts. This will lead to disgruntlement and demoralisation of a large section of the Bar,” the DHCBA said in a letter to the CJI.Taking strong exception to the SCBA statement that Supreme Court lawyers are more meritorious, the DHCBA demanded that the CJI should withdraw such directions, if any, given to the chief justices of high courts for consideration for elevation of top court lawyers.Some other high court bar associations are also reported to have also taken exception to the SCBA’s demand.SCBA President Vikas Singh—who had recently written to the CJI in this regard—had said: “The CJI has agreed to the request made by SCBA and has requested the Chief Justices of the High Courts to consider lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court for elevation to their High Courts”.In his May 31 letter to the CJI, Singh had written that the advocates practicing in the Supreme Court were hardly considered for appointment as high court judges by the collegiums. “The experienced and seasoned lawyers practicing in the apex court will prove to be deserving and meritorious judges of high courts,” he had written.Singh had said the Executive Committee of SCBA has constituted a “search committee” consisting of senior lawyers to facilitate the process of elevation by identifying deserving and meritorious Supreme Court practitioners.“The High Court Collegium may then consider such names along with the lawyers from the High Court Bar in order to choose the most deserving candidate amongst those available for elevation,” he had said.Singh had said that lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court have “vast experience and best exposure in dealing with all kinds of issues relating to civil, criminal, Constitutional, commercial law”.“However, they are rarely considered for elevation by the high court collegium as they do not regularly practice before the high court and while being professionally more meritorious than their colleagues at the high court, lose the opportunity for being considered as such,” the letter said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-takes-exception-to-scba-proposal-to-elevate-top-court-lawyers-as-hc-judges-267436

The Border Security Force (BSF) has close to 2.65 lakh personnel and is primarily tasked to guard India’s borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh.The BSF condoled Ram’s demise with a public message.“DG (director general) and all ranks condole the untimely and sad demise of Dr Naveen Ram, IG/Director (Medical) BSF on 12 June 2021 while undergoing treatment due to post COVID-19 complications,” it said.“Prahari parivar (BSF family) stands with his family in this trying time,” the BSF tweeted.The officer had earlier headed the medical wings of other paramilitary or central armed police forces (CAPFs) like the CRPF, ITBP and CISF.The doctor is credited with bringing in a major health directive in 2012 that relaxed eye sight norms for aspirants and in-service troopers of these forces enabling ‘minor vision correction’ candidates to serve in CAPFs that are deployed across the country for rendering a variety of internal security duties.

Yadav contended that the high court was not justified in holding the Central Vista redevelopment project as an “essential activity”.The Central Vista redevelopment plan – which aims to free up 75 acre land in the heart of the capital – involves demolition of around 10 buildings, including Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President’s House and Lok Nayak Bhawan.Announced in September last year, it envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for more than 1,200 MPs, expected to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.Refusing to set aside the clearances given to the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, the Supreme Court on January 5 said it can’t venture into policy matters and areas reserved for the Executive without any legal basis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-vista-petitioners-move-sc-against-delhi-hc-order-refusing-to-halt-work-267428

No work is inferior and they have to support their families, said one of them.A group of around 20 persons from Diva in the district has been hired by a private contractor for nullah cleaning which is undertaken every year to prevent flooding during the monsoon.Among them are some well-educated young men.Sameer (full name not disclosed), who said he is a “double graduate”, is working with the contractor for the last three months.“There are no jobs outside. Companies have closed due to the pandemic. One needs a job for earning livelihood and to take care of the family,” he told a local news channel.Anil, another worker, said he is an “IT engineer”.   Some of them had white collar jobs which they lost during the pandemic.To save on transport costs, they walk from Diva to Mumbra, a distance of over 10 km, every day for work.As they needed income, one of them approached an agent of the civic contractor who undertakes pre-monsoon works a few weeks ago, and expressed willingness to join his team of labourers.The corporator of the ward in Mumbra where the work is underway said she felt sympathy for them as they had lost their regular jobs. “I salute them for their work,” she added.“One should not look down upon any work. After all we have to survive and support the family. What if we are post graduates or double graduates? Our degrees are not going to help us at present,” said another man.“This job will last for a couple of weeks. Then we will have to look for another source of income,” he said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/armed-with-college-degrees-they-are-working-as-drain-cleaners-in-mumbra-267419

It is the first and only product to have published any data from human clinical trials in India.Covaxin is the only product to have any data on emerging variants, and it is also the first and only Covid-19 vaccine to have efficacy data in Indian populations, Bharat Biotech said in a statement.In vaccine development, preclinical studies involve the testing of vaccine candidates in laboratory animals.Bharat Biotech completed three preclinical studies, which are published in Cellpress, a peer-reviewed journal. The studies on Covaxin's Phase I (done to assess a vaccine's safety, immune response and to determine right dosage), and Phase II clinical trial (carried out to assess the safety and the ability of the vaccine to generate an immune response) are published by the peer-reviewed journal- the "Lancet-Infectious Diseases", read the statement.The company said that the full data from studies on Covaxin's neutralization of variants are already published at "bioRxiv", Clinical Infectious Diseases, and Journal of Travel Medicine."The study on the neutralisation of Beta and Delta variants (B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 respectively) and the study on B1.1.28 variant, at Journal of Travel Medicine, while the studies on B.1.617 variant and Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) are published at Clinical Infectious Disease, and Journal of Travel Medicine respectively," it said."The published studies are widely cited for the rigour and breadth that Bharat Biotech brings to its clinical trials. Currently, data from both efficacy and safety follow-up of Covaxin's Phase III trial is being analysed and compiled. Upholding its uncompromising commitment to integrity, the company will make Phase III trials data from the final analysis public soon," read the statement.India had begun its Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16, 2021, with two vaccines- Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-biotech-shares-full-data-of-all-research-studies-of-covaxin-267418
12-06-2021||New Delhi||Govt asks ministries to target 20 pc reduction in controllable expenditure||The government has asked all ministries and government departments to target 20 per cent reduction in expenditures like domestic and foreign travel, overtime allowance, rent and office expenses, in the current fiscal year as it tightens its purse strings amid the second wave of the pandemic.The Department of Expenditure under the Finance Ministry issued an office memorandum in this regard on June 10.“All the ministries/ departments are requested to take steps to curtail all avoidable non-scheme expenditure and aim for 20 per cent reduction in controllable expenditure.... Expenditure in 2019-20 may be taken as the baseline for this purpose,” the memorandum said.However, expenditure related to containment of the pandemic is excluded from the scope of this order.The memorandum said ministries should aim to control expenditures like overtime allowance, rewards, domestic and foreign travel, office expenses, rents, rates and taxes, royalty.Besides, expenditures related to publications, other administrative expenses, supplies and materials, cost of ration, clothing and tentage, advertising and publicity, minor works and maintenance, service or commitment charges, grants-in-aid general, contribution and other charges, should also be cut.The savings that would accrue to the government due to this move cannot be exactly ascertained. This is the second year in a row that the government has come out with measures to rationalise expenditure.Last year, the expenditure department had asked all ministries /departments to review appointments of consultants, curtail functions and ban use of imported paper for printing as part of measures to rationalise non-priority expenditure.As per estimates, the government is staring at an additional expenditure of up to Rs 1.45 lakh crore to provide free vaccines and foodgrains to people devastated by the deadly second wave of covid infections.Reversing a policy where states competed for vaccine supplies for certain age categories, the government earlier this week announced that the central government will procure vaccines for all adults. All above 18 years of age would get free vaccines from June 21.Also, the free foodgrain scheme that was to end in June has been extended till November 2021.

According to the complaint, Aisha Sultana during a news debate on a Malayalam channel alleged that the Centre had used Covid-19 as a "bio-weapon" against the people of Lakshadweep.Over the last few days, there has been an uproar against Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel over the new reforms introduced by him, which many allege are against the interest of the islanders.People are protesting against the draft legislations like Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act), Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation and Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021 among others.Patel, who was appointed as the Administrator of Lakshadweep in December 2020, is facing opposition over policies introduced by him from the people of the union territory and politicians, both from within Lakshadweep and the neighbouring state of Kerala. —ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/15-lakshadweep-bjp-members-resign-after-sedition-case-filed-against-filmmaker-aisha-sultana-267398

An investigation is being conducted to ascertain their identity.”The two policemen on duty were in civil clothes and are ASIs posted with the Special Branch of the Delhi Police, they said.The incident took place on June 10. The two policemen were deployed at the Delhi’s Singhu border to oversee the security arrangements, police said.The two policemen were allegedly found clicking pictures at the protest site when they were assaulted by the group, one of the protesters said.During the incident, one of policemen suffered a fracture on his wrist while the other ASI sustained severe injuries on his leg. Both of them have been discharged from a hospital after treatment, a senior police officer said.“They were beaten up by people present at the spot. Some of them involved in the incident have been identified but we are yet to find out who they were,” the officer said.Police said the nature of the job of the policemen posted with the Special Branch is different.“They are regularly deployed to keep an eye on the situation as well as see the security arrangements in place and to report on the appropriate action taken by the local police,” the officer said.A case has been registered under IPC sections of assaulting a public servant while on duty, voluntarily causing grievous hurt and other relevant sections including Delhi Disaster Management Act at Narela police station, police said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for more than six months now in protest against the three laws that they say will leave them at the mercy of big corporates and end the MSP regime.The government has said all these concerns are baseless and that the new laws are pro-farmer.  The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the laws till further orders and set up a committee to examine the issues.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions spearheading the protest, had said they will organise dharnas at governor houses across the country on June 26 to mark the completion of seven months of their agitation.They will show black flags during their June 26 protest and send memorandums to President Ram Nath Kovind.

12-06-2021||New Delhi||No substantial evidence to suggest children will be more affected in Covid third wave: Report||There appears to be no substantial evidence to suggest that children will be more affected or have greater illness severity due to Covid-19 in the anticipated third wave, according to a new report.The Lancet Covid-19 Commission India Task Force prepared the report after convening an experts group comprising leading paediatricians from the country to examine the issue of ‘paediatric Covid-19' in India.It said the infection's symptomatology in children in India appears to be globally comparable."Most children with Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and amongst those symptomatic mild infections are predominant. Most children have fever with respiratory symptoms, and often present with gastrointestinal symptoms (such as diarrhea, vomiting, pain in abdomen) and atypical manifestation compared to adults. The proportion of symptomatic children increases as age increases, as does the severity in such age groups," the report stated.In the absence of a national database on clinical presentation and outcomes of infected children during the two surges noted thus far, the data of approximately 2,600 hospitalised children, below the age of 10 years (excluding neonates), from 10 hospitals (both public and private), in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra and Delhi-NCR region, was collected and analysed.According to the data, mortality rates amongst these surveyed hospitalised Covid-19 positive children below the age of 10 years was 2.4 per cent and about 40 per cent of the children who died had comorbidities."Nine per cent of all hospitalised Covid-19 positive children presented with severe illness, under 10 years of age. The above observations were similar during the two surges of Covid-19 infections India has experienced," the Lancet document said.Three doctors from AIIMS, namely Sheffali Gulati, Sushil K Kabra and Rakesh Lodha, contributed to the study.Kabra said less than 5 per cent of children will require hospital admission in Covid-19 and out of them the mortality is of 2 per cent."Say out of 1 lakh, 500 children get hospitalised and 2 per cent of deaths is reported amongst them. So in one lakh, mortality of just one or two children is seen. In children, as such, the disease is less severe. Very low proportion requires hospitalisation and very small proportion of mortality is reported. The mortality is also contributed by underlying diseases in the form of comorbidities like diabetes, cancer, anemia or severe malnutrition. In normal children, mortality is extremely rare," he told PTI.The data was also evaluated separately for the time periods corresponding to the two surges, March 2020-December 2020 and January 2021-April 2021.Comparable observations were recorded in a multicentric study which examined 402 children hospitalised in Indian hospitals, of which 90 per cent were asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and of 318 cases wherein 44 per cent had underlying co-morbidities, it said."Based on the data available, there appears to be no substantial evidence to suggest that children would be more affected or would have greater illness severity due to Covid-19 infection in the anticipated third wave. Studies also indicate that children have milder disease, better prognosis, and low mortality in comparison to adults," it said.On multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in children, the report said, risk factors for this condition include obesity, asthma, compromised breathing, developmental disorders, cardiac disease, cancers or immunocompromised children as well as those who have undergone surgeries.Although figures indicate low mortality rates from acute Covid-19 in older teens, it appears to be higher in those who are obese. Most published data suggest mild to moderate predisposition in most cases and low mortality linked with MIS-C."Preliminary review of cases within representative facilities further corroborates the low case severity and low overall mortality rates in children. That said, the health system needs to gear up for a paediatric case load with adequate infrastructure, earmarked facilities at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of care, oxygen availability, appropriate equipment, trained manpower, drugs and injectables amongst others, all of which are specific to children," the report said.The national-level clinical protocols must be adhered to at all levels of facilities and all providers adequately trained, similar to adult protocols."The health system must maintain its routine programs like immunisation and nutrition and identify high risk patients in advance for better management. Vaccines will form an important part of the preventive strategy for adults and also eventually for children, and this must be evaluated and implemented expeditiously.“Behaviour change communication and media management must be prioritised to help alleviate panic and anxiety. Schools must be reopened cautiously in person, with options for online access as needed, but with a firm resolve to bring normalcy back as quickly as possible in children's lives,” the report added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-substantial-evidence-to-suggest-children-will-be-more-affected-in-covid-third-wave-report-267391

In 2021, till April, we have received 729 complaints from women and 266 from men,” she said.Advocate Prathana Sadavarte, one of the counsellors with the cell, said that during the strict lockdown last year, they started receiving more complaints from women about domestic violence abuse, emotional outbursts, psychological confinement and husbands and in-laws’ tendency of taking them for granted.“But post-unlock (September onwards), complaints from men also increased and they were about mostly work-related stress and extended working hours due to work from home mode,” she said.She said that if both the spouses are working, they are generally are sympathetic towards each other’s job responsibilities. However, if one spouse is not working, then he or she may not get full idea of the hardships that the other one is facing on the professional front.Giving an example, she said, “A male professional had approached us saying that he has been working from home since the last lockdown. He complained that just because he is at home, his wife expects him to help in household chores”. The husband had failed to communicate to her his work-related woes, as a result of which both of them started arguing.     While counselling them, we realised that both of them had not given space to each other which was required, she said.“During the counselling sessions, we asked them to start giving compliments about each other’s work and spending more time with each other,” she added. Sadavarte said that there is a perceived notion that such cells and helplines are generally women-centric, but the lockdown has changed that notion and men have also found a platform where they can share their emotions. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/work-from-home-effect-count-of-males-seeking-emotional-counselling-sees-upward-trend-267378

12-06-2021||New Delhi||Indians do not come first for PM, politics does: Priyanka slams govt’s Covid response||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi on Saturday launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, alleging that Indians do not come first for the PM, politics does and that truth does not concern him, propaganda does.As part of her “Zimmedaar Kaun (who is responsible)” campaign, in which she has been asking questions from the government over its handling of the pandemic, the Congress general secretary focused on the “crisis of leadership” and claimed that the whole world has witnessed the Prime Minister’s “incompetence at governance” during the pandemic.“He (the Prime Minister) simply retreated and waited for the worst to pass. The Prime Minister of India has behaved like a coward. He has let our country down,” Priyanka said in her statement posted on her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts.The Prime Minister’s vast capacity for vanity has been exposed, she claimed.“Indians do not come first for him. Politics does. Truth does not concern him, propaganda does,” Priyanka alleged and asserted that the time has come for the people to ask the Prime Minister ‘Zimmedaar Kaun (Who is responsible)’.Good governance in a crisis is about confronting the truth, seizing responsibility and taking action, she said.“Unfortunately, the Modi government did none of these. Instead, from the beginning of the pandemic, it made every attempt to hide the truth and to shirk responsibility,” the Congress general secretary alleged.“As a consequence, when the second wave hit us with unprecedented force, the government lapsed into a state of inaction. This inaction enabled the virus to spread with far greater ferocity and cause untold suffering,” she said.Priyanka also listed a series of measures that the Prime Minister should have taken in the wake of Covid spread.“If only the Prime Minister had acted upon the countless warnings he had been given by experts from India and around the world and if only he had listened to the recommendations of his own ‘Empowered Group’, or even to the Parliamentary Committee on Health, we would not have faced the horrendous shortage of beds, oxygen and medicines that we did,” she claimed.“Had he cared about those who looked towards him for leadership, he would not have reduced the number of dedicated Covid beds between the first and the second wave. He would have ordered the tankers required to transport oxygen and prepared for the diversion of industrial oxygen to hospitals,” Priyanka asserted.She hit out at the Prime Minister, saying that he exported millions of doses of life-saving drugs without ensuring provisions for Indian lives first.“Had the Prime Minister prioritized the people of India above his own PR and image building, we would not have the shortage of vaccines we have today,” Priyanka said.“Had he woken up from his slumber and ordered vaccines in the summer of 2020 instead of waiting till January 2021, he could have saved countless lives,” she claimed.Instead of distributing free vaccines across the world to boost his own image, had he paused for a moment and protected his countrymen first, the people would not be standing in line today grappling with a convoluted registration system designed to slow down the vaccine process, she said.“We could have vaccinated a very significant proportion of our population by now, considering we are one of the largest vaccine producers in the world,” she argued.She also slammed Modi for not taking opponents along in this battle for Indian lives, saying he could have engaged with experts, critics, allies and the opposition fearlessly.“He could have used the media as a disseminator of life-saving information about Covid, rather than as a propaganda tool to promote his own image,” Priyanka alleged. In her statement, she also accused the Prime Minister of putting politics before human lives, saying he should have helped support the states in their heroic battle against Covid-19.“As the leader of a nation deep in crisis, he would have sent his colleagues in the states resources, cleared their dues and strengthened their efforts instead of appearing on TV repeatedly to whine and complain about them in a pathetic attempt to abdicate his own responsibilities,” she said, in a sharp attack at the PM.Had the Prime Minister been an informed and competent leader he would have planned, strategized and prepared for the inevitable second wave, the Congress general secretary said, adding that he would not have set aside the tools of science and modernity and transported us back through thaali-banging and lamp lighting rituals into the darkness of bygone centuries.“Indeed, had the Prime Minister been the man his admirers believed him to be, had he had the mettle of a statesman, or the compassion and bravery of a true leader, he would have come forward and comforted his countrymen when they most needed reassurance and succor,” she said.He did none of this, Priyanla added, slamming the prime minister’s leadership during the Covid crisis.Quoting the lines written by the celebrated poet Nirala in his novel ‘Kulli Bhaat’, in which he describes the grim scenes that unfolded during the Spanish Flu epidemic one hundred years ago, she said they are eerily prescient, even more so now because “we live in modern times, when such scenes of collective turmoil caused by an abdication of governance ought to be a thing of the past”.The Congress has been critical of the Centre’s handling of the Covid situation in the country, but the government has dismissed the criticism of the Opposition party, accusing it of politicising the pandemic.

12-06-2021||Mumbai||Heavy rain lash Mumbai; train, bus services hit due to water-logging||Heavy rains, coupled with thunderstorm and strong winds, lashed Mumbai and its suburbs on Saturday, leading to disruption of train and bus services as tracks and roads got waterlogged at several locations, officials said.A Central Railway spokesperson said the suburban train services between Dadar and Kurla stations on the main line were suspended after the water rose above the track level, while a Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) official said that several of its buses had to be diverted due to water-logging at some points.At 10 am on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued a thunderstorm warning for a few districts in Konkan region, including Mumbai, for the next three hours from that time.“Thunderstorms accompanied with lightning and moderate to intense spells of rain with gusty winds 30-40 kmph are likely to occur at isolated places,” the IMD said in its warning for Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad and Ratnagiri districts of Konkan.It had earlier issued an ‘orange alert’ for Mumbai for Saturday. An orange alert implies that authorities should be prepared to handle any situation arising out of severe weather condition.The Central Railway official said, “Due to more than 61.21 mm rainfall in the last one hour, coupled with a high tide of 4.34 metres at 1.32 pm and closing of Mithi river floodgates, water level has been rising on track between Kurla and Sion.”  The suburban services on the Harbour line also slowed down due to water-logging on tracks near Chunabhatti station as a result of “extremely heavy rain”, he said.Trains have been running at a restricted speed for safety reasons, the official said.The operations of local trains on other sections of the main line and other routes, including the Thane-Vashi line, are normal, he added.A Western Railway spokesperson said that the suburban services on their corridors are running without any disruption, but they are closely monitoring the situation.Water-logging was witnessed at several locations in Bandra east, Hindmata, King’s Circle, Kurla Kamani and Wadala.The BEST spokesperson said the undertaking diverted its buses on at least 17 locations due to water-logging on roads.Mumbai has been witnessing heavy rain since Wednesday.

The TMC MP married the Kolkata-based businessman  Jain in June 2019 in Turkey. The wedding ceremony was conducted according to the Turkish Marriage Regulation.Nusrat in her statement also accused Nikhil Jain of mishandling her money and alleged that his family members have held back the jewellery given to her by her parents. "The one who claims to be "rich" and "been used by me" has been taking money from my account by accessing my bank accounts illegally and by illegitimate means at odd hours of the night, even post-separation. I have already taken this up with the concerned banking authority and a police complaint shall be filed shortly," she said in the statement.Jain has claimed that the couple has not been together for the last six months. The indifferences between Nusrat and him became public recently after both of them made startling revelations against each other. A post shared by Nusratian forever ♡ (@nusratjahanews)Jain initially said he didn't want to comment as the matter is in court. Later, the businessman revealed that he pressed Jahan several times to get their marriage registered in India, but she avoided these requests all the time.The issue snowballed into a political controversy as the BJP jumped into the scene alleging that the film actress had cheated the people showing that she is married. BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya posted a video showing the oath taking ceremony of Jahan where she is seen married, and wrote on his Twitter handle: "TMC MP Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain's personal life, who she is married to or who she is living in with, should not be anyone's concern. But she is an elected representative and is on record in the Parliament that she is married to Nikhil Jain.

Thereafter, collection of records and compilation should be completed in three years and disseminated to all concerned,” it stated.The requirement of having war histories written with clear cut policy on declassification of war records was recommended by the Kargil Review Committee headed by K Subrahmanyam as well as N N Vohra Committee in order to analyse lessons learnt and prevent future mistakes.“Post-Kargil War in 1999, GoM (Group of Ministers) recommendations on national security also mentioned the desirability of authoritative war history,” the statement mentioned.

12-06-2021||---||Cong's first love is Pakistan: BJP on Digvijaya Singh's Clubhouse chat leak||New Delhi, June 12Union ministers and the BJP on Saturday slammed Congress leader Digvijay Singh’s remarks that his party would consider reinstating Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir if voted to power.The remarks by Singh were made in a clubhouse chat on the issue where he said this in response to a Pakistan journalist’s question as to what the Congress would do on Article 370 should the BJP be ousted. The BJP was quick to field spokesperson Sambit Patra to question the Congress policy on Pakistan, with union ministers Jitendra Singh and Giriraj Singh following up.Congress has a history of siding with Pakistan, said Patra attacking Singh and reminding, “This is the same Congress leader who said Mumbai attacks were an RSS conspiracy.”“We demand a clarification from Rahul Gandhi on the remarks of Digvijay Singh. What do Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have to say? This club house is a grouping of people who hate PM Narendra Modi and in their hatred for him hate India too. What we heard in the club house was no coincidence. It was stage managed and part of the Congress toolkit we flagged earlier. We want to ask what locus did a Pakistan journalist have in assuming a scenario of BJP’s ouster from power? And Digvijay Singh thanked the Pakistan journalist,” said Patra. Minister of State in PMO Jitendra Singh joined the issue saying it is precisely this mindset of the Congress, which has sown the seeds of separatism in Kashmir and facilitated Pak designs in the Valley. Another minister Giriraj Singh attacked the Congress saying the Congress's first love is Pakistan.“Digvijay Singh conveyed Rahul Gandhi's message to Pakistan. Congress will help Pakistan in grabbing Kashmir,” Giriraj Singh said. Digvijay sought to clarify issues saying “the uneducated segment does not know the difference between shall and consider”.The Congress leader said he only said the issue could be considered and did not say anything definitively.BJP IT head Amit Malviya said “In a Club House chat, Rahul Gandhi’s top aide Digvijaya Singh tells a Pakistani journalist that if Congress comes to power they will reconsider the decision of abrogating Article 370…Really? This is exactly what Pakistan wants.”The Congress officially said the party has clearly stated its position on JK in a CWC resolution of August 6, 2019.“This is the official position of the party. We urge all leaders to refer to it,” Congress spokesman Pawan Khera said. The CWC had then said that Article 370 is a constitutional recognition of the Instrument of Accession of JK to the union of India and it should have been honoured until amended in accordance with the Constitution and after consultations with the people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congs-first-love-is-pakistan-bjp-on-digvijaya-singhs-clubhouse-chat-leak-267331
12-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: 213 new Covid cases; CM says people came together, succeeded in controlling 2nd wave||The national capital recorded 213 new Covid-19 cases, the lowest in over three months, and 28 fatalities on Saturday, as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal praised the people of Delhi, saying they have together faced the second wave of the pandemic with struggle and discipline and “succeeded in controlling it”.According to the latest health bulletin, these new fatalities pushed the death toll from Covid-19 here to 24,800.The city reported 213 new cases on Saturday while the positivity rate dipped to 0.30 per cent, the health bulletin said.On Thursday, the city had recorded 305 new cases with a positivity rate of 0.41 per cent, and 45 deaths, while the daily tally was 238 on Friday with 0.31 per cent positivity rate, and 24 deaths.On March 8, Delhi had recorded 239 new cases and on March 9, the daily tally was 320, according to official data.The infection rate, which had reached 36 per cent in the last week of April, has come down to below one per cent now.Kejriwal on Saturday simultaneously inaugurated 22 new PSA oxygen plants at nine hospitals across Delhi to bolster the preparations of the government in anticipation of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.“These new oxygen plants at nine hospitals across Delhi being added today to strengthen our preparations to fight Covid,” he said, adding these plants have a total production capacity of 17.3 MT, and 17 more oxygen plants will be started by July.He also cautioned that the chances of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic were quite real, asserting that his government was preparing to combat it on a “war-footing”.Delhi had been reeling under a brutal second wave of the pandemic that had swept the country, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with the recent oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals, adding to the woes.Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling up, with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20; rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths, as per the official data.However, the number of cases have shown a downward trend and the positivity rate too has been shrinking in the last several days. The number of deaths per day has also been showing a decline in the last couple of days.During the online event on Saturday, Kejriwal congratulated the people of Delhi, saying they have together faced the Covid second wave with struggle and discipline and “succeeded in controlling it”.On May 15, he had said, “The virus is reducing in Delhi slowly and steadily, and I hope it diminishes completely and does not rise again. However, we are not going to become negligent in anyway”, while sounding a tone of caution.A total of 71,513 tests, including 50,766 RT-PCR tests and 20,747 rapid antigen tests, were conducted a day ago, according to the health bulletin on Saturday.The number of cumulative cases on Saturday stood at 14,30,884. Over 14 lakh patients have recovered from the infection.The number of active cases decreased to 3,610 on Saturday from 3,922 a day before, according to the bulletin.The number of people under home isolation dipped to 1,123 from 1,238 on Friday while the number of containment zones dropped to 7,062 from 8,032 a day before, the bulletin said.

12-06-2021||Washington||Some Indian govt actions raised concerns that are inconsistent with its democratic values, says top US official||India remains the world’s largest democracy with a strong rule of law but some of the Indian government’s actions, including restrictions on freedom of expression, have raised concerns that are inconsistent with the country’s democratic values, a top US official has told lawmakers.Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Dean Thompson’s remarks came during a Congressional hearing on Democracy in the Indo-Pacific on Wednesday at the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia and Nonproliferation.“India remains the world’s largest democracy with a strong rule of law and independent judiciary and enjoys a strong and growing strategic partnership with the United States,” Thompson said.“However, some of the Indian government’s actions have raised concerns that are inconsistent with India’s democratic values,” he said.“This includes increasing restrictions on freedom of expression and the detention of human rights activists and journalists,” he said.Thompson said the US regularly engages in and on these issues, including the important work of civil society.India has previously rejected criticism by foreign governments and human rights groups on allegations that civil liberties have eroded in the country.The government has asserted that India has well established democratic practices and robust institutions to safeguard the rights of all.The government has emphasised that the Indian Constitution provides for adequate safeguards under various statutes for ensuring the protection of human rights.Responding to a question from lawmakers, Thompson said the US has been concerned in Pakistan and Bangladesh about some of the restrictions on journalists that have been there.“Similarly, at times, that has happened in India; though, I think, India, we can say, has a very vibrant press overall that reports very freely on its government,” he said.Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan, who represents a Congressional district from Pennsylvania, raised the issue of Kashmir during the Congressional hearing.“Although of course, they’re two great democracies, democracies including ours and India’s are not without their flaws and problems. I do have a pretty big (number of) Kashmiris in my community and there is, of course, concern about the treatment of the Kashmir people,” she said.“What is the dialogue that is ongoing between the administration and the Indian government on these human rights issues broadly, if you could share a little bit there?” she asked.Thompson said that the Biden administration routinely raises issues related to a vast array of rights and democratic issues with India.“Kashmir is one area where we have urged them to return to normalcy as quickly as possible, including we’ve seen some steps taken: The release of prisoners, the restoration of 4G access, things of that nature. There are other electoral steps we’d like to see them take and that we have encouraged them to do and will continue to do so,” Thompson said.Congressman Steve Chabot said that by many accounts, the US and India, as the world’s two largest democracies, are uniquely poised to join forces in promoting democratic values in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.“And I’m assuming that this administration would agree with that. If so, what initiatives does this administration intend to pursue to take advantage of that unique relationship between the US and India as the two largest democracies?” he asked.“We are, right now, through our global comprehensive strategic partnership with India looking at areas where we can work together to strengthen across the region the effects of the ability of countries to push back on malign influence and through the Quad initiative where we brought in Japan and Australia, as well,” Thompson replied.Initiated in 2007, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad is an informal grouping of the US, India, Australia and Japan.The Quad member countries have resolved to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the region.The US has a tremendous opportunity to work together with four like-minded countries, all democracies, that are looking at ways we can help deliver tremendous relief in the wake of COVID-19, Thompson said.“They can look at how we set standards and work together on critical technologies and diversifying supply chains. And finally can fight climate change and work on improving the environmental situation across the region,” he said.Congresswoman Houlahan said the United States and India, the world’s two largest democracies, are uniquely placed to join forces in promoting a democratic system and democratic values in the Indo-Pacific region, specifically, and probably beyond.The United States, Thompson said, has a global comprehensive strategic partnership with India.The US is looking at ways to both strengthen India’s ability to be a positive player and influencer throughout the region, including the Quad.“The Quad relationship is extremely important because of the ASEAN centrality and the vast regional reach that it has for us to be able to bring these kinds of democratic ideals across the board,” he said.“Our ability to leverage each other’s assistance programmes and complement one another where relationships may be stronger between us in a country versus India in a country or vice versa, there’s a great, leveraging opportunity there,” said the State Department official.“As is the case around the world, the Chinese government uses a combination of economic levers and soft power to pressure South Asian countries to align with its interests, and smaller countries are especially vulnerable to this pressure,” Thomson said.

12-06-2021||New Delhi||Pilot camp restless over not getting due in govt, closing ranks to press demands||Tensions simmered within the Congress in Rajasthan on Saturday with the Sachin Pilot camp getting increasingly restless over allegedly not being given their due in the government, and were seen closing ranks for pressing their demands strongly.An All India Congress Committee (AICC) panel formed to sort out differences between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and the Pilot camp is yet to come up with a solution.Congress leader Sachin Pilot is currently in Delhi and plans to stay till Sunday. Pilot's Delhi tour comes in backdrop of his loyalist MLAs making comments on the internal issues of the party, including an MLA sending his resignation to the Assembly Speaker.AICC in-charge of the state Ajay Maken on Friday had said: “Vacant positions in the Cabinet, Boards and Commissions would be filled soon and we are in talks with all”. When asked if senior party leader Pilot is angry, Maken had said: “I am speaking to Pilot ji on a regular basis. Had he been angry, he would not be speaking to me”.When asked if senior party leader Sachin Pilot is angry, the former Union Minister said, "I am speaking to Pilotji on a regular basis. Had he been angry, he would not be speaking to me."After senior leader Jitin Prasada switched to the BJP on Wednesday, Pilot raked up the issue of non-resolution of commitments made to him."It has now been 10 months. I was given to understand that there would be swift action by the committee, but now half of the term is done, and those issues haven't been resolved. It is unfortunate that so many of the party workers who worked and gave their all for getting us the mandate are not being heard," Pilot said.On Thursday, six MLAs met Pilot at his residence. All the six were part of the 18 MLAs who had rebelled against Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and had camped in a hotel in Gurugram.On Thursday, at least five Congress leaders had met Pilot at his Jaipur home.Former minister Vishvendra Singh held a one-on-one meeting with him. Later, Ved Prakash Solanki, Mukesh Bhakar, Ramniwas Gawria and Rakesh Pareek reached his residence.They questioned the “delay” in cabinet expansion and political appointments by Gehlot.Leaders close to Pilot said they are losing patience over the long wait for getting their due and claim they are being “pressured” by Chief Minister Gehlot to leave Pilot’s side.However, they asserted that they will fight “for their rights” within the party framework.According to sources within the Pilot camp, the former Rajasthan deputy chief minister is regularly in touch with Maken for ironing out issues and for redressal of grievances.When reached out for a comment and asked if he would meet senior Congress leaders here, Pilot refused to comment.Sources close to Pilot said the delay in the redressal of grievances as promised by the party high command was irking the leaders associated with him, and alleged that the chief minister is refusing to give them their due.The Congress government in Rajasthan was on the verge of collapse after Pilot along with 19 disgruntled MLAs raised a banner of revolt last year.Hectic consultations with rebel leaders led by Pilot helped the Congress save its government and its state unit from a division.Congress president Sonia Gandhi had set up a three-member panel of Maken, AICC general secretary organisation K C Venugopal and senior party leader Ahmed Patel to iron out differences within the state leadership.Pilot on Friday rejected a claim made on a television show by BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi that she had spoken to him about the possibility of joining the BJP.“Rita Bahuguna Joshi said she spoke to Sachin. She might have spoken to Sachin Tendulkar (the cricketer). She doesn’t have the courage to speak to me,” the Congress leader had told reporters in Jaipur during his party’s protest over fuel prices.Also, Congress MLA Hemaram Choudhary met Pilot in Jaipur on Friday morning, his first public visit to the state capital after sending in his resignation to Speaker P C Joshi on May 18.Pilot loyalist PR Meena on Friday called for an expansion of the Gehlot ministry.“The party high command should take a decision at the earliest because everyone is waiting,” he said.Meena had asserted that he stood firmly behind Pilot and “would even die” for him.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilot-camp-restless-over-not-getting-due-in-govt-closing-ranks-to-press-demands-267327
12-06-2021||Aizawl||4 children killed as massive landslide sweeps away building in Mizoram’s Aizawl||Four children were killed and two others injured as a massive landslide swept away a building at Aizawl in Mizoram, police said on Saturday.The incident happened around 9.30 pm on Friday at Thuampui neighbourhood in the Bawngkawn police station area in the northeastern part of the city, they said.An Assam-type building, in which a seven-member family lived, was swept away by the retaining wall that collapsed due to a landslip, triggered by rain, police said.Six of the seven family members were present in the house at the time of the incident, they said.Four children, aged between three and 16, died on the spot.The head of the family, Lalbiakzuala (75), escaped from the debris and another member was rescued alive, police said.The bodies were recovered from the debris during the rescue operation launched by police and local volunteers soon after the incident.The last body to be recovered was that of a 16-year- old girl, who was killed along with her twin sister, around 6 am on Saturday, police said.Three occupants of another building, which stood below, managed to escape when they heard the loud noise of the landslide.

12-06-2021||United Nations||India says it desires ‘normal’ neighbourly ties with all countries, including Pakistan||India has said it desires “normal” neighbourly relations with all countries, including Pakistan, and asserted that the onus is on Islamabad to create a “conducive atmosphere” and not allow its territory to be used for cross-border terrorism against India in any manner.The remarks by Counsellor in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN, R Madhu Sudan came at the UN General Assembly meeting on ‘Report of the Security Council for 2020’ on Friday. “India desires normal neighbourly relations with all countries, including Pakistan. Our consistent position is that issues, if any, between India and Pakistan should be resolved bilaterally and peacefully, in an atmosphere free of terror, hostility and violence,” Sudan said in the General Assembly.“The onus is on Pakistan to create such a conducive atmosphere, including by taking credible, verifiable action to not allow any territory under its control to be used for cross-border terrorism against India in any manner,” he added.Speaking earlier, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Munir Akram raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during his remarks.Sudan said it is rather “unfortunate” that Pakistan continued to indulge in “theatrics not befitting” the forum.“It is clear that the international community is not getting fooled by this delegation anymore,” he said, adding that the country sought to exploit the UNGA forum and “once again raised matters internal to my country.”       Sudan asserted that the decision taken by the Parliament of India on Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are “matters internal to India.”India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated it into two Union territories.India, currently serving a two-year term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member, further said that as a member of the 15-nation Council it will continue its efforts along with other elected members to pursue reforms in the working methods and for better reporting to the General Assembly.Sudan said the General Assembly debates on the reports of the Security Council time and again have sought more in-depth analysis by the Council of its work in the annual reports.“Unfortunately, this request has not been heeded to by the Council, whose functioning is based on anachronistic working methods centred around the principle of decision making by consensus. This principle affects mostly the elected members, who ironically hold the majority voice in the Council,” he said.He said India believes it is important for the Security Council to pay more attention to its report to the General Assembly rather than view it as a mere formality.“The General Assembly is indeed the most representative organ of the United Nations. The fact that there exists a separate provision in the UN Charter mandating such a report by the Security Council itself shows the importance with which this report is viewed.“Hence, the annual report of the Security Council must inform, highlight and analyse the measures that it has decided upon or taken to maintain international peace and security during the reporting period.”India also reiterated the need for analysis of the UN peacekeeping operations, the flagship tool for the maintenance of international peace and security.“We need more information on how peacekeeping operations are run, the problems they face, on why certain mandates are set or changed, or on when and why they are strengthened, scaled-down or ended. As most peacekeepers are contributed by non-Council members, who put the lives of their troops at risk to serve the cause of international peace, a better partnership between the Security Council and the Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) is needed,” he said.

India, along with Australia, South Korea and South Africa, is an invitee to the event at the sea-side resort in the city of Cornwall.The theme for the Summit is ‘Build Back Better’ and the host, UK, has outlined four priority areas for its period of Presidency of the G-7.These four agenda points include leading the global recovery from Covid while strengthening resilience against future pandemics; promoting future prosperity by championing free and fair trade and championing shared values and open societies. The fourth is ‘tackling climate change and preserving the planet’s biodiversity’.Any agenda on the pandemic at such a high-level meet will expectedly seek a deeper probe into the origin of the virus, which is so far suspected to have leaked form a lab in Wuhan, China.

Even as many states chose to restrict movement to reduce stress on the healthcare system, we realise that future waves can at best be prevented or at worst mitigated through aggressive and widespread vaccination,” authors say in a pre print submitted for peer review.The study found the protective effect of vaccination in preventing infection, hospitalisation, need for oxygen and ICU admission to be 65 per cent, 77 per cent, 92 per cent and 94 per cent, respectively, which means vaccines offer this level of protection to health workers who accepted the doses.The research is critical when the second dose coverage of Indian health and frontline workers is a dismal 56 per cent and 47 per cent and first dose coverage is 84 and 85 per cent, respectively.CMC, a 2,600-bed tertiary care hospital with 10,600 employees, vaccinated 8,991 staff (84.8 per cent) between January 21, 2021 and April 30. A majority (93.4 per cent) received Covishield, and the remainder, Covaxin.Reporting the incidence of symptomatic Covid infection among HCWs nearly a month after the first dose and later, the researchers say, “The median time from first dose to development of infection was 77 days and coincided with the second peak in India during April and May 2021. Thirty-three HCWs developed infection within two weeks of the second dose of vaccine. Among the 7080 fully vaccinated HCWs, 679 (9.6 per cent) developed infection 47 days after the second dose. The risk of infection among fully vaccinated HCWs was significantly lower when compared with unvaccinated HCWs.”The only staff member who died since the beginning of the pandemic had multiple co-morbidities and had not taken the vaccine.A previous study of 23,324 HCWs in the UK reported vaccine coverage of 89 per cent and in a two-month follow up, symptomatic and asymptomatic infections occurred in 80 participants (3.8 per ent) among vaccinated and 977 (38 per cent) among unvaccinated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/94-protection-against-serious-illness-in-vaccinated-docs-study-267226

12-06-2021||New Delhi||Uttarakhand disaster due to rock & ice avalanche: Study||The February 7 disaster in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, which resulted in over 200 dead or missing, was the result of an avalanche that dropped about 27 million cubic metres of rock and glacier ice from nearby Ronti Peak, according to a study by an international team of researchers.The region experienced the tragedy when a wall of debris and water barrelled down the Ronti Gad, Rishiganga and Dhauliganga river valleys.To investigate the cause, scope and impacts of the disaster, a global team of 53 scientists came together in the days following the tragedy.The researchers, including those from Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi and Indian Institute of Technology Indore, determined that the flood was caused by falling rock and glacier ice that melted on its descent, and not by a lake or diverted river.The study, published in the journal Science on Thursday, suggests that climate change is contributing to such events happening more frequently, and highlights risks of increasing development projects in fragile environments.The avalanche rapidly transformed into an extraordinarily large and mobile debris flow, the researchers said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-disaster-due-to-rock-ice-avalanche-study-267235

Bharat Biotech said it would pursue the FDA’s advice for full approval, which, when granted to Covaxin, would be the first for any Indian vaccine manufacturer.Edit: Poor vaccination rateHeart inflammation post Pfizer, Moderna shot?A top US disease control agency is reviewing reports of heart inflammation in male teens, young adults after Pfizer and Moderna 2nd dose.Virbhadra tests +ve 2nd time in 2 monthsAfter testing Covid positive on April 12, HP ex-CM Virbhadra Singh again tested positive on Friday.From june 14, No RT-PCR report needed to enter Himachal PradeshThe HP Government has allowed some relaxations from June 14, including entry into the state without RT-PCR report and intra-state transport.FRESH CASES 91,702TOTAL DEATHS 3,63,079ACTIVE CASES 11,21,671The government said though it respected the FDA’s decision, it won’t impact Covaxin use in India. “We have ample safety data. The phase-3 trial figures will be available in a week,” said Niti Aayog Member (Health) VK Paul.He said as sought, additional data had been submitted to the WHO to take a call on vaccine passports for Covaxin. So far, the vaccine had received green signal from 14 countries and approvals were in process in over 50 other nations, he said.The development came on a day India’s national positivity rate fell to 4.49 per cent after two and a half months and new cases dropped to the peak of the first wave. The government, however, cautioned people against laxity saying it was no time to party or crowd. The government also launched preparations for the fourth round of national sero survey to be done this month to determine the scale of infection and asked states to conduct their own surveys to facilitate local policy decisions. Paul said the situation appeared to be stabilising but the moment people dropped their guard, the chain of transmission would form and cases would rise again. “If we want geographies to be protected, states have to do their own sero surveys to enable local policy decisions,” said Paul. The last sero survey had put Covid prevalence rate in adults at 25 per cent (25 per cent people had developed antibodies against Covid). “The recovery rate has surged from 81.8 per cent on May 3 to 94.9 per cent today and new recoveries have exceeded new cases for 29 days,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-declines-emergency-use-clearance-for-covaxin-267173

You should not have doubt… You can’t say you want inquiries to be done outside the state.

The PM is learnt to have been reviewing the performance of top ministers with Nadda for some days now.The deliberations among the top BJP leaders at the PM’s residence came a day after Shah met UP party allies, including Apna Dal’s Anupriya Patel, who was a minister in the first Modi government. There was no official word from the party on these deliberations.The BJP has been reviewing its organisation and government works in various states. Nadda has held a meeting with the party general secretaries where, besides the relief work carried out during the Covid pandemic, the BJP performance in the recent Assembly polls were reportedly reviewed. With the party now gearing up for the next round of Assembly polls in five states early next year, including the all-important Uttar Pradesh, it is expected to initiate various measures to bolster support among various sections. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prime-minister-narendra-modi-meets-amit-shah-jp-nadda-amid-cabinet-rejig-buzz-267205
12-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre to review new studies if vax needed post recovery||Amid a raging debate on whether the Covid infected should get vaccinated, the government on Friday said India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) could review its decision if new evidence emerges. Experts from the Indian Public Health Association, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine and Indian Association of Epidemiologists have mentioned in a report to PM Narendra Modi that there is no need to vaccinate those with documented Covid-19 infection. NITI Aayog Member VK Paul today noted, “Respected institutions have submitted their views and we will consider these and also engage the experts one on one. Whether the Covid infected should or should not take a vaccine would be decided through the institutional mechanism which is in place for the purpose. The NTAGI meets regularly to study emerging evidence and to decide on policy.”Fauci warns against stretching vax intervalAnthony Fauci, Medical Advisor to US President, says doses should be kept at a reasonable schedule as extending intervals could expose people to one of the variants, as seen in the UK. The UK had extended the interval between AstraZeneca shots and then revised it back to 8 weeks.Paul said the current recommendation from NTAGI is that the Covid infected should take the shots three months after recovery (the WHO recommends shots six months post recovery).“If more data emerges, the policy can be nuanced. It is dynamic. There is no hardcore ideological position in science. Suggestions will be appropriately discussed. NTAGI consists of experts who are globally commended,” said Paul, advocating the same thought when asked if the gap between two Covishield doses – recently placed at 12 to 16 weeks – should be revised to eight weeks, as the UK has done. The experts in their report to the PM have said, “Those infected with Covid may be vaccinated after there’s evidence that the vaccine is beneficial after natural infection.” They have also argued against the current mass indiscriminate vaccination.“Vaccinating the vulnerable and those at risk, instead of mass population-wide inoculation, should be the aim at present,” the report said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-review-new-studies-if-vax-needed-post-recovery-267210

We did not profit much by his presence. I don’t think we shall lose much by his decision to leave. Dilip Ghosh, bengal bjp chiefRoy, national vice-president of the BJP and party MLA from Krishnanagar Uttar constituency, turned up at the TMC office in Kolkata this afternoon with his former MLA son Subhrangshu Roy (38). They were welcomed back into the TMC by party’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee in the presence of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Apparently, Roy was contemplating returning to the TMC as far back as March this year when the Assembly elections were underway in the state.Banerjee said, “Roy did not utter a single word against the TMC during the Assembly elections.” She said those turncoats who had attacked the TMC at the time of elections and “betrayed” the party would not be taken back to the party.Mukul joined the BJP in 2017. Roy’s name had figured in the Narada sting case being probed by the CBI. Roy’s critics claimed that he switched to BJP to avoid CBI action. Asked what led him to return to the TMC, Roy said he would soon give a detailed written statement on this. “I could not do BJP. I will not do BJP. That is why I have returned to my original home,” he said without specifying any particular reason.Banerjee said Roy was forced to join the BJP. “Agency was used to intimidate him,” she added. The CM said, “I had noticed that his heath was deteriorating. It is not possible to work for the BJP. There is so much repression, so much cruelty.....there is no place there for any human value.”Meanwhile, BJP’s Bengal MP Swapan Dasgupta today tweeted, “An election setback is of concern. The task of Bengal BJP is to draw the lessons and move ahead. These steps are underway and will become evident. There’s no cause for new and old karyakartas to be dispirited and go into a shell. The BJP will build on the 2.2 crore votes and enlarge its reach.” While the BJP leadership dismissed as “inconsequential” Roy’s ‘ghar wapsi’, also calling him an “opportunist” who passed on “internal information of BJP to TMC”, there are concerns in the party which also draws significant strength from the play of perceptions.This is also almost the first instance when a leader of Roy’s designation (vice president) has walked out of the BJP under Modi-Shah. “He was someone who was suitably accommodated in the organisation,” party leaders say.While Roy was said to be upset over being denied the Leader of Opposition post and the increasing clout of Suvendu Adhikari, his return may have just opened doors to other former TMC leaders, observers say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mukul-son-back-in-trinamool-267217

No, this isn't the beginning of a political joke.What it is in fact is a wedding invitation that's left many scratching their heads. A wedding invitation that was published in Tamil newspaper 'Jan Shakti', the mouthpiece of CPI on Monday, and has since gone viral says P Mamata Banerjee will marry AM Socialism.The invite also mentions the names of the groom's elder siblings—AM Communism and AM Leninism.CPI sources said Socialism is the son of party's Salem secretary A Mohan alias Stalin Mohan and the bride is the granddaughter of a Congressman, who named her after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee after being inspired by her actions and style of functioning. Mohan, who is also councillor of Panamarathupatti town, said he wanted his future generations to carry forward the ideology of Communism.He said his grandson is named Marxism."If a girl is born in the family, I will name her Cubaism," he said.On naming his first son Communism, he said that was due to the propaganda that Communism would not prosper after the fall of the Soviet Union."I decided to name him communism as I felt that communism will exist till the world and human race exist," he said, adding that many people had named their offspring Romania, Vietnam, and Russia in the region.So he named his second son Leninism and third one Socialism who is getting married to P Mamata Banerjee on Sunday, Mohan said.On publishing the invitation in the party mouthpiece, he said the family was not able to invite relatives and other people due to the Covid-19 restrictions. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-banerjee-to-marry-socialism-in-tamil-nadu-on-june-13-266886

In general, a USCIS officer will issue an RFE or NOID when the officer determines additional information or explanation that may potentially establish eligibility for an immigration benefit.“We are taking action to eliminate policies that fail to promote access to the legal immigration system and will continue to make improvements that help individuals navigate the path to citizenship, and that modernise our immigration system,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas.“These policy measures are consistent with the Biden-Harris administration's priorities to eliminate unnecessary barriers to our nation's legal immigration system and reduce burdens on non-citizens who may be eligible for immigration benefits,” said Acting USCIS Director Tracy Renaud.“USCIS is committed to promoting policies and procedures that ensure we operate in a fair, efficient, and humane manner that reflects America's heritage as a land of opportunity for those who seek it.”According to the 2018 policy, the USCIS adjudicators had full discretion to deny applications, petitions, and requests without first issuing an RFE or NOID, when required initial evidence is not submitted or the evidence of record fails to establish eligibility.The USCIS also said that they will increase the current one-year validity period on both initial and renewal EADs to two years for certain adjustment of status applicants. Increasing the validity period on EADs for certain adjustment applicants is expected to reduce the number of employment authorisation requests USCIS receives and allow the agency to shift limited resources to other priority areas. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uscis-reverses-trump-era-policy-denying-certain-immigrant-visa-applications-266846

From now my voice will only grow louder," she wrote on Facebook.According to the FIR lodged by Kavaratti police, a case under sections 124 A (sedition) and 153 B (hate speech) of the Indian Penal code has been registered against the filmmaker."The BJP leader who filed the case hails from Lakshadweep.While he betrays his native land, I will keep fighting for it. It is the betrayers who will find themselves alone tomorrow," she said in her post.Khader, in his complaint, said that Sulthana, during a debate in a Malayalam TV channel, had alleged that the Central government used biological weapons for the spread of COVID-19 in Lakshadweep."Now to the people of Lakshadweep: The sea protects you, and you protect it in return. What the betrayers have and what we don't is fear," Sulthana said in the post.The BJP leader, in his complaint, has alleged that Sulthana's was an anti-national act, which tarnished the "patriotic image" of the central government and sought action against her.The Lakshadweep-based model and actor Sulthana has worked with several Malayalam filmmakers.An archipelago located in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep has been witnessing protests by locals over the recent actions and administrative reforms being implemented byisland administrator, Praful Khoda Patel.The residents are seeking repeal of the proposed Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation, the Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (PASA or the Goondas Act) and the Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation (LAPR).Since then, social media has been flooded with #SaveLakshadweep, with thousands of others trending the hashtag.Expressing solidarity with the people of Lakshadweep, the Kerala Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution on May 31, demanding the recall of the administrator and requesting that the Centre immediately intervene to protect the lives and livelihood of the islanders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sedition-case-against-lakshadweep-activist-aisha-sultana-for-bio-weapon-remark-266834

We direct the exam to be postponed by one month," said a Bench led by Justice Indira Banerjee.The examination can be held anytime after the expiry of one month, it said.Noting that the situation in Delhi has improved but in other places figures were high, the Bench sought to know from AIIMS if the examination could be postponed by a month.Advocate Dushyant Parashar, representing AIIMS, opposed postponement of examination."Staying the exam will create an unprecedented crisis. One thousand doctors will be recruited by this exam. The petitioners can apply in the next September session exam. If stay is granted there will be no doctors," Parashar argued."These doctors are on Covid duty. How will they appear for exam?" wondered the Bench, which also included Justice MR Shah.A group of 26 doctors had moved the top court against the holding of INI CET Exam 2021, contending that it went against the assurance regarding postponement of PG Examinations given by the PMO while postponing the NEET PG Examination, 2021 by four months.The students were assured that they will be given at least one month to prepare for the examination and holding the examination during the pandemic would increase pressure on graduate doctors. They also cited how Class 12 examinations were cancelled."Conducting of this examination is resulting in endangering the life of thousands of doctors who are frontline workers in different hospitals which is a clear negation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India," they contended.Highlighting the fact that only 19-day prior notice was given, they submitted that examination centres were in different states or far from the candidates’ place of working requiring them to travel during restrictions due to Covid lockdown.They said many of the doctors were not fully vaccinated and had not even received the first jab of Covid vaccine."In the prevailing circumstances due to Covid, the conducting of this examination is resulting in building up pressure on the graduate doctors from across India to sit for the examination on 16th June, 2021, when under the present circumstances the Board examinations and other professional examinations have been either cancelled or postponed," the petitioners submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-postpones-ini-cet-exam-2021-by-a-month-266832
12-06-2021||New Delhi||Yogi meets PM Modi amid reports of dissent, speculation of Cabinet reshuffle||A day after meeting Home Minister Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president JP Nadda on Friday amid the prevailing buzz around “dissent” in the state BJP and the possibility of a Cabinet rejig “soon” to balance the crucial caste equations in the poll-bound state.Later, Prime Minister Modi held a separate meeting with Shah and Nadda, say sources, adding that a decision on the induction of new faces, including from NDA allies in the state Apna Dal and Nishad Party, in the Adityanath Cabinet, can be expected “soon”. Sources say Jitin Prasada, a former Congress leader from UP who recently marked a high-profile entry into the saffron party, had called on Adityanath last evening. The buzz also is that PM may also induct some leaders from poll-bound states, including UP, in his Cabinet to give a leg-up to party's prospects.Though leaders close to Adityanath insisted these were normal meetings to discuss “the current situation in the state, including future course of management of the Covid-19, and upcoming elections”, sources say important decisions were taken in the string of meetings over these two days. This was also the first time Adityanath met the PM, Shah, and Nadda in person since political turmoil hit the state BJP along with the second wave of the Covid-19. Apart from reports of “differences” between Adityanath and the PM over the induction of former Gujarat-cadre IAS officer Arvind Kumar Sharma in the UP Cabinet, the CM’s detractors claimed “other issues” as well. Apparently, the central leadership is also upset over the way UP’s high-profile Chief Minister has been managing the party affairs in the state and doing public outreach “without giving due prominence to the PM”. Interestingly, much was also read over why the PM did not wish Adityanath publicly on his birthday a couple of days back.   The sources claim the discussion revolved around prevailing anger among people and state leaders over Covid “mismanagement” in the second wave, ways to make amends ahead of Assembly polls and the cabinet expansion/reshuffle. BJP’s performance in recent panchayat polls was also discussed along with "disgruntlement" in the state leadership. One of the key messages for Adityanath, they said, is to “be prepared for the third wave of Covid-19. If the situation is managed well in case that happens, the BJP will win UP”. Apart from giving more prominence to the upset Brahmin community, another message is to build a solid caste matrix with NDA allies. Last evening Apna Dal leader, Anupriya Patel had also met Shah. A minister of state in the first Modi government, Anupriya is looking for a ministerial berth for herself in the Centre and a berth for her husband Ashish Patel in the state. Sources say two leaders of the Nishad Party, Sanjay Nishad and Praveen Nishad—an MP from Sant Kabir Nagar—also want a similar settlement.  Apart from accusations of “mismanagement” and the anti-incumbency factor, Adityanath is also facing allegations of “favouring” the Thakur community at the cost of Brahmins. This despite the presence of several "upper caste leaders”, including Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma and Power Minister Srikant Sharma, in his Cabinet". AK Sharma and Prasada are believed to be part of the re-boot plan to further boost the party's prospects in the state.Many state leaders have been openly critical of Adityanath over “mishandling” of the second wave of the Covid pandemic and have also voiced concern to the top leadership over the impact people’s anger may have on polls next year.Key messages—Get battle-ready for UP by taking along everyone—Be prepared for the third wave of Covid-19—If the situation is managed well, the BJP will win UP—Building caste matrix with allies, Apna Dal, Nishad Party, for OBC/ backward vote banks||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-meets-pm-modi-amid-reports-of-dissent-speculation-of-cabinet-reshuffle-266816
12-06-2021||New Delhi||Congress holds protests across Punjab, Haryana against rise in fuel prices||Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal along with party leaders and workers rode a horse-cart during a protest against the fuel price hike in front of a petrol pump in New Delhi on Monday.The Congress held symbolic protests at petrol pumps across Punjab and Haryana on Friday against the rise in fuel prices, and demanded an immediate rollback of the hikes.Congress workers held placards as they raised slogans during the demonstration against the fuel price hike.Petrol prices have been hovering over Rs 100 a litre for the past few couple of months now.Party leaders Venugopal and Shakti Singh Gohil reached the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium petrol pump on a horse-cart.Venugopal said that under the UPA government, the tax on petrol and diesel stood at Rs 9.20. Now, it is Rs 32.“The government should stop imposing excise duty on petrol and diesel. It should come under the purview of Goods and Services Tax. We demand a complete rollback of fuel price hike,” Venugopal, who is the Congress general secretary, said.Ajay Maken led a protest against rising fuel prices at petrol pumps in Rajinder Nagar and Janpath.Party leaders said protests are being held at petrol pumps across the county by local units in compliance with Covid-19 protocols. Besides the steep hikes in rates of diesel and petrol, prices of other commodities of daily use like cooking oil and gas have also registered a manifold increase, senior leaders of the party said.Protests were held at various places like Amritsar, Mohali, Kurali, Patiala, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Panchkula, Hisar, Gurgaon, Kaithal, Ambala, Panipat, Karnal, Fatehabad, Rohtak and Faridabad.In Amritsar, some protesters set fire to an old car, saying they wanted to send a message to the Centre that common people are unable to afford vehicles because of the high cost of fuel.Carrying posters and placards that read “Jumlon Ki Sarkar”, “Tel Ki Mar” and “Tel Ka Khel”, Congress workers raised slogans against the Centre and demanded a rollback of the price hikes.The party's workers staged a street play in Panchkula to highlight the plight of the common people as a result of the rise in prices of fuel and other essential commodities.Some even rode bullock carts and horse carts as a mark of protest.In Haryana's Kaithal, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala led the protest. A bullock cart was seen pulling a tractor there.Surjewala said prices of diesel and petrol are being increased at a time when the people of the country are battling the pandemic.He said the sharp rise in fuel prices has adversely hit various sections, including the farmers.Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja led a protest in Ambala City.She said the BJP-led government was “insensitive” to the plight of the common people and was putting more burden on them when they were already going through a difficult time.Leading a protest in Kurali, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar said, “The arrogant government at the Centre has constantly been increasing fuel prices instead of providing relief to the people during the current crisis.""During the Congress-led UPA regime, despite international crude oil prices being very high, diesel prices hovered around Rs 50, which is now near Rs 90 per litre, while petrol is touching Rs 100 per litre", he said."Despite international crude oil prices being high, the government led by Dr Manmohan Singh did not allow the burden to be passed on to the people, but just the opposite is happening under the Modi regime," Jakhar added.Punjab Congress leader Raj Kumar Verka said the steep rise in prices of petrol and diesel has broken the backs of the common people amid the COVID-19 pandemic. —with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-holds-protests-across-punjab-haryana-against-rise-in-fuel-prices-266811

All applications have to follow the BLA process, which is the standard process for vaccines. Therefore, for BLA, data from an additional clinical trial will be required to support the marketing application submission for Covaxin,” Biotech said.This process will extend Covaxin timelines for seeking US approvals.So far, Covaxin has received EUA from 14 countries with more than 50 countries in the process.“No vaccine manufactured or developed from India has ever received EUA or full licensure from USFDA. Thus, it will be a great leap for vaccine innovation and manufacturing from India when approved,” Biotech said.Covaxin is yet to secure entry to WHO Emergency Use Listing of Covid vaccines.It has submitted additional data for the purpose.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-eua-to-covaxin-in-us-bharat-biotech-says-working-to-get-full-approval-for-vaccine-266803
12-06-2021||Islamabad||Pak's Assembly passes Bill to give right of appeal to Kulbhushan Jadhav||Pakistan's National Assembly has passed a government-backed bill that will provide the right of appeal to Indian death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav, according to a media report.The National Assembly passed the ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Bill, 2020 on Thursday aimed at allowing alleged Indian spy Jadhav to have consular access in line with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict, the Dawn newspaper reported.Jadhav, the 51-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an "effective review and reconsideration" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.The ICJ, in its 2019 verdict, had asked Pakistan to provide a proper forum for appeal against the sentence given to Jadhav.Speaking after the passage of the bill, Law Minister Farogh Nasim said had they not passed the bill, India would have gone to the UN Security Council and could have moved contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ.Nasim said the bill was being passed in light of the verdict of the ICJ.He said by passing the law, they had proved to the world that Pakistan was a "responsible state".The National Assembly also passed 20 other bills, including the Elections (Amendment) Bill.The Opposition members staged a walkout and pointed out the lack of quorum three times, but each time the chair declared the house in order and continued the business, forcing the Opposition to resort to noisy protest.The Opposition members gathered in front of the Speaker's dais and raised slogans. Criticising the government's move, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) lawmaker Ahsan Iqbal pointed out that it had included the bill in the heavy legislative agenda to provide relief to Jadhav.Iqbal said it was a person-specific bill and the name of Jadhav was mentioned in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the bill.He said when the country's law allowed high courts to review the sentences awarded by military courts then what was the need for bringing the law.The government had already enforced the law through the promulgation of an ordinance in May last year soon after the ICJ verdict in Jadhav's case.Amid stiff resistance offered by Opposition parties, the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Law and Justice on October 21 last year had approved the bill that seeks a review of the conviction of Jadhav.The house also witnessed a rumpus when Pakistan Peoples Party's Raja Pervez Ashraf protested over remarks of Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who had stated that by opposing the bill to provide relief to Jadhav, the Opposition members were toeing the Indian narrative, the paper said.Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asked the speaker to provide some time to the members to see the bills.He criticised the government for first bringing the bill to provide relief to Jadhav through an ordinance and then getting it passed through bulldozing the legislation. Law minister Nasim said he was shocked to see the Opposition's behaviour and it seemed that the opposition had not read the ICJ verdict. He said the ICJ had clearly asked Pakistan to make effective legislation to provide the right of review to Jadhav.

12-06-2021||Washington||India's domestic challenges due to Covid threaten its regional, global ambitions: US think-tank||India's domestic challenges due to COVID-19 crisis have become a threat to its regional and global ambitions, a US think-tank has observed and warned that unless it recovers with the help of allies like the United States, the pandemic could impact the geopolitical balance in the Indo-Pacific.As such, it is in the United States' best interests to help India retain its status as a pre-eminent power in South Asia, particularly in view of China's efforts to bolster its position at the expense of the US and India, it said.The Hudson Institute think-tank said that at the start of the pandemic, India offered medical assistance to its immediate neighbours and followed vaccine diplomacy in the first three months of 2021 which helped India to project itself as a regional leader, advancing its claim of being a global power in waiting."There was optimism that India would be able to counter China's soft power with its own. Now, however, at least over the short term, India's domestic challenges have become a threat to its regional and global ambitions," wrote Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the US, and Hudson research scholar Aparna Pande.Haqqani is currently the director of South and Central Asia at the Hudson Institute. Pande is director, Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia at the think-tank."The recent surge of COVID-19 in South Asia challenges India's traditional ability to aid its smaller neighbours, a change that could, in turn, affect India's influence in its competition with China. "Unless India can recover from this surge with the help of allies like the United States, the pandemic could impact the Indo-Pacific's geopolitical balance," the joint policy memo released by Hudson stated.In the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, India succeeded in occupying the role of a regional leader. But official complacency, disinclination on the part of government leaders to accept the advice of scientific advisors and reluctance to ramp up vaccine production and distribution has seriously damaged India's standing, the think-tank report said.Haqqani and Pande wrote that a year-and-a-half after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, China's footprint in South Asia is larger than it was before. Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka are deeply in debt to China, having borrowed heavily from it due to the pandemic."Unless India, the United States, and the financial institutions led by the democracies provide support, the Maldives and Nepal may also turn towards China for assistance," they warned. Bipartisan support within the US policy community for India has already mobilised Americans to help India. The Joe Biden administration has sent oxygen concentrators, medicines testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment to India, and many US companies and the Indian-American community have rallied to India's support, the think-tank report stated.The Hudson Institute recommended the Biden Administration offers Covid vaccine doses to India and other countries in need of them. In the short term, one way to help India's economy recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would be to reinstate India's Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus status, which the Donald Trump administration removed.“A mini-trade deal could be offered to signal American support for India's economic recovery,” the policy memo said. Noting that India's economy underwent its first recession in 2020, contracting by 10 per cent, it said encouragement for American companies and those of other countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, that are moving out of China, to invest in India would also aid the country in restoring its economic growth.It recommended the Indian government enforces smart lockdowns, engage in vaccine diplomacy and also bolster 'Quad' diplomacy.
