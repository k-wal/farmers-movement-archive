The 23-year-old succumbed to the injuries later. Police have alleged Sushil is the “main culprit and mastermind” of the murder and said that there is electronic evidence wherein he and his associates could be seen beating the 23-year-old with sticks.Sushil is in judicial custody in Mandoli jail and has been kept in a separate cell due to security concerns.

The party has already decided that Chouhan is chief minister...Congress has no right to talk about the BJP’s CM.”On rumours of Cabinet expansion at the Centre and the state, he said it was a prerogative of the prime minister and the chief minister, respectively.

This would result in the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, he contended.“These are some things we do not realise while doing it,” the bench admitted.Appreciating the petitioner for making the good suggestion, the bench directed the state to create awareness or issue instructions to all business houses involved in packing food items, where such practice is in vogue.The matter stands adjourned by four weeks.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal arrested for demanding equal citizenship for all: Pinjra Tod||Activists and various civil society groups came together on Tuesday to mark a year of the arrest of women’s collective Pinjra Tod members Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal under the stringent U Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a case related to the 2020 Delhi riots.In a statement, Pinjra Tod said Narwal and Kalita were arrested because they raised their voice to demand equal and substantive citizenship for all.“Both of them were granted bail in every case against them yet they remain imprisoned on account of the UAPA under FIR 59, an extraordinary law which presumes guilt rather than innocence and accords the State the power to incarcerate people even before the trial commences,” it said.Narwal and Kalita were arrested in May 2020 for allegedly being part of a premeditated conspiracy behind the communal violence that broke out in northeast Delhi in February that year during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).At a virtual meeting organised by Pinjra Tod, speaking about the incarceration of Narwal, Kalita, and others like former JNU student Umar Khalid, activist Jignesh Mevani said the way they were “targeted” was “unfortunate”.He said the UAPA ensures that a person doesn’t get bail.“It is an unconstitutional way of suppressing the voices that the government does not like,” he said.Mevani said people need to “challenge false incarcerations”.“The judiciary needs to hold accountable the police, the politicians and the governments for making false offences,” he said.Former president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) Aishe Ghosh said: “They (Kalita and Narwal) were arrested not only because they were educated but because they were challenging the thought process of BJP, RSS and because they were able to connect to the masses”.“That they were speaking out about how we were not progressing as a society is what the RSS, the BJP did not like. They were asking the community to come together,” she said.Ghosh said people should continue speaking out at all protests and gatherings.“The one thing we should fear is the breaking up of our society. BJP will lose sooner or later, but the society will be broken,” she said.Ghosh said the government targeted people who were becoming role models for their communities.“By imprisoning Umar Khalid, the government wants to teach a lesson to young Muslims, and by imprisoning Natasha and Devangana, they want to teach a lesson to young women.“The government wants to alienate them from the masses,” she claimed.Other speakers at the meeting included writer and activist Farah Naqvi, senior journalist Hartosh Singh Bal, Supreme Court lawyer Shahrukh Alam and human rights activist Mohammad Aamir Khan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/devangana-kalita-natasha-narwal-arrested-for-demanding-equal-citizenship-for-all-pinjra-tod-265486
08-06-2021||New Delhi||CJI has written to CJs to consider SC lawyers for elevation as HC judges, says SCBA Prez||Chief Justice of India NV Ramana has requested chief justices of the 25 high courts to consider lawyers of the Supreme Court for appointment as high court judges, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) said on Tuesday.SCBA President Vikas Singh—who had recently written to the CJI in this regard—said: “The CJI has agreed to the request made by SCBA and has requested the Chief Justices of the High Courts to consider lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court for elevation to their High Courts”.In his May 31 letter to the CJI, Singh had written that the advocates practicing in the Supreme Court were hardly considered for appointment as high court judges by the collegiums. “The experienced and seasoned lawyers practicing in the apex court will prove to be deserving and meritorious judges of high courts,” he had written.On Tuesday, he said the Executive Committee of SCBA has constituted a ''search committee'' which, besides him, comprises the bar body's vice president and senior member Mahalakshmi Pavani and its four members—Rakesh Dwivedi, Shekhar Naphade, Vijay Hansaria and V Giri—to facilitate the process of elevation by identifying deserving and meritorious Supreme Court practitioners.“The High Court Collegium may then consider such names along with the lawyers from the High Court Bar in order to choose the most deserving candidate amongst those available for elevation,” he said.Singh had said that lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court have “vast experience and best exposure in dealing with all kinds of issues relating to civil, criminal, Constitutional, commercial law".“However, they are rarely considered for elevation by the high court collegium as they do not regularly practice before the high court and while being professionally more meritorious than their colleagues at the high court, lose the opportunity for being considered as such,” the letter said.The collegiums, as per the prevalent practice, headed by chief justices of high courts shortlist and recommend names of lawyers practicing there and the judicial officers under service category for appointment as high court judges and the Supreme Court lawyers were hardly considered for elevation, he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-has-written-to-cjs-to-consider-sc-lawyers-for-elevation-as-hc-judges-says-scba-prez-265481

She is an Independent MP backed by the NCP."The application (for caste certificate) was made intentionally to make a fraudulent claim to enable the respondent no.3 (Rana) to contest the election for the post of Member of Parliament on a seat reserved for a Scheduled Caste candidate," the HC court said in its judgement."In our view, since respondent no.3 has obtained the caste certificate fraudulently and got it validated fraudulently from the Caste Scrutiny Committee by producing fabricated and fraudulent documents, such caste certificate is cancelled and stands confiscated," the bench said.It is needless to observe that all the consequences in law providing upon cancellation of such fraudulently obtained caste certificate and caste validity certificate shall follow, the HC added.The court in its judgement also noted the "abysmal" functioning of the scrutiny committee.The HC passed its order on a petition filed by social worker Anandrao Adsule, seeking for cancellation of the caste certificate dated August 30, 2013 issued by Mumbai Deputy Collector, identifying Rana as belonging to the 'Mochi' caste.Adsule later filed a complaint with the Mumbai District Caste Certificate Scrutiny Committee, which ruled in favour of Rana and validated her caste certificate.Adsule then approached the high court.The petitioner's case was that Rana obtained the caste certificate using forged and fabricated documents.It claimed the certificate was obtained under the influence of Navneet Rana's husband Ravi Rana, who was a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly.The high court in its judgement said the order passed by the Scrutiny Committee validating Navneet Rana's caste certificate was "totally perverse, without the application of mind and contrary to the evidence on record".The bench noted that the original birth certificate of Navneet Rana did not mention the caste 'Mochi'."In our view, there are two sets of documents produced by the respondent no.3 (Navneet Rana) which were contradictory to each other before the scrutiny committee. The respondent no.3 had claimed to be 'Sikh Chamar' as well as 'Ravidasiya Mochi'," the HC said.The court further said the scrutiny committee has caused "injustice" to the petitioner and has put its "imprimatur on such fraudulent caste claim"."A wrong caste validity certificate granted in favour of the party who does not belong to that caste may deprive a genuine and deserving person belonging to such reserve category of the caste of the benefits prescribed in the Constitution of India," the court said in its order.The HC said in its view, the terms 'Chamar' and 'Mochi' are not synonymous and are different identities.The scrutiny committee did its job "rather sloppily and shirked the obligations" imposed on it, the HC observed."The scrutiny committee has totally ignored the objections raised by the complainant and also by the Vigilance Cell in respect of the documents (submitted by Navneet Rana to support her claim that she belongs to Mochi caste)," it said.It said the scrutiny committee allowed the caste claim in favour of Navneet Rana even though she failed to "discharge her burden by producing authentic and clear evidence".The HC noted that the core function of the scrutiny committee while verifying caste certificates is the investigation carried out by its vigilance cell."The scrutiny committee is not an adjudicating authority but an administrative body that verifies facts, investigates into a specific claim of caste status and ascertains whether the caste/tribe status claim is correct or not," the court said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-cancels-caste-certificate-of-amravati-mp-navneet-rana-265477
08-06-2021||New Delhi||Ensure there's no break in education of children orphaned by Covid-19: SC tells states,UTs||The Supreme Court has ordered the states and union territories to ensure that there is no break in the education of children who have become orphans or lost either one parent during the Covid-19 pandemic.“The State Governments/Union Territories are directed to make provisions for continuance of education of the children both in Government as well as in private schools,” a Bench led by Justice LN Rao said.“The other issues…relating to the protection of property rights of the children, further education of the children including employment opportunities, special care to be taken in respect of the girl child will be taken up on the next date of hearing,” it said.“The State Governments/Union Territories are directed to take action against those NGOs/individuals who are indulging in illegal adoptions,” the top court ordered.It also directed the states and union territories “to prevent any NGO from collecting funds in the names of the affected children by disclosing their identity and inviting interested persons to adopt them. No adoption of affected children should be permitted contrary to the provisions of the JJ Act, 2015.”The order came after Additional Solicitor General KM Natraj pointed out on behalf of the National Commission of Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) that certain NGOs were collecting funds in the names of the affected children and that their identity was being disclosed in public announcements by certain unscrupulous agencies and individuals who were inviting interested persons to adopt such orphaned children.“Invitation to persons for adoption of orphans is contrary to law as no adoption of a child can be permitted without the involvement of CARA. Stringent action shall be taken by the State Governments/Union Territories against agencies/individuals who are responsible for indulging in this illegal activity,” it ordered.The top court—which had earlier taken up suo motu cognizance of the spread of Covid-19 in children homes—is seized of an application filed by amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal seeking identification of orphaned children due to Covid-19 or otherwise and providing them immediate relief.The court directed Agrawal to contact the nodal officers to be appointed by the states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, Uttarakhand, NCT of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and UT of Jammu and Kashmir to obtain the information relating to welfare of children in a dolorous state due to loss of their parent/parents and submit a report by July 27, the next date of hearing.“The State Governments/Union Territories are directed to give wide publicity not only to the provisions of the JJ Act, 2015 but also to the several schemes that have been announced by the Central Government and the State Governments/Union Territories benefiting the children who have become orphans and children in need of care and protection,” it said.The NCPCR had earlier told the court that data of 9,346 affected children have been uploaded on Bal Swaraj portal. This includes 1,742 children who lost both parents, 7,464 now in a single-parent household, 140 have been abandoned between March 2020 and May 29, 2021.The court had on Monday given more time to the Centre work out the modalities for implementation of the recently launched 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme for those orphaned by Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ensure-theres-no-break-in-education-of-children-orphaned-by-covid-19-sc-tells-states-uts-265467

For this purpose the CISF has already carried out a survey.“The organisation is an important facility when it comes to ensuring medical and health security of the country and it obviously faces a terror threat from various inimical elements. The CISF, hence, has been tasked to secure the Bharat Biotech facility in Hyderabad,” a senior MHA official said.A spokesperson for CISF said, the force “will be inducted at the facility, which manufactures Covaxin, on June 14”.India at present is administering Covaxin and Covishield (manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India), apart from small doses of Sputnik V to its citizens to battle the coronavirus pandemic.The CISF was allowed to secure private installations of public importance following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, where five-star luxury hotels and a Jewish Chabad house were targeted by members of the Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba.The force guards about 10 such facilities across the country, including the Infosys campuses in Pune and Mysuru, the Reliance IT Park in Navi Mumbai and Yoga exponent Ramdev’s Patanjali factory premises in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-biotechs-hyderabad-campus-to-get-cisf-security-cover-265466

We will take a call on removing fluids tomorrow. He might get discharged in three to four days," Parkar told PTI.On Monday, Parkar said Kumar's health had improved, with his oxygen saturation levels better and his breathing difficulty reduced.Last evening, Kumar's wife, veteran actor Saira Banu, also shared a note on his official Twitter account, thanking fans for their prayers and best wishes."My husband, my Kohinoor, our Dilip Kumar Sahab's health is stable and doctors have assured me that he should be discharged soon,' the 76-year-old actor wrote.Banu also shared her picture with Kumar from his hospital bed.The Hindi cinema veteran was admitted to the same hospital last month for a regular health check-up.Kumar, who made acting debut with 'Jwar Bhata' in 1944, has appeared in several iconic films in his career spanning over five decades, such as 'Kohinoor', 'Mughal-e-Azam', 'Devdas', 'Naya Daur', 'Ram Aur Shyam', among others.He was last seen on the big screen in 'Qila' in 1998. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dilip-kumar-continues-to-be-stable-265465
08-06-2021||New Delhi||No data to show kids will be seriously hit in next Covid waves: AIIMS chief||There is no data, either from India or globally, to show that children will be seriously infected in any subsequent Covid-19 waves, AIIMS, Delhi, Director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Tuesday.Addressing a media briefing here, he said “it is a piece of misinformation that subsequent waves of the Covid-19 pandemic are going to cause severe illness in children”.Noting that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the children who got infected and got admitted in hospitals during the second wave in India, had either comorbidities or low immunity, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Director said healthy children recovered with mild illness without need for hospitalisation.Guleria futher asserted that “Covid appropriate behaviour is key to preventing future waves”, similar to the statement NITI Aayog Member (Health) V.K. Paul made on Monday.Explaining why pandemics return again, the AIIMS Director said “waves normally occur in pandemics caused due to respiratory viruses; the 1918 Spanish Flu, H1N1 (swine) flu are examples”.“The second wave of 1918 Spanish Flu was the biggest, after which there was a smaller third wave,” said Guleria. “And as we know, SARS-Cov-2 is a respiratory virus.” Multiple waves occur when there is a susceptible population and when a large part of the population acquires immunity against the infection, “the virus becomes endemic and infection becomes seasonal like that of H1N1 that commonly spreads during monsoon or winters,” he said.“Waves can occur due to change in the virus (such as new variants). Since new mutations become more infectious, there is a higher chance for the virus to spread.” Guleria said one of the reasons behind a wave can be human behaviour and cautioned that “whenever cases increase, there is a fear in people and human behaviour changes. People strictly follow Covid appropriate behaviours and non-pharmaceutical interventions help break the chain of transmission. But when unlocking resumes, people tend to think that not much infection will happen and tend to not follow Covid appropriate behaviour”.Due to this, the AIIMS chief said, the virus again starts spreading in the community, leading potentially to another wave.“If we have to stop subsequent waves, we need to aggressively follow Covid appropriate behaviour until we can say that a significant number of our population is vaccinated or has acquired natural immunity.“When enough people are vaccinated or when we acquire natural immunity against the infection, then these waves will stop. The only way out is to strictly follow Covid appropriate behaviour,” Guleria added.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||Citing shortage, Centre asks states to nominate more officers for central deputation||The Centre has asked state governments to nominate more officers for central deputation at the level of deputy secretary, director and joint secretary, citing their shortage, according to an official communique.It also asked them not to nominate officers, who are on the verge of promotion, that often necessitates their early repatriation to their cadre to avail the benefit.“It may be ensured that the names of only those officers are forwarded who are likely to remain available under the Central Staffing Scheme for full tenure,” said the letter issued by the personnel ministry.Officers of the level of deputy secretary/director and above are usually appointed in central government ministries/departments (i.e. on central deputation) under the Central Staffing Scheme (CSS).“It is, therefore, requested that larger number of officers may kindly be recommended for appointment at DS/Director/JS level under the Central Staffing Scheme so that the central deputation reserve/ deputation reserves are duly utilised for this purpose,” it said.Referring to its communique issued December last year seeking officers for deputation to the posts under CSS and for the posts of Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs) in central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) as well as in other organisations under central ministries/departments, the ministry said the number of nominations received so far has been “very minimal”.“The number of nominations received so far has been very minimal and as such the representation of officers from various cadres/services especially at DS/Director level is extremely low,” said the letter dated June 4.As you know, every cadre is allowed a deputation reserve to ensure that officers have the opportunity to work on deputation including that under the Central Staffing Scheme, which adds to their experience, it said.“The utilization of this reserve is low and this underutilisation, particularly at Deputy Secretary/Director level, causes serious gaps in cadre management,” said the letter also sent to secretaries of central government ministries/departments.This aspect would also be kept in view by Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) while considering cadre review proposals, to be received in future, it said.The cadres that have not been forwarding adequate nominations for Central Staffing Scheme at various levels may have to settle for less number of additional Senior Duty Posts in future by way of corresponding reduction, the ministry asserted.It is also requested to ensure that the officers who are at the verge of promotion to Senior Administrative Grade (SAG)/Higher Administrative Grade (HAG), as may be relevant, during the year are not nominated, often necessitating their early repatriation to avail of promotion in the cadre, the letter said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/citing-shortage-centre-asks-states-to-nominate-more-officers-for-central-deputation-265456
08-06-2021||New Delhi||Withdraw 25% Covid vaccine reservation for private sector: Left parties to government||Left parties demanded on Tuesday that the government withdraw the 25 per cent reservation of vaccines for the private sector, alleging that it was a “licence” to loot.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday that the Centre will provide free coronavirus vaccines to the states for the inoculation of all above the age of 18 years from June 21. He also said private hospitals can continue to procure 25 per cent of the vaccines, but their service charge would be capped at Rs 150 per dose over the fixed price of the vaccine.The Communist Party of India (Marxist), in a statement, said people will reject the “condemnable” effort by the prime minister to level false charges against the state governments and shift the responsibility to them.“However, the failed vaccine policy has not been fully reversed. The government has chosen to continue the dual pricing policy. As much as 25 per cent of vaccine production is still reserved for the private sector. This is nothing but a licence for loot by private manufacturers to make super profits.“Further, at a time of an acute vaccine shortage, the continuation of such a policy will dilute and weaken the need for universal vaccination, essential to prevent a third wave of the coronavirus. Only the rich can afford the exorbitant pricing of vaccines for the private hospitals permitted by the government,” the CPI (M) said, demanding the withdrawal of the 25 per cent reservation for the private sector.The Communist Party of India (CPI) said it is the Centre’s responsibility to make vaccines available to all citizens of the country for free and it is “not an act of charity”.“The party wants the government to ensure free supply of vaccines with full transparency. The party also wants the government to take into confidence the state governments as well as the public so that the entire population is vaccinated properly.“The party feels that there is no logic in allowing private hospitals to provide 25 per cent of vaccines and vaccination with a charge of Rs 150. The party emphasises that the entire vaccination must be free and be the responsibility of the central government,” it said in a statement. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/withdraw-25-covid-vaccine-reservation-for-private-sector-left-parties-to-government-265455

08-06-2021||New Delhi||Kejriwal writes to PM, says ready to make whatever changes Centre wants in doorstep ration scheme||The Delhi government is ready to make whatever changes the Centre wants in the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday.He requested permission for implementing the scheme that he claimed was stonewalled by the Centre days before its launch.“People have been made to queue up for ration by the governments in last 75 years. Sir, let not they remain in ration queues for next 75 years. They will never forgive me or you,” Kejriwal wrote.The AAP government last week claimed Lt Governor “rejected” its doorstep delivery of ration scheme citing lack of Centre’s approval and a pending case in the high court.Kejriwal said although the Delhi government was not legally bound, yet it sought Centre’s approval five times to avoid any dispute.“Food minister of Delhi Imran Hussain through letters on February 4, 2019, March 4, 2020, June 17, 2020, November 19, 2020 and December 3, 2020, informed the Central government that Delhi government is going to implement Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna. No objection was raised on this from your side even once,” he said.The Delhi government even changed the name of the scheme by dropping ‘Mukhya Mantri’ and addressed other objections and yet it was said that Centre’s approval was not sought and the scheme was rejected, Kejriwal said.“We are ready to make whatever changes the Central government wants in this scheme. Kindly permission be given to us deliver ration to the doorstep of people,” he wrote.The Union Food & Public Distribution Ministry on Saturday said that it has not asked Delhi government to distribute the ration the way they want.“They can do so under any other scheme. Government of India will provide additional ration for the same. As per notified rates. Where is the issue?” the ministry had said.The Delhi government wants to “tinker with” the nationally administered programme at the cost of Delhi consumers by charging cost of milling etc from them. Government of India had only informed them about the rule position, it had claimed further.It has been said that Delhi can start its own scheme separately without “tinkering” with Centre’s scheme, Kejriwal said in the letter.“Sir, when were we separate? Will now there be two schemes in a state on the same issue - one by Centre and the other by state? Does this mean the Central government and Delhi government each will spend Rs 2000 crore on ration distribution? Sir, will be a prudent thing to do?” Kejriwal asked Modi.He asserted the ration belonged to the people and not to the chief minister and prime minister or BJP and Aam Aadmi Party.People are asking if pizza, burger and smart phones can be home delivered, why cannot ration be delivered at doorsteps of poor, he asked.Claiming the doorstep delivery of ration scheme would end ration mafia, Kejriwal said it was very powerful and well connected and got the scheme rejected days before its launch.There should be no politics over any work of national interest, he said, requesting the prime minister to give the green signal.

He said the hospital will be sealed and patients will be shifted to other hospitals.In the April 28 video, Dr Arinjay Jain allegedly claims that there was acute oxygen shortage at the hospital during the second wave of coronavirus.“Start discharging people, there is no oxygen availability anywhere, even the chief minister cannot get you oxygen. Modi Nagar is dry,” he said.“We talked with families of the patients but no one was ready to discharge their patients. So, we decided to conduct a mock drill so that we could segregate the critically ill patients. After shutting off oxygen supply for five minutes, bodies of 22 patients started turning blue,” Jain said.He said that families of the remaining 74 Covid patients were asked to arrange for oxygen cylinders.However, the district magistrate said there wasn’t scarcity of oxygen at the hospital and that no patient died due to oxygen shortage at the hospital.Talking about deaths of Covid patients at the hospital, he said four patients died on April 26 while three succumbed to the infection on April 27.“Shri Paras Hospital had enough oxygen and it is not true that 22 patients died there due to oxygen shortage. However, the video that is being circulated will be examined and the required action will be taken,” the DM said.Chief Medical Officer, Agra, Dr RC Pandey told PTI that a team has been sent to the hospital to investigate the matter.When contacted by PTI, the owner of the hospital was not available.

The set is accompanied by another set of four limited edition posters (1985), which are based on the presented artworks, AstaGuru said.The artwork was acquired from the collection of a prominent collector from Kolkata who sourced these unique works directly from the artist.According to AstaGuru, modern Indian art remains the proverbial jewel in the crown for art collectors with consistent demand for works by masters.“The artworks curated in this auction take one through the realms of each of the masters' individual artistic journeys. This auction enables a collector to own a rare piece of work that represents significant milestones in the artists' distinctive careers at a no reserve price, presenting a great opportunity for anyone looking to own a masterpiece.“This auction also allows seasoned collectors to enhance their collections of some of the great masters with unique gems, from their artistic oeuvre, some which have been purchased directly from the artists by the seller,” said Sunny Chandiramani from AstaGuru.Another key highlight of the auction is a 1983 Untitled oil on canvas by Jagdish Swaminathan from his signature “Bird, Tree and Mountain Series”.Created in 1983, this series translates the artist's affinity towards etching a pictorial representation of form, in its purest and most refined state.Estimated between Rs 40 – 60 lakh, this particular work, which is executed with a bright red background, showcases his inspiration and intention to preserve and present formal qualities of Indian miniatures, the auction house said.An Untitled (1999) work by Ram Kumar is another important oil on canvas that is making its auction debut.Estimated at Rs 40 – 50 lakh, this is an important figurative work from the master who is generally associated with abstraction.However, the artist started with figurative works during the early 1950s and seldom through the course of his practice, intermittently revisited figurative style works, making this work rather rare, AstaGuru said.The auction will also include multiple significant and rare works by the greats from the Bengal School of Art including Jamini Roy, Gaganendranath Tagore and Nandalal Bose, and Jogen Choudhury, as well as works by distinguished artists such as F N Souza, S H Raza, Ganesh Pyne, Amrita Sher- Gil, K H Ara, Anjolie Ela Menon, K K Hebbar, Krishen Khanna, K G Subramanyan, Akbar Padamsee, Lalu Prasad Shaw.The works that will be offered at no-reserve and will start at an opening bid of Rs 20,000, are up for viewing online as well as at the Institute of Contemporary Indian Art in Mumbai till June 26. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rare-works-by-modern-indian-masters-at-upcoming-online-sale-265419

08-06-2021||New Delhi June 8 ||Delhi riots: HC grants interim custody-bail to Jamia student for exams||The Delhi High Court has granted interim custody-bail to Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student Asif Iqbal Tanha, arrested in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots last year, for two weeks to stay at a hotel here for studying and appearing in exams scheduled from June 15.A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani noted that it is imperative for Tanha to sit in his three remaining backlog or compartment examinations to complete his BA (Hons) (Persian) programme and said he be released on interim custody- bail on the morning of June 13 and shall be brought back to prison by guards on the evening of June 26.As agreed by the counsels for the state and Tanha, he will be staying at a hotel in Kalkaji here under the custody of two prison guards deputed by the Jail Superintendent.Tanha has undertaken to bear all charges and expenses to be incurred there, including lodging and food.“During the period of interim-custody bail, the applicant shall not invite to the said facility any visitors or guests, including family members, friends, classmates or any other person,” the bench said.As the exam would be conducted online, the court asked Tanha to arrange for a laptop and basic mobile phone along with a dongle for internet connection through a pairokar (representative pursuing his case) which will be first checked by the police officer concerned and then delivered to him.The court also allowed Tanha to make a phone call to his family or counsel for 10 minutes once a day during his stay at the hotel.Tanha has been directed by the court not to use the devices for any other purpose except studying and also not to erase or tamper with browsing history on the laptop or SMSes and call records of phone.“It is clarified that even before the commencement of interim custody bail, the applicant is permitted to receive all books and reading/study material, as he may consider necessary, through the Jail Superintendent, after being checked as per usual procedures.“During the period of interim custody bail, the applicant shall be entitled to receive all books and reading/ study material that he may require for his examinations, at the said facility, which would be delivered to him after being checked by the SHO, Police Station Special Cell, and unless there is compelling reason to do otherwise, the SHO shall permit all such books etc. to be handed over to the applicant with due expedition,” the court.It also made clear that considering the subjects of Tanha's study, the books and reading material may be in Persian or Arabic and permission to have such books and reading material shall not be withheld for that reason alone.The court said Tanha shall not in any way misuse or abuse the guarded liberty granted to him by way of interim custody bail and added that the period spent by him in interim custody bail would be counted as period undergone in prison as an undertrial.In December last year also, the high court had granted similar relief to the accused by directed the jail authorities to take him to a guest house to enable him to study and appear in exams.Tanha was arrested on May 19 last year in the case for allegedly being part of a premeditated conspiracy in the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24, 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

08-06-2021||Aditi Tandon||Hope to grant Covid vax approval for pregnant women soon: AIIMS chief||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 8India is awaiting additional safety data on Covishield and Covaxin before recommending inoculation for pregnant women. AIIMS, New Delhi, Director Randeep Guleria on Tuesday said many countries had begun vaccination for pregnant women.“The US FDA has given approval for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Data regarding Covaxin and Covishield will also come soon; some data is already available, and we hope that in a few days, we hope to get the full required data and grant approval for vaccinating pregnant women in India too,” said Guleria.Chairman of the national Covid-19 vaccine task force VK Paul said as per current guidelines pregnant Indian women should not be given Covid vaccines.“The reason for this is that a decision recommending vaccination to pregnant women could not be taken by doctors and the scientific community based on available data from vaccine trials. However, the government will clarify this situation in a few days, based on new scientific inputs,” Paul said.The experts said many Covid vaccines are being found safe for pregnant women and India was hoping the route should open for the two vaccines as well.“We request the public to be a little more patient, especially considering that the vaccines have been developed in a very short span of time, and pregnant women are not usually included in the initial trials, due to safety concerns,” Paul said.Paul also said that if someone had a significant allergy problem, then Covid vaccine should be taken only after medical advice.However, if it is only a question of minor allergies like getting common cold, skin allergies, one should not hesitate to take the vaccine, he said.Asked about lactating women, the experts there was no need for lactating women to stop breast feeding before or after vaccination.Guleria also advised people not to judge the efficacy of vaccines only by the amount of antibodies getting generated.“Vaccines give many types of protection - such as through antibodies, cell-mediated immunity and memory cells (which generate more antibodies when we get infected). Data available till now shows clearly that efficacy of all vaccines - whether Covaxin, Covishield or Sputnik V - are more or less equivalent. We should not, hence, say take this vaccine or that vaccine, whichever vaccine is available in your area, please go ahead and get yourself vaccinated so that you and your family are safe,” said Guleria.Paul said antibody tests post vaccination were not needed.“Antibodies alone do not indicate the immunity of a person. This is so because of T-cells or memory cells; these undergo certain changes when we receive the vaccine, they become stronger and gain resistance power. And T-Cells are not detected by antibody tests as these are found in bone marrow. Hence, our appeal is to not fall into the tendency of doing antibody tests either before or after getting vaccinated, take the vaccine which is available, take both doses at the right time and follow Covid Appropriate Behaviour. Also, people should not be under the false notion that the vaccine is not required if you have had Covid-19,” Paul said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hope-to-grant-covid-vax-approval-for-pregnant-women-soon-aiims-chief-265402

Appropriate action of public health act will be initiated against these hospitals," the communique has said.State Aam Aadmi Party convenor Rahul Mahambre said that Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and Health Minister Vishwajit Rane should order a judicial enquiry into the late reporting of Covid deaths and also demanded a white paper on the 67 deaths within the next 24 hours."@DrPramodPSawant @visrane why are the 67 deaths from Aug 20 to May 21 in fine print as footnote. We demand a judicial enquiry why 67 deaths from Aug 20 were not reported.This govt knows only to betray people of Goa," Mahambre tweeted on Tuesday.Opposition MLA Rohan Khaunte has also demanded a probe into the late revelation."The very fact that 67 Covid deaths in private hospitals went unreported, adds fuel to the already existing allegations that daily Covid figures are diluted as per government's necessity.

08-06-2021||Johannesburg||Mahatma Gandhi's train ejection commemorated in South Africa||Commemorating Mahatma Gandhi's ejection from a train in South Africa's Pietermaritzburg in 1893, various speakers from across the world discussed the relevance of the messages of India's Father of the Nation for the world today.The Pietermaritzburg Gandhi Memorial Committee decided some years ago that the story of June 7, 1893, and its impact on young Gandhi would be told every year at its anniversary, said David Gengan, chairman of the Committee.The seed for ‘Satyagraha' (non-violent resistance) was planted right here in Pietermaritzburg on the night of June 7, 1893, he said.Gandhi's 21 years in South Africa shaped his philosophy, especially as it relates to peace and non-violence, Gengan said, explaining that while the event had been commemorated at the station where the incident occurred, they had been unable to do so since last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Gandhi's granddaughter Ela Gandhi, 80, who heads the Gandhi Development Trust which oversees the Phoenix Settlement that he started during his tenure in Durban, said that during the course of his life, Gandhi discovered many truths.“These truths I believe are of great relevance for us today as we face the challenge of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.“As we struggle with the COVID-19 realities, we are becoming aware of the need for a change in our perception and behaviours to create a new normal,” she said.Ela said that in this context, Gandhi's seven observations have attained even greater significance.Sello Hatang, chief executive of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, said Gandhi's observations were attainable by all human beings.“It is when we try our best to be better humans that we build a world that (Mandela and Gandhi) dreamt of – the world that cares about the downtrodden, the forgotten, those who feel that they are the outcasts,” Hatang said.Javie Ravjee of the Mahatma Gandhi Remembrance Organisation in Johannesburg, which has revived the Tolstoy Farm commune started by Gandhi during his stay in the city after it had been left derelict for several decades, called for all similar organisations across the globe to form an association.Dr Sriram Sonty from Chicago agreed with this idea.“We should create a global association of all Gandhian networks where we can come together and make a statement and a mass protest across the globe, like they did for Black Lives Matter,” Sonty said.On the issue of self-sufficiency and self-reliance as espoused by Gandhi when he set up the Phoenix Settlement, Ela said it was indeed still relevant today.“Materialism is the cause of every issue that is taking place. The wars are because of resources. As long as wealth and money become the centre of our lives, we are not going to be able to change.“Phoenix Settlement's message is that there are other things much more important than wealth, and that is what we need to look at and develop. It is very relevant today, more than ever before,” Ela said.Professor Prasad Gollanapalli from the Gandhi King Foundation in Hyderabad said that there should be a deeper understanding of Gandhi that should be taken to the younger generation, especially at colleges and universities.On the fateful night, while Gandhi was on his way to Pretoria from Durban, a white man objected to his presence in a first-class carriage, and he was ordered to move to the third-class compartment.Gandhi had a valid first-class ticket and refused to obey the orders following which he was thrown out of the train at Pietermaritzburg station. He had stayed at the station that night.The incident on June 7, 1893, had strongly influenced Gandhi's decision to fight racial discrimination in South Africa and later the freedom struggle in India.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||NGT pulls up Punjab, Himachal, Haryana over pollution in Ghaggar river||The National Green Tribunal has come down heavily on Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana for failing to stop the discharge of untreated effluents in the Ghaggar river and said  that "if the State itself fails in implementing the law, it is nothing but breakdown of the system itself".A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the three states and Chandigarh continue to contribute water pollution, which is a criminal offence."It is breach of public trust under public trust doctrine. We are left with a feeling that there is no commitment to the rule of law and no concern for the environment and health of the citizens on the part of the concerned authorities in the states of HP, Haryana, Punjab and UT Chandigarh," said the bench, also comprising Justice Sudhir Agarwal.The tribunal directed the Chief Secretary, Punjab and the Advisor to the Administrator, Union Territory of Chandigarh in coordination with other concerned officers to take appropriate remedial measures to comply with the mandate of law, including the directions of the Supreme Court.It also directed a joint committee of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Punjab PCB and pollution control committee of Chandigarh to inspect the drain and furnish a status report within two months by e-mail.The tribunal said that in spite of enactment of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 making discharge of untreated effluents into a water body a criminal offence, the states are still struggling to prevent untreated sewage from being discharged into the water body at a huge cost to the environment and health and lives of citizens who have fundamental right to clean environment under the Constitution."Water pollution is a serious threat to the health of the citizens as well as other living beings who consume the water and also to the food safety for growth of which the water is used for irrigation...there can be no justification whatsoever for the State to have failed in complying with the law."If the State finds that they are unable to manage the sewage directly, there is no bar to other options being explored but there cannot be any justification not to comply with the mandate of law and protecting the health of the citizens in accordance with the Constitutional mandate," the bench said.The green panel said that no action is being taken against the erring officers and it gives an impression that there is collapse of Environmental rule of law."Who is to pay the cost of damage to the environment and public health of large number of unidentified citizens and other living creatures? Is such cost being calculated. How officers responsible for damage by their inaction or otherwise are being dealt with. Should the State be held liable vicariously for such failure and failure to punish the guilty," the bench said.The bench that the NGT has been passing repeated orders and as many as six reports have been submitted by a Monitoring Committee headed by a former High Court Judge and a former Chief Secretary, clearly recording failure of the State authorities but the higher authorities are also conveniently ignoring their responsibility."Advocates for the authorities only maintain silence before this Tribunal. If the State itself fails in implementing the law, it is nothing but breakdown of the system itself.“Is this Tribunal to just remain silent spectator for such gross failure or hold highest authorities accountable by directing their prosecution for their criminal failure and indirectly being party to the crime against the law of the land? How the law of the land is to be meaningfully enforced. We expect answers to these questions from the States," the bench said.NGT said the states should realise their responsibility to function according to the Constitution and take immediate remedial measures in punishing the guilty involved in failing to comply with the law and also take prompt measures instead of repeatedly taking the same plea of being engaged in tender process."It should not be difficult at this length of time to overcome such procedural requirements and to effectively prevent discharge of the untreated effluents after 46 years of enactment of Water Act and repeated orders of the Supreme Court and other Courts."For delay and continued violation, realistic compensation has to be recovered from the erring officers, apart from other action or in default, the compensation has to be quantified and recovered. The Executing Committee may make its recommendation in this regard,” the bench said.The tribunal was hearing a plea against failure of statutory authorities in Punjab and Chandigarh to install necessary Sewage Treatment Plant, resulting in discharge of pollution in the drain originating from Chandigarh and passing through various sectors and villages of Mohali, before merging into Ghaggar River."The pollution is affecting the eco-system, including the aquatic life and also public health. Discharge of untreated sewage into the drain is violation of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and also citizens right to clean environment."Further, since the waste water of the drain is used for cultivation of crops and washing of the vegetables which are consumed by the residents, it is affecting the food chain and public health," the plea said.

You can call it pre-monsoon showers, but certainly not the south-west monsoon," she said.These are no indications of onset of the monsoon here as yet, the official said."There has to be less variation and rains have to be widespread (to be called as monsoon showers). Apart from Mumbai, there should be rains over central Maharashtra also.Then only we can identify it as the south-west (SW) monsoon, she said.The official further said going by the present observations, the SW monsoon onset here could be declared after a couple of days-by June 10."There is also an off-shore trough in the Arabian Sea, but it is weak. Had it been strong, it could have helped in the advancement of the monsoon," she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rain-lashes-mumbai-met-dept-calls-it-pre-monsoon-showers-265384

It starts off with milder symptoms in kids, but it gets severe if it's not taken seriously. Therefore, it's essential that parents be aware of the symptoms and seek medical help immediately.Nishant Bansal, Consultant Neonatologist, Motherhood Hospital, Noida, lists down some signs and symptoms of Covid-19 in kids: Covid-19 has a range of symptoms including:* fever* cough* trouble breathing* symptoms of a cold such as a sore throat, congestion, or a running nose * chills* muscle pain* headache* a loss of taste or smell in children above 8 years of age * nausea or vomiting* diarrhoea* tirednessEven inflammation throughout the body remains a major concern even sometimes several weeks after they were infected with the virus. This is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Doctors are still trying to find out how these symptoms are related to the coronavirus pandemic.Bansal shares symptoms of MIS-C can include:* fever* belly pain* vomiting or diarrhoea* a rash* neck pain* red eyes* feeling very tired* red, cracked lips* swollen hands or feet* swollen glands (lymph nodes)If your kid is suffering from MIS-C, she or he might have trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, bluish lips or face, confusion, or trouble staying awake.Such symptoms should not be ignored, and the kid should be taken to the hospital. It has been observed that those kids get better with hospital care, sometimes ICU admissions, he points out.If a child has symptoms, what to do? Answers the expert: Seeing and examining the condition of the child, the doctor will then decide how to go about it: If it can be treated at home, if one should come in for a visit, or if one can have a video or telehealth visit.How to keep other members safe if the child has symptoms?Bansal says: "It's essential that all the family members stay at home until their test reports arrive. Make sure that people and pets in the house are away from your child as much as possible. Ensure that only one person in the family is handling the care of the sick child. If the infected child is above two-years-old then he/she should wear a mask at least for the time when the caregiver is in the room. Don't leave the child alone for a long time by putting on his/her mask. If the sick child is using the same washroom, then wipe down the bathroom with disinfectant after he/she uses it. Other family members should sanitize their hands at regular intervals."However, the family should not panic. Covid-19 vaccines are now available for people who are 18 and older. Even the doses for infants are on trial currently. Everyone should get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/essential-steps-to-catching-covid-symptoms-early-in-children-265378
08-06-2021||New Delhi||Why did govt use COVID-19 data as 'propaganda tool' rather than to stop virus: Priyanka Gandhi||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday slammed the Centre for allegedly not maintaining transparency on Covid-related data, and asked why the government used it as a "propaganda tool" rather than for stopping coronavirus spread.As part of her "Zimmedaar Kaun" (who is responsible) campaign, in which she has been questioning the government over its handling of the pandemic, the Congress general secretary put out a video in which she attacked the central government over the data related to Covid put out by it.In her posers to the Centre, she asked why there is such a massive deficit between official death data of Covid and unofficial data gathered from crematoriums, graveyards and other sources.Why has the government used data primarily as a "propaganda tool" rather than using it to stop the spread of Covid-19, Gandhi asked in the video posted on Twitter and Facebook.             She stressed that experts around the world have said that making data public and transparent is the only way "we can win the battle against Covid".Why has our government not done so, she asked?On Monday, Gandhi had accused the Centre of suppressing data related to the Covid pandemic, and said the Modi government's emphasis on propaganda over saving lives had caused "immense damage".The Congress has been critical of the Centre's handling of the Covid situation in the country, but the government has dismissed the criticism of the Opposition party, accusing it of politicising the pandemic.

He added that the government will protect the rights of Choksi as he awaits trial.Currently, Choksi has got interim relief from immediate repatriation to India by the Dominican court, which adjourned the matter of his detention.Loop Jamaica News quoted that Dominica PM as saying that, “The matter with this Indian citizen is before the courts, the courts will decide what happens to this gentleman and we allow the court process to go through.”“His rights will be respected as have been done thus far and let the courts decide what has to happen in that regard. We have no interest in so far as the issues in Antigua and the issues in India. We are part of a whole community and we have to recognise our duty and our responsibility,” Skerrit said.Choksi had gone missing from Antigua on May 23 after going out for dinner and was soon caught in Dominica. He was charged with illegal entry by the police in Dominica after he allegedly escaped from Antigua and Barbuda in a possible attempt to evade extradition to India.The 62-year-old fugitive is wanted in India in connection with a Rs 13,500-crore fraud in the Punjab National Bank (PNB).According to the Writeups 24, Choksi’s disappearance from Antigua and Barbuda and his apparent attempt to escape to Cuba, was unlike the Hollywood drama that it was made out to be. The Caribbean newspaper said that the whole planning was to manipulate the entire scenario into an abduction story, and the media was trapped in a hoax created by Choksi’s family on the advice of his lawyers.Responding to such media reports, Mehul Choksi’s brother on Monday sent a legal notice to Caribbean-based media outlet Associate Times, for publishing an article, what they termed as “fake, unsubstantiated, false and with unverified facts.”The media outlet had recently reported that Chetan Chinubhai Choksi, the elder brother of Mehul had the day after he landed in Dominica met with the leader of opposition Lennox Linton at the latter’s home for two hours and had promised to pay for election donation in exchange of support from the opposition to press the matter in the parliament.Chetan Choksi’s lawyer Ayush Jindal, said his client has sought an unconditional apology and issuance of a corrigendum clarifying the correct facts, in all print and digital media, and other social media platforms.Jindal in the legal notice stated: “Notice to cease and desist from reporting fake, unsubstantiated, false and unverified news against my client Chetan Choksi in respect to the matter of Mehul Choksi and thus, removal of the false news report from all mediums and to publish an unconditional apology to my client for reporting such false and fake stories and issue a corrigendum clarifying the correct facts, in all print and digital media, and other social media platforms.” (ANI)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dominica-pm-terms-mehul-choksi-indian-citizen-says-courts-will-decide-on-fugitives-future-265356
08-06-2021||Washington||Indian sentenced to 14 months in prison for US$ 8,00,000 fraud||A court in Seattle has sentenced an Indian national to 14 months in prison for defrauding his employer of nearly US$ 800,000 in used equipment sales, according to Acting US Attorney Tessa M Gorman.Arunkumar Singal, 42, pleaded guilty to wire fraud on January 3 and faces deportation after the completion of sentence."You put everything at risk for one thing: to add to your wealth… You stopped because you were caught by law enforcement, but you continued to lie and deceive," US District Judge Richard A Jones told Singal during the sentencing hearing on June 4.According to records filed in the case, in 2014 Singal was the director of Global Product Support at Spacelabs Healthcare Inc. The company was established in the 1950s to make medical monitoring devices for astronauts and then expanded its business to include medical monitoring devices for hospitals and clinics.Singal was put in-charge of a new initiative to resell used equipment. Federal prosecutors alleged that instead of selling the equipment to the highest bidder as he was supposed to do, Singal devised a scheme to have a Texas company bid on the equipment at a very low price, and then used a shell company, created by him, to purchase the equipment for a 10 per cent increase in profit from the Texas company.He then turned around and sold the equipment at a much higher price to a Minnesota company.  Through this fraudulent scheme Singal made a profit of more than US$ 780,000, court documents said.Singal used the ill-gotten gain to pay down the mortgage on his luxury Mercer Island home and to buy a Tesla, among other expenditures.The scheme unravelled when tech support workers doing regular maintenance on Singal's company cell phone reported messages that appeared to indicate side deals not authorised by the company. The company fired Singal and reported potential fraud to the Snoqualmie Police Department who alerted the FBI.As part of the plea deal, Singal sold the Mercer Island home and paid restitution to Spacelabs of US$ 780,163. “However, the harm to the company went beyond the lost income on the sales of the equipment. At the time Singal was stealing from the company, Spacelabs was having to tighten its spending and lay-off staffers. Had it received the true value of the used equipment, the financial constraints would not have been so severe,” the Department of Justice said.In asking for a three-year prison sentence, prosecutors wrote to the court, “Singal abused his position of trust and responsibility".When he was placed in a position of increased responsibility, he promptly abused the trust he had been given, devising the scheme to resell Spacelabs' property for his own personal gain. Singal literally lost no opportunity to wring every ounce of profit from his criminal scheme, they said.

08-06-2021||---||Centre to provide states free vaccine for all adults from June 21||New Delhi, June 7The government on Monday pledged free Covid vaccines for adults from June 21. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision to revert to the old system of centralised procurement of 75 per cent doses for free distribution to the states, as was the case before May 1.Ensure safety of doctors: IMA to PMIn the wake of incidents of assault on doctors by relatives of patients, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday sought PM Narendra Modi’s intervention in ensuring “optimum milieu” for medical professionals so that they can work without fear.2nd covishield dose after 28 days for...AIIMS starts screening kids for vax trialsThe screening of children for trial of Covaxin, India’s first indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine, among those aged between 2 and 18 started at AIIMS in New Delhi on Monday.1,00,636 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS 3,49,186ACTIVE CASES 14,01,609The PM said private hospitals could continue to procure 25 per cent of the vaccines, but their service charge would be capped at Rs 150 (as against Rs 300 at present) per dose over the fixed price of the vaccine.Noting that the return to the centralised procurement was rooted in the demand of states, which felt the previous system (before May 1) was good, the PM in an address to the nation today said, “As many states, having realised the challenges of vaccine planning and supplies, demanded reconsideration of the vaccination strategy and reverting to the pre-May 1 system, the government has decided that the 25 per cent vaccination work set aside for states will now be undertaken by the Centre. This will be rolled out in two weeks.“From June 21, the Government of India will provide free vaccines to all Indian citizens above 18 years. It will buy 75 per cent production of vaccine manufacturers and provide doses to states free of cost. No state would have to spend anything for the vaccines. The Centre will provide free vaccines to all citizens.”The PM also announced the extension of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana until Diwali. “Till November, 80 crore people will continue to get a fixed amount of free foodgrain every month.We will stand with the poor like a friend,” the PM said in the 33-minute address where he assured better vaccine supplies in the near future, informing the country that seven vaccines were under development and three in advanced stages.He said two vaccines for children were also being tried and a nasal Covid vaccine was under test. In oblique references to the Opposition, which has been questioning the government’s vaccine policy, the PM said there was no place for political bickering on the issue. “Inoculation based on vaccine supplies is a collective duty,” PM Modi said, warning citizens against disinformation and advising them caution in the face of the unlocking process as daily cases dropped to 1,00,636 today, at a 61-day low.Defending the government’s record, the PM said that between January 16 and April 30, the vaccination was progressing well under the aegis of the Centre and people were waiting for their turn to get the jabs but then a range of questions were raised.“Questions arose about the lack of choice for states. Some asked why the Centre was deciding everything. Some sought flexibility in lockdowns, saying one size did not fit all. The argument was that health was a state subject. Demands for decentralisation of planning and priority to age groups came up. Several pressures were exerted. We decided not to object if states wanted to procure. But soon states realised the challenges and awakened to the reality of low global supply of vaccines.” explained the PM.He hailed Indian scientists for the two made-in-India vaccines. Noting that India had administered 23 crore doses, the PM said India would speed up its vaccine pace.“Until 2014, child vaccine coverage was 60%. We have brought it to 90% with our clean intentions, clear policy and diligence. Previously, India would wait for years to get a vaccine that was being developed abroad. Today, we have our own vaccines,” said the PM.The Supreme Court had on May 31 called the Centre’s Covid 19 vaccine policy (free jabs for 45 plus and jabs at a price for 18 to 44-year-olds) “prima facie arbitrary and irrational”. The court had ordered the Centre to file an affidavit in two weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-provide-states-free-vaccine-for-all-adults-from-june-21-265240

For asymptomatic patients, the new guidelines do not even recommend a blood test or any drugs and clarify “no investigation and no medications are needed at this stage”.Mild patients would need investigation and paracetamol if symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue and other classical Covid signs persist or deteriorate.The guidelines say no to Baba Ramdev’s Coronil and 2-DG drug for moderately ill patients and recommends monitoring of oxygen saturation, controlling comorbidities and giving steroids and anticoagulants as per medical advice.The guidance lays down clear indications for the use of tocilizumab drug in severely ill patients and also tells doctors how and when to prescribe. It stresses the need to recruit a hospital infection committee to ensure prevention from fungal infections like mucormycosis and spells out a clear use and dosage of amphotericin B, which is in short supply currently.The new advice says no to irrational and rampant use of chest CT scans and indicates when to use a chest X-ray. “Exercise extreme caution when ordering a chest CT scan. Patients must remain socially engaged and stay positive,” the guidance says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-treatment-guidelines-drop-ivermectin-zinc-vitamins-hydroxychloroquine-265244

Land grabbers! When you come to court you become honest and law abiding and on site, you don’t do anything lawful.”“First the forest land has to be cleared. Don’t give us Covid excuses. File a compliance report. It may be a case where some people are hand in glove with the encroachers,” it said.It ordered the local police to give necessary logistical support to enable the corporation to evict the occupants and clear all encroachments.Noting that it had passed an interim order in February last year for the removal of encroachments, the Bench said it would be asking the civic body why the orders had not been followed so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/evict-encroachers-from-aravalli-forest-land-supreme-court-265248

On June 4, the name of Gurmit Singh, a resident of India, was mentioned on the passenger list of the two vessels -- Lady Anne and Calliope of Arne.Probe into Choksi’s ‘abduction’ begins‘Was trapped’The manner in which Jabarica conducted herself, including by not helping me get free from the said persons, and her subsequent lack of initiative in contacting the police points to the fact that she was an integral part of this entire schemeThe passenger list of Callioppe of Arne mentions the names of Gurjit Bhandal, a resident of Birmingham in the UK, and Gurmit Singh, a resident of India, according to the records of the Cobra tours.In his complaint, Choksi, who is facing charges of entering Dominica illegally, has stated that he had been residing in Antigua and Barbuda for the last three years, and there he came in contact with Jabarica, who used to stay in his neighbourhood. He also stated that he had gone to meet Jabarica on May 23 at around 5 pm when he was abducted by 8 to 10 persons, claiming to be Antigua police officers. In his complaint to the police, Choksi alleged that the people who abducted him said they would be taking him to the St John's police station. When he resisted and requested to contact his lawyers, "I was physically restrained and hit from all sides", the fugitive businessman said in the complaint. "I attempted to get away, but I was quickly overpowered, owing to being so heavily outnumbered due to my poor state of health. My attackers continued to beat me mercilessly with bare hands and also used a taser (gun) on my face, hands and exposed skin, causing burns, bruises and immense pain. They further told me that if I continued to resist, they would file a complaint against me for obstruction of justice,” Choksi said.Choksi further said that the attackers put him on a wheelchair, as he was in almost comatose state. "I was unable to resist when they tied my hands, legs and body to the wheel chair. A gag was placed in my mouth obstructing my airways, causing me to gasp for air," he said. Choksi said that in the same state he was taken to the backside of Jabarica's house and was placed on what seemed like a very small watercraft. “Later, I was handed over to an officer and his team to take me to the central police station,” he said. — TNS/Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mehul-choksi-names-indian-officers-mystery-woman-in-complaint-265257

Banerjee, meanwhile, said party leaders were reaching out to the BJP to facilitate the return of saffron party workers, who had fled their homes fearing attack by TMC workers post-elections.The Diamond Harbour MP and nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, widely perceived to be her political successor, claimed that post-poll violence stopped after Mamata took over as the Chief Minister.“There were some incidents of violence till the Election Commission was at the helm of affairs in Bengal,” Abhishek said, claiming that after Mamata took charge as the Chief Minister, there was even a “single incident” the targeting BJP supporters.“You must have seen that our leaders are reaching out to their BJP counterparts, saying if there is anything stopping your people from entering villages, write to us and we will make sure that irrespective of the person’s political affiliation, identity and inclination, we will help them go to their native places safely,” Abhishek said.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||Twitter seeks more time from govt to comply with new IT rules||Social media platform Twitter is learnt to have approached the government seeking more time to comply with the new IT rules.According to sources, the micro-blogging site has said that it intends to comply with the rules but needs more time due to the pandemic situation in India."Twitter has written to Meity seeking more time to comply with the IT rules. It has expressed its intent to comply with the rules but has been unable to do so because of the pandemic," a source told PTI.The response from Twitter comes after the government issued a strongly-worded final notice to the company last week regarding its non-compliance with the new rules.When contacted, a Twitter spokesperson said Twitter has been and remains deeply committed to India, and serving the vital public conversation taking place on the service."We have assured the Government of India that Twitter is making every effort to comply with the new guidelines, and an overview on our progress has been duly shared. We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian Government," the spokesperson said.In its notice, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had said that Twitter's refusal to comply with the rules demonstrated the micro-blogging site's "lack of commitment and efforts towards providing a safe experience for the people of India on its platform"."Despite being operational in India for more than a decade, it is beyond belief that Twitter Inc has doggedly refused to create mechanism that will enable the people of India to resolve their issues on the platform in a timely and transparent manner and through fair processes, by India based, clearly identified resources," the ministry had said.The new IT rules for social media companies that came into effect last month mandate large platforms like Facebook and Twitter to undertake greater due diligence and make these digital platforms more accountable and responsible for the content hosted by them.The rules also require significant social media intermediaries -- providing services primarily in the nature of messaging -- to enable identification of the "first originator" of the information that undermines the sovereignty of India, the security of the state, or public order.Under the rules, significant social media intermediaries -- those with over 50 lakh users -- are required to appoint a grievance officer, a nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel have to be residents in India.Further, social media companies will have to take down flagged content within 36 hours, and remove within 24 hours content that is flagged for issues such as nudity and pornography.As per the ministry's notice, though with effect from May 26, 2021, "consequences follow" given Twitter's non-compliance with rules, "as a gesture of goodwill, Twitter Inc is hereby given one last notice to immediately comply with the rules, failing which the exemption from liability available… shall stand withdrawn and Twitter shall be liable for consequences as per the IT Act and other penal laws of India".However, the notice did not mention a specific date for the micro-blogging site to comply with the rules.Non-compliance with the rules would result in these platforms losing their intermediary status that provides them immunity from liabilities over any third-party data hosted by them. In other words, they could be liable for criminal action in case of complaints.According to the central government, the new rules are designed to prevent abuse and misuse of platforms, and offer users a robust forum for grievance redressal.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||Indian Medical Association seeks PM Modi's intervention in assault on doctors, fake news||In the wake of incidents of assault on doctors by relatives of patients, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention in ensuring “optimum milieu” for medical professionals so that they can work without fear.Underlining the need for curbing the purposeful spread of misinformation against modern medicine and Covid-19 vaccination by certain people with vested interests, the IMA has appealed to the prime minister to resolve their long pending pleas.In a letter to Modi, the doctors’ body said persons spreading misinformation against the Covid-19 vaccination drive must be booked and punished in accordance with law, including under relevant provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act, 2005.“All such acts of omission and commission on behalf of any person raising doubts in the minds of the common public against the protocol guidance issued by the Ministry of Health for treatment of Covid-19 infected patients – ought to be suitable punished and simultaneously, any attempt of any person to fool the gullible public and promote so-called ‘magic remedies’ or ‘wonder drugs’ without the approval of the Ministry of Health, Government of India – ought to be immediately curtailed,” the IMA said in the letter.In its appeal, the doctors’ body said the government should promote universal free vaccination to all above 18 years of age without leaving the vaccines to the extent of 50 per cent to the states and private hospitals.“In the midst of this pandemic, we are also deeply hurt to see the increasing incidents of physical violence against the doctors and the health care professionals in this country. The brutal assault on our young doctor in Assam and the assault on lady doctors and even on veteran practitioners across the country - are really causing mental trauma amongst the practitioners,” the letter stated.“The Health Services Personnel and Clinical Establishments (Prohibition of Violence and Damage to Property) Bill, 2019, which seeks to punish people who assault on-duty doctors and other healthcare professionals by imposing a jail term of up to 10 years – which, apparently, was dismissed by the Home Ministry during an inter-ministerial consultation over the draft law, ought to be promulgated immediately along with the incorporation of provisions from the IPC/CrPC and with stipulations for a fixed time schedule for speedy conclusion of trials,” it said.The doctors said all those involved in such heinous crimes ought to be punished to also create an effective deterrent for other antisocial elements who may indulge in attacking any health care professionals.The IMA said doctors who have lost their lives in the war against the Covid-19 pandemic ought to be recognised as Covid martyrs with due acknowledgment of their sacrifice and that their families ought to be duly supported by the government.The doctors’ body highlighted that due to various obstacles in the procedural implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme under which insurance benefits are being extended to such families, out of 754 doctors who had lost their lives in the first wave, families of only 168 doctors have been able to apply under this scheme.It urged the prime minister to create an effective mechanism for identifying and verifying all these victims through the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) and also ensure that support is given to all the said families as solatium at their door steps.The post Covid-19 complications of lung fibrosis, increased thrombotic events and fungal infections are on the rise and everyone needs to be prepared for the same, the IMA said.Noting that drugs needed for the mucormycosis fungal disease were not available with ease, the doctors thanked Modi for the efforts taken to import the drugs and simultaneously augment indigenous production.“We appeal to you to set up a separate research cell to study these post Covid-19 complications in detail and to come out with multi-faceted treatment guidelines in all disciplines of medicine,” the IMA said.“The IMA has decided to continue to seek your intervention on the above issues and also to organise various intellectual meets, dialogues, and finally the National Protest Day on June 18 to secure smooth, cooperative and optimum milieu for Modern health care professionals which will enable them to work with much more compassion and dedication and without any fear of mental or physical harm,” the letter added.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||GOI reverts to centralised procurement of vaccines on states’ demand||Starting June 21, India will administer Covid vaccines at government inoculation centres free of cost to all adults with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday announcing a major decision to return to the old system of centralised procurement of jabs for further free distribution and administration to states.Assuring enhanced vaccine supplies in near future, the Prime Minister said the Centre had decided to procure 75 per cent vaccines including 25 per cent set aside for states under a liberalised policy that commenced from May 1, and this had been done on the demand of states.Punjab extends Covid curbs to June 15, but orders graded relaxations from tomorrow“Several states that earlier sought decentralization of procurement later realized the challenges of the process including the reality of short vaccine supplies globally. Many such states had a rethink and urged the Centre to revert to the pre May 1 policy of centralised procurement.  Many states started saying the previous policy was good. We started thinking on this demand of returning to pre-May 1 system of procurement and have now decided that the Centre will handle the 25 per cent vaccine-related work given to states. A system will be developed in two weeks. From June 21, all 18 plus people will be given free vaccines through 75 per cent central procurement and states won’t have to spend anything on vaccines,” the Prime Minister said on Monday.Government to distribute free foodgrains to 80 crore people till Diwali: PMHe announced that the government will ensure free vaccination for all.“Those who want to take vaccines private can do so at a cost. The 25 per cent procurement will remain available to private hospitals but they would have to cap service charge per dose at Rs 150,” said the prime minister.Noting that there is no place for political bickering and one-upmanship in the national Covid inoculation programme the Prime Minister said on Monday the vaccine drive between January 16 to April 30 was progressing smoothly under the aegis of the Centre when several states started demanding decentralization of the process which was eventually done.CMs, BJP welcome PM’s free Covid vaccine initiative; Opposition claims policy reversed due to fear of SC action“The country was progressing well towards free vaccine for all. Citizens were waiting for their turn to get vaccinates. That was when many states started demanding decentralisation of the process. Someone asked why only a certain age group should be covered, someone asked why the centre should decide who to vaccinate first; some even asked why elders should be covered first? A range of pressures was created and a section of the media even ran a campaign. The justification given was health is a state subject. After a lot of introspection we changed the policy keeping in mind the demand of states and said let states to 25 per cent procurement from May 1 if they so want,” said the PM, explaining the recent drift in the pace of vaccinations amid shortages of doses.He said the states soon realised the problems faced in vaccine rollout and awakened to the low availability of vaccines worldwide.‘With the second wave peaking in May, vaccine eagerness rising and states experiencing problems, several of them told us the old system was good and that we should revert to that. So we have decided to procure 25 per cent share of the states for free supply to them, as before,’ the PM noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goi-reverts-to-centralised-procurement-of-vaccines-on-states-demand-264839
08-06-2021||New Delhi||AIIMS Delhi starts screening of children for Covaxin trials||The screening of children for the trial of Covaxin, India's first indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, among those aged between 2 and 18 started at the AIIMS here on Monday.The trial on children has already started at AIIMS Patna to see if the Bharat Biotech jab is suitable for children. Participants would be given the vaccine after their screening report comes. The trial is to be conducted on 525 healthy volunteers. In the trial, the vaccine will be given by intramuscular route in two doses at day 0 and day 28. "The screening of children for conducting trial of Covaxin has started. Participants would be given the vaccine after their screening reports come," Dr Sanjay Rai, Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine at AIIMS, said.India's drug regulator had granted permission for conducting the Phase 2/3 clinical trial of Covaxin in the age group 2 to 18 years on May 12 Covaxin is being used on adults in India's ongoing COVID-19 vaccination drive. The government last week cautioned that even though COVID-19 has not taken a serious shape among children till now, its impact can increase among them if there is a change in virus behaviour or epidemiology dynamics, and said preparations are being strengthened to deal with any such situation.A national expert group has been formed to review COVID-19 infections in children and approach the pandemic in a renewed way to strengthen the nation's preparedness, NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul had said at a press conference.The group has examined signs which were not available four-five months before, he said.It has also considered available data, clinical profile, the country's experience, disease dynamics, nature of the virus and the pandemic and has come up with guidelines, which will be publicly released soon.“While we have been systematically reviewing scientific developments in this area, the group has been formed to take an updated view of the situation," Paul said.Asked if the Pfizer vaccine, if it comes to India, will it be considered for children between the age of 12 and 15 years as being approved by the UK, Paul had said that the country has its own vaccines which are being readied for children."Child cohort is not a small cohort. My rough guess is that if it is between 12 to 18 years, this itself is about 13 to 14 crore population and for which we will need about 25-26 crore doses."We cannot have some people getting and others not getting. So we will have to take this into account when we strategise and make a decision based on how many doses of which vaccines are available. he said.He further shared that Zydus Cadila's vaccine is already being tested in children. "So when Zydus comes for licensure, hopefully in the next two weeks, maybe we have enough data to take a view on  whether the vaccine can be given to children," he said.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi unlock: Markets, malls reopen on odd-even basis, metro services resume; see pictures||Jolted by the devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the National Capital moved slowly towards normal life as shops in markets and malls reopened on odd-even basis on Monday after nearly two months, with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealing to people to take all precautions against coronavirus.The Delhi Metro, the lifeline of the city, also resumed services on Monday, but with 50 per cent seating capacity and no provision for standing travel for commuters.Although all standalone and neighbourhood shops, including liquor vends, started functioning, cinemas, theatres, restaurants  (except home delivery and take away), bars, gyms, spas, barber shops, salons, beauty parlours and weekly markets will remain closed till further orders.Kejriwal appealed to people to follow Covid-19 guidelines amid the unlocking process in the city.“Many activities are resuming in Delhi from today. But take all the precautions to prevent coronavirus completely - wear a mask, keep social distance and keep washing hands, there should be no laxity at all,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.“One has to stay away from coronavirus infection and also bring the economy back on track,” he added.The shops in the markets and malls reopened on odd-even basis in accordance with their numbers, even as there were markets like south Delhi’s Krishna market where most shops remained closed.Atul Bhargav, president, New Delhi Traders Association representing shop owners in Connaught Place, said all arrangements were in place to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour.“However, the odd-even formula for opening retail shops is against our interests. We have enough space here in Connaught Place and most of the shopkeepers and their employees have already got the jabs. The government should treat retail and wholesale sectors differently,” he said.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general, Confederation of All India Traders said the odd-even is a “rejected formula” as far as the trade is concerned in Delhi and rather staggered timings of different markets would have been a better option to not only reduce human traffic in the markets, but also to provide ease of shopping to Delhiites.The government has allowed all private offices to operate with 50 per cent capacity between 9 am and 5 pm. However, Kejriwal urged all those who can work from home to continue to do so.Police and the district administration have formed teams to ensure no Covid norms are broken as the markets, malls and complexes reopen from 10 am to 8 pm.“Our teams have been deployed in the field for enforcement and awareness so the unlock process operates smoothly,” a senior police officer in west Delhi district said.Besides the markets and malls, standalone shops also reopened in the city, adding a hint of busy city life.“People are still under awe of their experience in the last two months of Covid surge. I hope the situation will improve and customers will return in the coming days,” said Varun, an electronic goods shop owner in Laxmi Nagar.A senior police officer said the shop owners in markets have been briefed to follow norms to protect themselves from the infection.“Our teams are in the field. People are normally following the precautions, but we are keeping a watch as the day progresses and more people are on the roads and markets,” he said.The Delhi Metro resumed services on Monday after a hiatus of nearly three weeks.Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) services were fully suspended since May 20 in view of the Covid-induced lockdown, which was first imposed on April 19 and then successively extended by the city government.Metro services initially ran partially, catering only to people from essential services, but from May 10, it was suspended in view of rising cases amid the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.On Monday, trains begun plying with the scheduled starting time for services being 6 am.“Only half of the available trains will be inducted into service with a frequency ranging from nearly five to 15 minutes on different lines,” a DMRC official had said on Sunday.The Delhi government offices opened with Group A officers and 50 per cent staff of lower ranks working there. However, all officers and staff associated with essential services will work without any restrictions.The chief minister had on Saturday announced various relaxations in the ongoing lockdown that was imposed on April 19, saying the Covid situation was improving and the economy of the city needed to be revived.On Sunday, Delhi reported 381 new instances of the Covid-19 infection, the lowest since March 15, with the positivity rate dipping to 0.5 per cent.Also, 34 more people have succumbed to the disease in a day, the lowest in around two months.

He made a formal claim through his attorneys that he was abducted from Antigua and taken to Dominica so it is a report that police are taking seriously and they are currently investigating the abduction," Browne said.Another report in the Associates Times poked holes in the theory of Dominica opposition leader Lennox Linton, who had reportedly claimed that Choksi was brought to Dominica in the Yacht Calliope of Arne around 10 pm on May 23.The family of Choksi had claimed that he was in Antigua till 5 pm on May 23 which makes it impossible to cover a 120-mile distance in four to five hours, which approximately takes about 12-13 hours, the publication said.The report said that according to Customs document, the boat had left Antigua at 10 am on May 23, whereas Choksi's domestic staff had said that he was in his residence till 5 pm which indicates that Choksi did not travel by the boat which Linton is claiming.It quoted unnamed doctors of the Dominica China Friendship Hospital, where Choksi is admitted, that a nail injury cited by his lawyers is an old one while other bruises could be new and could have been caused by even by a "slight push".Choksi had mysteriously gone missing on May 23 from Antigua and Barbuda where he has been staying since 2018 as a citizen.He was detained in the neighbouring island country, Dominica, for illegal entry after a possible romantic escapade with his rumoured girlfriend.His lawyers alleged that he was kidnapped from Jolly Harbour in Antigua by policemen looking Antiguan and Indian and brought to Dominica on a boat.Choksi was brought before a Roseau magistrate, on the orders of the Dominica high court, to answer charges of illegal entry where he pleaded not guilty but was denied bail.He was admitted in the Dominica China Friendship Hospital.The Dominica High Court has adjourned the hearing of the habeas corpus petition filed by his lawyers.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi had fled India in the first week of January 2018 weeks before Rs 13,500 crore scam in Punjab National Bank (PNB) rocked the Indian banking industry.The duo allegedly bribed the officials of the state-run bank to get Letters of Undertaking (LoU) on the basis of which they availed from overseas banks which remained unpaid.The allegedly corrupt officials did not enter these LoUs in the core banking software of PNB, thus evading any scrutiny. The non-payment of these LoUs or bank guarantees worth Rs 13,500 crore resulted in default and became a liability on bank.Modi escaped to Europe and was finally held in London where he is contesting his extradition to India while Choksi took citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 where he had been staying since his escape from Delhi.
