21-06-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: Class 12 exams of Assam, Tripura, Karnataka boards cancelled, SC told||The Assam, Tripura and Karnataka governments informed the Supreme Court on Monday that they have cancelled their Class 12 state board exams in view of the ongoing Covid-19 situation.A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said: “Counsel for the state of Assam and state of Tripura have informed the court that concerned Board of the respective states have cancelled the ensuing XII standard Board Examination, 2021. Counsel for the state of Karnataka, on instructions, informed the Court that the state Board has cancelled the XII standard Board Examination, in the state of Karnataka.”The Bench noted that as far as the Class 10 board examination, 2021 is concerned, no final decision has been taken so far by Karnataka. “Let the aforementioned position be brought on record in the course of the day. Affidavits in that regard be filed through email,” said the top court in its order, on a plea seeking cancellation of state board Class 12 exams.The Bench adjourned the matter till Tuesday after being informed that writ petitions have been filed challenging the assessment policies of the CBSE and the ICSE board exams.The Bench, during the hearing in the matter, observed that it would first examine the merits of the assessment scheme proposed for the CBSE and the ICSE students. It said it will examine points in both schemes, and it will understand if there were some issues, but it would not go by perception of somebody.“Attorney General, we have agreed with your scheme in principle. But we will hear the petitioners before we suggest modifications,” said the Bench.On June 17, the CBSE had said for Class 12, marks based on unit test/mid-term/pre-board exam will have 40 per cent weightage; Class 11 marks based on theory component of final exam will have 30 per cent weightage; and Class 10 marks, based on average theory component of best three performing subjects out of main 5 subjects, will have 30 per cent weightage.

They would be governed on terms applicable for foreign service and would be subject to service rules and regulations such as pay and allowances, leave and career progression as applicable to them in their parent cadre, the note adds.Headquartered at Kolkata, the OFB is the oldest and the largest organisation in the country’s defence industry, dating back to 1787 when a gunpowder factory was established by the British at Ishapore.They produce a vast array of equipment for the armed forces, para-military organisations and to a limited extent, the civilian market.This includes weapons and ammunition, soft-skin vehicles, armoured vehicles, personal equipment and clothing, parachutes, opto-electronic devices, surveillance equipment and ancillary items.Under the new scheme of things, the 41 factories have been converted into seven defence public sector undertakings. Ammunition and Explosives, headquartered at Khadki, will take over 12 factories, while Weapons and Equipment, headquartered at Kanpur, and Ancillary, headquartered at Ambajhari, will get eight factories each.Vehicles, headquartered at Avadi, will get five factories, Troop Comfort Items, headquartered at Kanpur, will get four. Opto-electronics, headquartered at Dehradun will get three, while Parachute at Kanpur will comprise a single unit.The plan for corporatization of the OFB was conceived about two decades ago to revitalise and streamline the functioning of the factories which have often drawn fire from Parliament’s Standing Committee on Defence and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India oversight over poor quality of products, mismanagement, delayed timelines and lack of technological advancements.According to latest figures compiled by the MoD, the total manpower in OFB as on February 1, 2021 was 74,085 and the revenue generated in 2020 was Rs 12,755 crore. Arms and Explosives had the lion’s share in both, with 24,436 employees and a revenue of Rs 4,348 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-outsider-yet-only-mod-top-brass-to-head-newly-corporatized-ofb-on-deputation-271943
21-06-2021||New Delhi||WB CM Mamata Banerjee moves SC against HC order on filing of affidavits in Narada sting case||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has moved the Supreme Court challenging the Calcutta High Court’s denial for filing of affidavits by her and state Law Minister Moloy Ghatak on their role on the day of the arrest of four Trinamool Congress leaders on May 17 by the CBI in connection with the Narada sting tape case.A Bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and Aniruddha Bose will be hearing the separate appeals filed by the chief minister, Ghatak, and West Bengal Government on Tuesday.Earlier, the top court had said that it would hear on June 22 the appeal filed by Ghatak. The top court on June 18 had requested the high court to hear the case a day after the apex court considers the appeals of the state government and Ghatak against the order.On June 9, a five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court, hearing CBI’s application for transfer of the Narada sting tape case from the special CBI court to the high court, had said it will decide later on considering the affidavits by the Banerjee and Ghatak on their respective roles on the day of the arrest of four leaders in connection with the case.Senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Vikas Singh, appearing for Ghatak and the state government, had said it was necessary to bring on record of the high court the affidavits as they deal with the roles of the persons concerned on May 17. The law minister was attending the cabinet meeting and was not in the court premises at the time of the hearing, Dwivedi had said, adding that even the CBI officials were not there on the spot as the lawyer for the agency addressed the court virtually. It has been alleged that the state ruling party leaders played a key role in stopping CBI from performing its legal duty after the agency arrested four leaders on May 17 in the case.Singh had contended that under the rules there is a right to file affidavits and, moreover, CBI filed as many as three affidavits and did not take the permission of the court.The high court, which on June 9 decided to consider later the affidavits of Banerjee and Ghatak, was urged by the Solicitor General that the affidavits cannot be accepted on the ground of delay as they were filed after the completion of his arguments.The CBI, which has filed an application seeking transfer of the Narada sting tape case from the special CBI court to the high court, has made the chief minister and the law minister parties in its plea there. It had claimed that while the Chief Minister had sat on a dharna at the CBI office in Kolkata soon after the arrest of the four accused, Ghatak had been present at the Banshall Court premises during the virtual hearing of the case before the special CBI court there on May 17. Ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, Trinamool Congress MLA Madan Mitra, and former mayor of Kolkata Sovan Chatterjee were arrested by the CBI which is investigating the Narada sting tape case on a 2017 order of the high court. The five-judge bench, comprising Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and justices I P Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen, and Arijit Banerjee, had adjourned the hearing in the matter. The bench had granted interim bail on May 28 to the four accused. The special CBI court had granted them bail on May 17 itself, but the order was stayed by the high court, which remanded them to judicial custody. They had been placed under house arrest on May 21 by the high court, modifying its earlier order of stay on the bail. The Narada sting operation was conducted by journalist Mathew Samuel of Narada News, a web portal, in 2014 wherein some people resembling TMC ministers, MPs and MLAs were seen receiving money from representatives of a fictitious company in lieu of favours.At that time, the four arrested politicians were ministers in the Mamata Banerjee government. The sting operation was made public ahead of the 2016 assembly elections in West Bengal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wb-cm-mamata-banerjee-moves-sc-against-hc-order-on-filing-of-affidavits-in-narada-sting-case-271934
21-06-2021||---||India-EU naval exercise to set stage for greater cooperation||New Delhi, June 21The joint naval exercise between warships of the European Union (EU) and India conducted in the Gulf of Aden on June 18 and 19 will be the precursor of strengthened operational cooperation at sea, said a statement by the EU.One frigate from the Indian Navy and three from EU’s Somalia anti-piracy force under Operation Atalanta played out the scenario of an anti-piracy operation that included cross-deck helicopter landings, live firing, a night-time joint patrol and a “naval parade’’ in the high seas off the coast of Somalia.The EU intends involving India in its CRIMARIO II (Critical Maritime Routes in the Indian Ocean) initiative to secure sea lines of communication vital for international trade and prosperity. While CRIMARIO I (2015 – 2019), was for the Western Indian Ocean region, CRIMARIO II will expand its geographical scope to South and Southeast Asia.However, India will not play a prominent role in the EU’s attempt to strengthen its strategic trade position in the Indo-Pacific, given recent regional pacts such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). India does not figure among the priority countries named by the EU which are Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.The EU statement noted that the current dynamics in the Indo-Pacific have given rise to intense geopolitical competition that have increased tensions on trade and supply chains as well as in political and security areas.The Strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific announced in April has renewed the EU’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific which, like India, describes it as the region from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific island states. This will include partnerships in security and defence, malicious cyber activities, terrorism, and organised crime.The EU statement noted that both sides are committed to a free, open, inclusive and rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region. This convergence led to the first EU-India dialogue on maritime security earlier this year. The Indian Navy has also been providing escort to World Food Programme chartered vessels, coordinated by EU’s Operation Atalanta.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-eu-naval-exercise-to-set-stage-for-greater-cooperation-271933
21-06-2021||Gwalior||Madhya Pradesh:  14 cops suspended for lapse in Scindia's security||Authorities in Madhya Pradesh on Monday suspended 14 police personnel of two districts for a lapse in the security of BJP Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia during his visit to the state, a senior official said. The lapse in Scindia's security occurred on Sunday night when he was on his way to Gwalior after arriving from Delhi.Gwalior Superintendent of Police Amit Sanghi told PTI that 14 police personnel—nine of Morena and five of Gwalior district—have been suspended for negligence in handling Scindia's security.Sanghi said the former Union minister was to be escorted by the Morena Police on the Madhya Pradesh-Rajasthan border and later this task was to be done by their Gwalior counterparts.However, the Morena police escorted another vehicle which was similar to the one in which Scindia was travelling, the SP said.The Rajya Sabha MP entered Gwalior un-escorted as information about his movement was not shared by the Morena police with their Gwalior counterparts, he said.Following this lapse, action has been taken against the cops from two districts, Sanghi said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh%C2%A0-14-cops-suspended-for-lapse-in-scindias-security-271928
21-06-2021||New Delhi||No scientific evidence of Covid vaccination causing infertility in men, women: Health Ministry||The Union Health Ministry on Monday reiterated there is no scientific evidence of Covid-19 vaccination causing infertility in men and women and asserted the jabs are safe and effective. There have been media reports expressing concern regarding infertility due to Covid-19 vaccination among people of reproductive age, the ministry said in a statement.Over the last few days, certain media reports have highlighted the prevalence of various superstitions and myths in a section of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) including the nurses, it said.Such misinformation and rumours were spread during the vaccination drives against polio and measles-rubella too, it added.The ministry said it has clarified in the FAQs (frequently asked questions) posted on the website that none of the available vaccines affect fertility, as all the vaccines and their constituents are tested first on animals and later on humans to assess if they have any such side effects.Vaccines are authorised for use only after their safety and efficacy is assured, the statement said.“Furthermore, in order to curb the prevalent myth regarding infertility due to Covid-19 vaccination, the government of India has clarified that there are no scientific evidences suggesting COVID-19 vaccination can cause infertility in men and women. The vaccines have been found to be safe and effective,” it stated.The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) has recommended the Covid-19 vaccination for all lactating women, terming it as safe with no need to stop or pause breastfeeding before or after the vaccination.

21-06-2021||New Delhi||Is Covid wave 2 over? Positivity rate below 5 pc for 14 days, but experts say end still far||India on Monday crossed the important milestone of a Covid positivity rate of less than 5 per cent for 14 consecutive days, conforming to the WHO’s recommended requirement for a region to reopen, but experts were wary of declaring the devastating second wave over.With 53,256 new coronavirus infections, the lowest in 88 days, and a positivity rate of 3.83 per cent, it would seem the present phase of the Covid-19 crisis is over and it is a good time to lift restrictions.This optimistic picture, however, must be edged with abundant caution, said several scientists, citing the emergence of new variants, the still high absolute number of cases, the many districts where positivity rate remains over 5 per cent and concerns over reliability of data.“With the current positivity rate at less than 5 per cent, India’s Covid-19 second wave is on the wane as quickly as it rushed to its peak, but the end of it may yet be far away as more transmissible new variants such as Delta plus variant are emerging,” said Naga Suresh Veerapu, associate professor at the School of Natural Sciences (SoNS), Shiv Nadar University, Delhi NCR.The Delta plus variant has been formed due to a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and considered one of the drivers of the second wave in the country and also in several others including the UK.The test positivity rate or TPR—the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed that turn out to be positive—is an important metric through which the public health system keeps tabs on the level of Covid transmission.The WHO recommends that test positivity should remain at 5 per cent or lower for 14 days before countries or regions reopen.In February this year, the country was celebrating the end of the first wave and conveniently ignored an imminent second wave, Veerapu said.“The Delta variant that emerged in March spread across the different parts of India, then cases surged to the peak yielding a second wave. The second wave conjoined with the first when the latter was at 1 per cent positivity rate,” he told PTI. Public policy expert Chandrakant Lahariya added that while the cases are on the decline, the absolute number of cases are still very high.“While the national level test positivity rate has come down, there are still many districts where TPR is above 5 per cent,” the Delhi-based physician-epidemiologist and health systems expert told PTI.“Therefore, before saying that the second wave is over, I would like to wait for the TPR to come down below 5 per cent everywhere and sustain for two weeks or longer,” he said.Scientist Gautam Menon agreed with Lahariya, noting that some states such as Kerala are still seeing positivity rates over 5 per cent. He added that it is unclear whether this reflects just better testing than other states or if the situation is still to improve there.Positivity rate was 10.84 per cent in Kerala on Sunday.According to Health Ministry data on Monday, India’s total tally of Covid-19 cases is 2,99,35,221 (2.99 crore/29.9 million) while active cases have reduced to 7,02,887.The second wave of the pandemic overwhelmed the healthcare system of the country, leaving hospitals struggling to cope with the surge in cases and critical drugs and oxygen in short supply. Infections have now slowed down and restrictions have been relaxed in most states.Agreeing that the drop in India’s cases has been quite dramatic, Menon noted, “From all we know, this is a genuine decline, both in urban and rural India.” “There is no strict definition of a ‘wave’, let alone of how and when it might be ending, but this is a good time as any to consider opening up, although with caution,” Menon, professor, Departments of Physics and Biology, Ashoka University in Haryana, told PTI.The experts also believe test positivity rates provide valuable information only if testing is broadly accessible across all regions.

Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who claimed this vehicle was stolen from his possession, was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5. As per the agency, two accused, Satish alias Tanni bhai and Manish Soni, who were arrested last week along with Sharma, had killed Hiran in a red Tavera car where Shelar and Jadhav were also present, and the body was later dumped in a creek. On Monday, the court also permitted Sharma to meet his lawyer every day for 20 minutes.So far, NIA has arrested ten persons in the case, including Waze and Sharma. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/antilia-bomb-scare-hiran-killing-3-remanded-in-nia-custody-271917
21-06-2021||Kolkata||BJP’s north Bengal leader, seven others join TMC||In yet another jolt to the BJP,   the party's Alipurduar district president, Ganga Prasad Sharma, joined the TMC on Monday, as senior leader of the state's ruling party Mukul Roy, who also switched sides two weeks ago, claimed that this was the "beginning of the saffron party's end" in the state.Seven other BJP leaders from the region, too, followed in Sharma's footsteps and joined the Mamata Banerjee camp.Roy, addressing a press meet here, said the BJP's rise in the state began with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when it managed to bag several seats in north Bengal, and its downfall, too, will start from the region."This is just a glimpse of what lies ahead... The BJP's fall in the state is imminent," Roy, who was the saffron party's national vice-president until recently, underlined.Asked what he might have to say about BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari's insistence that he quit as an MLA, having won the Krishnanagar Uttar assembly seat on a saffron camp ticket, Roy said, "He should first find out what his father (Sisir Adhikari) was up to."Roy was referring to the TMC's demand for disqualification of Kanthi MP Sisir Adhikari, who crossed over to the BJP, much like his son, ahead of the polls.Sharma, on his part, alleged that the BJP has ignored the sentiments of grassroots workers while choosing candidates for the assembly polls, "inducting people at its own will and flying them to Delhi"."We felt neglected but still gave our best to the organisation and ensured that five saffron camp candidates from Alipurduar district get to win the assembly elections.Now, however, I intend to work for people under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee," he stated.Rejecting Suvendu Adhikari's assertion that Sharma changed sides as he was denied a saffron party ticket in the assembly polls, Sharma said, "Let me ask him why he chose to join the BJP ahead of the polls? Also, I wish to know why he was made the leader of opposition in the Assembly and not Manoj Tigga, who is a senior and loyal member of the camp." Coming down heavily on local MP John Barla, who has recently sought a separate union territory comprising north Bengal districts, the BJP turncoat pointed out that the parliamentarian, instead of doing something constructive for the region, is "fanning the flames of division".TMC deputy leader in the Upper House, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, who was also present at the press conference, said the people of the state will distance themselves from the BJP even further due its demands of "separatism".Echoing him, education minister and senior TMC leader Bratya Basu noted that the saffron camp, on one hand, is observing 'Poschimbongo divas' (West Bengal Day), and on the other, its MP is seeking a bifurcation of the state, with no regard for its integrity.Talking about Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar's visit to north Bengal, the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP said, "He is free to go anywhere he wishes to... but he should have taken the state government in confidence."Dhankhar has embarked on a week-long visit to north Bengal earlier in the day amid the controversy that has erupted in the region in the wake of Barla's demand.Slamming state BJP president Dilip Ghosh over his claim that Bengal is becoming a "safe haven of terrorist outfits due to inaction of the state government", the TMC MP said, "There are central agencies to keep a check on terrorist activities. If we were to believe him, the obvious question would be what are these agencies doing.""Are the agencies only there to harass and arrest student activists and the ones who raise their voice against the policies of the BJP government?" the MP added.—PTI— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-north-bengal-leader-seven-others-join-tmc-271909

It was by mistake that he was given the second dose, he said.Dr Sipun Panda, in-charge of the Betanati Community Health Centre, said he was aware of the complaint by Sahu and a committee will go into the entire incident before any action is taken against the nurse.Behera said Sahu had to be kept under observation for two more hours after the second jab during which he was given an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to drink.Sahu reported no adverse reaction, Dr Panda said.

21-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi has received 57 lakh Covid vaccine doses against 2.94 crore needed: Sisodia||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged on Monday that the Centre pressured officials in Delhi to publish advertisements in newspapers thanking it for providing free Covid vaccines for all from June 21, while the city has got only 57 lakh doses so far against the 2.94 crore needed.He also said the Centre will supply only 15 lakh Covid vaccine doses to Delhi in July and at this rate, it will take around 16 more months to inoculate the city’s entire population.Sisodia said several BJP-ruled states have published advertisements in newspapers, thanking the Centre for providing free Covid vaccines for all aged above 18 years from June 21.“They also asked officials in Delhi to publish advertisements in newspapers thanking (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi for the free vaccination. They sent this toolkit to Delhi government officials and pressured them to issue such advertisements,” he alleged during a digital press conference.“People do not need advertisements but vaccines. I request the prime minister to supply 2.3 crore more doses in the next two months. I promise that we will do your publicity...publish advertisements in entire Delhi, but you have been asking states to do so without giving them vaccines,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader alleged.On June 7, the prime minister announced that all citizens aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated against Covid-19 for free from June 21, with the Centre distributing doses to the states.“I got to know that not a single free vaccine has been supplied to Delhi for use beyond June 21,” Sisodia said.The Centre will supply only 15 lakh Covid vaccine doses in July and at this rate, it will take 15-16 more months to vaccinate the entire population of Delhi, he said.“You have been saying India has been conducting the largest vaccination drive globally, but it has turned out to be the most mismanaged, derailed and messed up exercise in the world,” the deputy chief minister alleged.In the 18-44 age group, around 92 lakh people are eligible for vaccination against Covid-19 in Delhi. The city has 57 lakh people aged above 45.“Delhi needs 2.94 crore doses to fully vaccinate this population. It has got 57 lakh so far. We need 2.3 crore more doses,” he said.Till Saturday, 65,14,825 Covid vaccine doses were administered in Delhi and a total of 15,76,775 people fully vaccinated, according to government data.

21-06-2021||Mumbai||UP assault case: Bombay HC grants transit anticipatory bail to journalist Rana Ayyub||The Bombay High Court on Monday granted transit anticipatory bail to journalist Rana Ayyub for a period of four weeks in connection with an FIR registered against her by the Uttar Pradesh police for allegedly circulating a video in which an elderly Muslim man claimed he was thrashed and asked to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’.The police in their FIR claimed the video was circulated to create communal unrest.The FIR was registered at the Loni Border police station at Ghaziabad in UP on June 15 under IPC Sections 153 (giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (promoting enmity between groups on ground of religion, class etc), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feels of any class by insulting its religion or religious belief) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).Ayyub’s counsel Mihir Desai on Monday told a single bench of Justice PD Naik that the applicant was a journalist who had just forwarded the video from her Twitter handle.“On June 16, when she came to know that the content of the video was not correct, she deleted the same,” Desai said.He further said the offences under which Ayyub has been booked are all punishable only up to three years in jail and hence, she should be given time to approach the court concerned in Uttar Pradesh to seek relief.Justice Naik noted that the police probe subsequently found the person, who allegedly claimed he was thrashed and forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’, had some altercation with the people who beat him over some other transaction.“Considering the factual aspects of the case and to enable the applicant (Ayyub) to approach the court concerned in Uttar Pradesh where the FIR is lodged, protection from arrest can be granted for a temporary period of four weeks,” the court said in its order.“In the event of the applicant’s arrest in this period, she shall be released on a personal bond of Rs 25,000,” Justice Naik said, adding there would not be an extension of the time period granted to the applicant.Apart from Ayyub, the FIR names Twitter Inc, Twitter Communications India, news website ‘The Wire’, journalist Mohammed Zubair, Congress leaders Shama Mohamed, Salman Nizami, Maskoor Usmani and writer Saba Naqvi.As per the FIR, the accused persons did not verify the credibility of the video, and shared it online with a communal angle with an intention to disrupt public peace and create a divide between two religious groups.In a video clip, which surfaced on social media on June 14, the man, identified as Abdul Shamad Saifi, was heard saying he was thrashed by some young men and asked to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’.However, the Ghaziabad police ruled out a communal angle and said the accused persons were unhappy about a “tabeez” (amulet) which the victim had sold to them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-assault-case-bombay-hc-grants-transit-anticipatory-bail-to-journalist-rana-ayyub-271894

Her parents are daily wage workers. She wanted a phone to attend online classes but her parents were unable to arrange money to buy a device. This made the girl take the extreme step.

21-06-2021||New Delhi||Facebook, WhatsApp urge HC to stay CCI notice in privacy policy matter||Facebook and WhatsApp on Monday urged the Delhi High Court to stay the Competition Commission of India (CCI) notice asking them to furnish certain information concerning a probe ordered by it into the instant messaging app's new privacy policy.A vacation bench of Justices Anup Jairam Bhambhani and Jasmeet Singh said it will pass an order on the application.During the hearing, the bench said since it was sitting on a vacation bench, it did not want to delve into the merits of the matter even as the main petitions are pending before a bench headed by the Chief Justice.“We will pass an order. The matter will be listed on July 9 (the date already fixed for the main petitions),” the bench said.The case relates to the appeals of Facebook and WhatsApp against a single judge order dismissing their pleas against the probe CCI ordered into the instant messaging app's new privacy policy.The high court had earlier issued notices on the appeals and asked the Centre to respond to it.In their fresh applications filed in the pending appeals, Facebook and WhatsApp sought to stay on the CCI's June 4 notice asking them to furnish certain information for an inquiry conducted by it.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing WhatsApp, said the problem is that they have received a fresh notice on June 4 and the last date to respond is today, which is June 21.He said the privacy policy is already under challenge in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court by way of a batch of petitions and even the government is looking into it.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Facebook, said the question here is of propriety and it is not correct as the highest court of the country, that is, the Supreme Court is looking into the matter.“Why did they wait for June 4 evening to issue the notice? They could have done it earlier,” he said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi, representing CCI, opposed the pleas saying at the stage of inquiry furnishing of information will not lead to any order by the CCI and the notice is in pursuance to the inquiry which was not stayed by the high court and that this, not the first notice issued to them.ASG Balbir Singh, also appearing for CCI, said since there is a statutory order against Facebook and WhatsApp, they should not use the high court's order and say that they will not furnish the information sought by CCI and the information should not be stalled at this stage.When the court asked what was the hurry of issuing notice by CCI, Lekhi said the question was not of a hurry but the matter itself requires a lengthy process.He said till a report is submitted by the Director-General to the CCI, there will be no precipitate action against them.The high court had on May 6 issued notice and sought a reply of CCI on the appeals filed by Facebook and WhatsApp.The single judge on April 22 had said though it would have been "prudent" for the CCI to await the outcome of petitions in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court against WhatsApp's new privacy policy, not doing so would not make the regulator's order "perverse" or "wanting of jurisdiction".The court had said it saw no merit in the petitions of Facebook and WhatsApp to interdict the investigation directed by the CCI.The CCI had contended before the single judge that it was not examining the alleged violation of individuals' privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court.It had argued before the court that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and "stalking" of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is, therefore, alleged abuse of dominant position."There is no question of jurisdictional error," it had contended saying that WhatsApp and Facebook's pleas challenging its decision were "incompetent and misconceived".WhatsApp and Facebook had challenged the CCI's March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy.CCI had also told the court that only after the investigation can it be determined whether the data collection by WhatsApp and sharing it with Facebook would amount to an anti-competitive practice or abuse of dominant position.It had also contended that the data collected, which would include an individual's location, the kind of device used, their internet service provider and whom they are conversing with, would lead to the creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised by way of targeted advertising and all this amounts to "stalking".The two social media platforms had contended that when the top court and the Delhi High Court were looking into the privacy policy, CCI ought not to have "jumped the gun" and intervened in the issue.They had also said that CCI's decision was an abuse of the commission's suo motu jurisdiction.They had claimed that the CCI in the instant case had "drifted far away" from the competition aspect and was looking into privacy issues which were already being looked into by the apex court and the Delhi High Court.In January, the CCI on its own decided to look into WhatsApp's new privacy policy based on news reports regarding the same.

21-06-2021||---||SC reserves verdict on Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia compensation to kin of Covid deceased||New Delhi, June 21The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its verdict on PILs seeking an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of those who lost their lives due to Covid-19 pandemic.After hearing Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, senior advocate SB Upadhyay and others, a Bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice MR Shah asked the parties to file written submissions in three days and reserved its order.It directed the Centre to simplify the process of grant of death certificates to the dependents of COVID19 victims as the petitioners alleged lack of uniform guidelines for it. Earlier, it had asked the Centre to furnish the ICMR guidelines on death certificates for Covid-19 victims.The Centre maintained that giving an ex gratia amount of Rs 4 lakh each to kin of Covid-19 victims wasn’t possible due to limited resources as it would affect pandemic response on other aspects, leading to more damage than good.”Already the finances of state governments and the Central Government are under severe strain, due to the reduction in tax revenues and increase in health expenses on account of the pandemic,” the Ministry of Home Affairs had said in an affidavit filed in the top court.It had also cautioned the court against stepping into the domain of the Executive as it might have unintended constitutional ramifications.On Monday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, it was not the case of the government that it had no funds. “The question is how to utilise the funds,” he said, adding an insurance scheme would be the best way to handle such situations created by a pandemic.Earlier, senior advocate SB Upadhyay submitted that financial constraints cannot be used to evade constitutional obligations of the State.Highlighting that many families have lost their “sole bread earner”, petitioners Gaurav Kumar Bansal and Reepak Kansal had contended that under section 12(iii) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, every family whose member died due to disaster was entitled for ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh.However, the Centre said the entire amount of the State Disaster Relief Fund will end up being utilised for such payments, if such payments are made, it said. “Utilisation of scarce resources for giving ex gratia, may have unfortunate consequences of affecting the pandemic response and health expenditure in other aspects and hence cause more damage than good.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-verdict-on-rs-4-lakh-ex-gratia-compensation-to-kin-of-covid-deceased-271869

The emergencies, including cases of frostbite, acute mountain sickness and Covid, were managed by Dr Tarun Rana, a Deputy Commandant with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. He was also part of the CAPF group that summited Mount Lobuche, at a height of 20,100 feet, becoming the first medical officer from the CAPFs to scale an international peak.About 20 people who had shown serious symptoms of Covid were airlifted from the base camp to Kathmandu for treatment. Mild and moderate cases were managed at the base camp itself and some of the people even recovered and scaled Mt Everest, the officer added. Medicines and health-care items were also distributed by the team at a health camp at Porsche village in Nepal.The 38-member team, led by Inspector General Raghubir Lal, returned to New Delhi a few days ago and is at present in isolation in accordance with Covid protocols. The members were drawn from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Force, Shashtra Seema Bal, Central Industrial Security Force and the Central Reserve Police Force, which come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs.The team had left for Kathmandu on April 13 to scale Mt Everest and Mt Lhotse, the fourth highest mountain in the world, spending about two months in Nepal for the expedition.

We all have seen that in such difficult times, yoga has become a great source of inner strength," he said.Yoga shows us the way from stress to strength and from negativity to creativity, he asserted. Modi noted that the medical science focuses as much on "healing" as on treatment, and said yoga plays a role in healing. Many schools now begin their online classes with yogic exercises like pranayam, he said, adding that this prepares children physically to deal with Covid.The prime minister expressed confidence that yoga will continue playing its preventive, as well as promotive role in healthcare of masses.

According to the police, he duped the woman by introducing himself as a foreign woman named Rebecca Christine on Facebook.Rebecca became a friend of Sawai Madhopur resident Gunjan Sharma and told her that she is a widow and a cancer patient and owns a property worth Rs 28 crore.She further said that as she has no heir to her property, she wanted to transfer it to Gunjan, police officials said.The accused further told the victim that 'her' lawyer Barmex and an Indian representative Bain Johnson would contact her for further steps. Thereafter, Gunjan received an email from 'Foreign Exchange Department' after which she paid Rs 2.5 crore in different accounts shared by it in the name of penalty imposed on expensive gifts seized by custom offices which were bifurcated under different categories, including the RBI fee, processing fee, advocate expense, etc.After finding that she had been duped, Gunjan then lodged a complaint.Deputy Inspector General of Police, SOG Sharat Kaviraj with his team traced the addresses on the basis of accounts and arrested the accused from his office being run in Mussoorie and Dehradun.During investigation, it was found that the accused was working with a fake CA card and had opened offices in Delhi, Mussoorie and Dehradun to get loans and to open fake accounts by using GST, ITR, PAN card, Aadhar card details.He was working with some Nigerian nationals too to earn more commission by opening fake accounts for them.The accused used to gang up with foreigners of Nigerian origin by sending Facebook requests with fake identities and entrap and cheat them on the pretext of giving gifts and huge amounts of reward.To stay away from the grip of the police, the accused had opened offices at six different places in the last five years.The investigation is on in the case.Additional Director General of Police, ATS and SOG, Rajasthan, Jaipur, have appealed to people urging them not to get tempted by offers made by unknown persons.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-man-dupes-foreigner-of-rs-2-5-cr-after-befriending-her-on-facebook-271840

People suffer from deprivation, have no hope and live in fear,” Christine Schraner Burgener, Special Envoy of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Myanmar, told the UN General Assembly on Friday.In the absence of international action, civilians are forming people's defence forces, she said. They use self-made weapons and receive military training from ethnic armed organisations in their resistance grounded on democratic solidarity. Multiple regions of the country which have not seen armed clashes in decades become zones of significant unrest.“Nationwide clashes, including in central Myanmar and regions bordering China, India and Thailand, have led to acute new displacements of around 1,75,000 civilians, and some 10,000 refugees have fled to India and Thailand. The regional threat of the crisis is real,” she said, adding that “we must continue to call for maximum restraint and condemn all forms of violence. The risk of a large-scale civil war is real.”Burgener emphasised that as the region faces a multi-dimensional crisis in the heart of Asia, “our timely support and action is paramount”.She also stressed that the international community must not forget the Rohingya people as the situation of the Rohingya remains dire and the General Assembly must continue to be seized on the issue as an integral part of its engagement on Myanmar.“Highlighting persistent challenges, Rohingya continue undertaking risky journeys across the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea,” Burgener said.The UN General Assembly adopted the draft resolution ‘The situation in Myanmar' on Friday with 119 member states, including Myanmar, voting in favour.Belarus was the sole country voting against the resolution, while 36 nations abstained. The nations which abstained from voting include Myanmar's neighbours - India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Lao, Nepal and Thailand. Russia also abstained.India abstained on the General Assembly resolution, saying its views have not been reflected in the draft, which did not get support even from Myanmar's neighbouring countries and New Delhi does not believe the resolution, tabled hastily, is conducive to "aiding our joint efforts towards strengthening democratic process” in Myanmar.

Police said that the priest was forcibly taking two devotees to the temple. The police said that the temple was closed due to COVID and the priest was violating COVID norms. pic.twitter.com/lOtAbABGiV  Seeing the district magistrate offering puja, the priests also insisted that they be allowed in.No case has been filed in the incident so far.Sumit Pandey, brother of the priest, told reporters, "Police deliberately did this. Protesting priests have also been implicated in false cases. We are very respected in the community." He said that his brother regularly performed 'puja' for the Bachchan family.Rajan Pathak, former president of Panda Samaj, also condemned the incident and said that every worshipper is equal in the eyes of the Almighty. He said the temple did not discriminate against anyone.Additional Superintendent of Police Sanjay Verma denied the incident saying no policeman escorted any official for performing puja in the temple."A priest performed darshan puja and when Amit Pandey started taking other visitors for the darshan puja, the police objected to it," Verma said. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priest-who-performed-pujas-for-gandhi-family-big-b-beaten-up-in-clash-with-police-video-goes-viral-271832

It has employed nearly 10 women in NCR and another seven in Pune.The NGO aims to collect old uniform from across the country. The products made from recycled cloth would be donated to the needy, especially in children and old-age homes.Maj Gen Kohli says, “The military uniform cannot be thrown away or given to the poor as non-authorised persons are allowed to wear it or may misuse it. We thus came up with this idea of gracefully disposing of the uniform.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/recycling-used-military-uniform-to-help-needy-271639
21-06-2021||---||Yoga effective against glaucoma, arthritis: AIIMS experts||New Delhi, June 20On the eve of the seventh International Yoga Day celebrations to be led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi tomorrow, AIIMS Delhi experts backed meditation and yoga as additional therapies for glaucoma and rheumatoid arthritis citing clinical evidence to this effect.Senior experts Tanuj Dada and Karthikeyan Mahalingam of the Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS, today said meditation had been proved to work in glaucoma as an additional therapy in a study on patients at the institution.The researchers said meditation worked as adjuvant therapy in glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure, enhancing cerebral blood flow, reversing autonomic dysfunction (damage to nerves that control involuntary body functions), decreasing oxidative stress (an imbalance that impacts body’s ability to detoxify), preventing mitochondrial dysfunction (a condition that hampers cell viability), decreasing inflammation, improving the quality of life, modulating wound healing and modifying other associated systemic diseases.”“In a recent trial conducted at our centre to evaluate the effect of mindfulness meditation on trabecular meshwork gene expression — the role of particular genes — in glaucoma patients, it was found that meditation alters gene expression, positively modulating cellular mechanisms involved in glaucoma pathogenesis thereby indicating its direct impact on ocular tissues,” the experts said.Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness with stress known to worsen the condition.“Younger patients have more propensity for anxiety and depression is more common in the geriatric population. The National Health and Aging Trends study showed a bidirectional relationship between mental health disorders and visual impairment. The role of meditation in treating glaucoma can’t be overemphasised,” the AIIMS findings suggest. In another study today, AIIMS doctors reported major benefits of yoga-based lifestyle in making positive impacts on the patients of rheumatoid arthritis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yoga-effective-against-glaucoma-arthritis-aiims-experts-271640

An inter-ministerial meeting discussed the feedback and, thereafter, finalised the rules.The concerns regarding India’s IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, were conveyed by the Special Procedures Branch of the Human Rights Council (HRC). They pertained to protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to privacy.Delhi’s reasoningReplying to the HRC wing, the Permanent Mission of India in Geneva said the rules were designed to empower ordinary users of social media and victims of abuse at social media platforms would have a forum for redressal of their grievances.The mission also highlighted India’s well-recognised democratic credentials and that an independent judiciary and a robust media were part of India’s democratic structure.The government had notified the IT Rules on February 25.

Is it not the responsibility of the SC and its judges and the Prime Minister, who formed the trust, to ascertain the truth? Shouldn’t the SC take cognisance of the matter?” he said. Last week also, the party had alleged that the trust bought a piece of land for Rs 18.5 crore, which the transferor had bought for Rs 2 crore just a few months earlier.Trust official Champat Rai had maintained that the land was originally bought for Rs 2 crore and registered accordingly on March 18, but its onward sale to the trust was at the current market price, which had increased since the SC ordered the temple construction.

The Governor, who went to Delhi from Kolkata on June 15, was supposed to return to Kolkata on June 18. But he postponed return journey by a day to meet Shah for the second time during the tour. Dhankhar had already met Shah on June 17. But some unfinished business best known to them necessitated a second meeting on Saturday.In Delhi, Dhankhar, a vocal critic of the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led government in the state, met National Human Rights Commission chairperson Arun Kumar Mishra and Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi.Incidentally, while the NHRC has ordered a probe into the incidents of post-poll violence in West Bengal, the CBI is investigating a coal scam in the state in which heavyweight politicians are allegedly involved.Back in Kolkata, Dhankhar is again packing him bag for his north Bengal tour. A Raj Bhavan communiqué on Sunday said, “Dhankhar will be on a weeklong visit to north Bengal from tomorrow. The Governor will be reaching Bagdogra Airport on June 21 and after a brief media interaction will proceed to Darjeeling with a stopover at Kurseong.”Incidentally, Dhankhar was trolled on Twitter earlier as he took to the micro-blogging site to post his picture with a caption where he referred to a table apparently used by Lord Curzon to sign the 1905 Partition of Bengal papers as “iconic”. Curzon’s decision had triggered massive protests and sowed the seed of mass unrest against the British occupation of India.WB moves HC seeking recall of NHRC orderKolkata: The WB Govt has filed an application before the Calcutta High Court seeking recall of its order that directed the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission to constitute a committee to examine all cases of alleged human rights violations during post-poll violence in the state. The application has been listed for hearing on Monday. PTIBJP’s Alipurduar dist chief set to join TMCKolkata: In a major setback for the BJP in north Bengal, where it fared well in the Assembly polls, president of the party’s Alipurduar district unit Ganga Prasad Sharma on Sunday said he will shortly be joining the TMC. Sharma said he was “finding it hard to put up with the policies” of the saffron party, and working for people have become increasingly difficult for him.

The affidavit has been filed in response to a PIL seeking Rs 4 lakh each to the families which lost their dear ones due to the pandemic.While issuing notice to the Centre, the top court had last month asked it to furnish the ICMR guidelines on death certificates for Covid victims.96.27% recovery rate; recoveries outnumber daily cases for 38th consecutive day3.22% daily positivity rate; below 5% for 13th day in a rowIn Andhra pradesh, record 12.56L vaccinated in a dayHighlighting that many families had lost their “sole bread earner”, petitioner advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal had contended that under section 12(iii) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, every family whose member died due to disaster was entitled for ex gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh. However, the Centre said it’s the “national authority” that is empowered to recommend guidelines for the minimum standards of relief, including ex gratia assistance and thus it is a “function entrusted to the authority by the law passed by Parliament”.Noting that the term ex gratia itself meant that it’s not based on legal entitlement, the Centre said an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh was beyond the fiscal affordability of state governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/finances-under-strain-cant-give-rs-4-lakh-covid-death-relief-govt-to-supreme-court-271684

The PDP’s Political Affairs Committee met at party president Mehbooba Mufti’s residence in Srinagar and authorised her to take a call on the June 24 meeting. Asked if she had decided, Mufti told The Tribune, “I will decide only after the PAGD meet.” National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah also spoke with senior party leaders today but the talks were not “structured”, said NC provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani. He said a PAGD meeting would take the final call on participation.In Valley, concern over seat reductionJ&K mainstream parties are apprehensive about reduction in the Valley’s constituencies through the delimitation exerciseThe PAGD includes NC, PDP, Awami NC, CPM, J&K People’s Movement and the CPI. Sajjad Lone’s People’s Conference is no more with the alliance. Sources said the PAGD might decide to nominate attendees for the Prime Minister’s meeting.Meanwhile, sources said the ongoing delimitation exercise was high on the agenda with discussions on June 24 expected to seek a broad consensus in the matter. Sources also said the Delimitation Commission was likely to meet with J&K’s deputy commissioners soon to seek inputs on making the constituencies “geographically more compact”. In an earlier letter to DCs, the commission had sought details of areas of the current constituencies and related aspects.With the government repeatedly ruling out the restoration of J&K’s special status – a professed goal of the PAGD – political observers say the J&K mainstream parties would probably deliberate hard over the PM’s invitation.The PAGD had at the time of its constitution even adopted the erstwhile flag of Jammu and Kashmir as its symbol. The move was a symbolic expression of PAGD’s commitment to the demand that special status of the area be restored to the pre-August 5, 2019, status.Another issue the National Conference would have to consider while deliberating on the Centre’s invitation is the fact that it has challenged the J&K Reorganisation Act 2019 in the Supreme Court.The Lok Sabha MPs of the National Conference had skipped the first meeting of the Delimitation Commission on February 18 this year, saying that the J&K Reorganisation Act 2019 was “unconstitutional” and under judicial scrutiny and they could not attend proceedings that flowed from the Act.The PDP too has been publicly seeking restoration of J&K’s statehood — something the Centre has said will happen at an appropriate time. “It seems like an appropriate time in their dictionary will be when their agenda of changing the demography and reducing Kashmiris to second class citizens gets fulfilled,” Mufti had recently said in an interview to The Tribune.Earlier this morning, J&K L-G Manoj Sinha and Ladakh L-G RK Mathur met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.Meanwhile, PDP leader Naeem Akhtar has been released from house detention after over a month, officials said.Last delimitation exercise 26 yrs ago||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jk-invite-pm-meets-top-ministers-gupkar-allies-to-take-call-tomorrow-271677
21-06-2021||New Delhi||Congress alleges another scam in land purchase in Ayodhya; says responsibility of SC, PM to find truth||The Congress on Sunday alleged a scam in the purchase of land by the Ram Temple Trust in Ayodhya and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Supreme Court to “fulfil their responsibility” by ordering a court-monitored probe to find the truth.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that a BJP leader bought 890 square metres of land in Ayodhya for Rs 20 lakh in February and sold it to the Temple Trust for a whopping Rs 2.5 crore, making a profit of 1250 percent in only 79 days.“BJP leaders are clearly complicit in this ‘loot’ of donation collected for the construction of Ram Mandir. The everyday revelations reflect brazen plunder of crores of donations with active abetment of the BJP Government,” the Congress leader alleged.He said the people will never forgive anyone who misappropriates donations in the name of Lord Ram and questioned the “silence” of the prime minister and the Supreme Court.“Lord Ram’s temple is being constructed as per the orders of the Supreme Court. Is it not the responsibility of the Supreme Court and its judges and the prime minister, who formed the Trust, to find out the truth and investigate this?”“Shouldn’t the Supreme Court take cognisance of the matter? The Supreme Court should discharge its duty... hold an audit of the entire transactions under its monitoring and punish the culprits,” he told reporters when asked if the party would move the court.“Now the question is whether the Supreme Court and the prime minister will discharge their duty, we leave it to their discretion,” he said.Surjewala said if it is anyone’s responsibility, it is Prime Minister Modi’s as he formed this trust.“It is not only a question of morality, but it is also a question of constitutionality,” he said, adding that the ball is now in the prime minister’s court on what action he takes.The Congress had earlier alleged that land purchased for Rs 2 crore was sold for Rs 18.5 crore to the Trust “within minutes”, as per the land deed registered on March 18 this year, and demanded an SC-monitored probe into the “scam”.BJP leaders had hit back at the Congress, claiming those who were opposed to the Ram temple constructions were now trying to derail it by making false and misleading allegations.The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust had also dismissed the allegations as politically motivated.Surjewala said with the “facts” now in the public domain, an investigation is required under the supervision of the Supreme Court to ascertain the truth.Posing five questions to Prime Minister Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he asked, “What is the reason for the intriguing silence of Modiji-Adityanath on the brazen loot of crores and why no action is being taken against the sinners who openly looted funds for the construction of the Ram temple”. “The Modi-Yogi Governments should know that they cannot escape their bounden duty i.e. Raj Dharma to punish the culprits,” Surjewala said.

21-06-2021||New Delhi||India strongly rejects criticism of new IT rules by UN special rapporteurs||India has dismissed criticism of its new IT rules relating to social media by three UN special rapporteurs on rights issues saying the country's democratic credentials are well recognised and the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under its Constitution."The concerns alleging potential implications for freedom of expression that the new IT Rules will entail are highly misplaced," India's permanent mission to the UN in Geneva said in a strongly worded response, asserting that the rules are "designed to empower ordinary users" of social media.The enactment of these rules had become necessary following widespread concerns about increasing instances of abuse of social media and digital platforms, it said.The Upper House of Parliament had repeatedly asked the government to strengthen the legal framework and make the social media platforms accountable under the Indian laws and the rules were framed after extensive deliberations, it noted.Also, the Supreme Court of India in two judgements had directed it to frame necessary guidelines to eliminate child pornography and related contents in online platforms and also said that it was imperative to frame proper regime to find out the persons, institutions, and bodies who were the originators of such content messages."The Permanent Mission of India would also like to highlight that India's democratic credentials are well recognised. The right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under the Indian Constitution," it said in a communication to the rapporteurs."The independent judiciary and a robust media are part of India's democratic structure," it added.The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and the Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy had expressed concerns over India's IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021."The concern that the rules may be misused deliberately to make a large number of complaints so as to overwhelm the grievance redressal mechanisms created by social media platforms is also misplaced, exaggerated and disingenuous and shows lack of willingness to address the grievances of the users of these media platforms while using their data to earn revenues," the Indian mission said in its response.The Rapporteurs said the rules in their current form do not conform with international human rights norms and pressed for a detailed review."We would like to recall that restrictions to freedom of expression must never be invoked as a justification for the muzzling of any advocacy of multiparty democracy, democratic tenets and human rights," the Rapporteurs said in a communication.Under the new rules, social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter are required to appoint nodal officers and create mechanisms to remove offending posts and messages.US tech giant Twitter has been engaged in a tussle with the Indian authorities over the new rules. The government accused the company of failing to comply with the new rules which came into force late last month.The Indian mission also said that under the new rules, the social media companies are required to appoint India-based grievance redressal officers, compliance officers, and nodal officers to address complaints of the users."The enactment of new IT rules had become necessary due to widespread concerns about issues relating to increased instances of abuse of social media and digital platforms, including inducement for recruitment of terrorists, circulation of obscene content, the spread of disharmony, financial frauds, incitement of violence, public order, etc," it said.The mission said that prior to the notification of the rules, the users had no opportunity to file a complaint in case of any misuse or abuse of social media platforms.Referring to a verdict by the Supreme Court, it said the government of India fully recognises and respects the right of privacy.It said the new IT rules seek information only on a message that is already in circulation that resulted in an offence, asserting that they have been framed in exercise of the statutory powers of the IT Act, fully taking into account the principles of reasonableness and proportionality."The rules seek to empower the users by mandating the intermediaries, including social media intermediaries, to establish a grievance redressal mechanism for receiving and resolving complaints from the users or victims," the mission said."Intermediaries shall appoint a Grievance Officer to deal with such complaints and share the name and contact details of such officer," it added.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) also issued a statement on India's response. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-strongly-rejects-criticism-of-new-it-rules-by-un-special-rapporteurs-271461

21-06-2021||New Delhi||Scale up health infra, speed up vaccination to prevent another Covid surge: WHO to nations||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday called upon countries in its south-east Asia region to scale up public health infrastructure, rigorously implement social measures and make efforts to accelerate vaccination to prevent another Covid-19 surge.This week, Maldives and Myanmar confirmed the transmission of coronavirus variants of concern. Earlier, variants of concern have been confirmed in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste, the global health body said.The coronavirus variants of concern along with the opening of economies and societies contributed to the recent surge in cases globally.“We need to continuously strengthen our efforts to test, trace and isolate. Physical distancing, hand hygiene and proper wearing of masks need to be stringently implemented.“These measures should be in full force and for longer periods in areas reporting more transmissible variants of concerns,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the Regional Director of WHO South-East Asia.Even as countries scale up vaccination against Covid-19, they need to implement public health and social measures in a tailored and agile manner, she said.Singh, in a statement, said a risk-based approach is needed for public health and social measures and these measures should be implemented by the lowest administrative level and adjusted to the intensity of transmission and the capacity of health systems.A number of countries are currently at different phases in the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic and are facing varying epidemiological situations. Though the region is now witnessing an overall decline in cases mainly due to a dip in cases in India, in some other nations are still seeing a spike in cases.“We must not forget that the pandemic is still around and must guard against complacency at any level. We must continue to implement combinations of public health and social measures until globally there is high vaccine coverage among health workers, and high-risk and vulnerable groups,” Singh said in the statement.

21-06-2021||New Delhi||Can't give Rs 4 lakh compensation to Covid victims, Centre tells SC||Citing limited resources, the Centre has told the Supreme Court that giving an ex-gratia amount of Rs 4 lakh each to kin of Covid-19 victims wasn’t possible as it would affect pandemic response on other aspects, leading to more damage than good.“Already the finances of State Governments and the Central Government are under severe strain, due to the reduction in tax revenues and increase in health expenses on account of the pandemic,” the Ministry of Home Affairs said in an affidavit filed in the top court.The Centre cautioned the court against stepping into the domain of the executive as it might have unintended constitutional ramifications.The entire amount of the State Disaster Relief Fund will end up being utilised for such payments, if such payments are made, it said.“Utilisation of scarce resources for giving ex-gratia, may have unfortunate consequences of affecting the pandemic response and health expenditure in other aspects and hence cause more damage than good,” read the MHA affidavit.The affidavit has been filed in response to a PIL seeking an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the families which lost their dear ones due to the pandemic. While issuing notice to the Centre, the top court had last month asked it to furnish the ICMR guidelines on death certificates for Covid-19 victims.Highlighting that many families have lost their “sole bread earner”, petitioner advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal had contended that under section 12(iii) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, every family whose member died due to disaster was entitled for ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh.However, the Centre said it was the “National Authority” empowered to recommend guidelines for the minimum standards of relief, including ex-gratia assistance and thus it is a “function entrusted to the authority by the law passed by Parliament”.Noting that the term “ex-gratia” itself meant that it’s not based on legal entitlement, the Centre said an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh was beyond the fiscal affordability of state governments.”It is well settled through numerous judgments of the Supreme Court that this is a matter which should be performed by the authority to whom it has been entrusted and not one where the court will substitute its own judgement for the decision to be taken by the Executive. Any attempt to second guess may create unintended and unfortunate Constitutional and administrative ramifications,” submitted the Centre, which had earlier told the court that the issue was under consideration.Maintaining that it’s wrong to state that the help can be provided only through ex-gratia assistance as it would be a rather “pedantic and narrow approach”, the Centre said, a broader, sustainable and more prudent approach would involve health interventions, social protection, and economic recovery for the affected communities.“Globally, the governments in other countries too have followed this approach, and have announced interventions that provide fiscal stimulus. The Government of India has followed a similar approach,” it said||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-give-rs-4-lakh-compensation-to-covid-victims-centre-tells-sc-271398

21-06-2021||Bhartesh Singh Thakur||Five defence officers set to face General Court Martial in DeMo scam||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 19A Brigadier, Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, Captain and Warrant Officer are set to face a general court martial (GCM) in a case of alleged illegal exchange of old currency notes worth Rs 6 lakh with legal tender at the 1 Central Base Post Office in New Delhi after the 2016 demonetisation.They are also accused of preparing 5,944 forged forms with fake IDs for the exchange, carried out on November 9, 2016, a day after PM Narendra Modi declared old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes invalid. According to the chargesheet, Brigadier Suresh Gupta, the then Director (Operation and Technical), Ministry of Defence, and nodal officer of the Army Postal Service Base Circle, allegedly abetted the exchange of old currency notes and the preparation of the forged forms for exchange between December 12, 2016, and January 10, 2017.Brigadier Gupta is also accused of pressurising Brigadier MK Khan, the then Director, Army Postal Service Headquarters, Western Command, for not submitting an investigation report into the “scam”, interference in the post office’s internal functioning and allowing his son to have unauthorised access to treasury cash book of the 1 Central Base Post Office (CBPO). Colonel Subhash Chandra, then Commandant, 1 CBPO, is also facing trial. The GCM of Brigadier Gupta and Colonel Chandra will start on June 28.The second set of officers includes Lt Colonel Sudhir Kumar Singh, Captain Gagan Bawa and Warrant Officer G Rajendran, whose GCM is taking place separately and is starting on June 26.Lt Colonel Singh, then Officiating Commandant of 1 CBPO, is accused of knowingly furnishing false data related to the withdrawal of exchanged currency and making a false statement that the notes had been exchanged after proper identification. He has retired, but is attached for trial.Facing 12 charges, Captain Bawa, who was Base Post Master at 1 CBPO, is accused of abetting Warrant Officer Rajendran in the exchange of the old notes. He allegedly intentionally omitted to submit a report on the withdrawal of old series notes. He is also accused of improperly allowing Rajendran to deposit Rs 2.20 lakh brought by Naib Subedar Suresh Rajput, who too is under scanner for disciplinary proceedings. The Warrant Officer is facing seven charges.Defence counsel Rajesh Sehgal, representing all the accused but Colonel Chandra, said, “We have approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court and our contention is that the convening order of the GCM has become time-barred by the law of limitation under the Army Act as over three years have passed since the knowledge of the alleged offence. The Army Rule 180 has also been violated. The High Court has even issued a notice to the Army authorities.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-defence-officers-set-to-face-general-court-martial-in-demo-scam-271194
