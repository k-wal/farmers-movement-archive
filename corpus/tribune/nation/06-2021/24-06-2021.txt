24-06-2021||Satya Prakash||Abrogation of Article 370: Around two dozen petitions hang fire in Supreme Court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 24As Prime Minister Narendra Modi leads a Jammu and Kashmir outreach, around two dozen petitions challenging the validity of the J&K Reorganisation Act 2019--which divided the erstwhile state into two union territories—and nullification of Article 370 remain pending before the Supreme Court for almost two year.The top court had on August 28, 2019, referred petitions challenging Presidential Orders nullifying Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories to a five-judge Constitution Bench. In March last year, it had refused to refer it to a larger Bench of seven judges. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which divided the state into two union territories – Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, has already been acted upon. The changes came into effect on October 31, 2019 after notified in the official gazette.“The Supreme Court can always turn the clock back,” a five-judge Constitution Bench had said on October 1,  2020, when it took up the petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the J&K Reorganisation Act 2019 and the August 5 Presidential Orders nullifying Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir.There are around two dozen petitions challenging the Presidential Order nullifying Article 370, including those by Delhi-based advocate ML Sharma, Jammu and Kashmir-based lawyer Shakir Shabir, National Conference Lok Sabha MPs Mohammad Akbar Lone and Justice (Retd) Hasnain Masoodi, bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal and his party colleague Shehla Rashid.There is another PIL filed by former interlocutor for Jammu and Kashmir Radha Kumar, Air Vice Marshal (Retd) Kapil Kak, Major General (Retd) Ashok Mehta, and former IAS officers Hindal Haidar Tyabji, Amitabha Pande and Gopal Pillai who have urged the top court to declare the August 5 Presidential Orders be declared “unconstitutional, void and inoperative”.The Sajad Gani Lone-led Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference (JKPC) had in November last year moved the Supreme Court demanding early hearing of petitions challenging the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution.Referring to the “sweeping changes” introduced in Jammu & Kashmir by the Centre, the plea filed through JKPC spokesperson Adnan Ashraf, had submitted that such changes will have an irreparable impact on the rights of people of the erstwhile state.This was the second such plea in the top court. Earlier, petitioner Shakir Shabir had demanded early hearing, expressing the apprehension that mere passage of time can render the abrogation of Article 370 permanent, making the petitions infructuous.He had pointed out that since the promulgation of the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 amending Article 367 of the Constitution of India and abrogating Article 370 on August 5, 2019, several laws had been passed, effecting key changes in Jammu and Kashmir.Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the functioning of the Supreme Court that has been functioning in a restricted manner in virtual mode since March 2020. With apprehensions of a third wave of the pandemic looming large in the minds of health experts, government functionaries and the public in general, it’s difficult to hazard a guess as to normal functioning of the top court to enable it take up petitions challenging Presidential Orders nullifying Article 370 and bifurcation of J&K into two union territories.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abrogation-of-article-370-around-two-dozen-petitions-hang-fire-in-supreme-court-273416

24-06-2021||Kolkata||BJP seeks cancellation of Mukul Roy’s nomination for PAC||The saffron party on Thursday sought cancellation of Mukul Roy’s nomination for the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and urged the Assembly secretary to reject his candidature as his name has not been proposed by the BJP Legislature party and the TMC is ineligible to advance his nomination as he has been elected on a BJP ticket.Roy was among the 20 MLAs who filed nominations for memberships of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the West Bengal Assembly on Wednesday amid speculations that he may be appointed its chairman.The TMC has submitted 14 names and the BJP has put forward six names. Roy featured in the list of 20.Roy, officially a BJP MLA from Krishnanagar Uttar, switched over to the TMC last week but did not resign from the assembly or was disqualified under the anti-defection law.“We have submitted a letter to the assembly secretary objecting Mukul Roy’s nomination for the PAC membership.According to the assembly rules, either his name has to be submitted by the TMC or the BJP.“The list doesn’t state on whose behalf Mukul Roy has filed nomination,” a senior BJP MLA said.Roy’s name has been proposed by independent member Ruden Sada Lepcha and TMC MLA Tarun Kumar Maity.Citing Rule no-302 of the Rules Procedure and Conduct of Business in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, the letter by the BJP noted that the norm of electing members to the PAC is based on the Principle of Proportional Representation.“Proportional Representation means election of the PAC members from amongst the proportional ratio of the parties.The BJP has not recommended his name.“The TMC also can’t recommend his names as he has been elected on a BJP ticket. Hence, his nomination should be cancelled,” another BJP MLA said.Reacting to the development, TMC chief whip Nirmal Ghosh had said the letter by the BJP neither has any legal nor constitutional sanctity.“The BJP leaders don’t know the rules and proceedings of the House. When the nominations for the PAC membership are submitted, it is done as members of the house and not as a member of any party,” Ghosh said.Meanwhile, according to sources, all the 20 nominations, including that of Roy, have been accepted after the scrutiny.However, the list will be officially announced later.The BJP legislature party is apprehensive that the post of the PAC chairman, whose selection is the speaker’s prerogative, might go to Roy as there have been instances when Congress MLAs switching over to TMC were appointed to the important posts, party sources said.“As per the norm, the PAC chairman post goes to the opposition party. But, in the last assembly, we saw how Manas Bhunia and Sankar Singh held the post despite crossing over to the TMC and not resigning as Congress MLAs.“The speaker then had cited that they are officially opposition MLAs,” a state BJP leader said.The apprehensions gained momentum after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, during a press conference, said Roy is a “BJP member” and the TMC is ready to face voting on the floor of the house on the issue of PAC chairman.Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari said Roy’s nomination does not matter as he would cease to exist as a house member under the anti-defection law.

24-06-2021||Kolkata||Judge reserves order on Mamata’s recusal plea over his BJP links||The Calcutta High Court on Thursday reserved its order on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s application seeking recusal of a judge from hearing her petition challenging the election of her BJP rival from Nandigram Suvendu Adhikari apprehending bias because of his links to the saffron party.Banerjee was present before the court online during the hearing by Justice Kausik Chanda in accordance with his June 18 direction.Appearing for Banerjee, senior counsel AM Singhvi submitted through video conferencing that the petitioner apprehends bias on the part of the judge in adjudicating the election petition as he was formerly an “active member” of the BJP.Advocate SN Mookerjee also argued for the TMC supremo.Justice Chanda, whose recusal Banerjee has sought, reserved his judgement after hearing their submissions.Banerjee has claimed Justice Chanda was an active member of the BJP till his appointment as Additional Solicitor General in 2015, and since the election of a BJP candidate has been challenged, she apprehended bias in adjudication of the election petition.Quoting Shakespeare, Singhvi submitted: “Hon’ble judge of this hon’ble court should be like Caesar’s wife - above suspicion.”Justice Chanda said he was never the convenor of BJP’s legal cell, as claimed, but had represented the party in many cases before the Calcutta High Court.He acknowledged he had appeared for the BJP in a 2014 case for granting permission for a rally to be addressed by Amit Shah in front of Victoria House at Esplanade.The judge wondered whether recusing himself from the case would not mean giving in to a media trial.Justice Chanda also asked why the objections were not raised during the first hearing of the election petition on June 18 and the transfer application submitted to the Acting Chief Justice on June 16 was not mentioned then.Banerjee claimed in the recusal application that as Suvendu Adhikari is a member of the BJP and the “Hon’ble Judge was an active member of the BJP, (it) will lead to a situation and perception whereby the Hon’ble Judge adjudicating the said election petition, may be said to be judge in his own cause”.Her counsel had also written to the acting chief justice seeking reassignment of her election petition to another Bench.Banerjee has accused Adhikari, her former confidante- turned-rival, of committing corrupt practices in violation of Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. She has also alleged irregularities were committed in the counting exercise.According to the result declared by the Election Commission on May 2, Adhikari had defeated Banerjee by 1956 votes.She had sought recounting of votes after her defeat by a slender margin but the returning officer turned down the request.

India also pressed for the full implementation of UN resolutions and targeted sanctions against UN designated terrorist individuals and entities, they said.Doval also proposed the adoption of international standards to counter terror financing, including a MoU between SCO and FATF.  At the moment, Pakistan is the only SCO member that is on FATF’s grey list and a decision whether it will remain on the watch-list will be announced on Friday.The NSA also suggested the need to monitor new technologies used by terrorists including drones for smuggling of weapons and misuse of dark web, artificial intelligence, blockchain and social media.He advocated the need to preserve gains made in last two decades in Afghanistan and give top priority to welfare of its people. India fully supports SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan, which should be more active, Doval told the meeting.He also pressed for greater connectivity including through initiatives like Chahbahar, INSTC, Regional Air Corridors, Ashgabat Agreement which always leads to economic gains and building trust. “However, connectivity must respect sovereignty and territorial integrity,’’ he cautioned, in an oblique reference to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor which also passes through territory claimed by India.Sources said Doval said though India became SCO Member in 2017, it has physical, spiritual, cultural and philosophical inter-linkages for centuries with countries that now make up SCO.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-asks-sco-to-frame-action-plan-against-pak-based-terror-groups-jem-let-273401

24-06-2021||Unnao (UP)||BJP changes candidate for zila panchayat chief’s post after Unnao rape victim writes to President, PM||The BJP on Thursday changed its candidate for the post of the district panchayat chief here after the Unnao rape victim objected to the party’s choice, alleging that he is “very close” to former MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was convicted for the crime.Sengar, a former BJP MLA from Unnao’s Bangarmau seat, was accused of rape by the victim in 2017. A Delhi court had sentenced Sengar to life imprisonment in the case in December 2019.The party’s decision came after the rape victim wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in this regard.The rape victim also claimed danger to her life if the BJP gives ticket to Arun Singh, who held the post of the Nawabganj block panchayat chief. The elections for the post of the zila panchayat chairman are scheduled for July 3.The BJP had earlier denied the charge, with its district president Raj Kishore Rawat terming it “baseless” and suggesting that the allegations may be a part of a “conspiracy” by the Opposition.Later, Rawat in a statement said, “On directions of the party leadership, the candidature of Arun Singh has been cancelled. Now Shakun Singh, wife of the late former MLA Ajit Singh, will be the party candidate for the district panchyat chairperson.”  The rape victim had told PTI over the phone that though the BJP talks of strict action against criminals, it declared the man, who was “involved” in the murder case of her father, as its candidate for the post of the zila panchayat chairman.She alleged, “The BJP government is still supporting Kuldeep Singh Sengar. Arun Singh is very close to Sengar. My entire family has been destroyed by Sengar. If Arun Singh gets the ticket, it will increase danger to my life.”     “It is my demand from the party and the government to withdraw Arun Singh’s name and declare someone else as its candidate,” the rape victim said, adding that she has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, PM Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath regarding this.She also alleged that her uncle is seeking parole from police custody but it is not being allowed because of Sengar.Her sister’s marriage has been stalled due to the absence of any male member in her family, she claimed.Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya earlier in the day in Mirzapur said that he has got information about the BJP ticket to Arun Singh and the party leadership will take a decision on it.

24-06-2021||New Delhi||8-yr-old girl develops multisystem inflammatory syndrome; had tested negative for Covid||An eight-year-old girl here, who was a suspected case of Covid-19, developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a post-Covid complication that can manifest three to six weeks after the infection, hospital authorities said on Thursday.Early detection of MIS-C is important to control mortalities. It is an unregulated hyper immune response typically found in children as a reaction to inflammation in the body, doctors said.“The child was brought to Apollo hospital here early June. Her condition was critical with low levels of blood pressure, oxygen and dipping pulse rate. While she had tested negative for Covid-19, she was detected with high levels of Covid antibodies making her a case of MIS-C,” the hospital said in a statement.She was a suspected asymptomatic case of Covid-19, a spokesperson of the hospital said.“Because of her very high ventilator requirements and low oxygen saturations we decided to immediately put her on ECMO support. She improved gradually and it was only after a week that she could be taken off ECMO support,” Dr Nameet Jerath, senior consultant, pediatric intensive care, said.MIS-C, a post-Covid complication, can manifest three to six weeks after asymptomatic or symptomatic infection, and early detection is important to control mortalities, she said.Dr Muthu Jyothi, senior consultant, pediatric cardiology, at the hospital, said, “If MIS-C is not identified and treated quickly, the condition of the patient can deteriorate within hours and make it life-threatening.”               It can develop in children who had no serious COVID-19 symptoms, the doctor said.“We brought her in an ambulance while being on ventilator to ensure the situation does not degrade further, threatening her life,” Jyothi said.While the reported severity of Covid in children has been mild, a few cases of severe manifestations and post-Covid complications have been reported. These complications range from mild manifestations of extreme fatigue, body and joint pain and fever, to some severe health conditions, and MIS-C and acute respiratory distress being the two most common ones, the hospital authorities said.After complaining of high grade fever, abdomen pain, vomiting and persistent headache for a week, the young girl had been admitted to a local hospital where her condition had deteriorated to acute respiratory distress.She was then referred to the pediatric team of Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals here, the statement said.

24-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt lies with confidence: Fadnavis||Maharashtra BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday accused the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state of lying “with confidence”, and criticised it over issues such as Maratha, OBC reservations, handling of the Covid-19 situation and the Sachin Waze case.Speaking at a state-level convention of his party here, the former chief minister also said the BJP will intensify its agitation until the OBC reservation in local body elections—recently quashed by the Supreme Court—is restored.“It is a wrong thing, but I think we need to learn something from this government. The way the MVA government spreads lies with confidence every day, it has baffled me. We should learn to possess this confidence and not the lying trait from this government,” he said.The previous BJP-led government had offered reservation in jobs and education to the Maratha community and political reservation to the OBCs, but the steps taken by the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government resulted in nullification of these decisions, Fadnavis claimed.“The state BJP will not let the MVA government breathe easy until the political reservation for OBCs is restored. We are going to intensify our agitation in coming days and will corner the government,” he said.The government is “running away” from questions by truncating the coming monsoon session of the state legislature to only two days, the BJP leader said.Referring to dismissed police officer Sachin Waze and alleged favours he received while handling high-profile cases, Fadnavis said, “The Waze in the police department has been nabbed. There are many such Wazes in every department under the MVA. We need to catch them as well to clean up the system.”  Waze was dismissed from service after his arrest in the case of explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house and the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.

24-06-2021||Ravi S Singh||Modi asks people to be vocal for local toys||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 24Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday pitched for scaling up the country's toys industry to expand its footprint in the global market.In his virtual address to the Grand Finale of the country's first ‘Toycathon-21’, Modi said the global toy market is worth about 100 billion dollars, but India's share was a meagre 1.5 billion dollar.He addressed it after interacting with participants through video-conferencing. India imports 80 per cent of its domestic demand for toys resulting in outflow of crores of rupees abroad.Batting for "vocal for local", he said the purpose of the Toycathon was an effort aimed at making India a hub for ideation and production of toys.The "Toyconomy" of the country is linked to country being "atmanirbhar" (self-reliant). Artisans and smallscale units producing toys are located in villages. A boost to the industry will help them.He said toys play an important role in the development of a child's psychology. They are the stepping stone of socialisation and help shape the psychic development of the child. Toys are the first friend of the children.Urging entrepreneurs, start-ups and other stake-holders to step up the plate with quality production, Modi said the country has a huge potential in the toy and the gaming industry, including the digital sector. The country sparkles with ideas and concepts from mythology, folklore and culture, and with incidents galore relating to Independence struggle and heroics of the freedom fighters. He said the toys and gaming modules imported are designed on concepts which are not in sync with India's culture and civilisational values.

If we want to avoid it, we need to do three things aggressively follow COVID appropriate behaviour, we must have very good surveillance and aggressively push for vaccination. If we do these three things, we will be able to get away either not having a third wave or delaying it or it will have a very little peak,” he said.“If cases have come down, let us not make the same mistake which we made after the first wave. We thought that the virus has gone and now we can do anything. We must understand virus is still there and mutating. It is becoming more of a cause of concern,” he added.Dr Guleria said restrictions should be enforced in any area where there is a rise in cases. He also laid thrust on wearing a mask, keeping physical distance and washing hands.“We cannot allow any variant to spread. In any area where cases are increasing, hospital admissions are going up, then the area must be clamped, to stop the spread of the virus we can have a very strict lockdown. There is need to do a lot of testing, tracking, treating and isolating positive cases,” said Dr Guleria.The AIIMS director said if a large number of people get vaccinated, they will get less severe disease in case of infection and vaccination also helps in breaking the chain of transmission.

So far, everyone in Punjab has heeded my advice.”On Sidhu’s public remarks, Rawat added the former minister had also noted that he would abide by the decisions of the high command.Asked about the Punjab Congress face for 2022 state elections, Rawat said, “We will discuss that matter when the time comes.”He also said the party will call Sidhu for discussions soon.Earlier today, state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, Finance Minister Manpreet Badal, MPs Ravneet Bittu and Partap Bajwa also met Rahul Gandhi.Jakhar later said he was hopeful of an early resolution of the Punjab issue, given the level of seriousness with which Rahul Gandhi is viewing the matter.”We discussed ways of strengthening the party and resolving differences of opinion between leaders. The seriousness with which Rahul is watching the issue, I am confident of an early solution. The Congress will politically revive from Punjab,” said Jakhar, adding that compensatory job to kin of MLAs was wrong and could not be defended.“Some so-called advisers have landed the CM’s office in a spot. What is wrong cannot be called a right,” the state chief added on the issue of jobs to sons of MLAs in the state.Bajwa, meanwhile, said MLAs and ministers who want to fight elections in Punjab have discussed with the leadership the ways to get reelected.”We spoke about the current political situation of Punjab, where we stand electorally, what are the expectations of the people from us,” said Bajwa.On who would be the party’s face in 2022, Bajwa said that is for the leadership to decide.“I have told Rahul about my assessment and about how genuine the grievances of some leaders are. We held threadbare discussions on every issue and I suggested my solution on how to win the state,” Bajwa said, adding that he was expecting a solution in a week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-gandhi-to-decide-punjab-matter-by-july-10-harish-rawat-272922
24-06-2021||New Delhi||India, US kick off mega wargame in Indian Ocean with eye on China||India and the US on Wednesday kicked off a two-day multi-domain wargame in the Indian Ocean involving an array of air defence platforms to further consolidate their operational synergy in the face of China's increasing military presence in the region.The US has deployed its naval carrier strike group, led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, as well as a fleet of F-18 fighter jets and E-2C Hawkeye all-weather aircraft for the exercise, officials said.The Indian assets at the exercise included Jaguar and Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets, IL-78 air-to-air refuelling tanker aircraft, AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft and warships Kochi and Teg.The Indian Navy has also deployed a fleet of P8I maritime surveillance aircraft and MiG 29K jets, apart from other platforms.The US Carrier Strike Group (CSG) is currently deployed in the Indian Ocean region.A carrier battle group or carrier strike group is a mega naval fleet comprising an aircraft carrier, accompanied by a large number of destroyers, frigates and other ships."The Indian naval warships, along with aircraft from the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force will be engaged in the joint multi-domain operations with the carrier strike group comprising Nimitz-class aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan, Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Halsey and Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Shiloh," Indian Navy's spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said on Tuesday.He said the two-day exercise aims to strengthen the bilateral relationship and cooperation by demonstrating the ability to integrate and coordinate comprehensively in maritime operations.Officials said the high-tempo exercise will include advanced air-defence drills, cross-deck helicopter operations and anti-submarine manoeuvres with an aim to hone the war-fighting skills and enhance interoperability between the two sides.The exercise is being carried out south of Thiruvananthapuram, on the western seaboard.The officials said the exercise is focussing on multiple areas, including enhancing the aspects of interoperability, nuances of international integrated maritime search-and-rescue operations and exchange of best practices in the maritime airpower domain.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June 2016, the US had designated India as a "Major Defence Partner".The two countries have also inked key defence and security pacts over the last few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two sides have also signed the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and the sale of high-end technology from the US to India.In October last year, India and the US sealed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) to further boost the bilateral defence ties.The pact provides for the sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-kick-off-mega-wargame-in-indian-ocean-with-eye-on-china-272921
