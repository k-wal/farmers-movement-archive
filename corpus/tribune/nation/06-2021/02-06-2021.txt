We are in the process of structuring the criteria. We will put it in the public domain as soon as it is completed,” he said requesting students to not panic or worry.“The results will be prepared in mind all considerations. Structuring the criteria for evaluation may take some time, however, it will be the best solution, only in some rare condition will a student ask for a Board exam,” he said.Tripathi said exams have been cancelled keeping in view the safety of students and timely announcement of Class 12 results. The Board, he said, is assessing criteria for evaluation and marking. “Now we have got two months (to prepare the results).

02-06-2021||New Delhi||SC to deliver verdict on Thursday on journalist Vinod Dua’s plea for quashing of FIR||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on Thursday on a plea of senior journalist Vinod Dua seeking quashing of FIR lodged against him for sedition and other offences by a local BJP leader in Himachal Pradesh over his YouTube show.A Bench of Justices UU Lalit and Vineet Saran had on October 6 last year reserved the verdict on the petition after hearing arguments for Dua, the Himachal Pradesh government and the complainant in the case.On July 20 last year, the top court had extended till further orders the protection granted to Dua from any coercive action in the case.The apex court had earlier said that Dua need not answer any other supplementary questions asked by Himachal Pradesh Police in connection with the case.An FIR against Dua under provisions of Indian Penal Code for alleged offences of sedition, public nuisance, printing defamatory materials and public mischief was lodged by BJP leader Shyam at Kumarsain police station in Shimla district on May 6 last year and the journalist was asked to join the probe. Shyam has alleged that Dua, in his YouTube show, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of using “deaths and terror attacks” to get votes. Earlier, in an unprecedented hearing conducted on a Sunday on June 14 last year, the top court had granted protection from arrest to Dua till further orders. However, it had refused to stay the ongoing probe against him.Besides seeking quashing of the FIR, Dua, in the plea, has sought “exemplary damages” for “harassment”.He has also sought direction from the apex court that “henceforth FIRs against persons belonging to the media with at least 10 years standing be not registered unless cleared by a committee to be constituted by every state government, the composition of which should comprise of the chief justice of the high court or a judge designated by him, the leader of the opposition and the home minister of the state.”              Dua has said freedom of the press is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The plea has said the top court has been “emphasizing for distancing the police from the ruling party in the state” but “none of the major political parties which are in power in various states are ready to give up their control over the police”.“There is a recent trend against the media where state governments which do not find a particular telecast to be in sync with their political ideologies register FIRs against persons of the media primarily to harass them and to intimidate them so that they succumb to the line of the state or else face the music at the hands of the police,” the plea has claimed.It claimed there is a concerted approach of authorities “to silence the media which is not palatable to them”.It alleged that the FIR registered against Dua is “politically motivated” and is “purely to settle scores for critically evaluating the functioning of the Central government at the present time of Covid”.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi court sends Olympian Sushil Kumar to judicial custody||A court here Wednesday rejected a Delhi Police plea for three more days of custodial interrogation of Olympic medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar in connection with the alleged murder of a young wrestler at Chhatrasal Stadium here, and sent him to nine-day judicial custody.The international wrestler faces charges of murder, culpable homicide and kidnapping.Dismissing the police remand application, Metropolitan Magistrate Rashmi Gupta said, "As per the settled law, PC [police custody] remand should not be granted in a mechanical manner. It should be granted only when the situation warrants and it is justified." Sushil was arrested on May 23. The court had initially remanded him to six days of police custody, which was later extended by four more days on May 29.He was produced in the court after the expiry of his extended custody.Sushil Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted Sagar Dhankar and two of his friends Sonu Mahal and Amit Kumar at the stadium on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over a property dispute. The 23-year-old Dhankar succumbed to the injuries later.Police has called Sushil the "main culprit and mastermind" of the alleged murder and said there is electronic evidence wherein he and his associates could be seen beating Dhankar with sticks.During the course of proceedings on Wednesday, Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, representing the police, told the court that Sushil is not cooperating and that his custody is required to recover his mobile phone and the weapon of offence.He also said that the DVR of CCTV camera installed at his house and the clothes he wore during the brawl have to be recovered, and that he has to be confronted with other persons arrested in the case.Shrivastava called it a "cold-blooded murder" as he referred to the purported video of the brawl."The first clinching evidence that we could collect is the video. Everything is crystal clear in the video but everyone [eight arrested accused] is saying it is not me," he said.Advocate Pradeep Rana, representing Sushil Kumar, however, told the court that his client's further custodial interrogation is not required as he is merely a victim of circumstances and not a dreaded criminal.He submitted that his client has already been taken to Bhatinda for the purpose of recovery of mobile phone and to Haridwar for the DVR and clothes. "No new ground has been raised for seeking further remand," the counsel added."About 240 hours have already been given to the police for interrogation. Why were they not able to recover his clothes and mobile in 10 days? They are just passing the time," advocate Rana said, requesting the court to not send him to police custody.Co-accused Ajay Kumar Sehrawat, who was arrested along with Sushil from Mundka area, was also sent to judicial custody for nine days. Advocate Sumit Shokeen appeared on his behalf.Advocate Nitin Vashisht appeared for alleged victim and complainant Sonu Mahal. He had requested the court to extend the police custody. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-court-sends-olympian-sushil-kumar-to-judicial-custody-262378
02-06-2021||New Delhi||Officers sitting on untapped vaccine manufacturing potential need to be charged with manslaughter: HC||Officers sitting over untapped potential to make Covid-19 vaccines need to be charged with “manslaughter” as it is leading to so many deaths, the Delhi High Court said on Wednesday, observing that a lot of scope and infrastructure is available in India which is not being used.The court said some urgent hand-holding is required for manufacturing vaccines which is missing because of “fear psychosis” and this potential should not be taken away by foreigners.“The problem is of fear psychosis that some vigilance enquiry will take place, audit will take place, police investigation will take place. Tell them, this is not the time to be wary of these investigations and audit reports. This is leading to deaths today. Actually, some people need to be charged with manslaughter for sitting over this untapped potential,” a Bench of Justices Manmohan and Najmi Waziri said.The court said the Centre should expedite the process of clearing samples of Panacea Biotec which has collaborated with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for manufacturing Sputnik V here.If the vaccine has been approved for administering to the public at large, then the government is only required to see that the samples being produced by this firm are in conformity with the existing standards, it added.“Why you want them to go through a bridge trial, if you have made the bridge trial for the imported vaccine.“The bridge trial should have been conducted even with regard to the imported vaccine. You have done away with it for the imported vaccine. Why insist it for the domestic manufacturer but not for the manufacturer abroad,” the Bench asked.Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh, representing the Centre, said Panacea is far from producing the Covid-19 vaccine as it is pending approval from the authority and added that it cannot say the firm lacks funds for the manufacture of the vaccine as it was already getting finances from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).He said the issues of procuring and manufacturing of the vaccine including Sputnik are pending before the Supreme Court and therefore this court should not pass any order in the present application.He said the firm is one month away from commercial production of the vaccine and efficiency test has to be complied with as there is no waiver under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.The high court was hearing a plea of Delhi-based Panacea Biotec which has sought the release of an arbitral award, passed earlier in its favour and against the Centre, saying it needs funds at the earliest in the larger interest of humanity as it has already manufactured trial batches of Covid vaccine Sputnik V in collaboration with RDIF and the process of manufacturing scale-up batches is on.The Bench said: “There is a lot of scope and infrastructure for manufacture of vaccine in India which is going untapped and this is a factor you (Centre) must consider. See this untapped potential has to be utilised. You can’t leave this potential untapped. Foreigners are coming here, they should not take away this untapped potential. Your officers are not realising this.”  It added, “Himachal has a population of 75 lakh, Rajasthan has eight crore, Punjab has three crore. All these can be done by some manufacturer in north India. Half of the country can be fed by this only. There is a real urgency.”           The Bench said what about those who have lost their lives because of lack of vaccination and asked the Centre to act fast.“There is a tearing hurry, it’s a tearing emergency. You expedite your decision so that there is ‘some rahat ki saans’ (sigh of relief)” the Bench said.The court questioned the Centre saying it was not conducting efficacy test for a drug which is imported in India but was following the rule for the same drug being produced here.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||SC: Constitution doesn’t envisage courts to be silent spectators||The Indian Constitution does not envisage courts to be silent spectators when rights of citizens are infringed upon by executive policies, the Supreme Court has said while dealing with the Centre’s submission that courts should not interfere with its decisions on management of Covid-19.The apex court said in grappling with the second wave of the Covid pandemic, it does not intend to second-guess the wisdom of the executive when it chooses between two competing and efficacious policy measures.Read also: Provide documents, file notings on Covid vaccination policy: SC to CentreThe court said it will however continue to exercise jurisdiction to determine “if the chosen policy conforms to the standards of reasonableness, militates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right to life of all persons”.A special bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said it is trite to state that separation of powers is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution and policy-making continues to be in the sole domain of the executive.“Our Constitution does not envisage courts to be silent spectators when constitutional rights of citizens are infringed by executive policies. Judicial review and soliciting constitutional justification for policies formulated by the executive is an essential function, which the courts are entrusted to perform,” the bench said in its May 31 order uploaded on Wednesday.The top court said it is presently assuming a dialogic jurisdiction where various stakeholders are provided a forum to raise constitutional grievances with respect to the management of the pandemic. “Hence, this Court would, under the auspices of an open court judicial process, conduct deliberations with the executive where justifications for existing policies would be elicited and evaluated to assess whether they survive constitutional scrutiny,” it said.The bench, which passed its order in the suo motu case on Covid management, said it had clarified in its order of April 30, 2021, that in the context of the public health emergency with which the country is currently grappling, this Court appreciates the dynamic nature of the measures. “The judiciary does not possess the authority or competence to assume the role of the executive, which is democratically accountable for its actions and has access to the resources which are instrumental to policy formulation. However, this separation of powers does not result in courts lacking jurisdiction in conducting a judicial review of these policies,” the bench said.It said across the globe, the executive has been given a wider margin in enacting measures which ordinarily may have violated the liberty of individuals, but are now incumbent to curb the pandemic.“Historically, the judiciary has also recognised that constitutional scrutiny is transformed during such public health emergencies, where the executive functions in rapid consultation with scientists and other experts,” the bench said and referred to a 1905 verdict of US Supreme Court on the issue.The bench said that similarly, courts across the globe have responded to Constitutional challenges to executive policies that have directly or indirectly violated rights and liberties of citizens.“Courts have often reiterated the expertise of the executive in managing a public health crisis, but have also warned against arbitrary and irrational policies being excused in the garb of the “wide latitude” to the executive that is necessitated to battle a pandemic,” it said.On May 9, in an affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre had justified its Covid-19 vaccination policy saying that its response and strategy is completely driven by expert medical and scientific opinion which leaves little room for judicial interference and emphasised that citizens of all age groups will get free vaccination throughout the country.In view of the unprecedented and peculiar circumstances under which vaccination drive is devised as an executive policy, the “wisdom of the executive should be trusted”, it had said.In a global pandemic, where the response and strategy of the nation is completely driven by expert medical and scientific opinion, “any overzealous, though well-meaning judicial intervention, may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences”, the government had said.In 218-page affidavit filed in the top court’s suo motu case on Covid-19 management, the Centre had said, this policy “conforms to mandate of Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India and is made after several rounds of consultation and discussion with experts, state government and vaccine manufacturers requiring no interference by this Court as while dealing with a pandemic of this magnitude, the executive does have a room for free play in the joints, in larger public interest”.

The young women were brought to Bhopal through trafficking, police had said.Nath had claimed in an online press conference on May 21 that he possessed a pen drive/CD of the honey trap case, following which a notice was served to him by the SIT to record his statement under the CrPc sections.“Nath had already informed in writing that he will be in Delhi on Wednesday as per his pre-decided programme and therefore won’t be able to record his statement,” Narendra Saluja, the media coordinator of the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, told PTI.A senior SIT official also said as Nath was not available in Bhopal, his statement on possessing the pen drive of the honey trap incident could not be recorded.The official said no fresh date was given to Nath to record his statement.Investigators had arrested five women and their driver from Bhopal and Indore in September 2019 in connection with the ‘honey trap’ case.At that time, the Kamal Nath-led Congress government was in power in Madhya Pradesh.Police had filed a charge sheet in the case in a court in Indore on December 16, 2019.As per the charge sheet, the organised gang used to lure rich and high-placed people using young women trafficked to Bhopal.

We are elected members of Parliament visiting an integral part of our nation on that official capacity to interact with the authorities of the local bodies and other elected representatives of the people there in connection with the recent developments in the island,” Kareem said in a letter seeking permission.On May 30, the ADM had rejected permission for the MPs and asked them to postpone the visit.An archipelago located in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep is witnessing protests by local people for some days over the recent actions and administrative reforms being implemented by Patel.The Assembly had unanimously adopted a resolution seeking Patel’s recall, becoming the first state in the country to express solidarity with the islands, where regulations over beef and liquor, among others, have sparked a row. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-mps-stage-protest-demanding-recall-of-lakshadweep-administrator-262369

At the same time, it has maintained that improving ties with Israel does not mean abandoning Palestine.India had shipped free vaccines as late as March 30 to Ramallah despite an emerging crunch at home.The Palestinian Foreign Minister also asked Jaishankar to prioritise the “root causes of the injustice that befell the Palestinian people, the decade-long dispossession, displacement, colonisation, oppression of the Palestinian people and the denial and violation of their every human rights by Israel, the occupying power”.Otherwise, “the situation will not only remain volatile but will continue deteriorating with far-reaching and grave repercussion”.Other countries that had abstained along with India included Bahamas, Brazil, Denmark, Fiji, France, Italy, Japan, Nepal, Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Togo, and Ukraine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/missed-an-opportunity-palestine-foreign-minister-writes-to-jaishankar-262366

The ICSE also cancelled its class 12 board examinations.“It is time to move on to next year. We cannot deny that another academic session could be Covid affected and we need to plan before it’s too late once again,” Sisodia told PTI in an interview.He stressed on the need to be ready with a “foolproof formula” for next year to avoid scope for any “knee jerk decision”.“Now is the right time. A foolproof plan should be ready about how will assessment be done in March 2022, and according to it, the current session should be planned and students should be prepared. Internals, online and semi online activities should be as per that plan rather than preparing students differently and then saying we will not pass them without taking exams.“I feel if we do not start now, it will be again too late for next year and will then lead to an unprepared and knee jerk decision,” he added.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said his team is working on a draft plan in this regard and he will share the recommendations with the CBSE and the Centre.“A team is working on a plan on how academic session can be conducted for board and non-board classes and how can the assessment be done. Once we are done with the draft plan, I will share the recommendations with CBSE and the Centre,” he added.                 Sisodia, who had earlier told the Ministry of Education that going ahead with exams before vaccinating the students will be a disaster, said there can still be no second thought about it.“Exams or no exams, there cannot be a second thought about need to vaccinating students. The stocks are so low that we are not able to vaccinate people within age group of 18-44. All of this has to be done soon, the trials for vaccines for children and getting Pfizer vaccine for them, all of this has to be done on priority,” he said.The Centre on Tuesday decided to cancel the CBSE class 12 board exams amid the continuing Covid-19 pandemic across the country with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserting that the decision has been taken in the interest of students and the anxiety among students, parents and teachers must be put to an end.Sisodia also reiterated that the CBSE should announce its policy for evaluating students of class 12 at the earliest.“They should come up with an unbiased and objective criteria at the earliest so students can start looking forward to undergraduate admissions,” he said.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Cabinet approves Model Tenancy Act; govt says it will help overhaul legal framework||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Model Tenancy Act under which separate rent authorities, courts and tribunals will be set up in districts to protect the interest of both the owner and tenant.For residential premises, tenants will have to submit security deposit of maximum two months’ rent, while in case of commercial property, six months’ rent will have to be deposited.States and union territories can adopt the Model Tenancy Act by enacting fresh legislation or they can amend their existing rental laws suitably.The Act mandates for written agreement for all new tenancies, which will have to be submitted to concerned district ‘Rent Authority’.Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said that the move will help overhaul the legal framework with respect to rental housing across the country.The government said that the MTA will be applicable prospectively and will not affect existing tenancies. Rent and duration of tenancy will be fixed by mutual consent between owner and tenant through a written agreement.The Act says that no landlord or property manager can withhold any essential supply to the premises occupied by the tenant.According to the ministry, tenant will not be evicted during the continuance of tenancy agreement unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both the parties.Under the Model Tenancy Act, unless otherwise agreed in the tenancy agreement, the landlord will be responsible for activities like structural repairs except those necessitated by damage caused by the tenant, whitewashing of walls and painting of doors and windows, changing and plumbing pipes when necessary and internal and external electrical wiring and related maintenance when necessary.On his part, tenant will be responsible for drain cleaning, witches and socket repairs, kitchen fixtures repairs, replacement of glass panels in windows, doors and maintenance of gardens and open spaces, among others.“Where the landlord proposes to make any improvement in or construct any additional structure on any premises, which has been let out to a tenant and the tenant refuses to allow the landlord to make such improvement or construct such additional structure, the landlord may make an application in this behalf to the Rent Court,” the Act stated.The Act stated that the state government and union territories, in consultation with the jurisdictional high court can appoint district judge or additional district judge as ‘Rent Tribunal’ in each district.In a statement, the government said that it is expected to give a fillip to private participation in rental housing as a business model for addressing the huge housing shortage.“The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Model Tenancy Act for circulation to all states/union territories for adaptation by way of enacting fresh legislation or amending existing rental laws suitably,” the statement stated.The Act will enable institutionalisation of rental housing by gradually shifting it towards the formal market, the government said.“The Model Tenancy Act aims at creating a vibrant, sustainable and inclusive rental housing market in the country. It will enable creation of adequate rental housing stock for all the income groups, thereby addressing the issue of homelessness,” it stated.The Act will facilitate unlocking of vacant houses for rental housing purposes, it said, adding that it is expected to give a fillip to private participation in rental housing as a business model for addressing the huge housing shortage.

He also visited the Jalgaon residence of Eknath Khadse who quit the BJP last year to join Pawar’s party.“The context of these visits was different,” Fadnavis said.“As far as Matoshree is concerned, it has shut its doors for us, we did not stop going there,” he added.The Sena parted ways with the BJP following a dispute over the chief minister’s post after the 2019 Assembly elections.On Public Works Department Minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan praising senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari, Fadnavis said: “I am happy that Ashok Chavan praised our leader. But don’t just praise him, work like him so that you (Chavan) too would be praised”.The COVID-19 vaccination drive will gather pace from the next month, he said.The Union government allowed vaccination for the 18-44 years age group on the states’ demand, he claimed.“The vaccine supply will increase from the next month,” Fadnavis added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/matoshree-has-closed-doors-for-us-we-did-not-sever-ties-fadnavis-262360
02-06-2021||Mumbai||Faulty ventilators will have to be replaced; won’t allow experiments on patients: HC||If any ventilators supplied by the Centre to Maharashtra are found to be defective, then these devices should be replaced, the Bombay High Court said on Wednesday, while asserting that it will not allow experiments to be carried out on Covid-19 patients as majorly repaired ventilators may lead to loss of life.Justices RV Ghuge and BU Debadwar of the Aurangabad Bench of the high court was hearing a bunch of petitions on issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic.The court was last week informed by prosecutor DR Kale, appearing for the state government, that more than 100 ventilators supplied by the Centre to hospitals in the Marathwada region were found to be defective and hence, were not being used.The Centre had refuted the claim and said the hospital staff are not adequately trained to use ventilators.On Wednesday, Kale told the Bench that medical experts in the Government Medical College and Hospital had examined and operated ventilators provided by the Centre.As per the report submitted by Kale, these ventilators broke down frequently despite repairs and there were several other defects in them.Appearing for the Centre, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh said two senior doctors from Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia and Safdarjung hospitals will visit the government hospital in Aurangabad on Thursday to inspect the devices.Singh told the court that if the ventilators are found to be dysfunctional, then the manufacturer would be held liable.He further said there will be no risk of casualty, as these ventilators have not been put to use by the hospitals in the Marathwada region.The Bench, while accepting Singh’s statement, said, “We make it clear that we expect the Union of India to be firm with the manufacturer in the event of supply of defective ventilators.”The court said if required, it would direct for the defective ventilators to be returned.“In such a situation, it would be the responsibility of the Union of India to ensure that the defective ventilators are replaced with new functional ventilators,” the court said.It noted that any defects in the manufacturing of the ventilators call for replacement.“We would not permit experimentation of ventilators, which have undergone major repairs, in treating the patients, since this would be causing a risk/health hazard and unfortunately, the use of such ventilators may cause loss of life, which should be averted,” the court said.The Bench directed for a report to be submitted before it on the visit of the two doctors from Delhi and posted the matter for further hearing on June 7.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Mehul Choksi feared for his life, was terrified: Wife Priti||Even as a court in Dominica is all set to hear the habeas corpus plea filed by the lawyers of fugitive Indian businessman Mehul Choksi later in the day, his wife Priti Choksi in an interview with Business Standard has alleged that the ‘mysterious girl, Barbara Jabarika, had come to Antigua and Barbuda in August 2020 and she had walked in to their other house on the island’.She also claimed that after his capture, Choksi had thought he was going to be killed.The fugitive diamantaire, who has been staying in Antigua and Barbuda since 2018 after taking citizenship in 2017 under the Citizenship by Investment programme, had gone missing on May 23, sparking a massive manhunt in the island nation.He was captured in Dominica on May 27. A Dominican court has restrained the extradition of Choksi until further orders while hearing a habeas corpus plea filed by his lawyers.In the interview, Priti Choksi said, “At 5:11 pm exactly on Sunday he left. He wanted to go for dinner, and he left; that’s the last time I saw him. At about 8.30 or 9ish I began to get worried. He is normally home by 7 pm. But because he said he was going for dinner, I started trying his numbers. His Antiguan number came as voicemail and his WhatsApp numbers were ringing. I was getting very, very nervous. I was lonely, I don’t know many people here (in Antigua).”Read also: Mehul Choksi fit to be deported to India, onus lies on Dominican court: Ex CBI Director AP SinghShe further said that Choksi has a friend who comes as a consultant and works with him.“So I called him up at about 10 or a quarter to 10. I asked, ‘are you with him’? My first thought in my mind was maybe he was walking on the beach and maybe he went to the water and maybe you know something happened, an accident. So this person also went out looking. We have a cook who helps out. I called him up and said, ‘by any chance did sir (Mehul Choksi) call you up’? And he said ‘no’,” Priti said in the interview to Business Standard.Narrating the ordeal, she said that then Choksi’s friend also came across.“I asked, ‘can you just go around to the beaches’? By 10:30, a quarter to 11, he called to say he could find anything. The other person also said the same thing. Then both of them said, ‘let us go to the police station, because this is not normal’. So we went to the police station.“There was curfew (because of Covid) from 11 o’clock, 11 pm to 5 am is curfew, we had only one curfew pass. So we went in one car to the police station. These two people (the consultant and the cook) they wrote the complaint,” she told Business Standard.She also claimed that initially the police were like, ‘you should wait for 24 hours’.“But we said there was no way he wouldn’t be home. They did take it seriously, thank God, and filed a complaint. They had cruisers going on the beaches and roads at that time; because of curfew they were making sure the beaches were not packed or people weren’t partying.“They immediately contacted the cruisers and said can you have a look. We went and we also thought we’ll look around if we can see him or the car on which he went. This is about 12 o’clock midnight. Police said, ‘we are searching, don’t worry, go home, it’s curfew, you can’t be out’. They went on their patrol and we went home,” she recalled in the interview.When asked if she has the copy of the complaint which she filed with the police, she said: “We asked for it, but they said you now have to go through the commissioner and a lawyer to get it. I am very disturbed that he (Mehul Choksi) was taken around 5.30 pm on a boat and no one seems to have seen it. None of the video surveillance cameras at Jolly Harbour (a popular part of Antigua) are working.”To a question about the car which Choksi drove, she said, “Where the car was found at 7.30 the following morning, the police had patrolled the same area at 3 am and it wasn’t there. But it was mysteriously found at 7.30 am.”When asked about Jabarika, who is alleged to have lured Choksi into her house, from where he claims he was kidnapped, Priti said, “No I haven’t seen her, but I knew she had come (to Antigua) in August (2020) and she had walked in to our other house on the island and she befriended the chef there.”“I knew my husband used to walk with her. On the Friday and Saturday before he was taken, they went to Jolly Beach South for a walk. That’s where my husband would normally go, because there are lots of people there normally and all the houses have cameras,” she said in the interview.“She (Jabarika) insisted on Sunday that they go to the north side of the island. He said he didn’t feel like walking, because he was feeling a little tired. He said, ‘I’ll just go for dinner’. Where she was suggesting it was very secluded,” Priti claimed.When asked about the appearance of Jabarika, Priti said, “It’s not the person who is being shown by the TV media. She looks different. You’ve got a sexy femme fatale being shown. That’s not what she looks like. She may have a good body, whatever, whatever, but the thing is it’s not her.”When further pressed if Jabarika has disappeared or whether she is no longer in Antigua, Priti said, “There are rumours surfacing that she may be in Dominica or she may have left.”Sharing the details of Choksi’s movements Priti said he had not left the island in the last three years as his health is not good and he is 63 years old.She also said that Choksi’s passport is at home. When asked about what happened to Choksi when he apparently arrived in Dominica on May 25, she said, “He wasn’t allowed to meet a lawyer, get medical attention, nothing.” Priti said that the first time a doctor saw him was when the foreign minister from Antigua arranged for it.She also said that “Choksi thought he was going to be killed”.“The narrative being woven is that he absconded, and the first story, the Cuba story, pointed people in that direction. It was very ham-handed. My husband is no longer an Indian citizen as per Section 9 of the Indian constitution. In 2017, he ceased to be an Indian citizen. The safest place on earth for him is Antigua,” she added.Choksi is wanted in India by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case. He had shifted to Antigua in January 2018, days before the CBI registered a case.Last Thursday, the first pictures of Choksi emerged online showing several signs of bruises on his arms and a swollen eye.His lawyer in India, Vijay Agarwal, had told IANS, “Choksi was forced to get into a vessel from Antigua and was taken to Dominica. He also claimed that there were marks on Choksi’s body, implying the use of force.”“There is something fishy and I guess it was a strategy to take him to another place so that there are chances of sending him back to India. So I don’t know what forces are operating. The time will tell,” he had said.However, Antigua Police Commissioner Atlee Rodney has rubbished the claims of Choksi’s counsel and said that they have no information on him being forcefully removed.An eight-member team of Indian officials has also landed in Dominica on a private jet for the extradition of Choksi.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||HC verdict dismissing plea to halt Central Vista work during Covid challenged in SC||A plea was filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday challenging the Delhi High Court’s May 31 verdict which dismissed a petition seeking to suspend all construction activity of the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment during the Covid-19 pandemic while describing it as a “vital” and “essential” project of national importance.The project entails construction activities on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan here.The main Central Vista project envisages building a new Parliament House, a new residential complex to house offices and the prime minister and the vice president.It will also have new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate various ministries ‘offices.The high court had dismissed the plea saying it was “motivated” and filed with “ill-intent” and “lack of bona fides”.The high court had also imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners who wanted the work to be halted in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, observing that it was “not a genuine public interest litigation”.Advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav on Wednesday filed the petition in the apex court challenging the high court verdict.Yadav, who was not a party to the proceedings before the high court in the matter, has claimed that high court was “not justified” in holding that the plea was motivated and not a genuine public cause “by drawing presumption and assumption in the absence of proved material facts and evidence”.It alleged that the high court failed to appreciate that allowing a big construction work with large number of labourers and workers to continue during the pandemic period is a “serious public health issue” concern.It said the high court was not justified in holding that the construction activities for the project is “essential activities, especially when the entire activities of service sector, industrial sector and the activities of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are fully suspended during the peak pandemic lockdown period”.In its verdict, the high court had said, “The present petition has been filed to stop with immediate effect the work of the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue. This work is part and parcel of Central Vista project and of vital public importance. The construction of Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project cannot be seen in isolation.”        “In fact, the whole Central Vista project is an essential project of national importance, where the sovereign functions of Parliament are also to be conducted. Public is vitally interested in this project,” it had said.The high court had said that legality of the project was already upheld by the Supreme Court and even the Delhi Disaster Management Authority allowed it to continue.It had also said that from the affidavits filed by the Centre and the contractor—Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd (SPCPL) -- it was “clearly evident” that several facilities, like accommodation, medical facilities and Covid care centre, have been provided to the workers at the site.

Meanwhile, there is also some criticism over the internal assessment aspect with some critics saying that it may lead to “inequality and incompetent students getting admission in good colleges over the meritorious ones”.The CBSE says students will be evaluated on basis of a “well-defined objective criteria”. It has also decided that like last year, in case some students desire to take the exams, the option would be provided as and when the situation becomes conducive. Sources say the details are being worked out and will be shared as soon as possible. One option, of course, is an assessment of the academic performance of the past 3-4 years. Officials say the New Education Policy has indicators regarding internal assessment and the fact that the fate of a child cannot be decided by one exam. “The methodology for Class X is there. Students can be evaluated on basis of internal assessment, results of Class XII pre-board exams, and Class XI results,” they say.There will be checks and balances to ensure that individual schools do not exaggerate their internal assessment, they add.“There is a thought that results of Class IX and X should also be considered. However, Class XI is more aligned with the subjects a student reads in Class XII. They also need to be evaluated fairly,” said an official who did not wish to be identified.Meanwhile, those who are not satisfied with results can always opt for board exams when the situation is conducive. Most professional institutions have admission systems based on entrance exams, it remains to be seen how institutions that admit students on basis of Class XII marks reconcile.The sources said the majority of parents and students were against the examination and given the current “political situation”, the Narendra Modi government “had no other choice. The risk was too high”. Meanwhile, critics say the decision may have a long-lasting impact on the academic cycle. Anurag Gupta, co-founder of a company providing online education to Class-XII students, says the “decision may lead to inequality and incompetent students getting admission in good colleges, leaving behind the meritorious ones”.At the same time, he also added that in such difficult times the decision “will give safeguard health and future” of children.Class XII results-options||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-class-xii-exams-suspense-over-wait-now-for-evaluation-options-262352

The Centre says things like these. Before the Bihar elections, they had promised to inoculate its population after the elections, but nothing happened,” she told reporters at the state secretariat.Banerjee said considering the gap between doses, the process to vaccinate the entire eligible age group should take six months to a year to complete.She said her government has spent Rs 150 crore to procure vaccines, but only 1.4 crore of the state’s over 10- crore population could be inoculated so far.“The Centre is not sending vaccines to states.Whatever little stock that is supplied, gets depleted within days... It must give free vaccines to state governments,” she said.The central government had on Monday said it expects to inoculate the country’s adult population by the end of the year.  —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-claim-of-vaccinating-indias-adult-population-by-2021-end-a-hoax-mamata-262346
02-06-2021||New Delhi||First Covid-19 lockdown improved air quality in India: Study||The first lockdown imposed in India last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic led to an improvement in air quality and a reduction in land surface temperature in major urban areas of the country, according to a study.The findings, published in the journal Environmental Research, provide a strong evidence for potential environmental benefits through larger scale policy implementation.The study found that travel and work restrictions imposed early in the pandemic resulted in a significant environmental improvement, due to an abrupt reduction in industrial activities and a major decrease in the use of land and air transport.The researchers used data from a range of Earth observation sensors, including those from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5p and NASA’s MODIS sensors, to measure changes in surface temperature and atmospheric pollutants and aerosols.They concentrated on six major urban areas: Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, comparing data from the lockdown in March to May last year with pre-pandemic years.The study revealed a significant reduction in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a greenhouse gas emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels, equivalent to an average decrease of 12 per cent throughout India, and 31.5 per cent over the six cities.There was a 40 per cent reduction over the national capital, the researchers said.In India alone, about 16,000 premature deaths occur annually due to exposure to poor air quality, they said.The study also found land surface temperature over major cities in India substantially declined in contrast with the previous five-year average (2015-2019) with day temperatures being up to 1 degree Celsius cooler, and those at night up to 2 degrees Celsius cooler.“The lockdown provided a natural experiment to understand the coupling between urbanisation and local microclimate,” said study co- author Jadu Dash, Professor at the University of Southampton in the UK.“We clearly observed that reduction in atmospheric pollutants resulted in a decrease in local day and night-time temperature. This is an important finding to feed into the planning for sustainable urban development,” Dash said.The study found that along with surface temperature, the atmospheric fluxes at the surface and top of the atmosphere also significantly declined over major parts of India.The reduction of greenhouse gas concentration, higher atmospheric water vapour content and meteorological conditions played a complex role in the land and near-surface temperature reduction.“Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and absorption AOD showed a significant reduction which could be connected with the reduction in the emission sources across India during the lockdown,” said Bikash Parida, from Central University of Jharkhand.AOD tells us how much direct sunlight is prevented from reaching the ground by aerosol particles.“The aerosol type sources, such as organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), mineral dust, and sea salt also reduced significantly.“Moreover, in central India, increases in AOD were attributed to the supply of dust aerosols transported from the western Thar desert region,” Parida said.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Top ayurveda institute incorporates allopathy, tech; treats 600 Covid patients||Amid a controversy over Yoga guru Ramdev’s remarks on allopathy and doctors, the head of the government-run All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) has said the facility has successfully treated at least 600 Covid patients by implementing both the systems of medicine.Prof Tanuja Nesari said a holistic approach and the integration of ayurveda, allopathy and modern diagnostic technology made it possible.Patients with mild to moderate symptoms are provided treatment at a Covid health centre in the Central government-run institute. According to the Delhi government’s ‘Delhi Corona’ application, the facility currently has 47 oxygen beds, all of them vacant.        The All India Institute of Ayurveda was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2017. It has a 200-bed referral hospital for facilitating clinical research, 25 specialty departments and 12 clinics with eight inter-disciplinary research laboratories.“Pure ayurvedic treatment was provided to more than 94 per cent of the patients, but allopathy was used wherever required as per the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research. That’s the reason for our success... We have adopted a holistic and integrated approach,” Prof Nesari, an MD in Ayurvedic Pharmacology, told PTI.Of the 600 patients, around 200 were admitted during the second wave, she said.“The best part is that ayurveda and allopathy coexist here. Be it ayurvedic or allopathic, the treatment is guided by tests conducted in laboratories,” she said.“We do not administer any medication blindly. We closely monitor each and every case. This is a modern facility. We have pathology and radiology laboratories. We conduct CT scans, CRP and D-dimer tests regularly,” said Prof Nesari, who has in the past worked as CEO of the National Medicinal Plant Board.Which patients need what kind of treatment is jointly decided by doctors of ayurveda and allopathy. In moderate cases, both ayurvedic and allopathic medications are used, she said.“First, we give ayurvedic treatment along with oxygen therapy. If the patient’s condition doesn’t improve, we take the help of allopathy, which involves the use of steroids etc, according to the ICMR guidelines,” Prof Nesari said.The institute has 40 ayurveda doctors and five allopathic doctors. The facility has an ICU, too, and doctors from AIIMS and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital provide online consultation, if required.“For example, they tell our doctors what they need to do immediately if the oxygen saturation level drops suddenly. Serious cases are referred to AIIMS and RGSSH,” the director said.The AIIA referred one to 2 per cent of its patients to these tertiary care facilities, she added.The average length of stay at the facility is nine to 10 days. Hospitals have reported that a Covid patient with moderate symptoms remains admitted for 10-14 days, while a severe patient may have to spend up to a month due to dependence on medical oxygen.The director said doctors regularly monitor the oxygen saturation level of patients. Based on test results, pranayama and prone positioning are advised in some cases to increase oxygen saturation levels, she said.Ayurvedic medicines including Suvarnakalpa, Swas Chintamani, Swarna Bhupati are used in case of an emergency, too, and the results have been encouraging, she said.The treatment schedule for patients includes prayers, yoga, meditation, ayurvedic interventions, gargling, light exercise and ayurvedic medicine, approved by the Ministry of Ayush.Ayurvedic interventions and medicines are given based on symptoms.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Lockdown 2020: Over 8,700 people died on railway tracks during year, many of them migrants||Over 8,700 people were mowed down on railway tracks in 2020 even though passenger train services were severely curtailed due to the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, with officials saying many of the victims were migrant workers.                The Railway Board shared the data on such deaths for the period between January and December 2020 in its reply to a question by Madhya Pradesh-based activist Chandra Shekhar Gaur under the Right to Information Act.“Based on the information received from the State Police, 805 people suffered injuries and 8,733 people died on the railway track between January 2020 and December 2020,” the Railway Board has said.Officials separately said that many of those who died were migrant workers who chose to walk home along the tracks because train routes are considered shorter than roads or highways.They said these workers also chose the tracks as this way they could evade police for violating lockdown norms, and also had the belief they would not get lost midway.“They also assumed that no trains would be running because of the lockdown,” one of the officials said.While the fatalities during 2020 were fewer compared to four years immediately before that, the numbers are still significant given the fact that the passenger services were restricted after the coronavirus lockdown was announced on March 25.Only freight trains were in operation during the lockdown and before the railways started Shramik Special trains from May 1 to ferry migrant workers home.The passenger services have been reopening in phases, and by December, around 1,100 special trains were in operation along with 110 regular passenger trains.The services have now been restored to 70 per cent of the pre-Covid period.While many fatalities on tracks last year could not be registered for some reason or the other, the deaths of 16 migrant workers after being run over by a freight train in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad last May rattled many as they were killed while resting on the tracks thinking no train would be coming due to the Covid suspension.According to Railways figures, compiled from state governments, 56,271 people died and 5,938 were injured in such incidents between 2016 and 2019, registering an increasing trend, with 2017 being an exception.As many 14,032 people died in such accidents in 2016, 12,838 in 2017, 14,197 in 2018 and 15,204 in 2019, the figures showed.However, the Railways do not consider these deaths “railway accidents”.Railway’s death statistics are maintained in three forms—consequential accidents, trespassing, and untoward incidents.These deaths come under the category of “untoward incidents” or “trespassing”, and are investigated by state police and the victims are also compensated by state governments concerned.The Railways has carried out massive campaigns to reduce such deaths and also paid ex gratia to the kin of the victim on sympathetic grounds in some cases.The measures taken by the Railways include elimination of unmanned-level crossings over the broad gauge network, signal modernisation, the use of modern machines in maintenance, among others. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-2020-over-8-700-people-died-on-railway-tracks-during-year-many-of-them-migrants-262338
02-06-2021||Kolkata||Alapan Bandyopadhyay chapter is over, says Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata   Banerjee on Wednesday claimed that Alapan Bandyopadhyay is a closed chapter now, but asserted that her administration will stand by the former chief secretary of the state on the row over his not joining the central government.“Alapan Bandyopadhyay chapter is over now. The West Bengal government will give full support to Alapan Bandyopadhyay in whatever is going around with him,” Banerjee told reporters when asked about her government’s stance on the fiasco.Bandopadhyay was set to retire on May 31, but the state had recently sought and received permission for extension of his tenure by three months as he played a crucial role in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.He was, however, handed over a transfer directive by the Centre, shortly after a row broke out over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s post-cyclone review meeting, which the CM and the state chief secretary did not attend.The bureaucrat, instead of reporting to Delhi, chose to retire amid the Centre-state tussle. He was subsequently appointed as the CM’s chief adviser.The Union Home Ministry has served a show-cause notice on Bandyopadhyay under a stringent provision of the Disaster Management Act that entails imprisonment up to two years, amid a tug-of-war between the Centre and the Mamata Banerjee government over him.Bandyopadhyay has already started working as the chief adviser and was present at Wednesday’s meeting of the state Irrigation department presided over by Banerjee.

02-06-2021||Beijing||President Xi asks Chinese media, diplomats to tone down aggressive approach||President Xi Jinping has called for better international communication, urging the bellicose official Chinese media and “wolf warrior” diplomats to adopt a tone that displays openness and conveys modesty, in what observers see as a rare admission of Beijing’s growing isolation exacerbated by COVID-19.Xi, 67, who carries the image of being the most powerful Chinese leader after ‘Chairman’ Mao Zedong with possible life-long tenure in power, in a candid conversation at a group study session of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on Monday said, new concepts, domains and expressions should be created to tell China’s stories in a better way.In a comment seen as an expression of dissatisfaction with the current lot of “wolf warrior” diplomats and bellicose official media outlets, Xi spoke of the need for conveying the message with modesty and humility.Xi said a tone that displayed openness, confidence and conveyed modesty and humility must be maintained, the state-run China Daily said in its report on the speech.China needs a voice that matches its national strength and international status, it said.“It is necessary to give better play to the role of high-level experts and use platforms and channels such as important international conferences and forums and foreign mainstream media to speak out,” Xi said.He also emphasised the efforts to introduce the Chinese culture abroad and strive to shape a reliable, admirable and respectable image of the Communist giant.“It is necessary to make friends, unite and win over the majority, and constantly expand the circle of friends [when it comes to] international public opinion,” Xi was quoted as saying.Asked whether China will take a different approach in its diplomatic efforts in the light of Xi’s remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here on Wednesday that the comments were in line with China’s “peaceful development”.“I want to stress that enhancing and improving our international publicity work and better build our capability in international publicity will help China to create a more favourable external environment for our reform and development,” he said.“This is in line with what we need for China’s peaceful development as well as reform and opening up. It is also conducive to the trend of peace and development. It is both in the interest of China and beyond,” Wang said.Significantly, Zhang Weiwei, who served as an English interpreter for Deng Xiaoping, the moderate Chinese leader who succeeded Mao Zedong, was chosen to make a presentation on the status of China’s communication at the meeting presided over by Xi.Zhang, the director of the China Institute of Fudan University in Shanghai, gave advice for relevant work and the CPC leaders listened to his presentation attentively, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported without disclosing details.Chinese diplomacy and the official media have undergone a makeover ever since Xi came to power in 2012, becoming the leader of the CPC, the military and the Presidency.Since then, China’s diplomacy acquired a more aggressive tone while the official print and television media modernised on a scale and speed not seen before, and sought to forcefully push China’s narrative on contentious issues.The tone of the official media, especially by the CPC-run publications like the tabloid Global Times, has become increasingly belligerent, amid Beijing’s adverse international image following the emergence of the deadly coronavirus in Wuhan in 2019 that later became a horrific pandemic, resulting in over three million deaths globally.China is also aggressively pushing its narratives to counter the international pushback on the disputed South China Sea, allegations of the genocide of Muslim Uygurs in Xinjiang, repression of Tibetans in Tibet and the imposition of Beijing’s national security law over Hong Kong against massive opposition from local people.Xi’s remarks came amid China’s deepening feud with the US and negative perceptions of China at record high levels in many parts of the world, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday.Chinese observers said Xi’s call was a rare admission of Beijing’s isolation that has been exacerbated by aggressive “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy and ineffective propaganda and influence campaigns abroad, the Post report said.His comments also suggest how Beijing will seek to shift the unfavourable narratives in its ideological and geopolitical wrangling with Western democracies, it said.Commenting on Xi’s speech, Beijing-based analyst Wu Qiang said: “China is facing the worst international isolation since the reform and opening-up in the late 1970s, but it seems the leadership has not been able to find any solutions”. “Xi has effectively admitted the failure of China’s external communications and the country’s isolation, which could be attributed to a lack of convincing communications strategies and good China stories,” Wu told the Post.“But I don’t think there will be any change to the assertive diplomatic approach apart from some fine-tuning,” he said.Gu Su, a political scientist at Nanjing University, said poor communication and combative diplomats were holding back China’s efforts to fix its image.“Xi’s remarks appear to be related to Washington’s move to use an international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus to target China, which has gained momentum in recent weeks,” he said.“While it’s good that state leaders realise the problems we face, it would be naive to expect the media can make a big difference to how China is perceived around the world,” he said.Gu said an overhaul of foreign policy was needed, and polishing its communications strategy would not be enough for China to improve relations with other countries.Xi’s remarks “can be seen as a general assessment of global opinion on China, which is far from satisfactory”, Post quoted an expert who declined to be named.In view of Xi’s well-publicised comments in the official media, speculation is rife whether there will be a change of tone and tenor of Chinese diplomacy and the official media in its communication with the world. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-xi-asks-chinese-media-diplomats-to-tone-down-aggressive-approach-262333

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Why start vaccination centres with pomp if 2nd jab of Covaxin not available, HC asks Delhi govt||The Delhi High Court Wednesday said if the Delhi government could not ensure that people get both the doses of Covaxin within the stipulated time, then it should not have started so many vaccination centres with "much pomp and splendour".Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on whether it can provide the second dose of Covaxin to those who got the first jab, before expiry of the incubation period of six weeks between the two doses.The court also issued notice to the Centre on two pleas to make the second dose of both vaccines against Covid -- Covaxin and Covishield -- available in the national capital."Why did you (Delhi government) start it (vaccination) if you were not sure you can provide the second dose also? You should have stopped. Maharashtra stopped when it found it cannot provide second dose."You opened so many vaccination centres everywhere with so much pomp and splendour and now you say you don't know when the second dose stock would be available," the court said while hearing the two petitions.One of the petitions has been moved by a lawyer, Ashish Virmani, who received the first dose of Covaxin on May 3 and since May 29 has been unable to book a slot for receiving the second jab which has to be taken within six weeks of the first.Subsequently, he had to travel to Meerut in Uttar Pradesh to receive the second dose of the vaccine, advocate Pallav Mongia, representing Virmani, told the court.During the hearing, Delhi government additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal told the court that matter of getting stocks was presently between the state and the manufacturer.He said even he is yet to receive his second dose and added that there is scarcity of COVAXIN.Aggarwal said he will seek instructions on by when the stock of Covaxin would be available and whether those who got the first jab can be provided the second dose within the stipulated time of six weeks.The court listed the matter for hearing on June 4.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Class 12 boards: Challenge to decide fair evaluation criteria, must be done soon, say experts||Education experts and stakeholders believe the bigger challenge before the CBSE now is coming up with fair evaluation criteria for class 12 students whose exams have been cancelled and demanded that the policy is notified soon.The experts hailed the decision to cancel the board exams which were earlier postponed given the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Given the current situation, it is the right decision to cancel the CBSE Board exams. There is no way we could have held exams without compromising the safety of children. While we welcome the decision, we hope the modalities would be worked out quickly in consultation with stakeholders, they said."Since class marks are important factor that affects students' career, we expect CBSE to ensure students don't get affected with the methodology of awarding marks," said Praveen Raju, Co-Chair, FICCI ARISE, a collegium of stakeholders aimed at promoting quality education.In a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, it was decided that the CBSE will take steps to compile the results of class 12 students as per well-defined objective criteria in a time-bound manner."The next step is equally critical and crucial in terms of deciding the process and criteria based on which the children's performance will be gauged. This should be done keeping in mind that many of them make that extra effort during the last mile and hence, should be given due advantage," said Charu Wahi, Principal, Nirmal Bhartia School.According to Vishnu Karthik, CEO, The Heritage Schools, the decision on cancellation of board exams has provided some clarity and assuaged stress levels among students and parents but the challenge now is for the CBSE to arrive at alternative criteria to determine grade 12 marks. "Any delay or any confusion on the new grading criteria will lead to more confusion and stress among students. Clear directions should also be provided to Indian universities to modify their admissions criteria so meritocracy and fairness are not compromised,” he said.Shishir Jaipuria, Chairman of Seth Anandram Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions believes deserving students must be allocated grades or marks corresponding to their yearly performance. "It's a challenge that will require a great deal of meticulous thinking for arriving at a just criterion for academic assessment. I'm sure the schools and boards will rise to the challenge and deliver what's best for the students," he said. Rajiv Bansal, Director-Operations - Global Indian International School (GIIS), said admission in undergraduate courses, across India and internationally, are dependent on class 12 results, therefore, the sooner these details are announced, the better it would be for the students, their parents, and the entire academic community. Pallavi Upadhyaya, Principal, DPS-RNE Ghaziabad said schools further await the mode of result tabulation and assessment guidelines by the CBSE for fair scores as Class 12th remains a crucial exam in a student's lifetime.The CBSE had on April 14 announced the cancellation of Class 10 exams and postponement of Class 12 exams in view of the surge in coronavirus cases. Amid continuing demands for cancellation of exams by a large section of students and parents, the ministry had called a high-level meeting last Sunday to deliberate on the issue which was also attended by state education ministers and education secretaries. The CBSE had proposed two options -- conducting regular exams for only major subjects at notified centres or holding shorter-duration exams at the school where a student is enrolled.The majority of states opted for the second option which included conducting 90 minutes exams for major subjects at students' home schools. Few states also insisted on vaccinating students before going ahead with the exams.

02-06-2021||---||Top Sangh leader BL Santhosh praises Adityanath; bid to send a message 'all is well' in UP BJP||Vibha Sharma Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 2Praising Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, top central saffron leader BL Santhosh has said the Uttar Pradesh Government “effectively managed” the deadly second Covid wave in the state and reduced the daily infection count by 93 per cent.The endorsement came after a two-day review meeting in Lucknow amid widespread criticism against CM Adityanath over pandemic “mismanagement” and speculations of a possible reshuffle in his government and the state BJP.Taking to social media, Santhosh said in five weeks, the Yogi Adityanath government reduced the new daily case count in UP by 93 per cent. “Remember, it’s a state with a population of over 20 crore. When CMs could not manage a city of 1.5 crore, Yogiji managed quite effectively,” said the BJP general secretary (organisation).  Later, he also endorsed the decision of the state government to vaccinate parents of children below 12 years. “A wise move considering the logic that if at all third wave comes, it may affect children more. Parents will be around to look after the kids more safely,” Santhosh said.Though state leaders have always said that the review meeting by central leaders, which included Santhosh and BJP’s state in-charge Radha Mohan Singh was related to preparations for the UP elections scheduled next year, speculations were rife about changes in the Adityanath Cabinet and BJP’s state organisation led by Swatantra Dev Singh.Apparently, there are rumblings in the state BJP that Singh “is also not being able to spread the right message”. Rumour mills also claimed that a key point of saffron parleys was also to decide whether to go in for the incumbent CMs as its face in the upcoming election campaigns in various states.On whether Santhosh’s backing means the embattled Chief Minister is in the clear, observers say “it is obvious that ahead of the crucial UP elections, the BJP does not want to give an impression that there is any problem within the party. Unlike other CMs, Adityanath has his own cadre, has a hold on at least 25-30 seats and can influence results in an equal number of constituencies”.  Sources say several state leaders voiced reservations about the current situation of the BJP amid the “simmering anger” among people in the state. The general feeling is that if the BJP goes to the elections in the current circumstances, it may suffer substantial losses. Thousands of people, including BJP leaders and their kin, have lost their lives in the past one and a half months as Covid raged. Those who died of Covid include ministers and MLAs of the Adityanath government.However, leaders close to Adityanath dismissed all speculations, saying that the CM “made it amply clear that he is not open to any radical changes in the government or the organisation”. Adversaries, meanwhile, claim that some changes, especially in the state organisation, could be expected.   Ever since the meeting of top RSS and BJP leaders in Delhi, followed by another of Sangh leaders in Lucknow, the rumour mills are working overtime about “important changes” in UP Government, including a “bigger role” for former Gujarat-cadre IAS officer AK Sharma, a close confidant of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took voluntary retirement to join the saffron party a couple of months back.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-sangh-leader-bl-santhosh-praises-adityanath-bid-to-send-a-message-all-is-well-in-up-bjp-262309
02-06-2021||New Delhi||AI-driven platform to facilitate early Covid intervention over WhatsApp||A Bengaluru-based startup has developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven platform to identify Covid positive patients even from low-resolution chest X-ray images sent over WhatsApp, the Department of Science and Technology said on Wednesday.Xray Setu is quick and easy to use and can facilitate detection in rural areas. The specially designed platform also helps in early intervention through rapid screening of COVID-19 with chest X-ray interpretation for doctors who have access to X-ray machines, it said."ARTPARK (AI & Robotics Technology Park), a not-for-profit foundation established by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, with support from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based HealthTech startup Niramai and the IISc, has developed XraySetu specifically designed to identify Covid positive patients even from low-resolution chest X-Ray images sent over Whatsapp," the DST said.It also has semantic annotations of affected areas for review and localised heatmap by doctors to help them verify it easily with other modalities and has served close to 1,200 plus reports so far from the interior parts of India, it said.To conduct the health check, any doctor simply needs to visit www.xraysetu.com and click on the 'Try the Free XraySetu Beta' button. The platform will then redirect the person to another page, wherein he or she can choose to engage with the WhatsApp-based chatbot via web or smartphone application. The doctor can also simply send a WhatsApp message to the phone number +91 8046163838 to start the XraySetu service. "Then they just need to click the picture of the patient's X-ray and obtain the two-page automated diagnostics with annotated images in a few minutes. While extending the probability of the COVID-19 contraction, the report also highlights a localised heatmap for a quick perusal of the doctor," the DST said. Tested and validated with over 1,25,000 X-ray images from the National Institute of Health, UK, as well as over 1,000 plus Indian COVID-19 patients, XraySetu, has shown excellent performance with sensitivity: 98.86 per cent, and specificity: 74.74 per cent.Besides COVID-19, the platform can also detect 14 additional lung-related ailments, including tuberculosis and pneumonia, alongside others. It can further be used for both analog and digital X-rays and has been successfully piloted by more than 300 doctors in rural areas over the last 10 months, the department said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ai-driven-platform-to-facilitate-early-covid-intervention-over-whatsapp-262308

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Media reports on number of vaccine doses administered in May factually incorrect: Govt||The Union health ministry on Wednesday termed as "factually incorrect and without any basis" media reports alleging that while the Centre has promised 120 million doses of anti-Covid vaccines in June, only around 58 million doses were administered of the 79 million doses available in May.According to the ministry's data at 7 am on June 1, between May 1-31, a total of 61.06 million vaccine doses were administered by the states and Union territories.A total of 16.22 million balance and unutilised doses were available with the states. The total number of vaccine shots available from May 1-31 was 79.45 million, the ministry said in a statement.The Centre has been supporting the efforts of the states for an effective vaccination drive under the "Whole of Government" approach since January 16.In order to streamline the availability of vaccine doses, the Centre has been in constant touch with the vaccine manufacturers and has opened up different procurement options for the states and Union territories since May 1.There have been several unfounded media reports that have peddled misinformation among the masses regarding this exercise of national importance, the ministry said, adding that the total number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has reached 21,85,46,667."There have been media reports alleging the Union Government promising 120 million doses of vaccines during June 2021 while administering only around 58 million doses from the total of 79 million doses available in the month of May. This report is factually incorrect and without any basis," the statement said.Some media reports have criticised India's vaccination policy based on unverified quotes, it said, adding that these reports, questioning the prioritisation of population segments, are not supported by full information on the matter.The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) was formed in August last year to provide guidance on all aspects of vaccine introduction, including prioritisation of beneficiaries, procurement, vaccine selection and its delivery. The prioritisation of beneficiaries for Covid-19 vaccination was based on a review of available scientific evidence, WHO guidelines, global examples and practices followed in other countries, the ministry said.In India, the primary objectives of Covid vaccination are to protect the healthcare workers as part of the pandemic response system, prevent deaths and protect individuals at the highest risk and vulnerability of mortality due to the disease.Accordingly, the vaccination drive has been sequentially expanded to cover the prioritised groups, starting with the healthcare workers (HCWs), followed by the frontline workers (FLWs), then people aged 60 years and above and those aged 45-59 years with 20 identified comorbidities.Subsequently, from April 1, all citizens aged 45 years and above became eligible for vaccination.Such an approach has yielded positive results by achieving more than 81 per cent first-dose coverage among the registered HCWs and around 84 per cent first-dose coverage among the FLWs, thereby protecting these cohorts who are involved in providing healthcare services, surveillance and containment activities amidst the second wave of the pandemic.Also, 37 per cent beneficiaries in the 45 years and above age group have been administered the first dose of the vaccine, whereas 32 per cent of the eligible beneficiaries in this segment have received the second dose, the statement said.From May 1, all citizens aged 18 years and above became eligible for vaccination. A "Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy" was adopted on May 1 which is guiding the ongoing third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive. Under the strategy, every month, 50 per cent of the vaccine doses of any manufacturer cleared by the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) would be procured by the Centre. It would continue to make these doses available to the states and Union territories for free, as it was being done earlier.The remaining 50 per cent doses are available for direct procurement by the states, Union territories and private hospitals, of which the states' share is on a pro-rata basis. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media-reports-on-number-of-vaccine-doses-administered-in-may-factually-incorrect-govt-262297
02-06-2021||Panaji||HC notice to Tejpal on Goa govt's appeal against acquittal in rape case||The Goa bench of the Bombay High Court on Wednesday observed that the sessions court's judgement acquitting journalist Tarun Tejpal in a 2013 rape case was like a "manual for rape victims" as it goes into how a victim should respond in such cases.Justice S C Gupte issued a notice to Tejpal and posted for June 24 the appeal filed by the Goa government against the sessions court's order acquitting him in the case.The HC also directed the registry department to call for all papers and other documents related to the case from the sessions court."The judgement goes into how she (victim) responded.There are some observations on this. It is like a manual for rape victims," Justice Gupte said.The HC said the judgement also does not include the prosecution's case.It (judgement) directly goes into the gist of the case and then the victim's evidence and statements of witnesses, Justice Gupte said."There is a prima facie case to consider the leave (permission) to appeal (against the acquittal). Issue notice to the respondent (Tejpal) returnable on June 24," the high court said.The HC bench made the remarks when Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Goa government, read out portions from the sessions court's 527-page judgement which, while referring to the victim's behaviour (both during the alleged incident and afterwards), said the narrative was of "extreme implausibility"."The judgement says the victim, who is an intelligent woman and physically strong as she is a yoga instructor, could have prevented the sexual assault on her," Mehta said.On May 21, sessions Judge Kshama Joshi acquitted Tejpal, former editor-in-chief of the Tehelka magazine, in the case where he was accused of sexually assaulting his then colleague in a lift of a five-star hotel in Goa in November 2013 when they were attending an event.The trial court had in its judgement questioned the woman's conduct, saying she did not exhibit any kind of "normative behaviour" such as trauma and shock which a victim of sexual assault might plausibly show.Mehta on Wednesday pointed out to HC the observations made by the sessions court on how the victim met with eminent women lawyers like Indira Jaising and Rebecca John."What is wrong if the victim decided to get legal advice from women lawyers before approaching the court or police?" Mehta said.The court then noted that the judgement, while referring to Jaising, says the victim had saved her mobile number in her phone under the name 'Brahmastra'.Mehta said all this was irrelevant and hence, should be redacted."This will have a pan-India effect as everyone will read the judgement. In future, a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in taking legal advice. There is a portion in the judgement that these lawyers are feminists," he said, adding that even he is a feminist.The HC said it would go into all these issues on the next date of hearing."The judgement is already uploaded and is in the public realm. As per our earlier order, all references to the victim's identity have been redacted from the judgement," Justice Gupte said.Mehta further argued that the sessions court's judgement exhibits complete lack of sensitivity towards crimes against women and absolute lack of knowledge on this subject."We don't know if the victim was on trial or the accused. The entire judgement is as if the victim is on trial.Why should there be so much discussion on the victim's sexual history," he said.The sessions court's judge has been a mute spectator when the accused's lawyers brazenly went on to shame the victim, Mehta argued.

02-06-2021||Mumbai||Migratory bird tagged in Mumbai, sighted 4,500-km away in China||A Curlew Sandpiper tagged in Mumbai by Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has been spotted in the Tianjin province of China, around 4,500 kms away, marking a significant achievement in studying bird migration, officials said here on Wednesday.The bird—which breeds in the Tundra of Arctic Siberia is strongly migratory, wintering in Africa and also south and south-east Asia besides Australia and New Zealand - was tagged by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) scientist Mrugank Prabhu and his team.It was first caught and tagged in a wetland near the Palm Beach Road at Nerul in Navi Mumbai on March 18, 2019 with a unique Flag No. 7N5, and later it was captured against on January 13, 2020 at the Bhandup Pumping Station in Mumbai.The same Curlew Sandpiper has now been resighted at Tianjin in China on May 6, 2021 during its northward migration to its breeding sites, said Prabhu."The migratory birds wintering at Thane creek use the adjacent wetlands as their high-tide roosts. They show high fidelity to their traditional feeding and roosting sites as evident from their frequent resightings at these wetlands in the same as well as subsequent  migratory seasons. This signifies the importance of these habitats and the urgent need for their conservation," BNHS Director Bivash Pandav said.The bird tagged by Prabhu and his team was resighted in the Tangu Saltpans in Tianjin, China, near the shoreline. Tianjin province of China is the first record of international resighting of a waterbird tagged on the coasts of Mumbai and adjoining wetlands, he added.Currently, President of the Convention on Migratory Species, since 1927 the BNHS is an old hand at bird banding and ringing which reveal fascinating insights into the migrations of the birds, the political boundaries they cross and the potential hurdles they conquer en route, said Pandav.The birds are tagged either with a band of a light-weight metal ring having a unique alpha-numeric code, colour-flags, colour-bands or neck-collars on certain species in accordance with international protocols.India falls under the Central Asian Flyway (CAF - the paths birds follow in the sky) mainly for the North to South winter migration.The country has recently launched a National Action Plan for the flyway and a network of 29 sites comprising 20 major wetlands and nine wetland-clusters are identified as critical sites for the migratory waterbirds under the CAF-NAP which are being survey by  the BNHS.Annually, around 50-billion birds migrate across the world on their preferred routes with the timing of travel and the ecology of migration shrouded in intrigue and the bird ringing, recapture, resighting method is used to study this process and help scientists  discern the migratory 'flyways' of these avians.In past nearly four years, in Mumbai along around 10,000 birds of 36 species have been ringed or colour-flagged and in the past other studies, various species of gulls, terns, shorebirds, flamingos ringed in Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, eastern Asia and  Indian Ocean islands have been recorded on the Maharashtra coast, said Pandav. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migratory-bird-tagged-in-mumbai-sighted-4-500-km-away-in-china-262283

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Govt broadens rules that bar retired officials from publishing sensitive information||The Centre has amended its rules barring officers who had worked in intelligence and security related organisations from publishing sensitive information by adding new clauses, including the conditions that they can't share any material on “domain of the organisation” and its personnel.The Central Civil Services (Pension) Amendment Rules, 2021, dated May 31 and notified late Tuesday, also states that they need to take prior permission from the “head of the organization” for publishing such material. In the earlier 2007 rules, permission was to be taken from the head of the department. All employees would have to give an undertaking to the head of organisation that they would not publish such information failing which pension can be “withheld or withdrawn”, the amendment  states. According to the Central Civil Services (Pension) Amendment Rules 2007 that was notified in March 2008, all such employees are already barred from publishing any sensitive information, "the disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India”.The amended provision now reads, “No government servant, who, having worked in any intelligence or security-related organization…shall, without prior clearance from the head of the organisation, make any publication after retirement, of any material relating to and including domain of the organisation, including any reference or information about any personnel and his designation, and expertise or knowledge gained by virtue of working in that organization”.There was no mention of domain of the organisation and reference to any personnel in the 2007 rules."Domain may be taken to mean core area or core areas of the working of an organisation," an official explained.The head of the organisation will decide whether the proposed material for publication is sensitive or non-sensitive, and whether it falls in the domain of the organization, according to the amended rules.The 2007 rules had barred the employees from publishing material including “sensitive information, the disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the state, or relation with a foreign state or which would lead to incitement of an offence” after their retirement.The rules apply to employees who retire from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Central Economic Intelligence Bureau, Directorate of Enforcement (ED), Aviation Research Centre, Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, National Security Guards, Central Industrial Security Force and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police among others.The list also includes the Narcotics Control Bureau, Special Frontier Force, Special Protection Group and Financial Intelligence Unit.The CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, which have been amended to make way for 2007 and 2021 rules, however, don't apply to officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) among others.  The CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 apply to those appointed on or before December 31, 2003. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-broadens-rules-that-bar-retired-officials-from-publishing-sensitive-information-262279

But he alleged before the court that he was kidnapped and brought to a third country (Dominica) against his will. Now the court will decide his deportation."He further stressed that deportation is an easier process than extradition."If a criminal or a wanted fugitive is living in a country where they have legal status as a citizen, only an extradition process is left... For deportation, if someone enters a third country illegally and is caught, the country concerned must deport to India. The CBI has many deportation experiences under Interpol's Red Corner notices," the ex-CBI director told ANI.Singh said it was not necessary to enter into a treaty with a country for deportation or extradition of criminals/fugitives, stating that there has been many deportations from a third-party country based on Interpol's Red Corner notices.Interpol had issued the Red Notice against Choksi in December 2018.According to Choksi's lawyers, the jeweller had not fled Antigua but was forcibly abducted and allegedly beaten up and taken to Dominica.According to former CBI director Singh, "If the Dominica court finds that Choksi was kidnapped and forcibly taken to Dominica, he would be deported to Antigua as his country of origin."Choksi, is a key accused in the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab and National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case and is wanted in India on bank fraud charges, criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and money laundering. He acquired Antigua and Barbuda citizenship through the Citizenship by Investment Program in 2017 and had been living in Antigua since 2018. The jeweller is opposing court action to revoke his Antiguan citizenship and have him extradited to IndiaChoksi's lawyers have approached Dominica's Supreme Court in the case pertaining to deporting him to India. The court has put a stay on his movement out of Dominica and is set to hear the matter today, June 2.India has to present a tough case for against Mehul Choksi in the Dominica Court. India to present relevant papers and evidence in court as per the practices of the agencies.Former CBI director Singh, when asked if a team from India has sent to Dominica for a court hearing, he cited reports in local media."I have seen in the media that India has sent a team of officials who will present the case papers and evidence in the court. They will have to present the documents in the court through a lawyer and the local embassy will assist them, as per protocol," Singh said.Meanwhile, Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne had earlier told ANI that Dominica has agreed Choksi's repatriation and Antigua will not accept him back. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mehul-choksi-fit-to-be-deported-to-india-onus-lies-on-dominican-court-ex-cbi-director-ap-singh-262274
02-06-2021||New Delhi||Google claims new IT rules not applicable to its search engine, HC seeks Centre's stand||US-based Google LLC has contended that India's new IT rules for digital media are not applicable to its search engine, and urged the Delhi High Court on Wednesday to set aside its single judge order which applied them to the company while dealing with an issue related to removal of offending content from the internet.The single judge's decision had come while dealing with a matter in which a woman's photographs were uploaded on a pornographic website by some miscreants and despite court orders the content could not be removed in entirety from the World Wide Web and "errant parties merrily continued" to re-post and redirect it to other sites.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Centre, Delhi government, Internet Service Providers Association of India, Facebook, the pornographic site and the woman, on whose plea the single judge's ruling had come, and sought their responses to Google's plea by July 25.The court said it was not going to issue any interim order at this stage after Google told the bench that it was an intermediary, but not a social media intermediary, and sought protection against any coercive action for non-compliance of the template or guidelines laid down by the single judge.The global technology giant had also sought removal of the observation by the single judge that it was a social media intermediary.Google contended that the single judge, in his April 20 judgement, "mischaracterised" its search engine as a 'social media intermediary' or 'significant social media intermediary' as provided under the new rules."The single judge has misinterpreted and misapplied the New Rules 2021 to the appellant's search engine. Additionally, the single judge has conflated various sections of the IT Act and separate rules prescribed thereunder, and has passed template orders combining all such offences and provisions, which is bad in law," it has said in its appeal against the April 20 judgement.According to the template framed by the single judge, when such matters related to offending content come before a court and it is satisfied that an immediate redressal was required at the interim stage, it may issue a direction to the website where the objectional material is hosted to remove the same forthwith and maximum within 24 hours of receiving the judicial order."A direction should also be issued to the website or online platform on which the offending content is hosted to preserve all information and associated records relating to the offending content, so that evidence in relation to the offending content is not vitiated, at least for a period of 180 days or such longer period as the court may direct, for use in investigation," the court had said.It had also said a direction should be issued to the search engine(s) to disabled access to the offending content by 'de-indexing' and 'dereferencing'' it in their listed search results and the intermediary ought to comply with such a direction within 24 hours of receiving the same."The directions issued must also mandate the concerned intermediaries, whether websites/online platforms/search engine(s), to endeavour to employ pro-active monitoring by using automated tools, to identify and remove or disable access to any content which is exactly identical to the offending content that is subject matter of the court order," it had said.The single judge order had also said for a direction to remove or disable access to an offending content to be effective even within India, a search engine must block the search results throughout the world since no purpose would be served by issuing such an order if it has no realistic prospect of preventing irreparable harm to a litigant.It also directed the police to ensure the offending content was removed and directions were also issued to search engines, like Google, Yahoo and Bing, "to globally de-index and de-reference" the offending content from their search results.It asked search engines to endeavour to use automated tools, to proactively identify and globally disable access to any content which is exactly identical to the offending content, that may appear on any other websites/online platforms.It further stated that if an intermediary fails to fulfil the conditionalities and obligations cast upon it, it was liable to forfeit the exemption from liability available to it under the Information Technology (IT) Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/google-claims-new-it-rules-not-applicable-to-its-search-engine-hc-seeks-centres-stand-262272

02-06-2021||United Nations||Only 1 strain of Covid variant first detected in India is now of concern: WHO||The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said only B.1.617.2, one of the three strains of the B.1.617 Covid-19 variant first detected in India, is a “variant of concern” now and noted that lower rates of transmission have been observed for the other two lineages.The B.1.617 variant was first detected in India and was divided in three lineages - B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3.In the Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update published on Tuesday, WHO said available findings for lineages B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 were initially used to designate B.1.617 a global Variant of Concern (VOC) on May 11 this year.“Since then, it has become evident that greater public health risks are currently associated with B.1.617.2, while lower rates of transmission of other lineages have been observed,” WHO said.The UN health agency said that in order to reflect this updated information, B.1.617 has been “delineated”."B.1.617.2 remains a VOC and labelled variant Delta – we continue to observe significantly increased transmissibility and a growing number of countries reporting outbreaks associated with this variant. Further studies into the impact of this variant remain a high priority for WHO.”  The Delta variant has now been reported in 62 countries around the world as of June 1, the update said. It added that the B.1.617.1 strain has been reclassified to a Variant of Interest (VOI) and labelled variant “Kappa”. While Kappa is also demonstrating increased transmissibility (in specified locations), “global prevalence appears to be declining. This variant will continue to be monitored and reassessed regularly.”  The B.1.617.3 lineage is "no longer classified as either a VOI or VOC – relatively few reports of this variant have been submitted to date.”On Monday, the WHO announced the new naming system for key Covid variants and the labels are based on the Greek alphabet (i.e. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc), “making them simple, easy to say and remember.”  “The labels do not replace existing scientific names, which convey important scientific information & will continue to be used in research. The naming system aims to prevent calling #COVID19 variants by the places where they are detected, which is stigmatising & discriminatory,” WHO said in a tweet.WHO said that as the global public health risks posed by specific Covid variants becomes better understood and evolves, it will continue to update the list of global VOIs and VOCs.“This is necessary to adjust to the emergence of new variants, their changing epidemiology (e.g., the incidence of some variants is rapidly declining), and our understanding of their phenotypic impacts as new evidence becomes available and is shared.”   Variants no longer classified as VOCs or VOIs will continue to be monitored as part of the overall evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and may be reassessed pending new evidence indicating an increased public health risk, WHO said.The update further said that India reported the highest numbers of new COVID-19 cases in the past week at 1,364,668, a 26 per cent decrease compared to the previous week. Other countries reporting the highest numbers of new cases are Brazil (420,981 new cases; 7 per cent decrease), Argentina (219,910 new cases; 3 per cent increase), the United States of America (153,587 new cases; 18 per cent decrease), and Colombia (150,517 new cases; 40 per cent increase).The South-East Asia Region reported over 1.5 million new cases and over 29,000 new deaths, a 24 per cent and an 8 per cent decrease respectively compared to the previous week."Case incidence continued to follow a sharp decline for a third consecutive week, and death incidence decreased for the first time since early March 2021, primarily driven by trends reported in India,” the update said.In the South-East Asia Region, the highest numbers of new deaths were reported from India (26,706 new deaths; 1.9 new deaths per 100,000; an 8 per cent decrease), Indonesia (1057 new deaths; 0.4 new deaths per 100,000; a 15 per cent decrease), and Nepal (1010 new deaths; 3.5 new deaths per 100,000; a 22 per cent decrease).Globally, the number of new Covid cases and deaths continues to decrease, with over 3.5 million new cases and 78,000 new deaths reported globally in the past week; a 15 per cent and 7 per cent decrease respectively, compared to the previous week, the update said.The European and South-East Asia Regions reported the largest decline in new cases and deaths in the past week, while case incidence increased in the African and Western Pacific regions. “Although the number of global cases and deaths continued to decrease for a fifth and fourth consecutive week respectively, case and death incidences remain at high levels and significant increases have been reported in many countries in all regions,” the WHO update said.

02-06-2021||Our Correspondent||‘India home to 12% of world’s smokers’||Hoshiarpur, June 1“According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), India is home to 12 per cent of the world’s smokers. There are approximately 120 million smokers in India and more than 10 million people die each year due to tobacco in India,” said Dr Suresh Goyal, senior consultant of pulmonary medicine at Ivy Hospital, in an online awareness session.Dr Suresh Goyal, Senior Consultant of Pulmonary Medicine at Ivy hospitalMore than 10 million people die each year due to tobacco in India. It causes various types of cancer such as mouth, lungs, food pipe, kidney and pancreas etc. It leads to heart diseases, stroke, lung diseases (asthma and COPD) and various eye problems.He said smoking affects almost all organs of the body. “It causes various types of cancer, like mouth, lungs, food pipe, kidney and pancreas etc. It leads to heart diseases, stroke, lung diseases (asthma and COPD) and various eye problems. There is an increased risk of gum disease, stained teeth and tooth loss. It also lowers the immune system and leads to increased incidence of pneumonia. Smoking increases risk of type 2 diabetes, decreases sense of smell and taste, causes bad breath and premature aging of the skin,” he said.Dr Goyal further said tobacco by-products harm one’s appearance. Quitting smoking improves blood flow to your skin, increasing the amount of oxygen and nutrients that reaches the area.“This directly gives you a healthier complexion and improves your appearance. Smoking increases anxiety and tension. Quitting can lower your blood pressure, heart rate, there will be less shortness of breath and can be a low risk of cancer.”Moreover, smoking and Covid both target and damage your heart and lungs. Not only does smoking erode the lining of your lungs and leave it more vulnerable to infection, but it also hampers your body’s immune response during infection, said Dr Goyal.Every puff of cigarette smoke delivers more than 7,000 chemicals to your lungs. Now imagine what adding Covid to the mix does, he said.There is a strong association between smoking and increased severity of Covid symptoms in infected individuals. Smoking or using e-cigarettes around children compromises their health and safety. Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, he asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-home-to-12-of-worlds-smokers-262227

The NDA government had in 2019 amended the Protection of Human Rights Act, which earlier mandated that the NHRC chief should be a former CJI.The law was changed to allow appointment of a former SC judge as the commission chief. Former SC Judge Arun Mishra had recently made news for praising the PM as an “internationally acclaimed visionary who could think globally and act locally” and a “versatile genius”.He was selected from a list of 12.

The finding of the trial court on how a woman, who has been a victim of sexual assault, normally behaves is "unsustainable in law and is coloured by prejudice and patriarchy", it said.It also claimed the trial court completely ignored the most telling piece of evidence in the case (the apology e-mail) "which established the guilt of the accused beyond a shadow of doubt".On May 21, Sessions Judge Kshama Joshi acquitted Tejpal in the case where he was accused of sexually assaulting his then woman colleague in a lift of a five-star hotel in Goa in November 2013 when they were attending an event.The trial court in its judgement questioned the woman's conduct, noting she did not exhibit any kind of "normative behaviour" such as trauma and shock which a victim of sexual assault might plausibly show."Much of the impugned judgement has been consumed by sexual gossip and alleged sexual fantasies related to the prosecutrix which are legally prohibited," the appeal said.

Thereafter, the Chief Secretary arrived along with the CM and left immediately,” stated the notice sent on May 31. The notice asked Bandyopadhyay, a 1987-batch IAS officer, to explain within three days why action should not be taken against him. According to the notice, issued under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Bandyopadhyay had acted in a manner tantamount to refusing to comply with lawful directions of the Central Government and violating Section 51 (b) of the 2005 Act.Mamata Banerjee earlier said they failed to arrive at Kalaikunda in advance due to security restrictions imposed by ATC (air traffic control) in view of the PM’s arrival. After reaching Kaklaikunda, she was not allowed to meet the PM immediately by the SPG, she said.Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, citing a message sent to him by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on May 27 evening and a phone conversation he had with her then, said Banerjee had already made up her mind to boycott the PM’s meeting the following day as Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari was also asked to participate in it.Bandyopadhyay was served the MHA notice on the day of his superannuation upon reaching 60 years of age. He was granted three-month extension by Centre following a request by the CM. However, following the fracas on May 28, the Centre wrote to the West Bengal government to release the Chief Secretary and place his service with it. This prompted Bandyopadhyay to shun the extension and opt for retirement on Monday. He was immediately appointed Chief Adviser to the Chief Minister for three years.Notice under Disaster MGMT ActUpon arrival in the meeting room, the PM and other members of his entourage waited for around 15 minutes for the officers of the state government to arrive. — MHA notice||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-serves-show-cause-notice-on-former-west-bengal-cs-261850

The government also ruled out mixing of vaccine doses for India and said mixing was an unresolved scientific question and was “not an Indian protocol”.“Opening up must revolve on three pillars--the area being opened should have less than 5 per cent case positivity rate in a week; 70 per cent of vulnerable population (elderly, 60 plus and 45 plus with comorbidities) must have been vaccinated and communities must own Covid-appropriate behavior,” Bhargava said, adding that by July India would have enough doses to inoculate one crore people.Member (Health), NITI Aayog, VK Paul ruled out mixing of available vaccine doses. “Mixing of vaccines is not a protocol in India,” he said.Paul said early research had shown severe reactions upon getting a mixed second dose of the vaccine, though some studies had also shown possible benefits in terms of enhanced immunity. “Research on this is ongoing in other nations.

It has two-pronged goals — targeting warships, besides launching land attack from sea; and honing air-defence skills to target enemy aircraft, missiles or UAVs.The exercise comes in the backdrop of a recent move of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which has, for the first time, integrated its units with air-defence assets with PLA-Air Force (PLAAF) along the LAC.The exercise, which reportedly started on May 22, is scheduled to end in the middle of this week.China and Pakistan often exercise together. This year, the drill comes in the backdrop of around 1-year military standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh. The number of Pakistan troops taking part in the exercise is not known. From the Chinese side, troops of the 3 Air Defence Division are participating in it.In the run-up to the exercise, the PLA conducted a pre-exercise training for the Pakistan army at Sargodha, Punjab, Pakistan.Pakistan already uses some of the missiles being used in this exercise. For India, this means that similar arsenal could be on board PLA navy and Pakistan navy warships. Moreover, Indian pilots, drones and missiles could face similar threats and counters on both borders.Indian security establishment is aware that the Chinese low-to-medium altitude air-defence system, also known as LY-80, is being used. This is a medium-range surface-to-air defence missile system with around 150-km range. It can intercept and destroy aerial targets flying at low and medium altitude. The second set of missiles being used in the exercise are SM-6, Eagle anti-ship cruise missiles (better known in military circles by their numbers — YJ-81, YJ-82 & C-802). C-802 is the export version of YJ-802 land attack and anti-ship cruise missile with a range of 120-150 km. The C-802 anti-ship missile can also be launched from a fighter jet. Tibet has several lakes and water bodies where dummy ships are placed for target practice.Meanwhile, the PLA has changed its defence tactics along the Line of Actual Control. The PLA air-defence units in its western theatre (Tibet & Xinjiang) form a combined air-defence control system. At least 10 PLA units in the western theatre have been integrated for sharing inputs on early warning and combat readiness.Exercise under way in Tibet since May 22Chinese Air-defence system deployedIntegrating army, air force elements||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-chinas-air-defence-at-play-joint-drill-with-pak-261828

Last week, the Centre had announced that PM Cares will contribute through a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each child when he or she reaches 18 years of age. The top court, which had earlier taken suo motu cognisance of spread of Covid-19 in children homes, was hearing an application filed by amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal seeking identification of orphaned children due to Covid-19 or otherwise and providing them immediate relief. A Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao directed states and Union Territories to appoint nodal officers of level of Secretary or Joint Secretary who will interact with its amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal for providing all information on orphans, their identification and about the welfare measures for them. It posted the mater for hearing on Monday when it would take up matters related to Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) told the court that data of 9,346 affected children have been uploaded on Bal Swaraj portal. This includes 1,742 children who lost both parents, 7,464 now in a single-parent household, 140 abandoned between March 2020 and May 29, 2021. In an affidavit filed in the top court, the NCPCR said out of these children, 1,224 were now living with a guardian, 985 with a family member not designated as a legal guardian, while 6,612 were living with a single parent. Besides, 31 children have been sent to the special adoption agency, it submitted. A six-step scheme has been devised to monitor the well-being of children orphaned due to Covid-19 or those who lost one parent, the NCPCR informed the court. The maximum number of orphaned and abandoned children was seen in Madhya Pradesh, where 318 children were orphaned and 104 were abandoned, while UP recorded the highest number of children who lost one parent — 1,830 children are now living in single-parent households after the death of a parent due to Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-details-of-centres-scheme-for-covid-orphans-261826

Vimla, pro vice-chancellor of the university, said: "The Board of Studies on philosophy has decided that the works of Yogi Adityanath and Ramdev would be included in the syllabus. The two books have been recommended by the state government and endorsed by the Board of Studies of the university". The recommendation from the state government was made to the University Grants Commission (UGC)."Study and practice of this course will provide a stressless and effortless life, expansion of consciousness, regulation of the nervous system, etc," said the syllabus structure for the philosophy course recommended by the state government to the university.Under the New Education Policy, the UGC has come up with a new curriculum that allows universities to decide what makes up 30 per cent of the syllabus for each course. This 30 per cent is designed to keep regional relevance in mind.The two books have been chosen from a list of seven suggested readings, the others being 'Gheranda Samhita', 'Patanjali Yoga Sutra', a book by Swami Satyanand Saraswati and two by Paramhansa Yogananda.Prof Vimla said, "The concept of the New Education Policy is that students must first be apprised of their ancient cultural heritage and taught about the architects of this heritage. For instance, when it comes to botany, we need to teach students about the ancient sages who developed Ayurveda and the contributors to its evolutionary process". --- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/adityanath-ramdev-now-in-varsity-curriculum-261799

This wastes the time of the court and suggests that we have a lot of time. Serious matters must be given time,” a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said while hearing a consumer dispute.As on May 1 this year, 67,898 cases were pending in the Supreme Court. Out of 67,898 pending matters, 12,945 matters are such which can’t be listed for ‘hearing’ as they are either ‘Incomplete Miscellaneous Matters’ or ‘Not Ready Regular Hearing’ matters.The Bench got irked to see an application in a matter that had already been disposed of.“We cannot pass another order in an already disposed of matter. We shouldn’t be hearing you. Actually, this is how the Supreme Court is becoming dysfunctional. Judges have to spend their important time going through these files before the start of the day,” commented Justice Chandrachud.“These matters waste important time of the court, which could have been spent on serious matters, pan-India matters,” the Bench said, dismissing the application.“Today, when we were going through listed cases, we found that 95 per cent of the cases are frivolous. Yesterday, I had to finalise the order in the suo motu matter on Covid management, which is a matter of national importance but could not upload it because I had to go through the files listed for today,” Justice Chandrachud said, adding, “Judges should be able to spend time on matters of national importance, which are serious matters.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/frivolous-cases-making-sc-dysfunctional-justice-dy-chandrachud-261794

All anti-Punjab forces have to be defeated."Power of the People must return to the People !! Every Punjabi must be made shareholder in Punjab's Progress ... Jittega Punjab, Jittegi Punjabiyat, Jittega har Punjabi !! Live from Delhi pic.twitter.com/x7MnYdpojh  Also read: Panel keen on ‘adjusting’ Navjot Sidhu: Punjab ministersThe ex-minister who quit the state Cabinet in July 2019 after being divested of the local bodies portfolio for power has been in political wilderness ever since.Of late, Sidhu has been publicly attacking the CM for absentee justice in the Bargari case that involved the desecration of Guru Granth Saheb.The CM has, however, maintained that the SIT on the issue is continuing with its probe and the courts are seized of the matter."Upon being summoned by the Congress high command, I came here to appraise the AICC committee about Punjab. I have alerted the committee to the truth of Punjab and eloquently echoed the voice of the people of the state, of the grassroots, eloquently. The most important issue is that my previous stand on Punjab and issues concerning Punjab remains unchanged," Sidhu said after meeting the committee, which has been tasked with respectably rehabilitating him considering his star appeal and vote catching abilities.Sidhu said his top agenda is that the power of the people of Punjab -- the taxes they pay -- should return to the people in whatever form possible."Today I have shone light on the truth. Truth can be eclipsed but it cannot be defeated.Punjab will win. We have to ensure the victory of Punjab. Every citizen of Punjab has to be made a participant in governance. We have defeat all anti Punjab forces," said the MLA from East Amritsar adding: "Punjab, Punjabiyat and each Punjabi will win."The AICC panel is also meeting MLAs in batches of 25 daily and is expected to meet the chief minister later before submitting a report to the high command.Sources say a clear statement from the CM about justice in the sacrilege matter could be a way out of the current stalemate and for Sidhu to return to active state politics after the panel's deliberative process.That explains PCC chief Sunil Jakhar's statements of Monday that those behind the sacrilege would be brought to book and punished.If the sacrilege issue is resolved, a consensus could be evolved with Sidhu returning to the state cabinet in a role acceptable to him and the CM.The CM, sources say, is keen on unity in the election year, and may take one step forward to accommodate Sidhu.It, however, remains to be seen whether Sidhu will also take a step forward if CM cedes some space for him.The Congress leadership does not want a situation of Sidhu's alienation after the party's rout in recent state polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-congress-crisis-my-stand-is-unchanged-says-navjot-sidhu-after-meeting-aicc-panel-261710
02-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi allows home delivery of liquor; take-away of draught beer from micro-breweries also permitted||Delhiites can soon order home delivery of liquor through a mobile application or a website, with the city government permitting such facility by issuing a notification, which also allows take-away of draught beer in bottles or growlers from the micro-breweries in the national capital.The rules, notified on Monday, permit the holders of the necessary licences to serve liquor in open spaces such as terraces, the courtyards of clubs, bars and restaurants, where customers will have the choice of getting alcohol in bottles.However, it will be the sole responsibility of such establishments to ensure that no customer takes the served bottles out of the licensed premises.The move will boost the government's revenue at a time when Delhi's economy is struggling in view of the Covid-induced lockdown that has been in place since April 19.According to the notification, the licensee will deliver liquor at the buyers' residences only if the orders are received through an app or a web portal.The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) has welcomed the government's move to allow home delivery of liquor in the National Capital."This has been our consistent demand for a long. Last month also, we had requested the government to allow home-delivery of liquor in Delhi. There are many states that have implemented this and there has been no adverse effect coming out of it," CIABC director-general Vinod Giri told PTI.The notification issued by the Delhi finance department in the name of the Lieutenant Governor states that in hotels, no liquor will be served by the licensee at any place other than the room in which the person ordering it resides for the time being.The government also permitted the sale of medicated wine in the city, which is usually prepared by using wine as a solvent to soak out the effective components of herbs."The licensee shall not sell any article covered by his licence except for a medicinal purpose. The licensee shall not sell to any person at any one time any article covered by his licence in greater quantity than nine litres or 12-quart bottles, provided that sale in larger quantities may be made to persons holding a chemist's licence and to government and charitable dispensaries," the notification stated.The government also introduced a licence in the form of L-37 for hotel management institutes to keep liquor for the purpose of training."The licence shall be issued to hotel management institutes or other teaching institutes recognised by the government. The liquor shall be used for teaching purpose only. The liquor shall be purchased from licensed retail vends only. The limit of liquor shall be decided by the excise commissioner," it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-allows-home-delivery-of-liquor-take-away-of-draught-beer-from-micro-breweries-also-permitted-261694
