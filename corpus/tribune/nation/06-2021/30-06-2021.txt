30-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA coordination committee meets a day after Sharad Pawar calls on Uddhav||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday chaired a meeting of the coordination committee of the constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) at his official residence here against the backdrop of various issues including the likely election to the post of the Assembly Speaker during the upcoming monsoon session of the state legislature, sources said.A day earlier, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had met Thackeray, who heads Shiv Sena, amid speculation in state political circles over differences in MVA allies- Sena, NCP and Congress. Sharad Pawar had on Sunday said the MVA government was running smoothly and it would complete its full five-year term. The meeting was held on Wednesday evening against the backdrop of the Enforcement Directorate summoning former state home minister Anil Deshmukh of NCP in connection with a money laundering case and the state BJP writing to Union Home Minister Amit Shah for a CBI investigation against Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab into the allegations leveled against them by dismissed Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze. The meeting was attended by Subhash Desai and Eknath Shinde (Shiv Sena), Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil (NCP) and Ashok Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat (Congress)  who are members of the committee. According to sources, the alliance leaders also discussed the possibility of holding the election to Speaker's post during the two-day session beginning July 5. Simultaneously, demands are being raised from various quarters, including the BJP, to put off the elections to five Zilla Parishads scheduled to be held on July 19 against the backdrop of quashing of OBC quota in local bodies by the Supreme Court. Recently, Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had written to CM Thackeray to take a call on extending the duration of the upcoming monsoon session and filling the post of the assembly Speaker urgently citing the demands raised by a BJP delegation. In his letter dated June 24, the governor also asked the chief minister to take action on another demand made by the BJP to not hold elections to local bodies given that the OBC quota issue is pending. Maharashtra Assembly Speaker's post has been lying vacant since February this year after Nana Patole resigned to take charge as the state unit Congress president. According to sources, Congress leader Sangram Thopte, who hails from Pune district, is a front-runner to become the next Speaker.  In a letter to Amit Shah seeking a CBI probe against Ajit Pawar and Parab, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil referred to a hand written note submitted by Vaze to the NIA court in April in which the former assistant sub-inspector had claimed Pawar and Parab allegedly asked him to collect money from illegal gutkha sellers, manufacturers and contractors in the Mumbai civic body. In the past, both Pawar and Parab had refuted the allegations made by Vaze, who is currently in jail in the Antilia security scare-Mansukh Hiran murder case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-mva-coordination-committee-meets-a-day-after-sharad-pawar-calls-on-uddhav-276352

Therefore, media trials cannot be a guiding factor in deciding cases," the CJI said, adding it is also imperative to start a discourse as to how social media trends can affect the institutions."While there is a lot of discussion about the pressure from the executive, it is also imperative to start a discourse as to how social media trends can affect the institutions," he said. The CJI's remarks, made while virtually delivering the 17th Justice PD Desai memorial lecture on 'Rule of Law', come amid a raging controversy over the role of social media platforms.“Judges have to be mindful of the fact that the noise thus amplified is not necessarily reflective of what is right and what the majority believes in,” Justice Ramana said.He, however, said, judges need to completely disassociate themselves from what was going on as they cannot stay in “ivory castles” and decide questions that pertain to social issues.“The ultimate responsibility of a judge is, after all, to uphold the Constitution and the laws with values of reason, reasonableness and protection of human dignity,” the CJI said.It was extremely vital to function independently and withstand all external aids and pressures for the judiciary, he added."For the judiciary to apply checks on governmental power and action, it has to have complete freedom. The judiciary cannot be controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Legislature or the Executive, or else the Rule of Law would become illusory," the CJI said, adding judges should not be swayed by the emotional pitch of public opinion, getting amplified through social media platforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-says-judiciary-cannot-be-controlled-or-else-rule-of-law-will-become-illusory-cautions-against-social-media-influence-276350
30-06-2021||New Delhi||Study links Black Carbon with premature deaths||Black Carbon has a significant adverse effect on human health and can lead to a premature death, according to a new study, which could help improve the estimation of the future air pollution mortality burden.The Indo-Gangetic plain is exposed to Black Carbon (BC) with serious implications on regional climate and human health, but the health effects in terms of mortality due to BC aerosol exposure have never been evaluated in India, the study says.Most pollution-based epidemiological studies essentially relate exposure to the concentration of particulate matters (PM-10 and/or PM-2.5) that invariably generalise all particulates with equal toxicity without distinguishing among them by source and composition, which genuinely have different health consequences.Scientist R K Mall led the team of other scientists including Nidhi Singh, Alaa Mhawish, Tirthankar Banerjee, Santu Ghosh, R S Singh from the Department of Science & Technology-Mahamana Centre of Excellence in Climate Change Research (MCECCR) at Banaras Hindu University which conducted the story.The team explored the individual as well as the cumulative impact of BC aerosol, fine (PM 2.5), and coarse (PM 10) particulates, and trace gases SO2 (sulphur dioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), O3 (trioxygen) on premature mortality in Varanasi.Their research was recently published in a reputed journal ‘Atmospheric Environment’.“The study could also help estimate the future burden of mortality associated with air pollutants considering the present association and incorporating a growing population rate. This will help government and policy-makers for better planning to mitigate the adversity associated with changing climate-air pollution-health nexus,” the Department of Science and Technology said in a statement.A typical urban pollution hotspot in central the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) experiences a very high aerosol loading and trace gas concentrations throughout the year due to prevalence of a subsidence zone.Also, such centres have observed decadal increasing trends both in Aerosol Optical Depth and Black Carbon aerosols.The scientists from the MCECCR supported by the Climate Change programme of Department of Science and Technology (DST) utilised daily all-cause mortality and ambient air quality from 2009 to 2016 to clearly establish a significant impact of BC aerosols, NO2 and, PM2.5 exposure on mortality, a DST statement said.The inclusion of co-pollutants (NO2 and PM 2.5) in the multi-pollutant model increased the individual mortality risks for BC aerosols, it said.It added the effect of pollutants was more prominent for males in the age group of 5-44, and in winters. The scientists found that the adverse effect of air pollutants was not limited to the day of exposure but can extend as high as up to 5 days (lag effect).They further showed that mortality rises linearly with an increase in air pollutants level and shows adverse impact at higher levels.The inclusion of BC as a potential health hazard inspires and provides a background for more epidemiological studies to provide evidence of health effects of air pollutants from different parts of India, the DST added.

30-06-2021||Kolkata||Centre depriving Bengal of ample COVID vaccine supply: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of depriving her state of an adequate number of Covid vaccines while providing ample supplies to even smaller states.She said that despite the short supply of vaccines, at least 2.17 crore doses have been administered to people in the state by the government, and private bodies till Tuesday."We are not being given an adequate number of vaccines. While other states have received at least 3 crore doses, we have got one crore less. Had we received one crore more doses, we could have inoculated an additional one crore population. This has become a big area of deprivation," Banerjee told reporters at the state secretariat Nabanna."The Centre is providing vaccines to various states but depriving West Bengal. Ours is also a state," she said, directing Chief Secretary H K Dwidevi to write to the Centre on this issue.She claimed that while West Bengal has received only 1.99 crore doses, Uttar Pradesh has got around 3.5 crore doses and Maharashtra 3.17 crore doses."Even states smaller than West Bengal are getting more vaccines. I do not have any objection to that but why will the Centre not provide vaccines to our state and continue to defame us? We had asked for three crore vaccines long back but have not received them," she said.Banerjee, who is also the health minister, claimed that her state is number one in terms of utilisation of vaccines, implementation of the drive and the manner in which people are being inoculated."We are vaccinating at least 3-4 lakh people every day. But if we do not have the vaccines under my control, what will we do? I am not allowed to purchase vaccines and you (Centre) are also not providing them to us," she said.The TMC chief alleged that the BJP is keener on defaming West Bengal by spreading "distorted stories"."They defame West Bengal by discussing alleged atrocities in the state but don't talk about those happening in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or Gujarat...these are distorted and planted stories of the BJP. They are jealous because West Bengal is doing good. They were defeated and could digest it," she said.The TMC trounced the BJP in the recently concluded assembly elections, returning to power in the state for the third consecutive term.Banerjee said she has not received a single reply to the letters she had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi."I have written so many letters to the prime minister asking him to provide us with three crore vaccines but there was no response, not even to the one related to Covaxin," she said.Banerjee had last week written to Modi seeking his intervention for early approval of Covaxin by the World Health Organisation, without which people who have taken the Bharat Biotech jab may face problems travelling abroad.She said that the vaccination drive in the state is getting affected due to the short supply of Covid vaccines.Only second doses are being administered in Kolkata due to the shortage, Banerjee said.She said that the short supply has created a gap (days on which people could not be vaccinated) of two days and had earlier created a gap of 10 days."We got only 1.99 crore doses and we have already administered 1.90 crore of them," Banerjee said."We have spent Rs 59 crore from the state exchequer to purchase 18 lakh vaccines directly from the manufacturers and inoculated several lakhs of super-spreaders including bus drivers, conductors, vegetable vendors and autorickshaw drivers," she said.Due to the alleged short supply of Covid vaccines from the Centre, the state government has decided to use 50 per cent of the upcoming supplies to inoculate people scheduled to get the second dose. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-depriving-bengal-of-ample-covid-vaccine-supply-mamata-276342

The petitioners had asked for an opt-out option for candidates, postponement of the exam and increase in number of centres this year.It said the candidate need not produce an RT-PCR report if a medical certificate by a registered medical practitioner for himself/herself or a family member/s was produced along with the opting-out request.The top court—which had on Tuesday made it clear that it will not postpone the Chartered Accountant (CA) Examinations 2021 scheduled to commence next month—said candidates in containment zones would also be entitled to exercise the opt-out option and they can appear in the examinations in November.It said if a candidate contracts Covid-19 during the examinations and he/she is unable to appear in the remaining papers, such a candidate would be allowed to opt out. It will not be treated as an attempt, the Bench said, adding the candidate can appear in November for all the papers.The Bench rejected ICAI counsel’s suggestion that a candidate will not be allowed to opt out if a change of centre was within the same city and clarified that it shall not be treated as an attempt.It asked ICAI to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines and SOP issued by the competent authority, including the National Disaster Management Authority.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ca-exams-sc-allows-opt-out-option-to-candidates-276336
30-06-2021||New Delhi||India received 10 per cent excess rainfall in June: IMD||Even as southwest monsoon continues to elude parts of north India, including Delhi, the country has received 10 per cent more rainfall than normal in June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday.Currently, the northernmost limit of southwest monsoon is passing through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar.“Since June 19 there has not been any progress of monsoon,” the IMD said, inferring that most of the advancement was recorded between June 3 and 19. The monsoon made onset over Kerala on June 3.According to the IMD, the further advancement of southwest monsoon into the remaining parts of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab is not likely till July 7.Central and north Indian plains are already reeling under searing heat that is pushing temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius.The ongoing weak monsoon spell is over central, peninsular and northwest India while northeast India, Bihar, and east Uttar Pradesh are witnessing heavy rains.“For the country as a whole, cumulative rainfall during this year’s Southwest Monsoon till June 30 has been above normal by about 10 per cent above Long Period Average (LPA),” the IMD said.Actual rainfall during the same period is 18.29 cm as against the normal of 16.69 cm, it said.East and northeast India have received 1.3 per cent more rainfall than normal in June. Northwest India received 14 per cent more rainfall than normal, central India 17 per cent and south peninsula 2.4 per cent, the IMD said.Southwest monsoon reached Kerala two days late. It raced through parts of the country, covering east and northeast India, central India, central peninsula and even large parts of north India much before its scheduled arrival.But it is yet to reach Haryana, Delhi, parts of west Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.“Forecasts based on model consensus show that the formation of a low-pressure system over north Bay of Bengal is unlikely till July 7,” the IMD said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-received-10-per-cent-excess-rainfall-in-june-imd-276334
30-06-2021||New Delhi||SKM condemns ‘provocative behaviour of BJP-RSS goons to instigate protesting farmers’||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Wednesday condemned the “provocative behaviour of BJP-RSS goons to instigate protesting farmers at Ghazipur border and disrupt their peaceful protests”, claiming attempts being made to provoke them for several days.The BJP in turn blamed the agitating farmers for the ruckus in Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border and damaging vehicles belonging to party supporters. Though, as per a statement issued by the SKM, “for several days now, BJP-RSS goons have been trying to instigate and provoke protesting farmers at Ghazipur border. On the pretext of welcoming a BJP leader, Amit Valmiki, several BJP-RSS workers and supporters came into the Ghazipur border UP Gate protest site today and went close to the morcha stage.“They also raised slogans against the farmers’ movement. They raised slogans against protesting farmers calling them ‘gaddar’, anti-national, ‘khalistanis’ and terrorists and indulged in stone-pelting on the morcha stage”.Stating that there was “absolutely no justification to welcoming the BJP leader at this location”, Morcha leaders claimed it was done only to “instigate a clash with the protesting farmers, police in tow, in a time-testing BJP-RSS tactic”.“When they moved aggressively towards the stage, threatened to cross over the divider, farmers objected and confronted them with black flags. They insisted that BJP workers should leave the place. Police remained mute spectators throughout. In the ensuing clash, at least 5 farmers were injured,” they claimed, accusing the BJP of “trying to bring in discord and disturbance and dividing people into caste and religion lines”.Demanding to know who allowed “welcoming of the BJP leader” hardly 50 metres from the SKM stage, they termed the “allegations of weapons being found and vehicles being damaged as political diversionary tactics”. A complaint has been lodged by the protesting farmers at the local police station, they also said.The ruckus took place when BJP workers were carrying out a procession on a flyway where farm law protesters, mainly supporters of the Rakesh Tikait-led BKU have been camping for the past several months now.According to the eyewitness accounts, as the two sides came near each other on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway around noon, a scuffle broke out.Videos and pictures surfaced on social media, purportedly showing some damaged vehicles which were part of a cavalcade of Valmiki, for whose welcome the procession was being held.Meanwhile, agitating farmers observed ‘Hool Kranti Diwas’ at protest sites today to remember resistance and sacrifice of Adivasis in India’s independence struggle, and for a just and equitable land tenure system.Several Adivasi farmers from Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh were part of the morchas today, the SKM said. In Maharashtra, SKM leaders and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee met with the chief minister, demanding an assembly resolution in the upcoming session on July 5 “on the Centre repealing the 3 black acts and bring a statute on MSP guarantee for farmers”.Amid reports of the Centre bringing in a Bill to convert the Delhi air pollution-related ordinance into a central law in the upcoming Parliament session, the SKM also asked the “government to not bring covert and sly provisions of penalising farmers for straw burning in this legislation”.“The government had orally assured the protesting farmers that penalty provisions will not be applicable to farmers, during the talks between SKM leaders and the government, in late December 2020,” they said.According to the SKM, more farmers are reaching the protest sites at Singhu border and Tikri border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/skm-condemns-provocative-behaviour-of-bjp-rss-goons-to-instigate-protesting-farmers-276328
30-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police exercised great restraint while tackling R-Day violence: Outgoing chief Shrivastava||Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava, who retired on Wednesday, said the force displayed great restrain while handling the Republic Day violence in the national capital in which many policemen were injured.The farewell ceremonial parade in the honour of Shrivastava was held on Wednesday morning at New Police Lines, Kingsway Camp here.Interacting with reporters, Shrivastava said, “The farmers are also ours. Since the beginning, we told the police personnel that we need to show and handle the situation with restrain. The personnel were being provoked and they even had to jump from 15-feet height at the Red Fort. They suffered injuries, but did not abandon the path of restrain.”On January 28, Shrivastava had also written an open letter to the personnel, appreciating the way they handled the violence during the tractor parade on Republic Day, but asked them to remain alert for more challenging days ahead.In the letter, he said the police had an option of using force but the personnel showed restraint and presence of mind and successfully dealt with the situation.Nearly 400 policemen were injured during the tractor parade of the farmers who have been protesting against three central farm laws at Delhi’s borders since November 2020.He became the Commissioner soon after the city faced riots. After taking the charge, Shrivastava had said his priority was to restore peace and ensure communal harmony in the national capital.The riots in northeastern parts of Delhi claimed 53 lives and left over 400 people injured. The force also lost one of its own men - Head Constable Ratan Lal (42), after he sustained an injury during stone pelting at Gokalpuri.Asked about his journey as the commissioner, he said, “It was a pleasant journey and there were blessings of God as whatever steps we took, we got suitable results. We had challenges, but after taking everyone together, we got success at everywhere.” He also said the police force had a different challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic and its personnel went beyond the call of duty to help the people.“Those police personnel, who were working on our instruction, were also needed to be taken care of. On one hand, we were taking care of Delhi and filled the void, helped in delivering oxygen, food and medicines, but on the other it was also very important to take care of the personnel,” Shrivastava said.Asked about the challenges faced by police due to the emergence of social media and FIR filed against Twitter, Shrivastava said, “Nowadays, the conversation on social media is increasing. As the use of social media is increasing, there would also be some mistakes on it and the police will need to register cases. The presence of Delhi Police has also increased on social media.”The Delhi Police registered an FIR against Twitter for allegedly allowing access to child pornography on the microblogging platform following a complaint by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).Shrivastava on Tuesday presented 133 officers of the force with the Police Commissioner’s Commendation Disc awards in a ceremony at the new police headquarters on Jai Singh Road here.The Police Commissioner’s Commendation Disc (gold, silver and bronze) awards are on the lines of the Central Armed Police Forces to boost up the morale of the personnel. These awards are presented to those police personnel who have excelled in their work, the officials had said.Earlier, Shrivastava had told PTI that to improve its investigating ability, cybercrime experts were being hired and they would be working with the police force.Economic offences are also increasing and forensic accounting experts are also being hired to enhance its investigation capabilities, the commissioner had said.

Did they not feel ashamed?” Yusuf said in a TV programme when asked how Pakistan viewed the India-Taliban meetings.“They kept having the Taliban killed daily and kept giving funds for operations against them and today they have reached there to have talks,” he added.“Could not understand his logic why India should not engage with Taliban, except that he appears very upset. Or does he claim proprietary rights and allows only a few to engage with the Taliban? He will be even more upset as the Taliban leadership displays more independence,” commented former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Amar Sinha.“India’s outreach to the Taliban is limited and late-in-the-day. But it seems to have upset Pindi enough for them to evoke “shame” with no sense of irony whatsoever. I guess the message from the Taliban to India isn’t all that bad after all,” observed Avinash Paliwal, strategic expert and the author of a well-received book on India’s role in Afghanistan in the 80s.The Ministry of External Affairs has dismissed speculation that EAM S. Jaishankar had met top Taliban leaders during his recent visits to Qatar. But Qatar’s Special Envoy for Counterterrorism Mutlaq bin Majed Al Qahtani said at a webinar that, “there has been a quiet visit by Indian officials to speak to the Taliban”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/does-pak-have-proprietary-rights-over-taliban-ask-experts-276318
30-06-2021||Srinagar||Sikh body demands implementation of Inter-Caste Marriage Act, anti-conversion law in JK||A Sikh organisation here on Wednesday demanded the implementation of the Inter-Caste Marriage Act and the enactment of an anti-conversion law in Jammu and Kashmir.This comes amid a row over the allegations of alleged forced conversion of four women from the Sikh community to Islam in the union territory.“I, on the behalf of the Sikh community, would request that the Inter Caste Marriage Act is implemented in Jammu & Kashmir. Once this Act is put in practice at this place, the inter-caste marriages would come to an end automatically,” All Parties Sikh Coordination Committee Chairman Jagmohan Singh Raina told reporters here.Raina, also a senior office-bearer of the Apni Party, said these laws would safeguard the interests of the people belonging to different faiths and religions.“The elements who want to take mileage out of such marriages would also face an inevitable defeat,” he added.Raina said that over the years, the members of elite political families of Jammu and Kashmir have entered into inter-caste marriage but nobody pointed fingers at them.“Whenever such an incident happens in a normal (ordinary) family, the issue gets blown out of proportion. This needs to be analysed and people should be vigilant so that the opportunistic politicians don’t exploit them,” he said.“At the same time, it is also important that Anti-Conversion Law is implemented in Jammu & Kashmir. This would stop the forcible conversion of people belonging to any religion whatsoever. As a result of the same, the friction between the different communities would also come to an end once for all. There would be no tensions between the communities and all the people would live without fear,” he said.

30-06-2021||Chandigarh||DGCA issues fresh safety rules for civilian aircraft flying from defence airfields at night||Following a state government aircraft meeting with an accident while landing at a defence airfield at night, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued fresh instructions on precautions to be taken while carrying out night operations to and from a military airbase.A safety bulletin issued to all aircraft operators by DGCA’s Air Safety Directorate a few days ago states that during night time landings, visual approach should be given the last preference and instrument landing should be opted for.Flight crew should preferably carry out a precision approach using the runway’s Instrument Landing System (ILS) and if ILS is not available, a non-precision approach using the Continuous Approach Final Descent (CDFA) should be carried out, the bulletin states.CDFA is a technique for flying the final approach segment as a continuous descent and is consistent with stabilised approach procedures which brings the aircraft to a point about 50 feet above the runway or to a point where the aircraft has to flare out just before touchdown.If the aircrew chooses to carry out a visual approach at night, then the approach should be carried out after coming overhead.The DGCA has advised flight crew to utilise all available landing aids like ILS and non-precision approach to support the approach or follow the guidance of visual approach slope indicator or precision approach path indicator till crossing the runway threshold.DGCA has asked aircraft operators to take appropriate action on its recommendations, including reassessing operational documents.In addition, when requesting for runway change at defence airfields, the crew should ensure all the requirements for safe landing, including the position of the runway arrester barrier, are met.Last month, a Beechcraft Super king Air B200 aircraft of the Madhya Pradesh government was involved in an accident while landing at Gwalior airbase, which is being probed by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board.As per available information, the aircrew had requested for runway change while approaching Gwalior airfield. The aircraft was cleared to land, but the Arrester Barrier at the end of the runway was left in erected position, which damaged the aircraft.Military aircraft have arrester barriers at both ends of the runway which are used during emergencies to halt fighter aircraft that are unable to brake on their own after touchdown due to technical faults or airframe damage.There are 23 defence airfields in the country that have civil enclaves attached to them. While the domestic terminal for civilian passengers is separate and is maintained by the Airports Authority of India, the runway, air traffic control, navigation and safety services are owned by the Ministry of Defence.Civilian aircraft can also be permitted to operate from purely defence airfields if the need so arises.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-issues-fresh-safety-rules-for-civilian-aircraft-flying-from-defence-airfields-at-night-276314

It is publicity stunt. It is in a very, very bad taste. It is very, very unfair what you are doing to us. Don’t behave like a private litigant. You do espouse petitions on public interest, you can’t behave like an ordinary. You have to espouse much higher cause,” said a vacation Bench of Justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla, constituted to hear the matter.It cannot be allowed to indulge in Bench hunting, the court said.After some arguments, the counsel for the NGO, ‘Justice for All’, said he wished to withdraw the application.The court allowed him to withdraw the application and granted liberty to file a plea seeking early hearing of the main petition, listed for hearing in August, before the roster Bench.The application for the interim relief was filed in a pending petition in which the petitioner NGO, Justice For All, has sought to modify Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) policy for tabulation of marks of Class 10 board exams 2021 based on internal assessment conducted by the schools.Advocate Khagesh B Jha, representing the NGO, said he had not filed the application for the interim relief with the main petition since the cause has arisen now as after issuance of notice on the petition by the court on June 2, a fresh FAQs have been published by the CBSE on June 9.He said the last date to upload the marks and internal assessment of Class 10 students by schools at CBSE website is June 30.The application, through advocate Shikha Sharma Bagga, sought an interim order to direct all the schools affiliated by the board to publish the rationale document for devised criteria for the assessment of students of Class 10 on their respective websites, before calculating the result and uploading the same on the CBSE portal, to bring transparency.It said the students should be able access the document and raise grievances with the CBSE well in time along with the sagacious grievance redressal mechanism by the board for the students.The application said that after issuance of notice by the court on June 2, a fresh FAQs have been published by the CBSE on June 9, and it became clear that there is no modification in their alleged arbitrary policy of moderation of marks yet, which is in violation of Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution.“The present policy is absolutely discriminatory, unfair, illogical and would result in huge manipulation of marks by the schools, based on the performance of the senior batch of students of that particular school,” it said.The high court had on June 2 sought response of the Centre, Delhi government and CBSE on the NGO’s petition claiming that the policy of the board for calculating marks of Class 10 students based on the internal assessment by schools was unconstitutional and required to be modified.In its petition, the NGO has said: “The policy of moderating the average marks assessed by the school, based on the historical performance of the previous average result of the school, in terms of the best overall performance of the school would be injustice to the students as the performance of school is not relatable in any manner with the performance of the student.”              It has also said moderating the marks in consonance with the overall average score of the district, national and state average “was absolutely unreasonable, illogical and punitive for the students of a school which would appear in the board exams for the first time”, with no previous data of performance.The NGO has alleged that it can also lead to the manipulation of marks and exploitation, extortion of the students and parents.

There is no clarity from the government on people’s concerns over loss of livelihood, jobs and rising unemployment.”  Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced Rs 1.5 lakh crore of additional credit for small and medium businesses, more funds for the healthcare sector, loans to tourism agencies and guides, and waiver of visa fee for foreign tourists as part of a package to support the pandemic-hit economy.Together with the previously announced Rs 93,869 crore spending on providing free food grains to the poor till November and additional Rs 14,775 crore fertiliser subsidy, the stimulus package—mostly made up of government guarantee to banks and microfinance institutions for loans they extend to COVID-19-hit sectors—totalled up to Rs 6.29 lakh crore.

Most hospitals have already registered on the portal, sources stated."States and UTs will be informed by MoHFW, about the total quantum of doses available for private CVCs in a month for them. They will aggregate the demand from private CVCs, keeping these quantities in mind," a statement from the Union health ministry said.There will be no need for approval from the government. Successful submission of the procurement orders on the government portal will be sufficient.The Union health ministry will facilitate the supply of these vaccines to the private hospitals after payment is made electronically through the NHA portal."The likely monthly consumption shall be estimated by multiplying the daily average consumption during the week of the choice of the Private CVC (PCVC) in the previous month by 30. The maximum limit will be twice this quantity," the instructions read.  (ANI)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-hospitals-cant-directly-procure-covid-vaccine-need-to-place-orders-on-cowin-276243
30-06-2021||Hyderabad||Brazil suspends Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin deal over graft allegations||The Brazilian government on Wednesday announced temporary suspension of its 20 million-dose Covid-19 vaccine contract with Bharat Biotech following allegations of irregularities in the deal, with the Indian drug maker insisting that it has not received any advance payments.The city-based firm said it has not received any advance payments and that the company has followed a “similar approach” in Brazil towards contracts, regulatory approvals and supplies in several countries worldwide, where Covaxin is being supplied successfully.Announcing the Brazil government’s decision, its Health Ministry said in a statement that “with the recommendation of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Union (CGU), the Ministry of Health temporarily suspended the contract for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccine from Covaxin this Tuesday (29).”     “The measure does not affect the pace of the vaccination campaign to fight the pandemic in the country and follows compliance practices in public administration,” it said.The contract was also evaluated by the Ministry of Health’s Integrity Directorate, which will carry out an administrative investigation.The unit will act together with the “Controllership” in determining the terms of the contract, it further said.Responding, Bharat Biotech said the company has not received any advance payments nor has it supplied any vaccines to Brazil.“As of 29th June 2021, Bharat Biotech has not received any advance payments nor supplied any vaccines to MOH Brazil.”“Bharat Biotech has followed a similar approach towards contracts, regulatory approvals and supplies in several countries worldwide, where Covaxin is being supplied successfully,” it said in a statement.Precisa Medicamentos is Bharat Biotech’s partner in Brazil, providing assistance, guidance and support with regulatory submissions, licensure, distribution, insurance, conduct of phase III clinical trials, etc.The Covaxin contract to Brazil landed in controversy after the South American country’s Attorney General reportedly launched a probe into the deal.The minister of the CGU, Wagner Rosrio, explained that the suspension is a preventive measure.“We opened a preliminary investigation last week, that is, a specific audit in relation to the contract. The suspension time will only last for the period of calculation.We put the reinforced team to be very quick in the process,” he said.The CGU said it began a preliminary investigation into possible irregularities in the contracting of Covaxin on June 24. “By recommendation of @CGUonline, we decided to temporarily suspend the Covaxin contract.”      According to CGU’s preliminary analysis, there are no irregularities in the contract, but, due to compliance, the @minsaude opted to suspend the contract for further analysis,” Brazil Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga tweeted. On February 26, Bharat Biotech Ltd had said it entered into an agreement with the Brazilian government for the supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin during the second and third quarters of 2021. Earlier, the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil-Anvisa, had denied permission to import Covaxin under Emergency Use Authorisation after authorities found that the Indian plant in which the jab was being made did not meet the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements.However, Anvisa on June 5 gave clearance to the proposal to import Covaxin into the South American country, with some conditions.The Emergency Use Authorisation for Covaxin was granted by Brazil on June 4.The pricing of Covaxin has been clearly established between USD 15-20 per dose for supplies to governments outside India.The pricing for Brazil has also been indicated at USD 15 per dose.Bharat Biotech has received advance payments from several other countries at the above price points, with supplies in process, pending approvals, Bharat Biotech said.The company follows a similar partnership model in all countries, where its vaccines are supplied, as it does not have its own offices there.Bharat Biotech and Precisa Medicamentos are conducting a 5000-subject phase III clinical trial in Brazil, which was recently approved by Anvisa.The trial will be conducted by the Albert Einstein Institute, the vaccine maker said.

Among 41 co-sponsors, 32 lawmakers were from the ruling Democratic party and another nine from the Republican.The resolution recognised that India's pharmaceutical industry is a vital part of the global solution to the pandemic, especially for much of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and is the world's biggest producer of Covid vaccines having exported 66.36 million doses to 93 countries and accounting for over half of global vaccine manufacturing.“The resolution stands with the people of India as they collectively work to stem the spread of Covid,” said Sherman.“The US must work with our partners around the world to quell the virus everywhere it persists,” he added.Chabot said the second wave of Covid had caused immense suffering.“Our close ties to India and India's support for us early in the pandemic call for our support. As case rates continue to decline, we must help them finish the battle against the second wave and win the war against Covid altogether,” he added.Prior to this resolution, more than 150 members of US Congress across the political aisle have issued statements, letters and tweets in support of India.

The BJP, on the other hand, alleged the SP was looking for excuses as it was staring at an imminent defeat.“Those who have abused each democratic institution are talking of ethics and morality,” BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh said. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who alleged his candidates were stopped by the local administration and the police from filing nomination, is believed to have removed some district party presidents for “colluding” with the BJP.With Assembly poll a few months away, securing maximum posts in these panchayats has become a prestige issue for both parties.Crucial semi-final||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/zila-panchayat-chief-polls-nearing-samajwadi-party-says-bjp-poaching-leaders-276084

Need more, not less. Institutional multilateralism has been found wanting. Reforms have many forms, but vaccine equity will be the immediate test,” he observed.“The full diversity of our planet needs more accurate reflection in global policy making,” he added, while pointing out that the real economy needed decentralised globalisation, including in manufacturing, food and health. Resilient supply chains must develop in parallel, he advocated.As is the case with all Foreign Ministers at the G-20 gathering, Jaishankar also utilised the occasion to discuss India’s expectations and issues of concern with his counterparts.With Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, the minister discussed the Covid situation and urged early flight resumption.Talks also covered the strategic partnership and the regional situation on a day when Israel opened its embassy in the UAE. With his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi, Jaishankar touched on the Quad, the next meeting of their Defence and Foreign Ministers and Covid.In conversation with his Canadian counterpart Marc Garneau, Indo-Pacific, trade and economic cooperation and bilateral concerns were discussed.Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and Jaishankar also met and agreed to step up cooperation and work together in the multilateral arena. “Our pharma cooperation is particularly important in Covid times,” he said.Jaishankar also interacted with the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and discussed taking forward the bilateral relationship. Maio is expected to visit India after the Covid situation improves.During a meeting with US Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Jaishankar discussed the Indo-Pacific and the Afghanistan situation.‘EAM didn’t meet Taliban leaders’New Delhi: Sources here denied social media reports claiming that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had met certain Taliban leaders during his two visits in quick succession to Qatar early this month.

It was decided to conduct discussions on disengagement and de-escalation of troops, weapons and equipment from Gogra and Hot Springs, two flashpoints along the LAC.China does not want to bring the troop build-up in Depsang Plains into the forthcoming talks. The Indian Army holds a majority of the Depsang Plains, while the PLA holds the eastern edge of the plains. A section of the government is confident of forward movement in the next round (twelfth) of India-China military dialogue, the date of which has not yet been finalised.Over a year after the standoff began, talks on disengagement at Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang have made no headway.

Being a low-cost option and easily available, utilisation of these platforms for sinister purposes by terrorist groups has become an imminent danger and challenge for security agencies worldwide,” said VSK Kaumudi, Special Secretary (Internal Security), Ministry of Home Affairs.Kaumudi said the possibility of the use of weaponised drones for terrorist purposes against strategic and commercial assets called for serious attention by the member states. “We have witnessed terrorists using them to smuggle weapons across the border,” he said.The Special Secretary emphasised that the trans-border nature of this threat called for collective and unified action by the international community to hold accountable the countries sheltering terrorists.Other new avenues for spread of terrorism were misuse of new payment methods and crowd-funding platforms, the official observed. The increased use of closed group communications on Internet and social media platforms added to the concern, he said.“Continuing advancements in evolving technologies—artificial intelligence, robotics, Deepfakes, Blockchain, Dark-web—can also be abused by terrorists. Already, crypto currencies and virtual assets are helping terror financing, helped by the anonymity and un-traceability nature of these technologies,” he said.Kaumudi pointed out that Covid and the subsequent isolation had made people vulnerable to radicalisation and recruitment by terrorist groups who spread terrorist propaganda by enticing them into “video games”. —TNSNIA to probe attack, 2 more ieds recoveredIndia: Pak must Take verifiable actionIndia has told the UN General Assembly that it was high time the international community called on Pakistan to take "effective and irreversible" actions against terror outfits operating from its soil||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-un-india-flags-threat-of-weaponised-drones-276077

It also asked the Centre to set up a portal for registering migrant workers to create a national database for the scheme. “We direct the states to bring in place a scheme for distribution of dry ration to migrant labourers,” said the Bench, which also included Justice MR Shah.

30-06-2021||New Delhi||AstraZeneca Covid vaccine produces stronger immune response with 11-month gap, third dose: Study||The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine produces an improved immune response with a longer dose gap of up to 45 weeks, and a third shot is able to boost antibody levels even further, according to a study in the UK.The yet-to-be peer-reviewed study shows that antibody levels remain elevated for at least one year following a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India where the gap between its two doses has been set at 12-16 weeks.Read also: Cipla Global to import Moderna Covid vaccine, gets DCGI nodThe authors of the study noted that an extended interval of up to 45 weeks, or about 11 months, between the first and second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine resulted in up to an 18-fold increase in antibody response measured 28 days after the second dose.The research, posted on the pre-print server of The Lancet on Monday, included volunteers aged 18 to 55 years who were enrolled in the trials and had already received either a single dose or two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine.The researchers from the University of Oxford in the UK assessed immune response after a single dose, immunity after an extended interval between the first and second dose, and the response to a third dose as a late booster.With a 45-week dosing interval between the first and second dose, antibody levels were four times higher than with a 12-week interval.The finding demonstrates that a longer interval between the two doses of the vaccine is not detrimental but can derive stronger immunity, the researchers said.“This should come as reassuring news to countries with lower supplies of the vaccine, who may be concerned about delays in providing second doses to their populations,” said Professor Andrew J Pollard, chief investigator and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford.“There is an excellent response to a second dose, even after a 10-month delay from the first,” Pollard said in a statement.The researchers noted that some countries are considering administering a third ‘booster’ dose in the future.Studying the impact of a booster, they found that the dose given at least six months after a second dose boosted antibody levels six-fold and maintained T cell response.T cells are one of the important white blood cells of the immune system and play a central role in immune response.A third dose also resulted in higher neutralising activity against the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants, according to the findings of the study.The Delta variant was first reported from India and is believed to have driven the devastating second wave in the country.“It is not known if booster jabs will be needed due to waning immunity or to augment immunity against variants of concern,” said Associate Professor Teresa Lambe, lead author of the study.“Here we show that the third dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca vaccine) is well tolerated and significantly boosts the antibody response. This is very encouraging news if we find that a third dose is needed,” Lambe said.The authors also noted that both the late second dose and the third dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine showed fewer adverse reactions than the first dose.However, they noted that further research is required to follow up with study participants who received third doses beyond the period of the initial study.

30-06-2021||New Delhi||Govt hands over probe into Jammu airport drone attack to NIA||The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Thursday formally handed over the investigation into the first of its kind drone attack on the Indian Air Force (IAF) station in Jammu on Sunday to the national Investigation Agency (NIA).  A press release from the National Investigation Agency said investigators have registered a case of attempted murder and conspiracy (sections 307 and 120B) of the Indian Penal Code; unlawful activities, terrorism, and conspiracy (Sections 13, 16, 18 and 23)  of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act; and causing explosions (sections 3 and 4) of the Explosive Substances Act 1908.“The case relates to an explosion that occurred inside the premises of the Air Force Station, Satwari campus, Jammu on 27.06.2021 and a subsequent blast, after about 6 minutes carried out by drones in a well-planned conspiracy that led to the injury to two Air Force personnel and damaged the office buildings,” the press release said.“While NIA has been working with other agencies since immediately after the incident, pursuant to reregistration of the case, requisite actions as per law, for expeditious investigation of case have been initiated.”Also read: 60 drone sightings reported in 20 months: Punjab DGPBefore the decision taken by the MHA, multiple agencies, including the NIA, National Security Guards (NSG) along with the local police and Air Force authorities were looking into the terror attack case.“In investigations at the attack site, the investigators have not yet been able to find parts of any drone. This suggests that the drones used to carry out the attack dropped the explosives over the airbase and were navigated away from the area by their handlers,” sources said.LeT suspected to be behind IAF station attack, drones may have come from across border: DGP NIA had sent its team from Srinagar office to the Jammu Air Force station early Sunday morning to collect some primary evidence from the blast site. Later, evidence was sent to Delhi for forensic tests, officials in the NIA said.Meanwhile, sources said, investigators have also retrieved two unexploded IEDs from the blast site, which could hold clues for further investigation, as they have added to the mystery to the attack leading to suspicion that the two suspected drones had a significant payload carrying capacity.“The aerial attack is a first of its kind in the country. But this is the 45th drone strike carried out across the globe so far this year. While drone strikes are carried out by state agencies, aerial hits by terror groups through such machines are dubbed ‘attacks’ and the agencies are seeking to discriminate between the two through the ongoing investigation,” a senior official in the investigative agency said.The explosions took place around 1.40 am within six minutes of each other. The first blast ripped off the roof of a single-storey building at the technical area of the airport manned by the IAF in Satwari area on the outskirts of the city. The second one was on the ground.The officials said the explosive material dropped by the drones might have been manufactured using a cocktail consisting of RDX, but a final confirmation was still awaited.Also read:||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-hands-over-probe-into-jammu-airport-drone-attack-to-nia-275756
