This is his effort to malign the state and its people who have elected Mamata Banerjee,” Roy told reporters.After its claim of winning over 200 seats fell flat, the BJP is busy hatching a conspiracy and the governor is acting as the microphone of the saffron camp, he alleged.The BJP had claimed that it will win over 200 seats in the West Bengal assembly election but managed to get 77. Two of these elected leaders, who were also MPs, resigned later, while another, Mukul Roy, returned to the TMC, his old party.“We demand the removal of the governor from the post.“We think his five-day stay in the national capital is part of a larger conspiracy to disrupt the situation in West Bengal when the state government is fighting Covid-19 and rehabilitating people affected by natural calamities,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.The governor had earlier stated that he will embark on a four-day visit to Delhi. However, he postponed the departure from Delhi till Saturday and met Shah for a second time.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, on the other hand, claimed that the TMC is humiliating the governor for rushing to the aid of the people who had to flee their homes due to attacks by the ruling party after the poll results are out on May 2.“The state administration has taken no action. Now, if the governor goes to Delhi to highlight the issue, why should the TMC object?” he said.Roy alleged that statutory bodies such as the National Human Rights Commission, the National Commission for Women and the national commission for SC, ST and backward castes are being used to harass the elected government of West Bengal and build a false narrative that people are not safe in the state.On the demand of a BJP MP for carving out a union territory comprising districts of north Bengal, the TMC leader wondered whether the saffron party would support it if there is a similar demand for Gujarat.“This is nothing but a divisive ploy of the BJP after being summarily rejected by people of West Bengal,” he said.

Five of the six party MPs had chosen Paras as their leader in place of Paswan.The battle over the party’s ownership is likely to be decided in the Election Commission as both groups fight for the legacy of popular Dalit leader from Bihar Ram Vilas Paswan, who died last year.While Chirag Paswan is his son, Paras is his youngest brother.

19-06-2021||New Delhi||Medha Patkar moves SC seeking immediate release of prisoners above 70 years||Social activist Medha Patkar has moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Centre and all states and union territories for taking immediate steps including release of prisoners above 70 years of age either on interim bail or on emergency parole to safeguard their interests. Patkar said she has moved the top court for directions to the Centre, states and union territories and high powered committees (HPCs) to formulate a uniform mechanism so as to decongest the prisons pan-India, with respect to the release of the prisoners aged above the age of 70.Patkar, in her plea filed through advocate Vipin Nair, said, “Nelson Mandela had remarked that no one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its jails. This great leader, who was incarcerated for almost 27 years, held the firm belief that a nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.”   Her plea referred to the Prison Statistic published by National Crimes Record Bureau, which said 19.1 per cent of the total convicts in prisons in India are aged 50 years and above.“Similarly, 10.7 per cent of the under trial prisoners are aged 50 years and above. The total number of prisoners belonging to the age group of above 50 years and above stand at 63,336 (13.2 per cent of the total prisoners),” the plea said.It said that similarly, the total number of prisoners who are above the age of 70 years as on May 16, according to National Prisons Information portal is 5,163 except for the data from Maharashtra, Manipur and Lakshadweep as their statistics are not available. Giving a brief background to the case, the plea said that the top court on March 23, 2020, had directed the states and union territories to constitute a HPC, so as to determine the class of prisoners who can be released on emergency parole or interim bail. The plea said that on April 13, 2020, the court clarified that it had not directed the states/union territories to compulsorily release the prisoners from their respective prisons and the purpose of earlier direction was to ensure that the states/union territories could assess the situation in their prisons having regard to the outbreak of present pandemic in the country and release certain prisoners and for that purpose to determine the category of prisoners to be released.“On the basis of such a direction, the States/ UTs constituted HPCs and most of the HPC have classified prisoners for being released on bail or parole on the basis of the gravity of crime and the likelihood of the prisoners to misuse the concession granted to them,” it said.The plea said that as most of the categorisation of prisoners are based on social conditions and are based on factors of administrative convenience, the HPCs have not taken into account the categorisation of prisoners on the basis of their susceptibility to the infection and their need to be released on an urgent basis. “The most susceptible ones here are the aged/ elderly prisoners, who have a higher chance of getting infected (specifically septuagenarian prisoners, that is above 70 years). However, on a positive note, some HPCs of the states have taken a step towards releasing such old age prisoners,” it said. Giving details of the approach adopted by different states on the issue of release of elderly prisoners, the plea said that data of Gujarat and Rajasthan are the worst. With regard to Rajasthan it said that according to data available on National Prison Information portal regarding the number of aged prisoners in the central prisons, the total inmates are 9679, between 50-60 years (612), between 60-70 years (309) and above 70 years of age are 84 inmates.Similarly, it said that in Gujarat there are 14,764 inmates. Of them, there are 1,009 inmates between 50-60 years, 348 between 60-70 years and 90 inmates above 70 years of age. The plea said that prisons in Gujarat and Rajasthan are not according to the prescribed norms and are also densely packed as compared to their official sanctioned capacity. “As such, there is every possibility that the miniscule section of the elderly prisoners in the prisons across the state shall fall prey to the infection. Although the High-Powered Committee of the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat have directed release of prisoners pursuant to the directions of this Court, there is a need to consider release of elderly prisoners on the basis of their vulnerability to the infection,” the plea said. It said barring a few exceptions, some states have not taken necessary steps regarding the release of aged prisoners despite the deadly effects of the virus. “It can be thus seen from the different approaches of the HPCs that there is no uniformity in this regard by the HPCs of different state and also there seems to be no uniform criteria adopted by the states to decongest the prisons where aged/elderly prisons are undergoing their sentence of imprisonment,” it said.The plea said that the release of elderly prisoners, irrespective of the nature of the offences, is necessary and at the same time feasible for practical reasons and should not in any manner pose any law and order difficulties.The plea in the alternative sought direction to the Centre, states and union territories to ensure that those of elderly prisoners who are not willing to avail the temporary release are shifted to the most uncongested prisons and if possible, open prisons with adequate medical facilities.

19-06-2021||New Delhi||From Milkha Singh to wife Nirmal Kaur, couples who succumbed to Covid: Till death do them part – and not even then||India's Flying Sikh Milkha Singh has died, five days after his wife Nirmal Kaur succumbed to Covid.As the pandemic swept through India, many other couples faced the same tragedy—partners for decades or perhaps beginning their journey together giving up on life, within weeks and sometimes just days of each other.Psychiatrists have a term for it – ‘broken heart syndrome'. And the legendary Singhs may have epitomised it.While Singh, one of India's greatest sporting icons, died late Friday in a Chandigarh hospital after a long battle with Covid at the age of 91, his wife, national volleyball player Nirmal Kaur, passed away on June 13, 58 years after they got married and 65 years after they first met.Their children, three daughters and a son, golfer Jeev Milkha Singh, doffed their hat to “true love and companionship”."He fought hard, but God has his ways, and it was perhaps true love and companionship that both our mother Nirmal ji and now Dad have passed away in a matter of five days," a statement from the family said.And they are not the only ones.Former Rajasthan chief minister Jagannath Pahadia and his wife, former MLA and Rajya Sabha MP Shanti Pahadia, lived together and died together – well almost. He took his last breath at the age of 89 on May 20 in a Gurgaon hospital. She, two years younger, was in the same hospital and passed away three days later.“Both of them lived together for their entire lives and remained politically active and left together for their heavenly abode. They were married in their childhood by their parents and lived happily thereafter," their son Om Prakash Pahadia said.Senior journalists Kalyan Baruah and Nilakhshi Bhattacharya also lost their battle to Covid in a Gurgaon hospital in May. Like the Pahadias, they, too, passed away within three days of each other.After a lifetime of togetherness, Bikaner-based couple Om Prakash and Manju Devi couldn't, it seems, bear to be apart either. They passed away in November within 15 days of each other.Married for nearly four decades, the couple stuck together through many ups and downs, including financial woes and the weddings of their five daughters.Their nephew, who did not want to be named, said it was possible his aunt could not bear the news of her husband's death.“While my uncle passed away in the hospital due to Covid complications, I think it was the grief of his death that likely resulted in my aunt suffering a brain haemorrhage that eventually led to her death,” he told PTI.In such cases—where one partner has passed away while the other is still recovering—medical experts recommend that the news of the death be shared only after the spouse is well out of danger.According to Mumbai-based psychiatrist Harish Shetty, lack of knowledge helps recovery.“Informing the spouse when one is physically devastated can destroy mental equilibrium, thereby causing deterioration.“I have been part of teams that have been involved in informing the other spouse after recovery. The presence of family, a doctor and a counsellor is ideal. Allowing the process of grieving to begin effectively with support is the key,” Shetty told PTI.Gurgaon-based psychiatrist Jyoti Kapoor added that the news of the demise of a partner often makes the other suffer from what is known as a ‘broken heart syndrome' - a temporary heart condition caused due to high stress and overwhelming emotions.She said it was natural for couples who had lived together for decades to share a strong emotional dependence, where the loss of one can create significant stress for the other.“Our personal experience, as well as research, has suggested that depending upon circumstances of the living partner and individual vulnerability to handle stress, the risk of death in male spouse after wife's death is 18 per cent, and risk of women's death following the death of the husband is around 16 per cent.“This has sometimes been described as 'broken heart syndrome', a sort of physical ramification of extreme emotional stress among individuals with pre-existing physical vulnerabilities like chronic illness or frail health,” Kapoor said.Losing a partner in the best of circumstances is challenging. People take years to come to terms with the death of a terminally ill spouse whose death is almost inevitable.The pandemic has magnified this ordeal for couples—not only were the deaths sudden, but the partners also left behind were fighting for their own lives as well.Arpita Basu Roy's parents passed away within four days of each other. Both were in hospital together. Not visibly romantic, they were “soulmates” married for 30 years, she said. One would never eat, unless sure that the other person has eaten too.So when her mother passed away, it was almost like her father knew, and gave up on his desire to live.“The last day I saw my father, (after my mom expired), he was all numb. He did not even respond to my sister. He was staring blankly, as if in a state of shock. We think he understood that she was gone, and was unable to accept the news.“They were soulmates and probably could not live away from one another... so they decided to depart together,” the Kolkata-based Roy told PTI.While there is no data to establish the number of couples who succumbed to Covid-19, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) gives an estimate – that 3,261 children were orphaned during the pandemic.This data, released earlier this month, only takes into account children from 0-18 years. The actual numbers would be much more.An official in Tamil Nadu estimated that at least 50 couples succumbed to Covid-19 days after either one contracted the infection during the first wave last year.District Child Protection offices in the state have identified about 50 children who had lost both parents.Describing his enormous sense of loss at losing both parents to the virus, comedian Bhuvan Bam said nothing would ever be the same again.“Lost both my lifelines to Covid. Aai aur Baba ke bina kuch bhi pehle jaisa nahi rahega. Ek mahine mein sab bikhar chuka hai. Ghar, sapne, sab kuch.Meri aai mere pass nahi hai, baba mere saath nahi hain. Ab shuru se jeena seekhna padega. Mann nahi kar raha. (Nothing is same without my father and mother. Everything is shattered within one month. My home, my dreams, everything. Will have to learn living from scratch. I don't want to.)“Was I a good son? Did I do enough to save them? I'll have to live with these questions forever. Can't wait to see them again. I wish the day comes soon,” the Mumbai-based artist wrote on Instagram last week.In Karnataka's Mandya district, Nanjunde Gowda was anxiously awaiting the birth of his child, but died of Covid-19 on April 30. On May 11, his wife Mamata gave birth to their daughter. Three days later, she, too, was dead.And Covid claimed another victim. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/from-milkha-singh-to-wife-nirmal-kaur-couples-who-succumbed-to-covid-till-death-do-them-part-%E2%80%93-and-not-even-then-270992

19-06-2021||New Delhi||Court seeks IMA chief's response on suit seeking public apology for 'derogatory remarks' against Ayurveda||A Delhi court on Saturday sought response from the Indian Medical Association, its president, secretary and others in a civil suit seeking public apology for alleged derogatory remarks against Ayurvedic treatment and medicines.Civil judge Deeksha Rao issued notice to IMA, its president Dr JA Jayalal, secretary Dr Jayesh Lele, National Medical Commission and Bureau of Indian Standards on a suit filed by Rajender Singh Rajput and sought their reply by July 9.The suit, filed through advocate Bharat Malhotra, sought a direction from the court to Jayalal, Lele and IMA to desist from making any derogatory statement against the Ayurveda treatment and hurting the sentiments of Ayurvedic believers in the interest of justice.This comes amid an ongoing tussle between yoga guru Ramdev and the IMA chief after the former's alleged comments against Covid-19 vaccination and efficacy of allopathic medicine.The litigator also sought a permanent injunction restraining the IMA president and the secretary from using the association's platform to propagate any religion or hurt the sentiments of Hindus or others.Rajput said that the duo are abusing their powers by trying to infuriate the religious sentiments of the citizens of India by maliciously bringing Christianity in all the statements circulated through print and electronic media.It also demanded a public written apology from the IMA top officials for propagating a religion and making derogatory remarks against Ayurvedic medicines or treatment.Recently, in another suit, the district court had directed Jayalal to not use the organisation's platform to propagate any religion, saying that loose comment cannot be expected from a person chairing the responsible post.Besides this, the complainant has sought removal of the IMA chief and secretary from the name of the office bearers of the association. It also sought a direction to the National Medical Commission to remove the duo in the interest of justice.Rajput further alleged that the IMA is promoting commercial products of private companies in exchange for crores of rupees. He also named nine such companies, alleging that these brands paid money in exchange for stamps of approval to market their products.He also sought a direction from the court to IMA to furnish the details of reports showing the basis of the certification or any scientific journal and the details regarding the research or study conducted at the time of approving the products. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-seeks-ima-chiefs-response-on-suit-seeking-public-apology-for-derogatory-remarks-against-ayurveda-270987
19-06-2021||---||1,152 Class 12 compartment, private, repeat category students move SC||New Delhi, June 19As many as 1,152 students have moved the Supreme Court seeking cancellation of CBSE Class 12 compartmental examination as they demanded that the court-approved evaluation formula for regular students be applied to those in compartment, private and repeat categories and their results be declared on time.They urged the top court to direct the CBSE to finalise a formula for performance evaluation of the Class 12 private, compartment and repeat category students in accordance with the formula adopted by the CBSE and other school education boards for the regular students.Keeping in view the safety, health and well being of students, their parents and family members, teaching faculty and all stakeholders, the notification issued by CBSE calling off the Class 12 Board Examinations due to Covid-19 should be given widest interpretation so as to include all categories of students, and not just regular ones.According to the CBSE formula accepted by the top court on June 17, Class 10, 11 and 12 marks will be considered in 30:30:40 ratio to prepare the final results of Class 12 students and results would be declared by July 31. Marks in the best of three subjects would be considered for the purpose for Class 10, 11 and 12.While 30 per cent weightage will be given for Class 10 and 11; for Class 12 the weightage would be 40 per cent, he said, adding that for Class 12 the marks obtained by a student in his/her unit test/mid-term/pre-board examinations will be considered, while 20 marks will be given for practical in Class 12, the formula accepted by the court envisaged.The CBSE had said if a student wasn’t able to meet the qualifying criterion; he/she will be placed in “essential repeat” or “compartment category”.However, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) had proposed a different set of criteria to compute marks based on performance of students in the last six years and declare results by July 20. The court is to take up the matter again on Monday.The petitioners alleged that the CBSE has attempted to give an unequal treatment to private/patrachar/second chance compartment candidates of Class 10 and 12, thereby creating a classification which has no reasonableness, rational and hence, “is prima facie, unfair, unjust, arbitrary, and unreasonable and violative of the principles of equality enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution.”Due to the prevailing pandemic situation it was not advisable to conduct physical mode examination for the private/second chance compartment candidates, as it would endanger their life, the petitioners submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-152-class-12-compartment-private-repeat-category-students-move-sc-270974

On Friday night, District Magistrate Prabhu N Singh released a report based on those submitted by the two panels.Giving a clean chit to the hospital, the report said the facility monitored symptoms of hypoxia and oxygen saturation levels of patients so that treatment could be done with limited oxygen availability.A bedside analysis of every patient was done, and it was found that 22 patients were in critical condition, it added.The investigating committee also mentioned that the hospital had adequate oxygen cylinders. It was using 149 oxygen cylinders with 20 in reserve on April 25 and 121 oxygen cylinders with 15 in reserve on April 26, it said.Attendants of the patients had also arranged oxygen cylinders of their own, the committee further said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-proof-of-mock-drill-leading-to-death-of-22-patients-in-agra-hospital-report-270944

19-06-2021||---||States, UTs asked not to lower guard, take calibrated measures while easing out restrictions||New Delhi, June 19With states and Union Territories having started easing out restrictions amid declining number of Covid cases in the country, the Centre has cautioned them not to lower their guard and ensure that the whole process is carefully calibrated.Keeping in view the visuals of marketplaces on social media where people are seen crowding without wearing masks and not following other Covid-appropriate behaviour, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla has written a letter to chief secretaries of the states and administrators of UTs asking them to “sensitise the local administration at district level and other lower administrative units” about the need to keep a close watch on the trend of Covid cases.“With the decline in the number of active cases, many states and UTs have started relaxing restrictions. I would like to highlight that the decision to impose or ease the restrictions has to be taken, based on the assessment of the situation at ground level. While the opening-up of activities, after decline in cases, is essential, the states and UTs must ensure that the whole process is carefully calibrated,” the letter read.To contain the spread of infection on a sustainable basis, Bhalla said, it was necessary “to continue the strategy of test-track-treat” and “to ensure that the testing rate does not come down”.“As the situation is dynamic, a close watch needs to be kept on early signs of a surge in active cases or high positivity rates. A system should be in place at the micro level to ensure that whenever cases rise in a smaller place, it gets checked at that level itself, through local containment measures as per the existing guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,” the letter read.Prescribing a five-fold strategy of Covid-appropriate behaviour, test-track-treat and vaccination, Bhalla said, “Easing of restrictions in some states has led to resumption of crowding of people in markets, without adherence to the norms. It is, therefore, essential to ensure that complacency does not set in, and there is no let-up in adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour, while opening up activities.”Noting that vaccination against Covid in the present scenario is critical to breaking the chain of transmission, he said, “Therefore, all state/UT governments should step up the pace of vaccination to cover the maximum number of people in an expeditious manner.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-uts-asked-not-to-lower-guard-take-calibrated-measures-while-easing-out-restrictions-270908

19-06-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Govt doubts tainted money led to rise in funds by Indians in Swiss bank||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 19The government has requested for more information from the Swiss authorities and the possible reasons for media reports suggesting a huge rise of funds by Indians in Swiss banks.However, the government feels there does not appear to be any significant possibility of increase of deposits in Swiss banks due to undeclared incomes of Indian residents.This is because India and Switzerland are signatories to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAAC) and Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA), which have a significant deterrent effect on tax evasion through undisclosed assets abroad, stated the official release.These instruments enable automatic exchange of information (AEOI) between the two countries for sharing of financial account information. Since the signing of these pacts, exchange of financial account information for citizens of both countries has taken place in 2019 as well as in 2020, it added.In view of the existing legal arrangement for exchange of information of financial accounts, the government feels four factors could potentially explain the increase in deposits. These are an increase in deposits in India-based Swiss bank branches, increase in inter-bank transactions between Swiss and Indian banks, capital increase for a subsidiary of a Swiss company in India and increase in the liabilities connected with the outstanding derivative financial instruments.The statement noted that media reports allude to the fact that the figures reported are official figures reported by banks to Swiss National Bank (SNB) and do not indicate the quantum of much-debated alleged black money held by Indians in Switzerland.Further, these statistics do not include the money that Indians, NRIs or others might have in Swiss banks in the names of third-country entities.Reports stated that deposits by Indians have risen to over Rs 20,700 crore at the end of 2020 from Rs 6,625 crore at the end of 2019, reversing a two-year declining trend. They also state that this is also the highest figure of deposits in the last 13 years.However, customer deposits have actually fallen from the end of 2019. The funds held through fiduciaries have also more than halved from the end of 2019. The biggest increase is in “Other amounts due from customers”. These are in form of bonds, securities and various other financial instruments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-doubts-tainted-money-led-to-rise-in-funds-by-indians-in-swiss-bank-270899

Russia also abstained.Belarus was the sole country voting against it.“This resolution was tabled in the UN General Assembly in a hasty manner without adequate consultations with neighbours and regional countries. This is not only unhelpful but may also prove counter-productive to the efforts of the ASEAN to find a solution to the current situation in Myanmar,” India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti told PTI.In the explanation of the vote in the General Assembly hall, Tirumurti said as Myanmar's immediate neighbour and close friend of its people, India is cognizant of the “serious impact of political instability” and the potential of its spillover beyond Myanmar's borders.India has been calling for greater engagement with the objective of peacefully resolving all issues.“We already have such an ongoing initiative under the aegis of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). It is important that we extend support to the ASEAN efforts," Tirumurti said."During the discussions on this resolution, we had engaged in a spirit of finding a constructive and pragmatic way forward and had accordingly shared our suggestions to those who piloted this resolution,” he said.“However, we find that our views have not been reflected in the draft being considered for adoption today. We would like to reiterate that a consultative and constructive approach involving the neighbouring countries and the region, remains important as the international community strives for the peaceful resolution of the issue,” Tirumurti said.

Prevention tools against all kinds of mutations are the same — vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Commenting on the AIIMS, New Delhi, study which revealed that more than 55% children and more than 63% adults may have already been infected by Covid during the second wave, Member, Health, NITI Aayog, VK Paul said, “So far as the study findings regarding vast proportions of the population showing antibodies go, the fact is we cannot take anything for granted on herd immunity. The evidence on this is not clear. Brazil had a 70% infection prevalence rate but a new variant caused massive devastation. Likewise in Delhi, we knew the sero positivity rate was around 56% before the Delta variant came and played havoc.”HC NOTICES TO CENTRE, DELHI OVER VIOLATIONS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-covid-report-below-5-positivity-rate-in-531-districts-270770

Twitter India’s public policy manager Shagufta Kamran and legal counsel Ayushi Kapoor deposed before the panel. During the 90-minute deposition, the officials were asked “tough and searching questions”, including why Twitter should not be fined as it has been found “violating” rules of the country, sources said.Panel members, mostly from the ruling BJP, asked the Twitter officials whether their policy “is more important or rule of land”, to which officials responded they respected the Indian laws but had to follow their policy too for larger interest, the sources said.MD told to join Ghaziabad case probeThe Uttar Pradesh Police have served a notice on Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari in a case of a viral video of alleged assault on a Muslim man in Ghaziabad earlier this month.

These pertain to delay in taking clearances under environment and wildlife laws.Await wildlife, eco clearancesThe MoD had taken up the matter with all stakeholders to resolve the issue keeping in view the projects of national importance, the sources said. An official pointed out that in November 2014, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, accorded a general approval underSection 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, to expedite the forest clearances for taking up border infrastructure works. This mandated that no prior clearance was needed from the environment impact assessment committee for raising infrastructure within 100 km of aerial distance from the LAC. The dispensation was to start work and then seek exemptions and clearances. The order also permitted diversion of land for strategic road building.Notably, this exemption does not apply for wildlife protection issues under the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972. Each project needs an independent bio-diversity impact assessment by a committee of experts, which submits a report to the National Board of Wildlife.The Ladakh plateau had seen major battles in the 1962 war. Some 9,000 sq km (15.22 per cent) area in Ladakh is under wildlife sanctuaries. Some of these include mountain ridges which are strategically vital and provide a deep view across the LAC in Tibet.A proposal to remove the blanket ban on building infrastructure was first proposed in 2012, but non-official members of the National Board for Wildlife protested. Earlier in October 2011, an independent survey of the animal population was completed.Meanwhile, China, on similar terrain and ecology on the Tibetan side, has gone ahead to provide all-weather connectivity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bro-projects-stuck-in-red-tape-china-on-infra-building-spree-270717

Except for repeal, if any farmers’ union wants to talk on provisions of the Act even at midnight, Narendra Singh Tomar will welcome it,” the Agriculture Minister tweeted.The government has held 11 rounds of talks with the protesting farm unions. At the last meeting in January, the negotiations hit a roadblock with 41 farmer unions rejecting the Centre’s offer to put the laws on hold.Farmers of Punjab and Haryana will gather at Amb Sahib Gurdwara in Mohali and Nada Sahib in Panchkula on June 26 and then march to Raj Bhavan in Chandigarh. This was decided in a meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) at Kundli, Sonepat, today. The Morcha has announced ‘Kheti Bachao, Loktantra Bachao’ drive on June 26 on the completion of seven months of the farm protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-repeal-farm-laws-agriculture-minister-270710

However, it clarified that the release of the three activists — Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha — who walked out of Tihar Jail on Thursday on bail would not be interfered at this stage.“It’s troubling that the High Court has gone on to narrow down the scope of the UAPA in a bail application when there was no challenge to the statute,” it noted. Terming it an “important issue” that can have pan-India ramifications, the top court issued notices to the accused trio, asking them to respond to the Delhi Police petition challenging the Delhi High Court’s order and posted the matter for hearing in the week starting from July 19.“In a bail application, 100 pages of judgment and judges discussing all laws... that’s what is surprising us...The way UAPA has been interpreted by the high court, probably will require examination by us,” it said.The order came after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the high court’s findings called for acquittal of the accused and others were also moving for bail based on this judgment.“It’s virtually an acquittal order. The trial court will have to entertain a discharge application and replace it with this judgment,” the Solicitor General submitted.“Right to protest, how does it include the right to kill people?” Mehta said, adding 53 people were killed and 700 others injured in the Delhi riots that happened during the then US President Donald Trump’s India visit last year.On behalf of the accused, senior advocate Kapil Sibal opposed Mehta’s submission and urged the court not to stay the HC verdict.Holding that right to protest is a fundamental right which can’t be termed as a “terrorist act”, the Delhi High Court had on Tuesday granted bail to the three student activists who faced charges under various provisions of the IPC and the UAPA in Delhi riots conspiracy case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-stay-but-will-study-hcs-uapa-interpretation-supreme-court-270707

In a gesture signifying that things are in his favour, Yediyurappa, who did not make any comment on what transpired at the meeting on the leadership issue, flashed the victory sign as he departed from the state BJP office.“The leadership issue was not discussed... Yediyurappa is our leader, there is no change in that. Our in-charge Arun Singh has asked me to make it clear,” Revenue Minister and core committee member R Ashoka told mediapersons.Yediyurappa earlier in the day had downplayed the dissidence against him as he ruled out any political crisis in the state.“There is no political crisis at all...what is happening is just because one or two people are saying something in the media, it is creating misunderstanding,” he said, pointing out that Singh did not even meet those involved in such activities.Speculations have been rife for some time now that a section of the ruling BJP is trying to push for unseating Yediyurappa, despite Singh, party state president Nalin Kumar Kateel and other senior leaders ruling out replacing the CM and asserting that the 78-year-old Lingayat strongman will continue in the top post. This is mainly because of repeated open statements by some disgruntled legislators against the functioning of the government and its leadership, party sources said.Despite being warned not to make open statements, disgruntled BJP MLC AH Vishwanath today once again demanded Yediyurappa’s ouster and levelled allegations of corruption and interference in the administration against his younger son and party vice-president BY Vijayendra.Yediyurappa is no stranger to controversies and allegations. In 2011, he was forced to resign as CM and also spend time in prison after being indicted in a scam, though later he was acquitted of all charges.State Govt dismisses tender scam allegation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-backs-yediyurappa-change-unlikely-270469

She accused the BJP leader of committing corrupt practices and also alleged discrepancies in counting.Initially, the petition was listed to come up before Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya on June 9. However, subsequently, Banerjee “was made aware” by the Chief Justice (Acting) that her petition got assigned to Justice Chanda.Banerjee’s counsel wrote that his client apprehends that Justice Chanda was aware of her objections to his appointment as Permanent Judge.Noting that Chanda was an “active member of the BJP” when he was an advocate, the letter questioned assigning of Banerjee’s election petition to him. His client was apprehensive that the judge could favour Adhikari, the counsel stated.Justice Chanda on Friday fixed June 24 as the date for presentation of Banerjee’s plea.Derek O’Brien, TMC leader in the RS, tweeted two pictures of an event organised by BJP’s law and legal affairs department.Drawing a circle around the face of a person purported to be Justice Chanda, O’Brien wrote, “Who is that person ‘circled’ in both pics? Is he Justice Chanda of Calcutta High Court? Has he been assigned to hear the Nandigram case? Can the judiciary sink any lower?”Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh compared the HC Judge with Assembly Speaker (who may be winning as a party nominee. but is expected rise above party affiliations when discharging his duty as Speaker) and said as a judge Justice Chanda acted impartially.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nandigram-poll-plea-mamata-says-no-faith-in-justice-chanda-270470

A group of 13 local fishermen claimed that they had ventured into the sea on May 7 onboard trawlers “Thushan 1” and “Thushan II” and were physically assaulted by the Indian Navy in the international waters around Diego Garcia on June 4. “They demanded drugs from us even after we told them that we were only fishermen,” two fishermen told the local Hiru TV on Thursday. Responding to their claims, the Indian High Commission here denied that the fishermen had been assaulted by the Indian Navy. “Media reports on June 17 stating that a group of Sri Lankan fishermen was attacked physically by the Indian Navy are blatantly false,” the High Commission said. “The Indian Navy is a highly disciplined and professional force which discharges its responsibilities in an impeccable manner,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reports-on-navy-attacking-lankan-fishermen-false-270471

Let this matter be listed before another Bench,” Justice Banerjee said at the very outset of the proceedings. The top court had on May 18 asked the Centre and the West Bengal Government to respond to the plea filed by Biswajit Sarkar, whose elder brother was killed and co-petitioner Swaranalata Adhikari, whose husband was killed in poll-related violence. They have said this is a matter which requires probe by an agency like CBI or a SIT under court’s supervision, as the state police has not been taking any action despite a complaint being made. The petition alleged that Abhijit Sarkar was killed on May 2 by a mob comprising 20 TMC supporters which entered the house of Biswajit Sarkar, dragged his elder brother Abhijit and killed him in front of his mother and other family members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judge-recuses-from-bengal-violence-case-270474

The 91-year-old’s fight with Covid-19 ended late Friday night at the PGI, where he had been undergoing treatment for the dreaded virus which took his wife Nirmal’s life five days ago.He will be cremated at 5 pm on Saturday with full state honours.His mortal remains have been kept at his Sector 8 residence. Milkha Singh, who tested positive for Covid-19 on May 20 after a domestic help at his residence was found infected, was initially admitted to a Mohali hospital before being brought home on May 30. However, he was admitted to the PGI after his oxygen levels fell.Also read: Milkha’s death brings the curtain down on the extraordinary story of this remarkable athlete, whose exploits were retold to the new generation through cinema with the movie Bhag Milkha Bhag.Born in Gobindpura — now in Pakistan — on November 30, 1928, Milkha was violently uprooted from his birthplace by the Partition when riots took the lives of his parents, two sisters and a brother.His life changed for the better when Milkha joined the Army, and it was in this institution that his amazing talent was identified and nurtured.Milkha became the first Indian athlete to win a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in the 400m division at Cardiff in 1958.The same year, he did the 200m-400m double at the Tokyo Asian Games.His most famous race, however, is the 400m final at the 1964 Olympic Games, where he was one of the favourites to get a medal — which he missed by a whisker, ending up fourth.After his career ended, Milkha became a sports administrator.He is survived by one son — golfer Jeev Milkha Singh — and three daughters.In the passing away of Shri Milkha Singh Ji, we have lost a colossal sportsperson, who captured the nation’s imagination and had a special place in the hearts of countless Indians.

The first phase in February was followed by the second phase in March, while the next phases were scheduled for April and May.But those were postponed after an exponential rise in the number of COVID-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic in the country.The JEE-Advanced exam, which is conducted for admission to the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology and the National Institutes of Technology, was also postponed. The exam was scheduled on July 3.While no further decision was taken on NEET-UG, the registration for the exam, which was supposed to commence from May 1, was kept in abeyance. The ministry is also yet to decide on the fate of the Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET).The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday announced the marks tabulation policy for the Class 12 exams, which were cancelled on June 1 in view of the Covid situation. The schedule for the subsequent entrance examinations is expected to be decided soon.According to the policy decided by a 13-member panel set up by the board, the theory paper evaluation formula is that a 30-per cent weightage will be given to the marks obtained in Class 10, another 30-per cent weightage to the Class 11 marks, and a 40-per cent weightage to the Class 12 marks obtained in the unit test, mid-term and pre-board exams.The CBSE scheme further elaborated that for Class 10, the 30 per cent marks based on the average theory component of the best three performing subjects out of the main five subjects will be taken. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/decision-on-pending-entrance-exams-jee-neet-soon-ministry-of-education-270448

India has administered a cumulative number of 26,89,60,399 (26.89crore) COVID-19 vaccine doses so far.Pollard, who is also Professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity at Oxford University in the UK noted that AstraZeneca is not working on a single-dose vaccine."Two doses are needed. One may be good but the second is needed to boost protection," said the scientist.He also said that his group is not planning or working on a booster or a third jab, saying it may not be "necessary".Pollard said that in a situation of vaccine shortage it makes sense to ensure a measure of protection for the widest number of people rather than provide a better level of protection for a smaller number of people He explained this by saying that one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India, provides above 70 per cent protection against serious illness and hospitalisation which has to be the main concern."One should not be deterred or deflected by the fact that one dose provides only 30 per cent protection against symptomatic illness," the scientist said, adding symptomatic illness usually means nothing more than a cold, cough, and fever, which most people can easily handle.He also noted that as more mutations and variants inevitably appear, symptomatic protection from vaccines is likely to diminish."What we need to focus on is a high level of continuing protection against serious illness and hospitalisation," Pollard said.In India, the gap between two Covishield doses was four to six weeks, then increased to six to eight and is now 12-16.Referring to the UK reducing its Covishield doses gap just as India increased its, Pollard said that Britain reduced the gap at a time when a substantial proportion of its population was already vaccinated."In India, the converse is the case. The vast majority of people are unvaccinated and unprotected. Therefore, you need to ensure that as many as possible are protected against serious illness and hospitalisation, even if that means a large number will have lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection," the scientist explained.Pollard said another sensible reason for extending the gap in circumstances where the supply of vaccine is short is that the level of the protection provided by one dose of AstraZeneca significantly increases in the second and third months after the jab.AstraZeneca is an adenovirus vectored vaccine. Scientists have engineered a version of adenoviruses that infect chimpanzees to carry the gene responsible for the spike protein of the coronavirus, which the virus uses to enter and infect human cells.With 62,480 new coronavirus infections being reported in a day, India's total tally of COVID-19 cases rose to 2,97,62,793, while the death toll climbed to 3,83,490 with 1,587 fresh fatalities, the lowest in 61 days, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/astrazeneca-vaccines-chief-investigator-backs-indias-12-16-week-covishield-dose-gap-270445
19-06-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan says at times it feels India's presence in Afghanistan perhaps 'larger than it ought to be'||With India stepping up its diplomatic activities in Afghanistan's peace process as the US prepares for the troops withdrawal, a jittery Pakistan has said that at times it feels that New Delhi's presence in the war-torn country is perhaps "larger than it ought to be".Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's remarks to Afghanistan's Tolo news channel comes days after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad in Qatar's capital Doha on Tuesday and exchanged perspectives on the war-ravaged nation and the region."Obviously, you have sovereign relations and you have bilateral relations and you have every right to have sovereign and bilateral relations with India. You have trade with India. They come and carry out development work there, that's completely fine with us," Qureshi said during the interview which will be telecast on Saturday.“But at times we feel that their presence is perhaps larger than it ought to be because they...don't share a border with you,” he said, according to the excerpts of the interview posted by the news channel on its Twitter handle.When asked whether India's presence in Afghanistan bothers Pakistan, Qureshi said, "Yes, If they use your (Afghan) soil against us, it bothers me." Asked how India is using Afghan soil for anti-Pakistan activities, he alleged: "Yes, they are...By carrying out terrorist activities." During the interview, Qureshi also sought to absolve the Taliban for the spike in violence in Afghanistan, saying it would be an "exaggeration" to blame the insurgent group for the bloodshed."Again, if you try and create this impression that the violence is high because of the Taliban...again, that would be an exaggeration. Why do I say that? Aren't there other elements over there who are playing the role of a spoiler?” On a question on the forces responsible for the violence, Qureshi said: “Daesh (the Islamic State), like forces within Afghanistan...who gain from the war economy, who want to perpetuate their power, who are not seeing beyond their nose and just want to hang on to power.” The Taliban and the Afghan government are holding direct talks to end 19 years of war that has killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged various parts of the country.The intra-Afghan began as the US and the Taliban signed a landmark deal in Doha on February 29, 2020 following multiple rounds of negotiations to bring lasting peace in war-torn Afghanistan and allow US troops to return home.India has been keenly following the evolving political situation after the US signed the peace deal with the Taliban. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains on America's longest war.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested close to USD three billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.During his visit to Qatar, Jaishankar on Tuesday met US special envoy Khalilzad in Doha and exchanged perspectives on the war-torn nation and the region. Khalilzad briefed him on the recent developments in Afghanistan.The minister also met senior members of the Qatari leadership and discussed the issue of Afghanistan among other matters as Doha is involved in the Afghan peace process.In March, Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar visited India during which Jaishankar conveyed to him India's long-term commitment towards a peaceful, sovereign and stable Afghanistan.India on Thursday said its vision for Afghanistan is driven by an approach of pro-development and pro-democracy and that it is for the Afghan people to judge each of their partners on the basis of past actions.In early March, Jaishankar and Khalilzad spoke over the phone and discussed the developments pertaining to the Afghan peace talks.In the same month, Jaishankar attended the 9th Heart of Asia Ministerial Conference in Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, where he voiced 'grave concern” over violence and bloodshed in Afghanistan and said that there is a need for a genuine ‘double peace' in and around the war-torn country.Jaishankar also said that India has been supportive of all the efforts being made to accelerate the dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban, including intra-Afghan negotiations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-says-at-times-it-feels-indias-presence-in-afghanistan-perhaps-larger-than-it-ought-to-be-270427

In two years, India likely will develop herd immunity through vaccine and exposure to the disease," said Robert Gallo, director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland and international scientific advisor, Global Virus Network. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-should-brace-for-third-covid-19-wave-by-october-say-health-experts-270414
19-06-2021|| New Delhi||Jaipal encounter: SC asks Punjab & Haryana HC to hear plea for second autopsy||The Supreme Court on Friday set aside the order of Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the plea filed by slain gangster Jaipal Singh Bhullar's father seeking directions to the Punjab government to conduct a second autopsy of his son's body.   The high court, which had declined the plea on the ground of territorial jurisdiction, was asked by the apex court to consider the plea again on June 21. HC dismisses plea for 2nd post-mortemA Vacation Bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah also directed the Punjab government to make appropriate arrangements to preserve the body, which has been taken to Firozpur in Punjab from Kolkata. “The impugned order is set aside. The High Court is requested to hear the matter on Monday (June 21). The Punjab government shall make necessary arrangements for the storage of the dead body,” the Bench said. Bhullar and another gangster Jaspreet Singh, involved in killing two policemen recently in Ludhiana, were gunned down by a Kolkata police team in a shootout in the city on June 9 after receiving "pin-pointed" information from their Punjab counterparts. Kin refuse to cremate gangster Jaipal Singh Bhullar, want autopsyThe high court had dismissed the plea of the slain gangster's father saying the matter is not under its jurisdiction as the encounter took place in Kolkata.During the hearing in the apex court, advocate Ishma Randhawa, appearing for Bhullar's father Bhupinder Singh claimed it was a fake encounter and the deceased was killed by custodial torture. She contended that Singh has seen the body of Bhullar, which she said had gone blue and bones were broken. Randhawa said that his father had gone to Kolkata on his own and brought back the body to Firozpur in Punjab.Dreaded gangster Jaipal Bhullar, aide Jaspreet killed in Kolkata encounter“I am not seeking a CBI probe into the encounter but all I want is a second autopsy to ascertain the fact whether he was killed in custodial torture or not. I have the right to know under Article 21 of the constitution to know how my son was killed,” she said. On Thursday, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had dismissed a petition filed by Bhullar's father seeking directions to the state of Punjab to conduct a second autopsy of his son's body either at PGIMER here or AIIMS, New Delhi. The court had also dismissed another plea for preserving Bhullar's body at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). Bhullar's family hasn't yet conducted his last rites. Bhullar's father Bhupinder Singh, in his petition had sought directions to the state of Punjab to conduct a second post-mortem of his son's body either at the PGIMER, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, or some independent medical institute to ascertain the nature of injuries. Bhupinder Singh, a retired Punjab police inspector, has alleged that his son was tortured before being gunned down. Earlier on Monday, the Ferozepur deputy commissioner had rejected the request of Bhullar's family for a second post-mortem. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaipal-encounter-sc-asks-punjab-haryana-hc-to-hear-plea-for-second-autopsy-270403
19-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi High Court order granting bail to 3 student-activists booked under UAPA can't be treated as precedent: SC||Taking exception to the Delhi High Court reading down the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) while granting bail to three student activists facing charges under the anti-terror law in the Delhi riots conspiracy case, the Supreme Court on Friday said the order can’t be treated as a precedent.“In the meantime, the impugned judgment shall not be treated as a precedent and may not be relied upon by any of the parties in any of the proceedings,” a Bench led by Justice Hemant Gupta said.However, the three accused—Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha released from Tihar Jail on Thursday—will not be re-arrested as it clarified that their bail was not being interfered at this stage.”It’s troubling that the high court has gone on to narrow down the scope of the UAPA in a bail application when there was no challenge to the statute,” it noted.Terming it an “important issue” that can have pan-India ramifications, the top court issued notices to the accused trio asking them to respond to the Delhi Police petition challenging the Delhi High Court’s order and posted the matter for hearing in the week starting from July 19.”In a bail application, 100 pages of judgment and judges discussing all laws... That’s what is surprising us...The way UAPA has been interpreted by the high court, probably will require examination by us,” it said.The order came after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the high court’s findings called for acquittal of the accused and others were also moving for bail based on this judgement.”It’s virtually an acquittal order. The trial court will have to entertain a discharge application and replace it with this judgment,” the Solicitor General submitted.”Right to protest, how does it include the right to kill people?” Mehta said, adding 53 people were killed and 700 others injured in the Delhi riots that happened during the then US President Donald Trump’s India visit last year.On behalf of the accused, senior advocate Kapil Sibal opposed Mehta’s submission and urged the court not to stay the HC verdict.Holding that right to protest is a fundamental right that can’t be termed as a ‘terrorist act’, the Delhi High Court had on Thursday granted bail to the three student activists who faced charges under various provisions of the IPC and the UAPA in Delhi riots conspiracy case.The high court had said it was constrained to note that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters may get out of hand, “the state has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’. If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril”.Terming as “somewhat vague” the definition of ‘terrorist act’ under the UAPA, the HC had cautioned against its use in a “cavalier manner”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-high-court-order-granting-bail-to-3-student-activists-booked-under-uapa-cant-be-treated-as-precedent-sc-270373

We don't know if there is any household which has not suffered in the second wave, closely or remotely," the bench observed.
