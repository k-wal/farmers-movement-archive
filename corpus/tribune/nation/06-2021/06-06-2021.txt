06-06-2021||New Delhi/Chandigarh/Mumbai||More states announce easing of Covid-induced curbs from Monday||Haryana and Sikkim were the latest to extend lockdown from Monday but have eased the curbs like several other states including Maharashtra that have announced cautious steps towards restarting or scaling up activities after over a month following a decline in Covid cases.“The state government is taking a calculated risk and hence people have to take care of themselves. Nothing is going to be eased immediately,” Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said ahead of the start of the five-tier unlock process based on a weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds in districts.Thackeray emphasised that the local administration will take decisions on whether to ease restrictions and further tighten them.In Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, restaurants, shops selling non-essential items and public places are set to reopen from Monday but malls, theatres and multiplexes will continue to remain shut as the metropolis has been categorised under level 3 of the ‘unlock’ plan.However, the national capital, which began the unlock exercise from May 31 will see further easing of restrictions from Monday, with the government allowing resumption of metro services at 50 percent capacity and reopening of markets and malls on an odd-even basis.Officials said teams of police and district administration have been deployed across the city to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour.Possible super spreader areas like prominent markets, malls and liquor stores that attract large crowds have been marked for strict compliance with precautions like the use of face masks and social distancing.In June, several states and Union Territories have begun easing the lockdown restrictions which they first started imposing in mid-April as the second Covid wave hit the country, but the Centre has cautioned that the unlock process has to be slow and that Covid-appropriate behaviour needs to be strictly followed.“Whatever we know from possible scenarios presented by eminent people, it (Covid) will decline and June will be much much more better but the concerns are when we open up, how do we behave because the virus has not gone anywhere,” NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul had said last week.The Uttar Pradesh government also extended the relaxations in the coronavirus curfew to four more districts on Sunday. With this, curbs have been eased in 71 districts where shops and markets outside containment zones will be allowed to open for five days a week.While the count of active cases have fallen below the 600-mark in these districts, a watch is being kept on the remaining four districts of Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Saharanpur, and a decision on these districts may be taken on Tuesday, an official statement said. The Haryana government said it was extending the lockdown, clamped in the state on May 3, till June 14 as a preventive and precautionary measure though the Covid positivity rate and the number of new Covid positive cases have declined.While further relaxations regarding the opening of shops and shopping malls have been given, religious places are also allowed to open now with 21 people at a time.Corporate offices can have 50 percent attendance after adopting social distancing norms and gatherings of up to 21 people are allowed at weddings, funerals and cremations from the earlier 11.The Sikkim government, while announcing the state-wide lockdown for one more week till June 14, also allowed relaxation for shops selling groceries and hardware.Even as the Covid situation has relatively improved in most of the northern and western states, southern and eastern parts of the country are still reporting a high number of cases.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin had announced the extension of the lockdown by a week till June 14 with some easing of restrictions from Monday, except in 11 districts where the number of new cases reported was still high.Earlier, neighbouring Karnataka had extended the lockdown till June 14.Himachal Pradesh and Goa had also extended the ‘Corona curfew’ till June 14 with some easing of curbs.Ladakh on Sunday announced a gradual unlocking after a month-long ‘corona curfew’ in the Union Territory.India reported 1,14,460 new coronavirus infections, the lowest in 60 days, while the daily positivity rate further dropped to 5.62 percent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday.With the fresh cases, the total tally of coronavirus cases in the country climbed to 2,88,09,339.The Covid-19 death toll climbed to 3,46,759 with 2,677 daily deaths, the lowest in 42 days, while the active cases dropped below 15 lakh, the data updated at 8 am showed               India had reported more than 88.82 lakh coronavirus infections in May alone during the raging second wave of Covid-19, accounting for 31.67 percent of the over 2.8 crore cases reported in the country so far and making it the worst month of the pandemic.The month of May also saw 1,17,247 fatalities due to the disease, which is around 35.63 percent of the total 3,29,100 deaths recorded so far.The daily cases peaked on May 7 when the country registered 4,14,188 infections in a span of 24 hours, while daily deaths were the highest on May 19 with India reporting 4,529 fatalities due to Covid-19.The active cases had peaked on May 10 at 37,45,237.Here is a look at coronavirus-induced restrictions/lockdown imposed by states and union territories:      —Delhi will continue with lockdown with the second phase of easing of restrictions from June 7.—Haryana has extended lockdown till June 14 with some easing of restrictions.—Punjab has extended the coronavirus restrictions till June 10.—Uttar Pradesh has eased restrictions in 71 districts.

06-06-2021||Hailakandi/Aizawl||Tension along Assam-Mizoram border as 2 houses burned down||Two abandoned houses along the Mizoram-Assam border have been burned down by unidentified persons, fuelling tension along the volatile inter-state border, police said on Sunday.Both the states claimed that the incident took place inside their territory on Friday night but no casualty was reported as the houses were empty.While Assam put the blame on “miscreants from Mizoram”, the neighbouring state pointed the accusing finger at “Bangladeshi immigrants who wanted to flare up the border dispute”.Hailakandi district Superintendent of Police Ramandeep Kaur claimed that besides burning down the two empty houses belonging to Ali Hussain and Saidul Islam, miscreants from Mizoram have also erected a structure 300 metre inside Assam’s territory near Gutguti area in the district.An investigation is underway to ascertain the identity of the miscreants involved in the incidents and cases have been registered, she said.Security has been beefed-up in the area and patrolling has been intensified, the SP said.The matter has been taken up with higher-level authorities in Mizoram and hopefully, the issue will be resolved soon, Kaur said.Kaur, along with Hailakandi Deputy Commissioner Rohan Kumar Jha and Ramnathpur police station officer-in-charge Liton Nath visited the area to review the prevailing situation.The location falls under the inner-line reserve forest area and is very difficult to reach from the Assam side, she said.Vanlalfaka Ralte, the SP of Mizoram’s Kolasib district, however, claimed that the abandoned houses were located in Zophai area near Bairabi town in the district.“The houses, abandoned since February this year, were earlier occupied by non-tribals hired by Mizos to look after their paddy fields.“We suspect that the burning of the houses was a political ploy by Bangladeshi immigrants to revive the border issue between the two neighbouring states,” he told PTI.The area where the incident took place is within the territory of Mizoram and not within the inner line reserved forest area, he said, adding that the owners of the field have land pattas (documents) in Mizoram and pay land taxes to the state government.A case has been registered with the Bairabi police station and a manhunt launched to nab the accused.Since October last year, there have been frequent incidents of burning of houses, allegations of land encroachment and even a bomb blast inside a closed school along the 164.6-km-long Mizoram-Assam border.The previous incident had taken place near Gallacherra border outpost, under which Gutguti falls, in February and since then, many residents had vacated their houses, Kaur added.

06-06-2021||New Delhi||Southwest Monsoon covers the entire northeast: IMD||Advancing further, the Southwest Monsoon covered the northeast region, nearly four days after its normal date, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.The Southwest Monsoon made an onset over Kerala, which marks the beginning of the four-month rainfall season, on June 3 after a delay of two days.In a span of three days it has covered entire Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.“Southwest Monsoon has further advanced into more parts of central Arabian Sea, some more parts of Maharashtra, entire Karnataka, some more parts of Telengana, entire Tamil Nadu, some more parts of Andhra Pradesh, more parts of central Bay of Bengal and northeast Bay of Bengal and hence the entire northeastern states of India (Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh), most parts of Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim today, 6th June 2021,” the IMD said.Monsoon covers different parts of the northeast from June 3 to 10. For instance, its normal date to reach Agartala, Aizawl, Shillong and Imphal is June 1 and Gangtok in Sikkim is June 10.However, the progress is going to slow over the next two days, June 7 and 8, the IMD said.The activity is expected to pick up after that due to a cyclonic circulation that is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal. This will also help the monsoon cover Odisha, Jharkhand, parts of West Bengal and Bihar by June 15, it said.Monsoon is expected to be normal this season as well as in June, a month critical for sowing. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/southwest-monsoon-covers-the-entire-northeast-imd-264414

They are not even gangsters,” the Additional Sessions Judge stated in an order dated June 5.He further said that the plea is not required at this stage as the accused are not being produced in the court physically due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The judge also noted the replies submitted by the Superintendent of Mandoli and Tihar jail, Additional DCP (Special Cell) and DCP of third battalion of Delhi Police, on the plea.The DCP told the court that in the aftermath of an attempt made by armed assailants to free an undertrial prisoner at GTB Hospital, the police had decided to request the court for permission to handcuff high-risk prisoners who are prone to escape.“As part of the exercise, the current application for handcuffing UTPs Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi was moved for the consideration of Hon’ble Court,” the senior police officer stated in a reply submitted to the court on April 26.However, in the reply given by the Additional DCP of Special Cell, it was stated that no such application seeking to produce both the accused in handcuffs, was filed before any court or other authority.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/they-are-not-gangsters-court-rejects-plea-to-produce-umar-khalid-khalid-saifi-in-handcuffs-264412

06-06-2021||New Delhi||Phase II clinical trial of Niclosamide drug for treatment of Covid-19 patients begins||The CSIR and Laxai Life Sciences Private Limited have initiated phase II clinical trials of anti-helminitic drug ‘Niclosamide' for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, a statement said on Sunday.The trial is a multi-centric, randomised, open label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Niclosamide for treating hospitalised Covid-19 patients.Niclosamide has been extensively used in the past for treating tapeworm infection in adults as well as children. The safety profile of this drug has been tested over time and has been found safe for human consumption at different dose levels, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) said.Ram Vishwakarma, advisor to Director General CSIR, pointed out that in a screen to identify drugs that can inhibit syncytia formation, Niclosamide was identified as a promising repurposed drug by a research group from King's College London, which collaborated in this project.The syncytia or fused cells observed in the lungs of patients with novel coronavirus infection probably result from the fusogenic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Niclosamide can inhibit this syncytia formation.Independently, a collaborative research between CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM), Jammu and the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru had recently demonstrated that Niclosamide was also a potential SARS-CoV2 entry inhibitor, blocking the viral entry through pH dependent endocytic pathway.Given these two independent experimental studies, Niclosamide has now emerged as a promising drug candidate for clinical trial in Covid-19 patients.Srivari Chandrashekhar, director, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) Hyderabad highlighted that the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) is being made by Laxai Life Sciences based on improved technology developed at IICT and the lab is a partner in this important clinical trial which could provide cost-effective therapeutic options for patients if the ongoing trial is successful.Ram Upadhayaya, CEO, Laxai Life Sciences noted that realising the potential of Niclosamide, efforts were initiated last year itself to undertake the clinical trials.Having received approval from drug regulators, the clinical trial has been initiated this week at different sites and is expected to be completed within 8-12 weeks, the CSIR said.Based on successful clinical evidence generated during the clinical trials in Indian studies, emergency use authorisation may be sought so that more treatment options are available to Covid-19 patients, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/phase-ii-clinical-trial-of-niclosamide-drug-for-treatment-of-covid-19-patients-begins-264404
06-06-2021|| Hyderabad||Boy dies after falling in open drain||Open drain has taken the life of a seven-year-old boy in Hyderabad. The tragedy happened late last night in the Bowenpally area after workers left a drain open after cleaning work. Due to darkness Anand Sai accidentally slipped and fell into the gutter and drowned. The incident took place around 9:40 pm. The absence of the boy was discovered and when some passers-by noticed the boy shouting for help. It took about three hours for the boy to be taken out, by which time he was already dead. People said all efforts to retrieve the boy failed as the water flow in the drain was heavy due to the rain. Bowenpally Inspector K Ravi Kumar said the body was retrieved around 12.30 am with the joint effort of the police and firefighters. He said a case had been registered against Ramu contractor for negligence under section 304 part II (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code. Residents have accused the Secunderabad Cantonment Board of negligence, saying that no wall was erected around the drain before other maintenance and construction was undertaken last month. The locals said that they had warned the contractor and the local councilor of the danger, but they ignored the warning.  Open drains pose a considerable danger in monsoon seas as they are left open to facilitate water flow. A 12-year-old girl had fallen into an open drain in a similar incident while cycling in Neredmet, Hyderabad. Though initially suspected that the girl could have been abducted, her body was found a day later in a lake 2 km away.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/boy-dies-after-falling-in-open-drain-264403

06-06-2021||New Delhi||9.27 lakh severely acute malnourished children identified till November last year: RTI||More than 9.2 lakh children in India are ‘severely acute malnourished’, with the most in Uttar Pradesh followed by Bihar, according to  government data, underscoring concerns that the Covid pandemic could exacerbate the health and nutrition crisis among the poorest of the poor.An estimated 9,27,606 ‘severely acute malnourished’ children from six months to six years were identified across the country till November last year, the Women and Child Development Ministry said in response to an RTI query from PTI.Of these, Uttar Pradesh counted for 3,98,359 and Bihar 2,79,427, according to the figures shared by the ministry. Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Nagaland, Manipur and Madhya Pradesh reported no severely malnourished children.Except for Ladakh, none of the anganwadi centres in the other four, including Madhya Pradesh, one of India’s largest states, reported any data on the matter, according to the RTI reply.The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines ‘severe acute malnutrition’ (SAM) by very low weight-for-height or a mid-upper arm circumference less than 115 mm, or by the presence of nutritional oedema. Children suffering from SAM have very low weight for their height, and are nine times more likely to die in case of diseases due to their weakened immune system.The Women and Child Development Ministry had last year asked all states and union territories to identify SAM children for their early referral to hospitals. The figure of 9,27,606 came following that exercise.The worry is that the numbers could not just be an underestimation but also rise in view of the ongoing pandemic with fears that the third wave could impact children more than others.“There is rise in unemployment, there is rise in an economic crisis which is bound to have repercussions on hunger and when there is hunger there will be malnutrition. The government has a clear cut protocol and they need to ramp that up,” Enakshi Ganguly, co-founder of the HAQ Center for Child Rights, told PTI.While Uttar Pradesh and Bihar top the list for SAM children, they are also home to the highest number of children in the country. According to 2011 census data, Uttar Pradesh has 2,97,28,235 (2.97 crore/29.72 million) children aged 0-6 years while Bihar has 1,85,82,229 (1.85 crore/18.5 million).     According to the RTI response, Maharashtra reported 70,665 SAM children followed by Gujarat at 45,749, Chhattisgarh at 37,249, Odisha at 15,595, Tamil Nadu at 12,489, Jharkhand at 12,059, Andhra Pradesh at 11,201, Telangana at 9,045, Assam at 7,218, Karnataka at 6,899, Kerala at 6,188 and Rajasthan at 5,732.The identification of SAM children was done by over 10 lakh Anganwadi centres from across the country.Ganguly stressed on the role of anganwadi centres in helping improve the nutrition status of the children.“The anganwadis have to become much more functional and if the possibility of children reaching anganwadis is going to become hard because of lockdowns, then the anganwadis need to reach the children. So what are the plans for that?”  she asked.“Malnutrition will be a huge comorbidity… if what they are saying that children will be affected more in the next wave holds true, then malnutrition will be a huge comorbidity and how are they going to address that?” Dola Mohapatra, executive director, Rise Against Hunger India, agreed that COVID-19 could further exacerbate the situation with shrinking food diversity and low intake combined with episodes of missing food at times.He said solutions have to be both home-based care and facility-based care.“Since SAM has direct connection with food availability, utilisation and awareness – the immediate task is to appropriately build linkages with the government systems to ensure families receive not just ration/food, but required education and support,” he said.“COVID-19 has been a big impediment in organising community based interventions, so new ways/methods to disseminate info to the mothers and caregivers have to be found out,” he said.Mohapatra also stressed on the need to strengthen Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs) which are meant to treat SAM cases “There are studies that suggest that NRCs have not been very effective.  In many cases, we have seen that SAM cases have been discharged early because either the centre could not continue to keep the same case for a continued period, or the caregivers could not stay for a longer duration at the facility, or there was simply not enough supervision by the higher ups.” He also stressed on the need for designing customised menus in consultation with experts for SAM cases and formulating guidelines.“For administrative and operational convenience, as well as for better accountability, SAM cases could be segregated into smaller units and responsibility to manage/coordinate and monitor smaller units could be handed over to independent entities such as medical colleges, local NGOs, women’s collectives – under the overall guidance of the District/Block health staff,” Mohapatra said.While data is not updated year on year, the last available figure of SAM children is from NFHS-4 (National Family Health Survey) in 2015-16 according to which prevalence of severe acute malnutrition among children was reported at 7.4 per cent.  NFHS-4 gathered information from 601,509 households, 699,686 women, and 112,122 men. Information on 265,653 children below age 5 has been collected in the survey    NFHS-5, released in December last year, which gave figures for 22 states and UTs also presented a grim scenario. It said malnutrition increased among children in 2019-20 from 2015-16 in 22 states and UTs.Around 13 states and UTs out of the 22 surveyed recorded a rise in percentage of children under five years who are stunted in comparison to 2015-16; 12 states and UTs recorded a rise in percentage of children under five years who are wasted; 16 states and UTs recorded a rise in the percentage of children under five years who are severely wasted and underweight in 2019-20. The NFHS-5 was conducted on 6.1 lakh sample households.Wasting is low weight for their height among children, reflecting acute undernutrition. Wasting is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five years of age.To tackle high persistence of malnutrition in the country, the Centre launched the Poshan Abhiyan programme in 2018 to reduce low birth weight, stunting and undernutrition and anaemia among children, adolescent girls and women.

In contrast, four of the 20 high under-five mortality countries allow vaccination of pregnant women, while none include them in the preferential group. India and Indonesia, with one fifth of world's population, fall in both the groups but do not include pregnant women for vaccination.Many organisations have represented the government for inclusion of pregnant women for inoculation.Last month, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has moved the Supreme Court against the January 14 advisory of the Union government excluding pregnant and lactating women from vaccination.Arguing for prioritisation, the report said pregnant women experience more severe Covid-19 disease than non-pregnant women. They are more likely to require hospitalization, admission to ICU, receive invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation when compared with non-pregnant women, it said, adding, there is a 70 per cent  increased risk of death among symptomatic pregnant women as compared to non-pregnant ones.  Women who get coronavirus infection while pregnant, experience a higher maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, it added. Observing that Covid vaccination in pregnancy has dual benefit, it said, both the mother and newborn get antibodies which have been demonstrated in cord blood and breast milk. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-prioritise-pregnant-women-for-covid-19-vaccination-report-264386
06-06-2021||New Delhi||Amid Covid curbs, 27 lakh caught without ticket on trains in 2020-21; cases down to 25 pc of 2019-20||Despite severe restrictions on entry at railway stations without confirmed tickets in view of the coronavirus pandemic, over 27 lakh people were caught travelling on trains ticketless in the last fiscal, an RTI query has revealed.This was, however, less than 25 per cent of the number of cases recorded the previous financial year and that is attributable to the restrictions imposed to check the Covid-19 contagion, say officials.The data made available by the Railway Board following an RTI query made by Madhya Pradesh-based activist Chandra Shekhar Gaur showed that between April 2020 and March 2021, 27.57 lakh people were caught travelling ticketless and Rs 143.82 crore was levied as a fine from them.In the 2019-2020 fiscal, 1.10 crore people were caught travelling ticketless and in total, a fine of Rs 561.73 crore was realized from them."Travelling ticketless or with an unauthorised ticket is a long-standing challenge before the Indian Railways. On its part, the Railways makes informative, educative and punitive measures to discourage people from doing the same," said Railway spokesperson D J Narain.The 2020-2021 financial year was the period when the Railways ran the least number of passenger trains in its history due to the coronavirus pandemic and there were severe restrictions on the movement of people inside railway premises, including non-issuance of platform tickets.It includes the lockdown period between April 14 and May 3 when the Railways was not operating any passenger trains except the Shramik Specials which started from May 1. These trains were run at the request of the state governments and the tickets were issued only to those authorised by the states.In June last year, the Railways began running special trains and issued strict guidelines -- e-ticketing through IRCTC website or through mobile App, no tickets booking at reservation counter, only passengers with confirmed tickets to be allowed entry at station and screening to be done before boarding with only asymptomatic passengers allowed to enter the train.Fully waitlisted passengers and unreserved passengers were not allowed to travel on trains as the unreserved coaches were booked as reserved second sitting coaches to ensure that the necessary Covid-related protocols are followed."Accordingly, in line with these instructions, without ticket passengers at railway premises and trains were being identified and charged as part of normal as well as special ticket checking drives."The number of without ticket cases in 2020-21 (27.57 lakh) was less than 25 per cent of the number of such cases detected in 2019-20  when such figure was 1.10 crore. This was feasible due to wide publicity efforts by railways to create awareness and to discourage irregular travel," Narain said.Currently, the Railways is running 809 special Mail Express trains on an average per day, 2,891 suburban services, 26 special trains being operated as clones of highly patronised trains and 403 passenger services. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-covid-curbs-27-lakh-caught-without-ticket-on-trains-in-2020-21-cases-down-to-25-pc-of-2019-20-264381

Security environment is seriously compromised. In such a grim situation called upon (the) Chief Secretary to brief me on the law and order situation on Monday 7th June and indicate all steps taken to contain post poll violence,” he tweeted on Sunday.The governor also alleged that people who have voted against the ruling TMC are victims of “targeted violence”.“The state is in (the) grip of unprecedented post poll retributive violence at unimaginable scale, with lacs of people being displaced and property worth hundreds of crores vandalised. Rampant vandalism and hooliganism has resulted in large scale arson, loot, destruction of property.“Numerous instances of rapes and killings at the hands of rogue elements who have no fear of law (sic),” he stated.Condemning alleged incidents of socially boycott and denial of benefits to people who had voted for TMC rivals, he said they are being made to pay extortion fees for living in their own house or running their own business.“Democratic values are openly shredded and trampled by ruling party harmads. People are in mortal fear of police and that in turn is at the feet of ruling party rogue elements,” he wrote on his Twitter handle.He maintained that state functionaries “are not recognising this malaise, much less take steps to contain it”.“Police is engaged as extension of ruling dispensation to let loose vindictiveness on political opponents. In such a grim situation Chief Secretary of the state be called upon to brief me urgently on Monday 7th June and indicate all steps taken to contain post poll violence,” Dhankhar, who has always been at loggerheads with the TMC government, added.Slamming the governor over his contentions, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said Dhankhar devalued his post.“He devalued the chair of the governor and worked as an agent of the BJP during elections. Now that people have rejected them (BJP), he is trying to complicate things unnecessarily. He has no importance and lost his mind totally.He is an insatiable soul,” Ghosh told PTI.Moitra, addressing Dhankhar as ‘uncle-ji’, said he should go back to Delhi.“Uncleji only way WB’s ‘grim situation’ will improve is if you move your sorry self back to Delhi & find another job,” Moitra tweeted.She also suggested he should work as an “advisor to Ajay Bisht Yogi CM (Uttar Pradesh) on how best to ‘Thok Do’ (silence) opposition or advisor to Home Min (minister) on how best to hide during a pandemic”.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wb-guv-expresses-concern-over-grim-law-and-order-situation-tmcs-mohua-maitra-lashes-out-264380

The fruit has been priced between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 per piece. Bookings have already been done for these mangoes,” Shivraj Singh Jadhav, a mango cultivator from Katthiwada, told PTI.He said people who have booked ‘Noorjahan’ mangoes in advance include fruit lovers from Madhya Pradesh as well as neighbouring Gujarat.“This time the weight of a Noorjahan mango is going to be between 2 kg to 3.5 kg,” Jadhav added.Ishaq Mansoori, an expert in cultivating ‘Noorjahan’ mangoes in Katthiwada, said, “This time the crop of this variety has been good but the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the business.”He said ‘Noorjahan’ trees could not flower properly due to unfavourable climatic conditions in 2020.“In 2019, one mango of this variety weighed around 2.75 kg at an average and buyers paid as high as Rs 1,200 apiece for it,” he added.The ‘Noorjahan’ variety produces fruits towards the beginning of June. These trees start flowering in January- February.A ‘Noorjahan’ mango can grow up to a foot long and its kernels weigh between 150 to 200 gm, local cultivators claimed.

A notification to this effect was issued on Friday night.“The state government is taking a calculated risk and hence people have to take care of themselves. Nothing is going to be eased immediately. Some criteria and levels have been fixed and the local administration will take decisions on whether to ease restrictions and further tighten them,” the chief minister said.As per the ‘unlock’ notification, areas with a positivity rate of five per cent or less and oxygen bed occupancy of less than 25 per cent will be in the first category, and can open up completely.Whereas in the fifth category areas, with a positivity rate of more than 20 per cent, only essential shops will remain open and office attendance will be capped at 15 per cent.During the meeting, Thackeray also said that the state should set an example before the country by showing that the industrial sector can function uninterrupted by following all COVID-19 norms during restrictions.“We should not let ourselves be knocked down by the virus,” he said.“Neither a lockdown is required nor do we want to get knocked down by the virus. So all health related rules have to be followed,” Thackeray added.He said if there is a need to go for another lockdown after the possible third wave, there should be no impact on manufacturing.“Industries should set up temporary accommodations in their premises for their staff and employees. The planning process should begin now,” he said.Prominent among those who participated in the meetingincluded Uday Kotak, Sanjiv Bajaj, B Thiyagrajan, Naushad Forbes, Amit Kalyan,Ashok Hinduja, A N Subramanyam, Ajay Piramal, Harsh Goenka, Niranjan Hiranandani, along with the state government’s COVID-19 task force members Sanjay oak and Shashank Joshi.A statement from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said the industrialists present at the meeting welcomed the criteria of positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy to ease restrictions and the levels fixed.They said awareness should be created about this among people, and also offered help in checking the spread of corona virus in rural areas.They suggested that members of the unorganised sector should be vaccinated and the IT sector professionals should be allowed to continue working from home .Their other suggestions include vaccination of not just employees of the industrial sector, but also their families. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-government-taking-calculated-risk-uddhav-thackeray-on-easing-of-curbs-264376
06-06-2021||Kochi||Lakshadweep admin issues new order to deploy govt officials in fishing boats||Amid protests by islanders against its "reform" measures, the Lakshadweep island administration has taken a set of decisions, including deputing government officials onboard local fishing boats for intelligence gathering.The administration also issued a new order on managing cleanliness and hygiene, on June 4, directing the people of the islands to scientifically dispose of the tender coconut shell, tree leaves, coconut husk, coconut shell, trunk etc in and around dwelling and public places.Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal attacked the administration for its new directives, terming them as a "mockery" and urged the authorities to withdraw them immediately.It was on May 28, a meeting chaired by Principal Secretary cum Advisor to the Administrator decided to depute responsible government servants onboard local fishing boats for intelligence gathering.The meeting also decided to strengthen the security measures to monitor the local fishing boats and crews, intensify checking of passenger boats and vessels reaching the islands and strengthen the ship berthing points and helibase by installing CCTV cameras.The administration later gave direction to officials concerned to initiate action as per decisions taken on the meeting.He questioned the practicality of implementing the order, saying there are hundreds of fishing boats operating from the islands and how many officials are going to be deployed in such vessels.Noting that a well established system of surveillance by the Navy and the Coast Guard was already in place in all the islands, the MP said the Coast Guard headquarter in islands have an effective radar system which can cover activities of any vessels operating in 30 nautical mile areas.Faizal said every month or once in three months Coast Guard is having regular interaction with the local fishermen to train them on how to report the movement of suspected objects in the seas."All this training is given to the fishermen. They are very cooperative with the security agencies. By introducing such a law, what are they (administration) trying to establish?" he asked.Faizal alleged thatthe administration's actions showed that they donot believe the innocent fishermen community of Lakshadweep."The recent order, which has come in the way of surveillance on the coastal areas of Lakshadweep, is really a mockery .. I feel", he told PTI.Alleging discrimination, he asked why such surveillance using officials onboard fishing vessels were not happening in coastal states like Gujarat, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.Issuing the order on hygiene and cleanliness, the administration said whoever violates or contravenes any of the directions shall be liable for punishment with fine as per Schedule I of the Lakshadweep Solid Waste Management Bye-Law, 2018 and also be liable to criminal proceedings for offence punishable under Section 188 of IPC.Questioning the provision in the order directing scientific disposal of biodegradable materials like coconut leaves, Faizal said the land of Lakshadweep became fertile because the forefathers who lived in the islands buried them in the soil.He also said it is the responsibility of the administration to provide technology for scientifically managing the waste.Asked whether he had taken up the matter with the Union Government, Faizal said, "I feel really ashamed of taking up such matters with them".Meanwhile, the Congress has decided to step up its agitation against the administration for its "anti-people" reform measures in the islands.According to party sources, the MPs from the Congress- led UDF in Kerala will organise a 'dharna' in front of the territorial administration office in Kochi on Monday.Expressing solidarity with the people of Lakshadweep, the Kerala Legislative Assembly has unanimously passed a resolution demanding the recall of island administrator Praful Khoda Patel and requesting the Centres immediate intervention to protect the lives and livelihood of the islanders.An archipelago located in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep has been witnessing protests by locals for over the recent actions and administrative reforms being implemented by Patel.Defending its action, the Lakshadweep administration has said it was laying the foundation for the future of islands in a planned way and to develop it on the lines of Maldives in two decades. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakshadweep-admin-issues-new-order-to-deploy-govt-officials-in-fishing-boats-264371

06-06-2021||Vijayawada||Andhra hospital treats newborn for rare Covid multi-system inflammatory syndrome||In what is believed to be the world's first reported case, a newborn diagnosed with Covid multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MISC) with abnormal skin lesions, has been successfully treated by a team of doctors at the Andhra Hospitals here.PV Rama Rao, chief of the children's services at Andhra Hospitals, said: "The condition was diagnosed as neonatal 'Purpura fulminans', a very rare condition symptomised by extensive skin lesions during the newborn period. However, this newborn baby was suffering from the rare skin condition, in combination with neonatal MIS-C is presumably the first reported case in the world, as extensive literature search showed no reported cases till now."The seven-day-old infant was admitted to Andhra Hospitals, neonatal intensive care unit on May 21, with a history of skin manifestations and fever. The child was afflicted with black, red, and bluish-tinged skin lesions on back of the abdomen, buttocks and legs at 16 hours of life and the condition worsened over the next three to four days.With the mother not reporting any significant health problems or fever during pregnancy and the entire pregnancy was uneventful, doctors  feel she had possibly been covid asymptomatic.However, while both mother and child had a negative RT-PCR test, Covid IgG antibodies were positive in both of them, suggestive of transplacental transmission of antibodies from mother to the child.Transplacental vertical transmission of Covid antibodies from mother to baby is very rarely described in literature. There  are very few reported cases in the world, presented with clinical manifestations suggestive of neonatal multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC).Blood investigations in the baby showed high white blood cell count, rise in inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, other markers showed marked rise such as ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, NT - ProBNP, IL6 & low protein C level.  NT pro BNP increase suggested some cardiac dysfunction such as cardiac failure.A team comprising Dr Bhoojata, Dr Revanth, Dr Krishnaprasad, Dr Meghana and Dr Balakrishna helped treat the newborn with Immunoglobulins, steroids & blood thinners such as heparin, following which the fever has subsided, and the child is feeding well. The paediatric surgeon performed surgical debridement of the skin lesions which have started healing.Rama Rao said that they are submitting their findings to Lancet, the peer-reviewed medical journal. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-hospital-treats-newborn-for-rare-covid-multi-system-inflammatory-syndrome-264363

Legal action will be taken immediately against @amazonca," he tweeted on Saturday.The Minister had directed for similar action against Google following uproar last week against a search result showed Kannada as India's "ugliest language", but later decided against going ahead with it, as the tech giant tendered an apology.Terming it an insult to the government, JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy has asked the government to look into possibilities of taking action against Amazon, and it was necessary to stop the recurrence of such things in future.He also demanded that Amazon should apologise to Kannadigas.The bikini had the colours of the unofficial state's flag, in hues of yellow and red, and has the state's emblem 'Gandaberunda', a two-headed mythological bird, which now seems to have been removed by Amazon from its Canada site following uproar.There was no immediate comment from Amazon. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amazon-under-fire-after-bikini-having-colours-of-karnataka-flag-emblem-on-sale-264360

It was a personal meeting,” Singh said.Backing the embattled chief minister, Singh said the Uttar Pradesh government and the party’s organisation are going strong.“The strongest organisation and most popular government are working in UP,” Singh said.However, observers are reading much into the meeting given the hectic political developments in the state over the past few days, especially after accusations of “mismanagement” against Adityanath in the second wave of coronavirus. It also follows a string of meetings by BJP’s ideological fountainhead, the RSS, in the capital. Though Sangh functionaries described them as preparations for an upcoming annual meeting, sources say discussions were held around the Covid situation in poll-bound states, including Uttar Pradesh where elections are due in March 2022.Also on the agenda was resolving the political crisis created due to “differences” between Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over former Gujarat-cadre IAS officer Arvind Kumar Sharma. The chief minister is believed to have refused to accommodate Sharma in any top post in the state, though “he was willing for a minister of state post (for Sharma)”.Observers also say that any meeting with Anandiben Patel cannot be a routine one. “She is the Governor, has been the CM and understands the situation well,” they say.It remains to be seen whether Sharma will be accommodated in the Cabinet but before visiting the Raj Bhavan Singh also met state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh. Earlier, Singh and BJP general secretary (organization) BL Santhosh met several state leaders in Lucknow and backed Adityanath, describing him as "hardworking and efficient" to dispel speculations surrounding his future.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-uttar-pradesh-in-charge-meets-state-governor-says-no-plans-for-cabinet-rejig-264344
06-06-2021||Ranchi||Leopards now rein in tigers' Palamu abode, once credited with world’s 1st tiger census||Leopards now rein in Palamu’s Tiger Reserve, known globally for undertaking the world’s first census for big cats in 1932.Bizarre as it may sound, the fact is that a reserve that once took pride in its tiger populace is now a safe haven for about 150 leopards. Tourists these days flock Palamu Tiger Reserve to have glimpses with leaps of leopards, say officials, who add that no tiger has been sighted since a tigress was found dead in February 2020 near Betla National Park.“We now have about 150 leopard population, which has become an attraction for tourists coming to Palamu ...Happy tourists are often seen taking photographs with the leopards...However, we are making all efforts to facilitate the return of the tigers,” Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF) and Project Director, PTR YK Das told PTI.Attributing “left-wing extremism activities, movement of security personnel, increased human encroachment and depleting prey bases in core and buffer zones of the reserve spread across about 1130 square km” as the main reasons behind the big cats abandoning their former safe haven and migrating to forests in neighbouring Chhattisgarh and Odisha, Das said restoration of prey base among other measures were on to lure them back.He said that though no tigers were detected in the last All India Tiger Estimation, one tigress was found dead in PTR in February 2020 which establishes that tiger used to be there.A census taken nearly a decade ago had revealed one male tiger and five females lived there.“We are working on a relocation project to preserve PTR’s ecology and improve its prey base to facilitate the return of tigers. Initially, we will be relocating inhabitants of two villages—Latu and Kujrum to outside PTR...The relocation project involves a 300 square km area, which is human infested. We will be relocating 22 families of these two villages, who have agreed to it,” Das said.The plan is to provide a family unit of either Rs 15 lakh for relocation or Rs 10 lakh and 5 acres of land in areas with roads and other facilities, he said. The project is being implemented at a cost of Rs 26 crore.A total of eight villages—Kujrum, Latu, Ramandag, Hainar, Gutucha,Vijaypur, Gopkhad and Pandra have been identified for relocation to places outside the tiger reserve with Latu and Kurjum being taken up in phase one.Of the 1129.93 sq km area of PTR, 414.08 sq km is marked as core area (critical tiger habitat) and the rest 715.85 sq km as buffer area. Of the total area, 226.32 sq.km is designated as Betla national park. In the buffer zone, 53 sq km is marked as a tourist zone.Palamau was declared a protected forest reserve in 1973-74 when Project Tiger was launched. Project Tiger was launched to try and stem the fall in numbers of Indias national animal. It aimed to address depletion of tiger habitats and rectify damages to them to help preserve the countrys tiger population.The reserve, according to information, recorded its highest tiger population in 1995 with 71 big cats but since then their population has been dwindling with only three recorded in 2014 and as per the recent it had no tigers.The Palamau Tiger Reserve, located at a distance of about 170 km from state capital Ranchi via Latehar, consists mainly of Sal forests, mixed deciduous forests and bamboo groves. The reserve zone is the watershed area for three important rivers Koel, Burha and Auranga.The Palamau Tiger Reserve was one of the first 9 tiger reserves created in the country at inception of Project Tiger and has the distinction of being the first sanctuary in the world in which a tiger census was carried out based on pugmark count, as early as 1932 under the supervision of JW Nicholson, the then DFO, Palamau.Apart from leopards it boasts of elephants, grey wolf, gaur, sloth bear, four- horned antelope, Indian ratel, Indian otter and Indian pangolin among its inhabitants.In total, 47 species of mammals and 174 species of birds have been identified, according to officials who said that apart from these, a total of 970 species of plants, 17 species of grass and 56 species of medicinal plants have also been identified.

The market for agriculture (is) just working normally everywhere," he argued.The Niti Aayog member noted that income from the agriculture sector, which is a major source of earning for rural people, is intact. "So that large segment of rural income, ...it is remaining intact and rural demand on that count will not be affected," he opined.Chand added that only in case of some services which are not working in rural area, there is an issue."I would say that the government should keep its emphasis on MGNREGA," Chand suggested.The Niti Aayog member, however, admitted that remittance from urban areas that has been going to rural areas and aiding rural demand will fall.On being asked why India is not self-sufficient in pulses production, he said there is need to increase pulses area under irrigation and that will make a lot of difference in production and stability in prices.He added that "in India, our subsidy policy, our price policy, technology policy, have remained too much in favour of rice and wheat and sugarcane. So I strongly believe that along with the technological breakthrough, we need to make our procurement, our MSP favourable for pulses".Chand pointed out that pulses are not like edible oil that can be imported in big quantity from outside the country as pulses are available in international markets in small quantities.Asked whether the government was considering reduction in import duty of edible oils, he said the main reason for the increase in edible oils prices is the rise in international rates and it's not that India's output is low."I feel that if prices (of edible oils) do not come under control then the government has a lot of cushion and that cushion is that duty rate on import should be reduced," Chand said.The Niti Aayog member pointed out that whenever price of a commodity rises, then the government reduces import duty on that commodity and when price falls, then it increases import duty.In this year's budget, the government has put this big surcharge which raised duty on oilseeds to a very high level, he said, adding that many people look at only import duty, but they are not looking at effective duty."So though, import duty on edible oils, you will find is low, in some cases it is 10 per cent, and in some cases it is 15 per cent. But there is another 15 per cent kind of thing as a surcharge which raised the effective duty, which I would say is high in the present circumstances," Chand observed.The Niti Aayog member asserted India or any other country for price stabilisation follows duty policy that is countercyclical."So, since international prices (of edible oils) are rising...then without affecting our farmers you can ensure that when imports land in India, they do not land at cheaper rates... "...therefore there is a scope for the government that even if they lower the duty, the landed price is not lower because international prices are high," he argued.As per the government data, the retail prices of edible oils have risen by more than 60 per cent in over a year and are adding to the woes of consumers, who are already reeling under the economic distress induced by the Covid-19 pandemic.India meets 60 per cent of edible oil demand through imports.To a question on farm sector growth, Chand said the agriculture sector will grow more than 3 per cent in 2021-22.The farm sector grew at 3.6 per cent in the last fiscal. India's economy contracted by less-than-expected 7.3 per cent in the fiscal year ended March 2021 after growth rate picked up in the fourth quarter, just before the world's worst outbreak of coronavirus infections hit the country.India is currently at the centre of global Covid-19 pandemic and from a daily case count of over 4 lakh, the number of new Covid-19 cases are rapidly dropping.India reported 1,14,460 new coronavirus infections, the lowest in 60 days, while the daily positivity rate further dropped to 5.62 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/second-covid-19-wave-not-to-impact-indias-agri-sector-in-any-way-niti-aayog-264333

06-06-2021||Aligarh (UP)||Key accused in May 28 Aligarh hooch case arrested||The key accused in the last month’s Aligarh hooch incident, which has claimed at least 35 lives so far, was nabbed in the early hours of Sunday, police said.Accused Rishi Sharma, who carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his arrest, was held near Bulandshahr border in western Uttar Pradesh, Aligarh Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kalanidhi Naithani said.Sharma, whom the police described as the kingpin of the liquor mafia, was named in 13 different cases connected to the recent liquor tragedy, and was nabbed this morning on the Aligarh-Bulandshshar border as he was about to slip out of the district after being holed up in his hideouts since the past nine days.On Saturday, the police had raised the bounty on Sharma from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh.His wife, son, two brothers and a nephew were arrested in the last five days.The search for Sharma was extended to half a dozen neighbouring states and several districts, where he had his network.The police were tracking over 500 cell phone numbers belonging to his close circle. Police were tipped off on Saturday night that Sharma would be travelling to Bulandshshar in an SUV.He was nabbed in his vehicle, which was carrying a large cache of spurious liquor, police said.Nearly 50 people have died in Aligarh since consuming spurious liquor on two different occasions recently, according to police, while officials estimated that the death toll could go up to 100 as autopsy reports of another 50 hooch consumers were awaited.“In a major breakthrough in the hooch incident, key accused and Rs 1 lakh rewardee Rishi Sharma has been arrested from near Bulandshahr border,” Naithani said.“Earlier, the police had arrested accused Vipin Yadav, with Rs 50,000 reward on his arrest, and Rishi Sharma’s brother Munish Sharma carrying a bounty of Rs 25,000 in this case,” the SSP said.The district police chief said so far 17 FIRs have been lodged and 61 accused arrested in Aligarh over the deaths of people after consuming spurious liquor.Multiple police teams, he said, have carried out investigation and searches in six states since the case came to light while a crackdown on the liquor mafia also started in Aligarh.Nine people died after consuming spurious liquor found dumped in a canal near Rohera village in Jawan area, officials said on Friday.Another man died on Friday in Aligarh’s Kodiyagunj village and officials link it with the same stock of liquor found in the canal near Rohera village on June 2 by some brick kiln workers.The 10 fatalities are apart from people killed in the first tragedy which broke out on May 28, in which 35 people are confirmed to have died of liquor poisoning.

These are very responsible persons and they earnestly treat one another with utmost respect. I believe that they will always arrive at a solution to any issue that they might face,’’ Putin said at a meeting with the world's 16 leading news agencies. “But it is important that no other extra-regional power is interfering with that,’’ he cautioned.India and China have been locked in a standoff on the border in eastern Ladakh with New Delhi calling for disengagement in order to further bilateral ties. Putin also said there were no “contradictions” preventing Russia from working with either India or China. Russia has created an environment in which both India and China can work within the framework of SCO and BRICS. "We are also cooperating at the UN,’’ he added.Putin’s observations come a month after he agreed with PM Modi's suggestion for a two-plus-two meeting of their Foreign and Defence Ministers, making Russia the first non-Quad country to have such a format with India.On Quad, Putin stressed that "no partnership should be aimed at making friends against anyone." Russia, he said, had "very deep profound relations with India based on trust’’ that had enabled joint work on advanced weapons systems and technologies.

Of the 425 Covishield and 90 Covaxin recipients, 98.1 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively, showed seropositivity. However, both seropositivity rate and average rise in anti-spike antibody was significantly higher in Covishield versus Covaxin recipients,” the study authors show.The study highlights the significance of speedy vaccination to avert a potential third wave of the pandemic, signalling the urgency of expanding the coverage, which is running low due to stock shortages of Covaxin and Covishield.While no difference was observed in relation to gender, body mass index, blood group and any comorbidities, people aged 60 years and above or those with type 2 diabetes had a significantly lower seropositivity rate, indicating a comparatively lower antibody response. The study also shows a good safety profile for both vaccines.“Both the vaccine recipients had similar solicited mild to moderate adverse events and none had severe or unsolicited side-effects. In conclusion, both vaccines elicited good immune response after two doses, although seropositivity rates and median anti-spike antibody titre was significantly higher in Covishield compared to Covaxin arm,” researcher AK Singh says.India has so far inoculated 43 per cent of its 60-plus people with one dose (the rates being as low as 35 per cent in Punjab, 39 in Telangana, and as high as 78 in Himachal Pradesh and 80 in Tripura).

The earlier target was 2030.The PM said 11 sectors had been identified to make good use of resources by recycling them through modern technology.“The action plan for ‘Kachra to kanchan campaign’, which will have all regulatory and development related aspects, will be implemented in coming months,” he said, addressing an event to mark World Environment Day organised by Ministries of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Environment, Forest and Climate Change.“India is setting an example to the world that it is not necessary to stop development to protect the environment,” the PM said.

These have been distributed now in over 212 countries,” Aylward said.“If we look at that 2 billion doses, over 75 per cent of it has gone to just 10 countries. And in fact three countries — China, the US and India — account for about 60 per cent of those doses,” he said.He said while Covax has played an important role in distributing the doses to 127 countries and getting several countries to start their vaccination drives, the challenge is in the access to the vaccines.He said the 60 per cent of the two billion doses that have gone to China, India and the US are “all domestically procured and used”. — PTIUS announces $57 mn aid for TB||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-india-china-account-for-60-of-2-bn-vax-doses-distributed-globally-263959

06-06-2021||Hyderabad||Decks cleared for import of Covaxin into Brazil; conditions apply||Brazil has given clearance to the proposal to import Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin into the South American country with some conditions.The National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil — Anvisa — had earlier denied permission to import Covaxin after authorities found that the Indian plant in which the jab was being made did not meet the good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements.The Brazilian health regulator also approved another proposal to import Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine into that country.According to Anvisa’s approval, Brazil is expected to receive four million doses of Covaxin initially.After using the authorised doses, the agency will analyse the data for monitoring the use of the vaccine in order to assess the next quantities to be imported.“Anvisa authorised this Friday the exceptional import of the Covaxin vaccine by the Ministry of Health for distribution and use under controlled conditions. The authorisation defined the amount of 4 million doses, which can be used only under specific conditions. The decision was taken at the 9th Extraordinary Public Meeting of the Collegiate Board,” it said in a statement in Portuguese.All batches to be destined for Brazil must have been manufactured after the adaptations of the GMP implemented by the manufacturer Bharat Biotech, according to the corrective and preventive action report (Corrective and Preventive Action - CAPA) presented to Anvisa, the regulator said narrating a slew of conditions for the importing of Covaxin.On February 26, Bharat Biotech Ltd had said it signed an agreement with the Brazilian government for the supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin during the second and third quarters of 2021.Bharat Biotech presented an adequate action plan and fulfilled all the pending issues related to the certification of GMP request, Anvisa said.Bharat Biotech, on May 25, filed new requests with Anvisa on the issues of GMP.Anvisa recently authorised the conduct of clinical trials of Covaxin in Brazil.Approval for tests on the immuniser developed in India will serve to assess the efficacy, safety and consistency between vaccine batches.Announcing the approval of Spuknik V by Brazil on its official twitter page, the Russian vaccine-manufacturer said, “#SputnikV will be used in Brazil following ANVISA’s approval. Brazil has become the 67th country in the world to authorise Sputnik V. The Sputnik V team fully answered all questions fromANVISA on the vaccine’s efficacy & safety.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/decks-cleared-for-import-of-covaxin-into-brazil-conditions-apply-263920
06-06-2021||Vijay Mohan||Army starts process of merging sub-area headquarters||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 5The Army has initiated the process of merging sub-area headquarters, which are static establishments located across the country, with headquarters of operational formations located in the same station or their vicinity.The move is part of the Army’s ongoing organisational restructuring to optimise its manpower and resources and its basis lies in the recommendations of a study group that was formed a few years ago to review the existing hierarchy.According to a circular sent to all Army Commands by the Staff Duties Directorate at Army Headquarters a few days ago, 13 sub-area headquarters are to be merged with the headquarters of co-located formations like corps.Sub-areas are commanded by officers of the rank of Major General, designated as General Officer Commanding (GOC), who reports to the area commander, a Lieutenant General. who in turn functions under the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Command in whose territorial jurisdiction the area lies.There are a few independent sub-areas, not reporting to an area, and some that are not co-located with a formation.Under the new hierarchical set-up, the GOC of a sub-area will be re-designated as Major General (Land, Works and Welfare) posted at corps headquarters, reporting to the corps commander instead of the area commander. Similarly, other officers and staff at sub-area headquarters will be adjusted at corps headquarters with new designations and modified charters of duties.A sub-area is a static formation which does not control any combat or operational elements but is mandated for providing administrative, logistical and infrastructural support to formations and establishments in its territorial jurisdiction. It is also responsible for local station matters, accommodation and welfare of ex-servicemen through station headquarters, besides being an interface with the local administration for providing aid to civil authorities in times of need.As an offshoot to the merger, station headquarters, which is responsible for managing the internal affairs of a particular military station, will now have a permanent station commander instead of the commander of the locally based operational formation like a brigade being the ex-officio station commander.As part of its reorganisation plans, two new posts at the level of Lieutenant General were created at Army Headquarters in December 2020. These are Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Strategy) and Director General Information Warfare.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-starts-process-of-merging-sub-area-headquarters-263910
06-06-2021||Naina Mishra||India witnessed two-fold increase in mucormycosis cases: CDC study||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 5A twofold rise in mucormycosis has been found in the first evidence-based multicentre study on Covid-19 Associated Mucormycosis (CAM) held in India between September and December last year, as compared to the same period in 2019.The study which took place in 16 centres of India, including PGIMER, Chandigarh, compared epidemiology and outcomes among cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19)–associated mucormycosis (CAM).Under the doctors at PGIMER, a study was conducted with the name of MucoCovi (Muco from mucormycosis, Covi from Covid-19) study at 16 centres across the country. The study results were published yesterday in the reputed Emerging Infectious Disease Journal (Journal of CDC, Atlanta, USA) as ‘Multicenter Epidemiologic Study of Coronavirus Disease associated Mucormycosis, India’. Among 287 mucormycosis patients, 187 (65.2%) had CAM; CAM prevalence was 0.27% among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The researchers noted a 2.1-fold rise in mucormycosis during the study period compared with September–December 2019.Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among CAM and non-CAM patients. The most common underlying disease among both CAM and non-CAM groups was uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (62.7%). COVID-19 was the only underlying disease in 32.6% of CAM patients.It was seen that on an average CAM diagnosis was made 18 days after Covid-19 infection. The most common sites of infection were found to be nose with eye involvement (in 58% cases) followed by nose with eye and brain involvement (27% cases) and then lung infection (9% cases). It shows a considerable number of patients reported late to the hospital after the disease progression to the brain. Besides facial pain, nasal blockage and discharge; toothache and loosening of teeth were seen in a high number of cases for the first time.On comparing the cases of CAM with mucormycosis without Covid-19 (i.e. Non-CAM) it was seen that uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease in both groups. In patients with CAM, newly detected diabetes mellitus was more frequent compared to non-CAM cases (20.9% versus 10%). This suggests the direct role of COVID-19 in causing or worsening diabetes, which may predispose these patients to mucormycosis.In fact, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis developed CAM early, in less than eight days of Covid-19. On the other hand, those patients who developed CAM later had mostly received steroid treatment. It was seen that inappropriate use of steroids (63.3%) i.e. either in very high doses or use in patients who did not need it was associated with development of late CAM, i.e. more than eight day after Covid-19 diagnosis.The overall death rate due to mucormycosis (both CAM and non-CAM) was 38.3% at six weeks and 45.7% after 12 weeks of illness. It was seen that patients >54 years of age, those with brain or lung involvement and those who had to undergo ICU admission had a higher risk for death.According to the study, the COVID-19–related hypoxemia and improper glucocorticoid use independently were associated with CAM.“The Covid-19 pandemic has led to increases in mucormycosis in India, partly from inappropriate glucocorticoid use. Age, rhino-orbital-cerebral involvement, and intensive care unit admission were associated with increased mortality rates; sequential antifungal drug treatment improved mucormycosis survival, the study concluded.Dr. Arunaloke Chakrabarti, Professor & Head, Department of Medical Microbiology, PGIMER, said, “The rise in number of cases coincides with the country’s Covid-19 epidemic. Clinicians should be vigilant for mucormycosis in the patients recovering from Covid-19 illness, especially among patients with new or previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus and clinical manifestations of facial or orbital pain or black or blood-stained nasal discharge or loosening of teeth. In addition, improper glucocorticoid use for the Covid-19 treatment is an additional risk factor in CAM. Therefore, treating physicians should ensure they use appropriate drugs and doses in Covid-19 patient treatments.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-witnessed-two-fold-increase-in-mucormycosis-cases-cdc-study-263891

06-06-2021||St. Petersburg (Russia)||No ‘extra-regional power’ should interfere in bilateral issues of India and China: Putin||Asserting that both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are “responsible” leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday said they both are capable of solving issues between the two countries, and that it was important that no “extra-regional power” should interfere in the process.With Russia publicly critical of the Quad, the four-nation grouping of India, the US, Japan and Australia, Putin also told PTI that though it was not up to Moscow to assess how any nation should participate in an initiative and to what extent they should build their relations with other countries but no partnership should be aimed at making friends against anyone.The Russian president’s remarks, in response to a question on Moscow’s view on Quad as well as India’s participation in the grouping, were a veiled reference to the Chinese claim that the grouping is to contain Beijing’s influence in the strategic Indo-Pacific region.He also asserted that there were no “contradictions” in Russia’s partnership with India and the ties between Moscow and Beijing.“Yes, I do know that there are some issues related to India China relations but there are always a lot of  issues between neighbouring countries but I know the attitude of both the Prime Minister of India and also the President of China. These are very responsible people and they earnestly treat one another with utmost respect and I believe that they will always arrive at a solution to any issue that they might face.“But it is important that no other extra-regional power is interfering with that,” the Russian President told PTI through a translator during a virtual interaction.It has been more than a year since the military standoff between China and India erupted in eastern Ladakh on May 5, 2020 during which there were fatalities on both sides for the first time in 45 years. They have made limited progress in achieving disengagement at the Pangong Lake area while negotiations for similar steps at other friction points remained deadlocked.Asked about the growing proximity between Russia and China and if that will impact the Indo-Russia security and defence cooperation, Putin said the relations between India and Russia were developing quite rapidly, quite successfully based on “trust”.“We highly appreciate such a high level of cooperation with our Indian friends. These relations are of a strategic nature. They cover a whole range of avenues of our cooperation in economy, energy and hi-tech. In defence, and I am not just talking about purchase of Russian arms...We have very deep profound relations with India based on trust,” he said.Putin also asserted that India is Russia’s only partner that they are working together with on “elaborating and manufacturing, especially in India, advanced weapon systems and technologies but that is not where our cooperation ends because our cooperation is multifaceted.”          During the interaction with select top editors of major international news agencies, including from the US, India, the UK, Germany and France, Putin replied to wide ranging issues, including Russia-US ties, the pandemic situation, the US sanctions against Russia and the Gaza issue.Asked about Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov’s criticism of Quad as ‘Asian NATO’ and his view on India’s participation in the grouping, Putin said, “we are not participating in the quad, it is not my place to give my assessment to any other country participating in any initiative because every sovereign nation has the right to decide with whom and to what extent they are building their relations. I only believe that any partnership between countries should be aimed at making friends against anyone, No.”Ahead of his maiden summit with US President Joe Biden in Geneva on June 16, the Russian president also said that he was not expecting any “breakthrough”.“We are not taking steps first — I’m talking about the steps that deteriorated our relations. It was not us who introduced sanctions against us, it was the United States who did that on every occasion and even without grounds, just because our country exists,” he said.

India is setting an example to the world that it is not necessary to stop development for protecting the environment,” the PM said.Modi said till 2014, on an average only 1.5 per cent of ethanol was being blended in India, which is currently 8.5 percent.In 2013-14, around 38 crore liters of ethanol were purchased in the country which has increased to more than 320 crore liters.The Prime Minister also released the “Report of the Expert Committee on Road Map for ethanol blending in India 2020-2025” and launched the ambitious E-100 pilot project in Pune for the production and distribution of ethanol across the country.The theme for this year’s event is ‘promotion of biofuels for a better environment’. “India has taken another leap by releasing a detailed roadmap for the development of the ethanol sector on the occasion of World Environment Day,” the PM saidThe PM also interacted with a farmer from Pune who shared his experience of organic farming and use of biofuel in agriculture.“Ethanol has become one of the major priorities of 21st-century India,” he said, adding that focus on biofuel is having a better impact on the environment as well as on the lives of farmers. “A large part of this eightfold increase in ethanol procurement has benefitted the sugarcane farmers of the country,” he said.Most of the ethanol manufacturing units are mostly concentrated in 4-5 states where sugar production is high. However, now food grain-based distilleries are being established to expand it to the entire country to make ethanol from agricultural waste.“India is a strong proponent of climate justice and is moving ahead with a lofty global vision like the founding of the International Solar Alliance for realising the vision of One Sun, One World, One Grid and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure initiative,” he said.He noted that India has been included in the top 10 countries of the world in the Climate Change Performance Index. “India is aware of the challenges that are being faced due to climate change and is also working actively,” he said.Speaking on “hard and soft approaches” being taken to fight climate change, he said India’s capacity for renewable energy has increased by more than 250 per cent in the last 6-7 years and common man has also joined pro-environment campaign like avoiding single-use plastic, beach cleaning and Swachh Bharat.Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Narendra Singh Tomar, Prakash Javadekar, Piyush Goyal, and Dharmendra Pradhan were also present on the occasion.  India’s green footprint  *Kachra to Kanchan campaign being taken forward in mission mode.*India stands among the top 5 countries of the world in terms of installed renewable energy capacity.*Capacity of solar energy increased by about 15 times in the past 6 years.*Ujjwala scheme reduced dependence on wood, helping environment and health of users*Forests cover increased by 15 thousand square kilometers in the last few years.*Number of tigers in India doubled and leopards increased by about 60 percent in the last few years.*Metro rails increased from 5 cities to 18 cities*More than 80 airports have been installed with LED lights which would improve energy efficiency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-environment-day-india-advances-20-per-cent-ethanol-blending-in-petrol-to-2025-263824

06-06-2021||Mumbai||Indian govt’s schizophrenia led to Covid ravages: Amartya Sen||India’s “confused” government focused on taking credit for its actions rather than working to restrict the spread of Covid-19, resulting in schizophrenia that led to massive troubles, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has said.India was better placed to fight the pandemic because of its pharma manufacturing prowess and also higher immunity levels, the noted economist said while speaking at an event organised by the Rashtra Seva Dal late Friday evening.Sen’s remarks came in the backdrop of the second wave of the pandemic seeing the number of officially reported cases topping over 4 lakh a day and over 4,500 deaths daily, and also concerns over under-reporting. Some eminent personalities have said a sense of early “triumphalism” led to the crisis.Sen said India could not play on its strengths because of a poor response to the crisis due to confusion in the government.“The government seemed much keener on ensuring credit for what it was doing rather than ensuring that pandemics do not spread in India. The result was a certain amount of schizophrenia,” Sen said.Sen, who is a professor of economics and philosophy at Harvard University, cited writing by Adam Smith in 1769 wherein the father of modern economics argues that if one does good things, he does get credit for it. And the credit could be sometimes an indicator of how well one is doing.“But to seek the credit, and not the good work that generates the credit shows a level of intellectual naivete which has to be avoided. India tried to do that,” Sen added.“It (government) was trying to generate the credit boasting across the world that India will save the world perhaps. And at the same time, allowing the problem to develop and have a grip over the lives of Indians across the country,” he added.Sen said India was already afflicted with social inequities, slowing growth and unemployment at record highs, which came to haunt it during the pandemic.“A failure of economy and failure of social cohesion was the basis of the failure of the pandemic attack as well,” he said, adding that limitations on education led to difficulties in assessing early symptoms and treatment protocols.Sen also argued for a “big constructive change” in healthcare and education above all, but also in economic and social policies in general.
