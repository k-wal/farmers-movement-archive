29-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre tells states to focus on five-fold strategy of Covid management||The Centre asked the states on Tuesday to focus on the five-fold strategy for effective Covid-19 management and said the process of relaxing restrictions should be carefully calibrated.In an advisory to all the state governments and Union Territory administrations on Covid-19 management for the month of July, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also said the states should regularly monitor the districts with a high number of active coronavirus cases per million (10 lakh) population as it is an important indicator to predict the need for upgrading the health infrastructure and logistics, so that early and prompt action can be taken.He said with the decline in the number of active coronavirus cases, many states have started relaxing the restrictions.Bhalla said the process of relaxing the restrictions should be “carefully calibrated”, and prompt and targeted action needs to be taken by the states, in line with the advisory issued by the Union health ministry.“States, UTs should closely monitor case positivity and bed occupancy on a regular basis, taking the districts as administrative units.“On witnessing any early sign of an increase in the case positivity rate and higher bed occupancy, necessary action should be taken for containment and upgrading the health infrastructure,” the communication said.The home secretary said for the districts with a high positivity rate and bed occupancy, the states may consider imposing restrictions.“There should be a continuous focus on the five-fold strategy for an effective management of Covid-19 i.e. test-track-treat-vaccination and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said.Bhalla said as has been emphasised in previous home ministry orders and advisories, adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour is crucial to guard against any surge in the number of cases.To reiterate, Covid-appropriate behaviour includes mandatory use of face masks, hand hygiene, following physical, social distancing (maintaining a two-yard distance with anybody) and proper ventilation of closed places, he added.While easing the restrictions, it must be ensured that there is no letup in adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, the home secretary said.“I would, therefore, urge you to issue directions to the districts and all other authorities concerned to take necessary measures as advised by the health ministry in its letter dated June 28 for the management of Covid-19.“I would also advise that the orders issued by the respective state governments, UT administrations, district authorities in this regard should be widely disseminated to the public and the field functionaries for their proper implementation,” he added.

ICAI says the Chief Medical Officer can issue a certificate for the students now”.He said, "Whoever faces difficulty will be given another chance. These students had 7 years to appear for the old syllabus exam...we will give the benefit but limited to those who are directly or indirectly affected by Covid. Results will be declared as soon as possible."On behalf of petitioners, senior counsel Meenakshi Arora said it was difficult for a student unable to appear in the exam to obtain an RT-PCR positive test report."Candidates have to travel from all across the country to appear for exams. These students who live in containment zones may not be able to take the RT-PCR tests. The ICAI has not looked into problems being faced by students," she said, adding the upcoming July CA exams were the last opportunity to appear as per the old syllabus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-postpone-ca-exams-says-sc-to-pass-orders-on-granting-opt-out-option-on-wednesday-275874
29-06-2021||Vibha Sharma||Ahead of council of ministers' meeting, speculation rife over possibility of reshuffle||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 29Ahead of the important meeting of the council of ministers called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, speculation has been revived over the possibility of a reshuffle of his Cabinet “in time for new ministers to settle down in their portfolios/assignments” before the upcoming Monsoon session.While the council agenda has been circulated as “Covid management and review of projects related to the ministries of road transport and highways and aviation”, it is believed that it may include other dimensions and the issue related to the long-pending and much-anticipated Cabinet reshuffle (expected as early as the first week of July) may be one of them.Interestingly, apart from the usual buzz surrounding leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia, former Assam CM Sarbanand Sonowal, and others, there is also a new speculation regarding Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar being anointed Madhya Pradesh CM in place of Shivraj Singh Chouhan who “may be brought to the Centre”.    It remains to be seen whether the speculation proves right but the buzz is that PM may accommodate more leaders from poll-bound states like UP and Uttarakhand and give better representation to southern states, especially Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. It is also believed that some old faces may make way for new ones from the BJP.  Allies, including the JD-U, AIADMK, Apna Dal, and LJP, which currently have no representation in the central council of ministers, may be accommodated. In fact, RPI’s Ramdas Athawale is the only non-BJP minister in the Modi Cabinet.The reshuffle is also expected to unburden the load of ministers handling several portfolios. While the burden of half-a-dozen of the existing Union ministers may be reduced, some (especially those who failed to impress in Assembly elections) may make way for more promising faces.      The BJP is inclined to give more space to allies in mind the caste arithmetic in states like UP and Bihar. The JD-U, which refused to join the government in the past, is expected to land more than one post and likewise the AIADMK. Sources say in view of elections in UP, parties like Apna Dal may also find a berth.The breakaway faction of the LJP may also be accommodated in the expansion. With UP elections due next year and the BJP also wants to give a message to the Dalits.It has been two years since Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed charge of the NDA 2.0. When the reshuffle happens, it will be his first in this tenure. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s meeting comes after the PM’s review of the performance of ministers in the past month in the presence of BJP president JP Nadda and general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh. The Monsoon Session of Parliament is likely to commence on July 19 and conclude on August 13, sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-council-of-ministers-meeting-speculation-rife-over-possibility-of-reshuffle-275873

There have been apprehensions in India that people who took Covishield jabs are unlikely to be eligible to travel to the European Union member states under its ‘Green Pass’ scheme.The EU Digital Covid certificate or ‘Green Pass’ will be mandatory to travel to European countries and the document will serve as proof that a person is vaccinated against Covid-19.“The aim of the EU Digital Covid Certificate is to facilitate free movement inside the EU. It is not a pre-condition to travel,” said the official.“For the purpose of the Digital Covid Certificate, individual member states will have the option to accept also vaccinations that have been authorised by the World Health Organisation, such as Covishield,” the official added.The EU Digital Covid Certificate is meant to facilitate safe free movement during the Covid-19 pandemic within the EU member countries and it will serve as proof that a person was vaccinated against Covid-19, received a negative test result or recovered from the infection.“Concerning a possible EMA authorisation for Covishield, as of yesterday, the European Medicine Agency (EMA) stated that it had not received a request for approval,” the official said.“It will examine any such request when received, as per its procedures. The EMA does not investigate new drugs on its own unless it is asked by the relevant companies,” the official said.The EMA has already approved four Covid-19 vaccines which included Vaxzevria, the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in the UK and EU-member countries.The SII makes Covishield in India with a licence from AstraZeneca.The official said temporary restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU are currently in place from many non-EU countries, including India, due to the pandemic.“EU member states shall gradually lift these temporary travel restrictions at the external borders, based on developments of the health situation,” the official said.

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Uttar Pradesh: July-3 UP zila panchayat adhyaksh elections, BJP-SP trade charges||Ahead of the July-3 elections to various posts of zila (district) panchayat, including that of 'adhyaksh' (chairpersons), two main contenders BJP and the Samajwadi Party are busy trading charges. While the SP has accused the BJP of “poaching its candidates” and using “dubious means” to “somehow project a win in panchayat elections it otherwise lost in May”, saffron leaders claim that “facing a certain defeat, the SP leadership is blaming BJP”.“Their leader (SP chief Akhilesh Yadav) has found a way out of owning defeat by blaming BJP. Those who have abused each democratic institution are talking of ethics and morality,” BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh said.  Notably, Yadav, who claimed that SP candidates were stopped from filing nomination papers with “the help of local administration and police”, is also believed to have removed district presidents for “colluding” with BJP in “sabotaging” his party’s chances. With Assembly elections just a few months away, getting the maximum number of key posts in these panchayats is important for both the BJP and the SP. Given that these elections are not fought on party symbols but political affiliations, according to reports around 747 SP members were elected in the elections held in April followed by 690 of the BJP and 381 of the BSP. The BJP has been under severe criticism over the “mishandling of the Covid pandemic” and results of the panchayat results were seen as a reflection on the governance of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Though according to the BJP all Independent candidates were its members, therefore it won 981 seats.Notably, soon after the results in May, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy made an interesting extrapolation of panchayat results on the Assembly constituencies’ map, claiming that the SP had won 243 Assembly seats, the BJP 67, and others 47.According to Swamy, 46 of 403 assembly seats in the State were “purely urban” and therefore panchayat polls covered 357 rural assembly seats.  Swamy said out of 357 seats, "SP wins 243 and BJP wins 67 and the rest 47. If I have it wrong, correct me”.Meanwhile, political analyst Sudhir Panwar, who is also allied to the SP, said “people will take revenge of this usurping of people mandate by force”.“The blatant and open use of administrative machinery and money by BJP in influencing/poaching of non-BJP members who won elections independently and with the support of the SP and the RLD exposed dictatorial attitude of BJP. Toppling elected state governments and now poaching of district panchayat is the testimony of decay in the value system of RSS-BJP which proclaimed herself as a party with principles and ideology,” Panwar added.The UP election commission said that Chairpersons to 22 zila panchayats have been elected unopposed. The elections to the remaining 53 will be held on July 3||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttar-pradesh-july-3-up-zila-panchayat-adhyaksh-elections-bjp-sp-trade-charges-275858

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Right to life may be interpreted to include right to food: SC||Taking note of basic global concept on food security, the Supreme Court Tuesday said in that the absence of explicit provision for it, the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution may be interpreted to include the right to live with human dignity, having right to food and other basic necessities.“The Right to Life as guaranteed by Article 21...gives the right to every human being to live a life of dignity with access to at-least bare necessities of life. To provide food security to impoverished persons is the bounden duty of all States and Governments,” the top court observed while issuing a slew of directions on a plea of three activists.The activists—Anjali Bharadwaj, Harsh Mander and Jagdeep Chhokar—had sought implementation of welfare measures for migrant workers who faced distress again due to curfews and lockdowns in various parts of the country during the second wave of COVID-19.“There has been worldwide awareness regarding the right to food for human beings. Our country is no exception. Lately, all Governments have been taking steps and taking measures to ensure that no human being should be affected by hunger and no one dies out of hunger. The basic concept of food security globally is to ensure that all people, at all times, should get access to the basic food for their active and healthy life.“The Constitution of India does not have any explicit provision regarding the right to food. The fundamental right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution may be interpreted to include the right to live with human dignity, which may include the right to food and other basic necessities,” held a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah.The top court, in its 80-page judgement, referred to the National Statistics Office (NSO) data of 2017-2018 and said there are around 38 crore workers engaged in the unorganised sectors and to provide food security to them is the duty of the government.“Thus, the number of persons in the unorganised sector is more than 1/4th population of the entire country. These unorganised workers did not have any permanent source of employment and have engaged themselves in small time vocations and occupations at various places away from their native places. Contributions of these labourers towards different projects, industries, make considerable additions in the economic development of the country,” it said.The Constitution enjoins that the control of resources of the community are for promoting welfare of people by securing social and economic justice to the weaker section, it said.It acknowledged the fact that migrant workers had been exposed to financial and other hardships during the pandemic due to their limited access and claim to the welfare resources offered by states and union territories (UTs).”When migrant labourers form more than 1/4th population of the country, all Governments or authorities have to take special care regarding welfare of these migrant workers/labourers. The Parliament has enacted various legislations to safeguard the interest and welfare of the migrant labourers, which we shall notice hereinafter,” it said.Holding that states are duty-bound to provide food security to poor people, the bench said Parliament with an objective to provide such a security had enacted the National Food Security Act, 2013.“The Central Government may undertake exercise under Section 9 of the National Food Security Act, 2013 to re-determine the total number of persons to be covered under the Rural and Urban areas of the State,” the top court said in the judgement.

Such reports are completely false, baseless and mischievous,” said a source.The reports emerged as the US looked to complete the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan by September 11, ending a nearly two-decade of its military presence in the war-ravaged country.In the midst of fast-paced developments relating to the Afghan peace process, a senior Qatari diplomat said at a webinar organised by the Arab Centre in Washington DC recently that he believed the Indian side was engaging with the Taliban as the group could be a key component in the future of Afghanistan.

Being a low-cost option and easily available, utilisation of these platforms for sinister purposes by terrorist groups have become an imminent danger and challenge for security agencies worldwide,” said VSK Kaumudi, Special Secretary (Internal Security) in the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.“The possibility of the use of weaponised drones for terrorist purposes against strategic and commercial assets calls for serious attention by the member states. We have witnessed terrorists using them to smuggle weapons across borders,” he added.“The transborder nature of this threat calls for collective and unified action by the international community, without any excuse or exceptions, ensuring that those countries which provide safe havens to terrorists should be called out and held accountable,” emphasised the official.Other new avenues for spread of terrorism were misuse of new payment methods and crowdfunding platforms for financing of terrorism, the official observed. The increased use of closed group communications on Internet and social media platforms adds to the concern, he said.Continuing advancements in evolving technologies—Artificial Intelligence, robotics, “Deep fakes”, Blockchain, Dark-web – can also be abused by terrorists. Already, crypto currencies and virtual assets are helping terror financing, helped by the anonymity and untraceable nature of these technologies.Kaumudi also pointed out that Covid and the subsequent isolation has made people vulnerable to radicalisation and recruitment by terrorist groups who spread terrorist propaganda by enticing them into “video games”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-flags-dangers-of-weaponised-drones-at-un-275844

However, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points. India has been particularly pressing for disengagement of troops in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.According to military officials, each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control in the sensitive sector.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach at the 11th round of military talks.

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Parliamentary panel seeks Twitter’s response on locking of accounts of Prasad, Tharoor||A parliamentary panel has sought Twitter’s response on the recent locking of the accounts of Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, sources said on Tuesday.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Technology has sent a letter to Twitter seeking its response within two days, sources said.The panel was instructed by its chairman Tharoor to seek a reponse from Twitter on the blocking of accounts of Prasad and others on its platform, sources said.Last week, Twitter had blocked Union Information and Technology Minister Prasad from accessing his account which ratcheted up tensions with the government as it came under renewed attack for not following local laws.Twitter denied Prasad access to his account ‘@rsprasad’ for almost an hour on the grounds that he violated the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, but the minister said the microblogging platform violated new IT rules that require intermediary or a host of user content to give prior notice before locking access.The IT Minister called out Twitter over the brazen arbitrariness and running its “own agenda”.Soon after Prasad flagged the issue, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted that he too had faced something similar.“Raviji, the same thing just happened to me. Clearly DMCA is getting hyperactive. This tweet has been deleted by @Twitter because its video includes the copyrighted BoneyM song ‘Rasputin’,” Tharoor tweeted.Tharoor further said: “As Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, I can state that we will be seeking an explanation from @TwitterIndia for the locking of @rsprasad’s & my accounts & the rules & procedures they follow while operating in India”.Prasad lashed out at Twitter, and in a series of posts on rival social media platform Koo said it was apparent that his statements calling out the “high handedness and arbitrary actions” of Twitter, had ruffled feathers.Meanwhile, Facebook and Google officials here on Tuesday deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology on the issue of misuse of social media platforms.While from Facebook its country public policy director Shivnath Thukral and general counsel Namrata Singh deposed before the panel, Google was represented by its country head (government affairs and public policy) Aman Jain and director (legal) Gitanjali Duggal. The agenda of the parliamentary panel meeting is to safeguard citizens’ rights and prevent the misuse of social/online news media platforms.Earlier, Facebook representatives had informed the parliamentary panel that their company policy does not allow their officials to attend in-person meetings because of their Covid-related protocol.But Chairman Shashi Tharoor conveyed to Facebook that its officials will have to appear in person since the parliament secretariat does not allow any virtual meetings.The Parliamentary Committee on IT will also summon representatives of YouTube and other Social Media Intermediaries in the coming weeks over the issue.Facebook and Google representatives were called days after Twitter officials deposed before the panel.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-seeks-twitters-response-on-locking-of-accounts-of-prasad-tharoor-275841
29-06-2021|| Mumbai||Why Centre’s approval needed for door-to-door vaccination, HC asks Maharashtra government||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked the Maharashtra government why it needed approval from the Centre to start door-to-door vaccination programme for senior citizens, specially-abled and bedridden persons in the state.The state government on Tuesday filed an affidavit in the high court saying home vaccination on an experimental basis could be started, but only for those who are completely immobile and bedridden.It, however, also said the proposal will have to be first approved by the Union government.“Why do you (Maharashtra government) need approval? Health is a state subject too. Is the state government doing everything after taking approval from the Centre? Have states like Kerala, Bihar and Jharkhand taken approval from the Union government?” a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni asked.The Bench was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by two advocates—Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari—seeking a direction to the Union government to start door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens above the age of 75, specially-abled persons and those who are bedridden.Earlier, the Union government had said door-to-door vaccination cannot be introduced currently due to various reasons, including vaccine wastage and the risk of adverse reaction to the vaccine.The court had then asked the Maharashtra government if it was willing to start door-to-door vaccination in the state.In its affidavit, the State Family Welfare Board said the Maharashtra government has been following guidelines laid down by the Union government for vaccination and to date, it (state) has not made any request for door-to-door vaccination.As per the affidavit, door-to-door vaccination can be introduced on an experimental basis for bedridden persons.It said even for these people, a certificate has to be issued by the person’s doctor, saying the person is not likely to have any adverse reaction to the vaccine, and if there is any such reaction, then the doctor concerned shall be entirely responsible to manage and administer appropriate medical treatment to the person.The affidavit also said family members of the person concerned shall have to provide written consent before the vaccine is administered to the person at home.“In order to avoid vaccine wastage, at least 10 beneficiaries concerned shall be made mandatorily available in the closed proximity as one vial contains 10 doses of vaccine,” it further said.The affidavit said if this proposal is accepted by the state government, then the same shall be sent to the Centre for approval.The Bench posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-centres-approval-needed-for-door-to-door-vaccination-hc-asks-maharashtra-government-275840
29-06-2021||Mumbai||Covid drugs’ distribution: Sonu Sood says he acted as conduit to help needy||Actor Sonu Sood on Tuesday denied any wrongdoing in the distribution of anti-Covid-19 drugs by him, and told the Bombay High Court that he was only helping out those who genuinely needed medicines amid shortages. The High Court, hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking probe into the distribution of Remdesivir and other drugs by politicians and celebrities like Sood, allowed the actor to intervene in the PIL.The distribution of medicines as well as oxygen cylinders by politicians and celebrities at a time when even the government was finding it hard to keep up with the demand had raised eyebrows.The HC had at the previous hearing asked the Maharashtra government to find out if there had been illegal hoarding and unauthorised distribution of drugs.On Tuesday, a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni allowed an application filed by Sood through advocate Milan Desai seeking to become a party to the PIL.In his application, the actor denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the petitioners were trying to destroy his philanthropic work and defame him.  Since the onset of the pandemic he had been “relentlessly doing philanthropic work”, Sood said.After the second wave hit in April this year, people were running from pillar to post to get lifesaving medicines as there was a lack of coordination between the places where the medicines were available and those who needed them, the application said.“Therefore I decided to be a conduit between the two, i.e. connecting bona fide needy people with the places where the aforesaid drugs were available, so that the latter could directly send the requisite drugs to the needy patient,” Sood said.Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, the state’s lawyer, had told the HC earlier that the government had initiated inquiry to ascertain the roles played by Sood and Congress MLA from Mumbai Zeeshan Siddique in the procurement and supply of medicines in response to SOS appeals on social media.A case was also registered at the Mazgaon metropolitan court against the BDR Foundation and its trustees for supplying Remdesivir to Siddique though it did not have a requisite license, Kumbhakoni had said.Siddique had been merely providing the medicine to those who approached him, so no action was taken against him, the advocate general had said.As to Sood, Kumbhakoni said the actor procured medicines from pharmacies attached to a private hospital in the city. Pharma company Cipla had supplied Remdesivir to these pharmacies and inquiry into the same was going on, he had said.On Friday, Kumbhakoni reiterated this information, following which the bench said it was open to hearing all concerned parties. “We will allow your intervention application,” the HC told Sood’s lawyer.The court also took a stock of the state’s preparedness to face a possible third wave of the pandemic.The advocate general told the bench that the production of drugs against black fungus (mucormycosis) has been increased in the state, and nodal officers have been appointed to supervise the distribution of anti-COVID-19 drugs to hospitals.The hearing will continue on Wednesday.

29-06-2021||Srinagar||JK conversion row: One of 4 Sikh women had approached HC for protection against harassment by family||One of the four Sikh women alleged to have been converted to Islam by force had approached the Jammu and Kashmir High Court seeking protection from any coercive action by her family and the police, saying she changed her religion and married a Muslim man willingly.Viran Pal Lour, who became Khadeeja after marrying Manzoor Ahmad Bhat on January 20 this year as per Islamic rituals, had approached the high court in May this year.In an order passed on May 20, Justice Ali Mohammad Magrey had directed the police to ensure the woman’s parents—Rattan Singh and Popinder Kour—or anyone else at their behest does not harass, attack, kidnap or harm the couple.“…and they shall be allowed to live their married life the way they like and protect their rights in terms of the guarantee as enshrined by the Constitution of India,” the order said.The woman (26) and her husband (31), who declared their marriage before the public notary in Budgam district court in February, had told the court that they were living like nomads as her parents had lodged a complaint at Satwari police station in Jammu against Manzoor.The court had directed Satwari SHO not to take any coercive action based on the complaint. It had also asked the Budgam police chief to ensure the implementation of the directions in letter and spirit.Sikhs in Kashmir, supported by community members from Delhi, have held protests against such interfaith marriages and alleged that Sikh women were being forcibly married off to older men.Shiromani Akali Dal leader Manjinder S Sirsa, who also arrived here on Sunday for the protest, has said they have taken up the issue with Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.“We have been protesting for two days. Four girls have been forcibly converted including an 18-year-old who was married to a middle-aged man and it was said she was married according to her own will,” Sirsa had said on Monday.

29-06-2021||New Delhi||4.61 crore Covid doses given in 8 days: Govt||A marked increase in the pace of Covid-19 vaccination has been observed from June 21 with around 4.61 crore doses being administered in eight days, which is more than the population of Iraq (4.02 crore), Canada (3.77 crore), Saudi Arabia (3.48 crore) and Malaysia (3.23 crore), the government said on Tuesday.On an average, 57.68 lakh doses of the vaccine were administered per day which is more than the population of Finland (55.41 lakh), Norway (54.21 lakh) and New Zealand (48.22 lakh), Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said addressing a press conference.The new revised guidelines of Covid-19 vaccination came into effect from June 21, according to which the Centre will now procure 75 per cent of the vaccines being produced by the manufacturers in the country.In order to incentivise production by vaccine manufacturers and encourage new vaccines, domestic vaccine manufacturers are given the option to also provide vaccines directly to private hospitals. This would be restricted to 25 per cent of their monthly production, the new guidelines stated.Agarwal informed that 49 per cent of the population aged 60 years and above has been vaccinated with the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The government highlighted that the cumulative vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed 33.11 crore so far.Out of an estimated 59.7 crore people in the age group of 18-44 years, 15 per cent have been vaccinated with the first dose of the vaccine, it said.Agarwal said from June 21-28, 57.68 lakh average daily doses have been delivered.“A marked increase in vaccine administration in the present phase (June 21-28) with 4.61 crore doses administered in 8 days which is more than the population of Iraq (4.02 crore), Canada (3.77 crore), Saudi Arabia (3.48 crore) and Malaysia (3.23 crore),” he said.From May 1 to June 24, 56 per cent doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been given in rural areas, while 44 per cent have been administered in urban areas, he said.Of the total number of vaccinations so far, Aggarwal said 46 per cent women have been inoculated and 54 per cent men have received the jabs. A total of 54,693 other gender have also been given vaccines during the period, Agarwal said. There are 20.9 crore people aged between 45-59 years, out of which 42 per cent have been vaccinated with the first dose of the Covid vaccine, Agarwal said.A decline of almost 92 per cent has been noted in the daily COVID-19 cases since the highest reported peak on May 7.A sharp decline of over 85 per cent has been noted in weekly positivity since the highest reported weekly positivity of 21.3 per cent reported between May 4 to May 10. India launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on January 16 and has so far administered over 33.11 crore doses, while the UK which began the drive on December 8 has administered around 7.67 crore doses.The US which started the drive on December 14 has administered over 32.44 crore doses while Italy, Germany and France which launched their inoculation drive on December 27 have administered around 4.98 crore, 7.21 crore and 5.24 crore doses respectively, he said.India took 163 days to reach the 32 crore mark, while the US took 193 days.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul said there is an improvement in the pandemic situation but stressed on maintaining caution.“There are 111 districts where more than 100 daily cases are being reported and it is in our peninsula region—Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal. Concern in the face of an ongoing pandemic of this nature must continue to be on our minds...lowering of guard is not acceptable,” he said.“We would like to see increased proportion of women coming to vaccination booths for receiving the vaccine so that skew in gender can also get corrected,” he added.On vaccination of lactating mothers, he said all four Covid-19 vaccines presently approved in India are safe for them.“They must take it and no specific precaution is needed and they should get vaccinated. This is scientifically valid and applicable to all the vaccines that have been licensed,” he said.“With full authority and science and research, I want to say there is no side effect of infertility associated with vaccines and it is rumour mongering and raising doubts so please don’t believe them. There is no chance with any infertility, male or female, in relation to any licensed vaccine—Covaxin, Covishield, Sputnik-V and Moderna,” he said.On a question why the death toll remains high, he said death rates were higher in the second wave as compared to the first wave.“I have no doubt that the deaths are declining and are on a downswing and it is only a matter of time. It is essentially the lag due to which these are there, but some of the serious cases that prolonged from more intense phases are also adding up to this situation,” he said.On the Delta plus variant of Covid-19, he said scientific data on transmissibility, severity or vaccine efficacy against this variant is not available yet.“It is being monitored and scientific action is being taken,” he added.On vaccination of pregnant women, Agarwal said NTAGI recommendation has come to the Health Ministry and it is being examined and it will be examined with other stakeholders too, and required orders based on that will be issued.

They knew each other and there was no coercion or force used (against the girl),” Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Delhi president Paramjit Singh told reporters here.He thanked all the people who made the marriage possible.Asked if the 18-year-old woman was already married to a Muslim man following her alleged conversion, he said no marriage had taken place.He appealed to people to maintain the age-old communal harmony in Kashmir.“We do not want any (anti-conversion) law. The majority community has to take care of the minority community,” he added.Singh said the Sikh community wanted to set up a major hospital in Kashmir on a plot owned by Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee.“We have around 81 kanals of land (8.125 acres). A part of it is under occupation of the tillers. We want to pay them due compensation and take back the land for establishing a big hospital for people here,” he added.SAD leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa had alleged on Monday that four Sikh women were forcibly married and converted to Islam in Kashmir recently and demanded that they be returned to their families.

Need more, not less,” Jaishankar said while addressing the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting here.“Institutional multilateralism has been found wanting. Reforms have many forms but vaccine equity will be the immediate test. The real economy needs decentralised globalisation, including in manufacturing, food and health. Resilient supply chains must develop in parallel,” he said.“The full diversity of our planet needs more accurate reflection in global policymaking,” he added.India has recorded more than 3 crore coronavirus cases and registered nearly 400,000 deaths due to the virus since the beginning of the pandemic last year. Globally, the coronavirus has infected over 18 crore people and killed nearly 40 lakh, according to Johns Hopkins University.Jaishankar arrived in Italy from Greece on the second leg of this two-nation tour to attend the the G20 ministerial meetings.The G20 summit is scheduled to be held in Italy in October.

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Do not have ITR of political parties: I-T dept to RTI activist||The IT Department has given a “contradictory” response when asked for tax returns of political parties under the Right to Information Act, by first saying that the information is not held by it and then citing exemption clauses to refuse disclosing the information, an RTI activist claimed on Tuesday.The Central Information Commission, the highest adjudicator of RTI matters, had ordered in 2008 that tax returns of political parties should be disclosed under the transparency law, a position which was repeatedly reflected in its orders later.RTI activist Venkatesh Nayak approached the Income Tax Department seeking tax returns filed by political parties in the last 10 years.“The applicant is hereby informed that, the requested information is not held as such, by the CPIO as registered information nor is the requested information required to be maintained as such by the CPIO, under extant rules or regulations,” the RTI response said.Citing a Supreme Court order, I-T Department’s Central Public Information Officer said where the information sought is not part of the public authority’s record and where it is not required to be maintained under any law or regulations, the act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority to collect or collate such non-available information and furnish it to the applicant.The CPIO went on to cite five of the 10 exemption clauses of the RTI Act to underline that the sought information, not held by her, was exempt from disclosure.She also cited another apex court order that stated the information related to matters of an assessee is personal information which stands exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act.“The CPIO gave a totally contradictory reply to this RTI application. First she claimed that she does not hold the information. She also claimed that the information is not available in the desired form as explained in the RTI application. She cited a much-abused para from the CBSE judgement of the Supreme Court in support of her denial. Then she also claimed that five out of the 10 exemption clauses are applicable to the information sought,” Nayak told PTI.The RTI exemptions cited by the CPIO to deny information relate to intellectual property rights, trade secrets and information in the nature of commercial confidence, fiduciary relationship, threat to life and safety of persons who give information to law enforcement agencies in confidence, impediment to investigation, prosecution or apprehension and privacy of an individual.“How can exemptions apply to information which she believes that she does not hold, nor even knows who is likely to have it is a big question that she has not looked at while issuing this contradictory reply,” Nayak said.Ordering the disclosure of income tax returns of political parties, the then Information Commissioner AN Tiwari had said it is recognized that political parties do need large financial resources to discharge their myriad functions.“But this recognition is tinged with the apprehension that non-transparent political funding could, by exposing political parties, and through it the organs of State which come under the control or its influence, to the corrupting influence of undisclosed money, can inflict irreversible harm on the institutions of government. There is public purpose in preventing such harm to the body-politic,” he had said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/do-not-have-itr-of-political-parties-i-t-dept-to-rti-activist-275820

The forced conversion and wedding of Sikh girls in Kashmir is wrong and the delegation has submitted a memorandum over it. I will discuss this with the Union Home Minister regarding the action that needs to be taken.”The Sikh leaders have asked the government to enact a strong law against conversion by force or by duping. They have also demanded equal rights for the minority Sikhs residing in Jammu and Kashmir.Earlier, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had also assured to meet these leaders to discuss the issue of religious conversion and possible appropriate actions.The Sikh leaders said they had faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he had been working towards normalisation in Jammu and Kashmir.On Monday, a massive protest had taken place at the J&K House in New Delhi.Reportedly, two Sikh girls were abducted and forcibly converted to Islam. The first one, an 18-year-old Sikh girl from Badgam district, was abducted and forcibly converted to Islam at gunpoint. Another girl from Srinagar, who after attending a function of her Muslim friend, has been missing and is reported to have been married off to a 62-year old man.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sikh-delegation-meets-home-mos-reddy-demands-strong-anti-conversion-law-275809
29-06-2021||New Delhi||Monsoon reaches one of its last outposts in Rajasthan 2 weeks early; eludes Delhi, parts of north India||The southwest monsoon has reached Barmer in west Rajasthan, one of its last outposts, two weeks before its normal schedule but is yet to arrive in the north Indian plains, including Delhi, which have been reeling under searing heat, the Met office said on Tuesday.The northern limit of southwest monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.After arriving two days late in Kerala, the monsoon had raced across the country, covering eastern, central and adjoining northwest India seven to 10 days earlier than normal.It has even covered parts of north India, including Rajasthan’s Barmer—a border district and mainly desert area—but parts of west Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana are yet to receive rainfall. According to Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, Barmer is among the few stations in west Rajasthan which are usually covered by the southwest monsoon in the last. Southwest monsoon reaches west Rajasthan by the first week of July.However, it covered Barmer two weeks before its normal schedule, IMD’s Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said.“A system in the Arabian Sea provided impetus to the monsoon which covered some parts of Rajasthan including Barmer in early June,” Mohapatra said.In case of Delhi, Haryana, parts of Punjab, west Uttar Pradesh and west Rajasthan, the easterlies bring monsoon over this area from the Bay of Bengal, he said.“But there has been no active system currently in the Bay of Bengal that could help the easterlies to bring monsoon over this region,” Mohapatra added.The meteorological office had earlier predicted that the wind system may reach Delhi by June 15, which would have been 12 days early.However, westerly winds have been blocking its advance into Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana.Normally, monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27 and covers the entire country by July 8. Last year, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 25 and covered the entire country by June 29.However, this year, the wait for Delhi, Haryana, parts of west Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and west Rajasthan has been overdue even as the mercury and humidity have continued to soar, the IMD said, adding immediate relief was unlikely.“Prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and Punjab during the next six to seven days,” the IMD said.

The entire area has been flooded by the overflowing Kankai river.Shiv Kumar Singh, the groom along with other relatives were returning from Palsa village located on the other side of the river. After the marriage ceremony, bride, groom and other relatives were to return on a boat.After travelling some distance, the boat got stuck in the sand."We had no other option but to travel from boat to dry place on the bank of river. So I immediately decided to travel the distance carrying her on my shoulder," Singh said."The bridge on Kankai river near Singhmari was proposed some 10 years back. The people of Kishanganj and adjoining districts are forced to use boat to cross the river. The state government is callous," the groom's relative Rahul Singh said."This incident is an example of development of Bihar claimed by the Nitish Kumar government. Road connectivity to most of the villages adjoining to rivers are cut off from the rest of the state. Hence, boat is the only option for us. Such a situation is arising in almost every place affected by the monsoon flood," Rahul Singh said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-groom-carries-bride-on-shoulder-across-river-in-spate-275801

29-06-2021||Satya Prakash||Central Vista: SC dismisses petitions against Delhi HC order refusing to halt work||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 29The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed petitions challenging the Delhi High Court’s decision refusing to halt construction work on the Central Vista project in the national capital and imposing a cost of Rs One lakh for wasting judicial time."The High Court's view is a possible view. You challenged one project selectively," a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar said, adding, they didn't even bother to find out about other public projects allowed during Covid lockdown.Earlier, refusing to set aside the clearances given to the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, the top court on January 5 said it can’t venture into policy matters and areas reserved for the Executive without any legal basis.The Central Vista redevelopment plan – which aims to free up 75 acre land in the heart of the capital – involves demolition of around 10 buildings, including Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President’s House and Lok Nayak Bhawan.Announced in September last year, it envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for more than 1,200 MPs, expected to be constructed by August, 2022, when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.Terming the Rs one Lakh cost imposed by the Delhi High Court as “exorbitant”, petitioners Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi had earlier this month moved the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court’s decision refusing to halt construction work on the Central Vista project."The impugned judgment, especially the imposition of exorbitant costs, has a chilling effect on public spirited individuals raising genuine issues of public health and on the right of citizens to question the actions of the government and to hold it to account, which it is submitted is the bedrock of democracy," they had submitted.Describing the Central Vista project as "vital and essential", a Bench headed by Delhi High Court Chief Justice DN Patel had on May 31 imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners for wasting its time by filing a "motivated" petition.The legality of the project had already been upheld by the Supreme Court and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority also allowed the work to continue, the high court had said, adding the workers were already present at the site and, therefore, "we see no reason to stop the work”.The petitioners, however, said they were aggrieved by the "unsubstantiated” findings and adverse observations, particularly the comment that their petition was motivated, ill-intended and lacked bona fides.Advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav -- who was not a party to the case-- had also moved the top court against the HC order, terming it a “matter of serious public health concern.” Yadav contended that the high court was not justified in holding the Central Vista redevelopment project as an "essential activity".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-vista-sc-dismisses-petitions-against-delhi-hc-order-refusing-to-halt-work-275791

29-06-2021||London [UK]||Oxford study says mixing COVID-19 vaccines gives good protection||Amid the global shortage of the COVID-19 vaccines, a study conducted by Oxford University has found out that alternating doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines generate robust immune responses against the coronavirus. According to the study, 'mixed' schedules of these vaccines induced high concentrations of antibodies against the SARS-CoV2 spike IgG protein when doses were administered four weeks apart. This study, published on the Lancet pre-print server, means all possible vaccination schedules involving the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines could potentially be used against COVID-19. "The Com-COV study has evaluated 'mix and match' combinations of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines to see to what extent these vaccines can be used interchangeably, potentially allowing flexibility in the UK and global vaccine roll-out," said Professor Matthew Snape, Associate Professor in Paediatrics and Vaccinology at the University of Oxford, and Chief Investigator on the trial.   "The results show that when given at a four-week interval both mixed schedules induce an immune response that is above the threshold set by the standard schedule of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine."   Professor Snape said these results are an invaluable guide to the use of mixed dose schedules, but the interval of four weeks studied here is shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.Meanwhile, UK Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said: 'Today's data are a vital step forward, showing a mixed schedule gives people protective immunity against COVID-19 after four weeks."      "Our non-mixed (homologous) vaccination programme has already saved tens of thousands of lives across the UK but we now know mixing doses could provide us with even greater flexibility for a booster programme, while also supporting countries which have further to go with their vaccine rollouts and who may be experiencing supply difficulties." The University of Oxford is leading the Com-COV study, run by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium (NISEC). This UK government funding study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using a different vaccine for the initial 'prime' vaccination to the follow-up 'booster' vaccination.

Credit is more debt. No banker will lend to a debt-ridden business," Chidambaram said.Debt-burdened or cash-starved businesses do not want more credit, they need non-credit capital, the former finance minister said in a series of tweets."More supply does not mean more demand (consumption). On the contrary, more demand (consumption) will trigger more supply," he said.Demand will not grow in an economy where jobs have been lost and incomes or wages reduced, Chidambaram argued."The answer to this crisis is to put money in the hands of the people, especially the poor and lower middle classes," he said.The Congress had on Monday claimed that the measures announced by the Finance Minister "delivered nothing but headlines" and said the government should take steps to spur demand to revive the economy "which continues to be in the doldrums".

His body was cremated at Balkeshwar Ghat by passing it off as a Covid patient's remains.Sachin Chauhan, 25, was the only son of cold storage owner Suresh Chauhan. He was kidnapped on June 21 and murdered the same night.His family members had filed a missing complaint but he could not be traced.The Special Task Force received a tip-off on Sunday night after which they detained five people, including Sachin's close friend Harsh Chauhan, who is son of his father's business partner.

When the borrowed amount reached Rs 40 lakh, Aswani asked Sachin to return the money, but he was not willing to pay back.Aswani and Harsh then made a plan to kidnap Sachin and demand ransom of Rs 2 crore from his father.On June 21, Aswani called Sachin to join them for a booze party at Khaspur village. He was allegedly smothered to death by the accused.SSP Muniraj G. said, "In a bid to mislead the police, the accused bought PPE kits from a medical shop in Kamla Nagar and after covering themselves, they cremated his body at Balkeshwar under a fake name.

The IAF attack is the first instance of suspected Pakistan-based terrorists deploying drones to strike at the country's vital installations."Today, misuse of information and communication technology such as internet and social media for terrorist propaganda, radicalisation and recruitment of cadre; misuse of new payment methods and crowd-funding platforms for financing of terrorism; and misuse of emerging technologies for terrorist purposes have emerged as the most serious threats of terrorism and will decide the counter-terrorism paradigm going forward,” Special Secretary (Internal Security), Ministry of Home Affairs in the Government of India, VSK Kaumudi said.Speaking at the ‘Global scourge of terrorism: assessment of current threats and emerging trends for the new decade', he said, “Another add-on” to “existing worries” is the use of drones."Being a low-cost option and easily available, utilisation of these aerial/sub-surface platforms for sinister purposes by terrorist groups such as intelligence collection, weapon/explosives delivery and targeted attacks have become an imminent danger and challenge for security agencies worldwide,” he said at the 2nd High-Level Conference of the Head of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of the Member States in the General Assembly.“The possibility of the use of weaponised drones for terrorist purposes against strategic and commercial assets calls for serious attention by the member states. We have witnessed terrorists using UAS to smuggle weapons across borders,” Kaumudi said, according to his statement issued by the Permanent Mission of India to the UN.Kaumudi said the Covid pandemic and the subsequent isolation had further accentuated the impact of the internet on people making them vulnerable to radicalisation and recruitment by terrorist groups.Spreading terrorist propaganda through the use of "indulging video games" is another strategy that was deployed by terrorist groups during the pandemic, he said.“It is imperative for countries to adopt a multi-pronged approach to tackle the global threats emanating out of misuse of new technologies, particularly aiming towards terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism,” he said.

Hospitals were reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.“India came to the assistance of the United States during this country's time of need, and now the United States stands with the people of India as they continue to battle the Covid pandemic,” the US Agency for International Development said on Monday.USAID announced an additional USD 41 million in support to help India respond to the Covid pandemic and strengthen the country's preparedness for Covid and future health emergencies.USAID's assistance will support access to Covid testing, pandemic-related mental health services, timely referrals to medical services, and access to health care in remote areas, the independent agency of the US federal government primarily responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance said.Through this additional funding, USAID will continue to partner with India to strengthen health care supply chains and electronic health information systems, support its vaccination efforts, and mobilise and coordinate private sector relief, it said.USAID has contributed more than USD 200 million for India's Covid relief and response efforts since the pandemic began, including more than USD 50 million in emergency supplies and training for more than 2,14,000 frontline health workers on infection prevention and control, benefitting more than 42 million Indians, according to a media release.The US is providing significant emergency assistance to the hardest-hit countries in South Asia, including India and Nepal, by allocating more than USD 300 million under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which President Joe Biden had signed on March 11.In May, President Biden announced USD 100 million worth of Covid assistance to India.The US-India Chambers of Commerce Foundation has raised more than USD 1.2 million for coronavirus-related efforts in India.With record-breaking fundraising, the US-India Chambers of Commerce Foundation has shipped or en route nearly 120 ventilators and over 1,000 oxygen concentrators, a release said on June 3.Also, India will be a significant recipient of the US vaccines after Biden announced details of his administration's decision to send 25 million Covid vaccines to countries across the globe.India has been included in both the identified categories - direct supply to neighbours and partner countries, and under the Covax initiative.

At least nine people have been confirmed killed, officials said on Monday.Vishal Patel, 42, his wife Bhavna Patel, 38, and their one-year-old daughter Aishani Patel are believed to be among the missing, their niece Sarina Patel told CNN, adding that Bhavna Patel is four months pregnant.Sarina said she last spoke to her family on Father's Day."I had actually called them to tell them I had just booked a flight to come visit because they've been asking me to come to see their home and to meet their daughter. I haven't met her due to the pandemic," she said on Friday.They were home at the time the collapse took place, she said. "We have tried calling them countless times and there's just been no answers, text messages, nothing. They haven't contacted anybody," she said.Bhavna is a British and US citizen, the British media reported.Umma Kannayan, a family friend of the Patels, told the BBC that they were a "very loving" family who were closely involved in their religious community."Aishani was like the little baby of the temple," she said. "It feels like you've lost a part of yourself."            She said she was waiting with the Patel family's relatives for news, but that "not much information has been shared" about the victims."I think all of us, the family included, and the folks that are very closely associated with them [at temple] would want to know the list of survivors currently present," she said. "Perhaps from there some hope either might be given or might be shattered, but some names out there would be very helpful for all."        Meanwhile, the painstaking search for survivors is continuing as families waiting for news are increasingly fearing the worst. Some prayed for a miracle. Others have already begun to speak about their loved ones in the past tense.As of Sunday, at least nine have been confirmed dead and more than 150 people are still unaccounted for, authorities said, the USA Today reported.Authorities have identified eight of the nine people confirmed to have died in the tragedy so far.On June 24, a building at the Champion Towers South Condo, around seven miles away from Miami beach, partially collapsed leaving at least five dead and 156 missing. Emergency officials are asking people to contact them if they have relatives unaccounted for.A state of emergency has been declared by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.The number of people unaccounted for is 159, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters Friday -- up from the figure of 99 that officials gave Thursday afternoon, CNN reported.Those 159 people "have been identified as possibly being on the site. So those are people that maybe live there, but we don't know whether they were there at the time," the mayor said at a news conference on Friday afternoon in Surfside.Numerous search and rescue personnel have been scouring the rubble, including from the surface, with search dogs, sonar and cameras.Structural engineers also have been shoring up other places -- such as areas near a parking garage underneath the rubble -- to allow crews to tunnel underneath with light machinery.The building's residents reflected South Florida's international and cultural mix, with affluent families from Argentina, Paraguay and Colombia and a tight-knit Jewish community.President Joe Biden on Friday approved an emergency declaration for the state, making federal aid available to Florida.The cause of the partial collapse of the building is not known.

School closures due to the pandemic have provided an even greater opportunity to these terrorist groups to target children, including through online avenues, for radicalisation and indoctrination in violent extremist ideologies,” he cautioned.Taking advantage of School closureSchools’ closure due to the pandemic has provided an even greater opportunity to these groups to target kids. —Harsh Vardhan Shringla, Foreign SecretaryPointing out that the Covid pandemic had further negatively impacted children in situations of armed conflict by hampering their access to education, health and social services, Shringla said it had made them susceptible to recruitment and abduction. “It is, therefore, important that states keep child protection concerns at the core of their pandemic response measures,” he observed. The Foreign Secretary called for ending impunity for all actors responsible for perpetrating grave violations against children.

There are several means by which a drone can be detected, identified, disabled or destroyed, which includes radar, infrared,laser, opto-electronics, electromagnetic and acoustic means along with the use of guns, rockets or missiles. These can be fixed, vehicle mounted or man-portable.Last year, the Defence Research and Development Organisation had unveiled an anti-drone system designed by it, which is reported to have been deployed selectively so far, with state-owned Bharat Electronics Limited designated as the production agency.The Army’s Directorate of Air Defence is undertaking a project to develop counter measures against unauthorised flying objects that can be used for surveillance or attack. Launched over a year ago, the Army expects the feasibility study to take around two years, with other two or three years for developing a technology solution.The BSF is also in the process of acquiring anti-drone systems. Its requirement is for a ground-based standalone platform capable of detecting a lone suspicious flying object or a group of UAVs and react within 10 seconds.Being border states and given their history of terrorism, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir are vulnerable to cross-border smuggling and terror attacks. Security forces have reported an increase in drone activity in border areas, with several instances of drones violating the Indian air space of being used to drop arms and ammunition on this side of the border.Difficult to trackMost drones used for cross-border smuggling of arms and ammo or for attacks are much smaller than conventional aircraft. Since low altitude and their minuscule radar makes them difficult to track electronically, ground forces have to rely on visual sightings and audio signalsNo funds for techThe Punjab Police are facing financial issues in the procurement of anti-drone technology.

The attack appeared to be closely linked with the recovery of a 6-kg IED by the Jammu police from an LeT operative that led to detention of at least three terror suspects, they added.The agencies did not rule out the possibility of the drones having originated from the Indian side of border, but claimed these might have been activated by terrorists who infiltrated from Pakistan, sources added.Involvement of Pak state actors likelyMeanwhile, a fresh attempt to attack a military installation with the help of drones was foiled by alert Army sentries at the Ratnuchak-Kaluchak station who fired at the unmanned aerial vehicles that then flew away. “Two separate drone activities were spotted over Ratnuchak-Kaluchak military area by alert troops,” Jammu-based Army PRO Lt Col Devender Anand said in a statement.Officials in the security agencies said over 300 drones and unidentified flying objects had been sighted along the country’s western frontiers with Pakistan since August 5, 2019, particularly in Punjab and Jammu sectors. Personnel posted in forward areas were trying to find a suitable technology to check these objects, they added.The security agencies were also testing some indigenous counter-drone technologies in varied terrain along the border.Top LeT militant heldJammu: Nadeem Abrar, LeT commander involved in several killings, was arrested on Monday. “Big success for us,” tweeted Kashmir zone IGP Vijay Kumar.

The rules allow flying of drones under certain conditions. There are 34 green zones in which drone operations are permitted after intimation about the time and location of flight.“Yellow zones” require permission to operate drones, but “red zones” are no go areas. The use of drones for civilian operations across the country is being discussed as part of a policy to regulate small drones, their ownership and permission to operate.Sources said the Home Ministry officials wanted that drone operations should have 80-km buffer from any military, strategic or high-value targets. The armed forces maintained that the country, or even the world, didn’t have any technology to detect, destroy and prevent a drone from being a threat in an area as vast as India. Solutions could be applied only to close tactical areas, provided manned surveillance and quick response teams were in place.The new Indian drone regulations, titled UAS Rules-2021, ask drone operators to adhere to a set of rules. This includes having a student pilot licence, remote pilot licence and a permit for becoming an unmanned aircraft operator.The drones have to be “no permission, no take-off” (NPNT) compliant.

The map was later removed.The distorted map has triggered angry responses, with netizens demanding action against Twitter.The government is seized of the matter and may take action. Already, the micro-blogging site is under fire over the non-compliance of new ITrules despite repeated reminders. Twitter and the government have been at loggerheads on multiple instances in the past few months. In November last year, the government issued a notice to Twitter for showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir instead of Ladakh.Names US citizen as grievance officerTwitter has named California-based Jeremy Kessel as India’s grievance redressal officer.

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Approval to Covishield would be considered should we receive marketing authorisation application: EU agency||The Covishield vaccine "does not currently have a marketing authorisation" in Europe and the matter would be considered when an application is received for it, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Monday.People vaccinated with Covishield, manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), are unlikely to be eligible to travel to the European Union member states under the 'Green Pass' scheme as the vaccine is yet to be cleared by the EMA.The EU Digital Covid certificate or 'Green Pass' will be mandatory to travel to European countries and the document is likely to serve as proof that a person is vaccinated against Covid-19. Travel under 'Green Pass' to non-EU citizens may be rolled out in a phased manner from July 1.However, individual European Union member countries may have separate rules and norms for travellers.The EMA has already approved four Covid-19 vaccines which included Vaxzevria, the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in the UK and EU-member countries.The SII makes Covishield in India with a licence from AstraZeneca."The only Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca for which a marketing authorisation application was submitted to and evaluated by EMA, leading to its authorisation in the EU, is Vaxzevria," Alessandro Faia, a spokesperson of the EMA said."In the EU, the vaccine called Covishield does not currently have a marketing authorisation. Even though it may use an analogous production technology to Vaxzevria (the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine authorised in the EU), Covishield as such is not currently approved under EU rules," the official said. Explaining the reason, the official said even tiny differences in the manufacturing conditions can result in differences in the final product. "This is because vaccines are biological products. Even tiny differences in the manufacturing conditions can result in differences in the final product, and EU law, therefore, requires the manufacturing sites and production process to be assessed and approved as part of the authorisation process," the spokesperson said."Should we receive a marketing authorisation application for Covishield or should any change to the approved manufacturing sites for Vaxzevria be approved, we would communicate about it," he said.The official clarified that the EMA is not responsible for any decision regarding travelling into the EU and the travelling conditions associated with Covid-19 vaccination, such as the EU Digital Covid certificate. "This is a matter for the European Commission and for individual member states," the official added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/approval-to-covishield-would-be-considered-should-we-receive-marketing-authorisation-application-eu-agency-275317
29-06-2021||New Delhi||Monsoon: No rains in northwest India till July 7-8||With the northern limit of the southwest monsoon (NLM) stuck at its position for more than 10 days now, the Indian Meteorological Department said on Tuesday the seasonal rains are not expected to progress into Delhi, Chandigarh, Haryana, and southern parts of Punjab for another 6-7 days. Rather, some independent forecasters believe the monsoon may continue to give the hitherto uncovered parts of the Northwest a miss till around July 10.Why it mattersAccording to Mahesh Palawat of Skymet, from Monday/Tuesday the monsoon axis is also shifting towards foothills, further leading the seasonal rains into perhaps the “longest break spell” at this time of the year. It also means that parts of central India that have been covered may also not receive rains it revives again.“Though it has happened earlier, such a long break at this time of the year is unusual. There’s no indication of rains (in Northwest) till July 7/8,” says Palawat. The IMD also adds that prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features, and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, and Punjab during next 6-­7 days.The main reason, rather the hindering factor, appears to be the prevalence of westerlies over the region, which again is “unusual” as according to Palawat by this time they generally shift into upper latitudes.“Upper-level westerlies have been persisting since June 17/18, which is unusual as generally during this time of the year they shift more north,” he says.   Notably, the IMD around July 11 said that rains will reach Delhi by June 15, which is 12 days before its usual date of June 27. Last year also the wind system had covered the entire country by June 29, seven days before the usual date of July 8. “The monsoon was really progressing well till then. Rather the low-pressure area in the Bay of Bengal was expected to further boost the current, which did not happen,” meteorologists say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-no-rains-in-northwest-india-till-july-7-8-275288
29-06-2021||Mukesh Ranjan||Jammu drone attack: Preliminary probe points to role of Pakistan-based LeT||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 28Intelligence and investigative agencies on Monday said that the preliminary findings in the investigation into the drone attack at the Indian Air Force (IAF) station in Jammu on Sunday indicated the role of the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) terror group and use of highly sophisticated explosive RDX, which also points at likely involvement of Pakistan’s state actor in the blast.Also read: Alert soldiers thwart possible attack by drones on military station in JammuNew face of terror: Drone attack on Air Force base in Jammu; 2 injuredSources in the agencies said, the two bombs weighing a little over 2 kg each, were dropped from a height of around 100-150 meters and were activated by ‘impact charge’. The attack appeared to be closely linked with the recovery of a 6 kilogram IED by the Jammu Police from an LeT operative leading to detention of at least three terror suspects, they added.  The sources said the agencies are also not ruling out the possibility of the drones having originated from Indian side of the border, but they claimed that these might have been activated by terrorists infiltrated from Pakistan with the requisite training.Meanwhile, officials in the security agencies said, over 300 drones and unidentified flying objects have been sighted along the country’s western frontiers with Pakistan, particularly in Punjab and Jammu sectors. They said personnel posted in forward areas are grappling to find a suitable technology to check these lethal sky-floating objects.The officials said the security agencies have also been testing some indigenously-built counter-drone technologies in the rough jungle terrains, desert and marshes along the borders with Pakistan, but till date a very little success has been achieved.Thus, the officials said, in the present situation the lead agencies — Border Security Force (BSF) and frontier units of states’ police — have adopted a standard operating procedure (SOP) of “sight and blight” in case a drone or a remotely operated aerial vehicle is spotted.Data prepared and shared by the security agencies with the government said over 300 “definite sightings” were made by the BSF and other police units after August 5, 2019, when Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 was withdrawn and it was reorganised into the two Union Territories (UTs) of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh.However, experts in the internal security establishment, sources said, are analysing for adoption some specific anti-drone techniques like sky fence, drone gun, ATHENA, drone catcher and Skywall 100 to intercept and immobilise suspicious and lethal remote-controlled aerial platforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jammu-drone-attack-preliminary-probe-points-to-role-of-pakistan-based-let-275285
29-06-2021||New Delhi||Twitter website displays distorted map of India; J&K, Ladakh shown as separate country||Amid a stand-off with the Indian government over compliance with new IT rules, the Twitter website is displaying a wrong map of the country that shows Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh as separate country.The glaring distortion, which appears on the career section of Twitter website under the header ‘Tweep Life’, has triggered a heavy backlash from netizens who are demanding strict action against the microblogging platform.This is not the first time that Twitter has misrepresented India’s map. Earlier, it had shown Leh as part of China.A mail sent to Twitter on the issue did not elicit a response.The US digital giant has been engaged in a tussle with the Indian government over the new social media rules. The government has confronted Twitter for deliberate defiance and failure to comply with the country’s new IT rules, despite repeated reminders.Notably, the microblogging platform has lost its legal shield as an intermediary in India, becoming liable for users posting any unlawful content.On Monday, social media users slammed Twitter’s gross misrepresentation of India’s map that appears on its career section. The global map, showing Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh outside India, triggered angry responses from netizens who are demanding stringent action be initiated against the microblogging platform that has flouted rules on multiple occasions in the past.In October last year, Twitter came under heavy criticism and faced backlash after its geotagging feature displayed “Jammu & Kashmir, People’s Republic of China” in a live broadcast from Leh’s Hall of Fame, a war memorial for fallen soldiers in the Union Territory of Ladakh.India has issued a stern warning to Twitter that time, making it clear that any disrespect of the country’s sovereignty and integrity is totally unacceptable.In November, government issued a notice to Twitter for showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir instead of the Union Territory of Ladakh, as Centre lambasted the platform for disrespecting the territorial integrity of India by showing an incorrect map.Twitter’s apparent heavyhandedness has come under government scrutiny when the microblogging platform did not fully complied with the new rules, called intermediary Guidelines, that mandate setting up a robust grievance redressal mechanism and appointing officers to coordinate with law enforcement.The rules became effective from May 26; and Twitter, even after the expiry of the additional time, had not appointed the requisite officers, leading to it losing the ‘safe harbour’ immunity.Even in the backdrop of heightened strained relations with the Indian government, Twitter on Friday briefly blocked IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from accessing his account over alleged violation of US copyright law - a move that was immediately slammed by the minister as being arbitrary and in gross violation of IT rules.Meanwhile, Twitter’s interim grievance officer for India, Dharmendra Chatur, has quit within weeks of taking over the key role.California-based Jeremy Kessel has now been named as India’s grievance redressal officer, on the platform’s website - although the appointment does not meet the requirements of new IT rules, which clearly mandate key officers including the grievance officer, to be resident in India.Twitter and the government have been at loggerheads over multiple instances in the past months, including during the farmers’ protest and later when the microblogging platform tagged political posts of several leaders of the ruling party BJP as “manipulated media”, triggering a sharp rebuke from the centre.
