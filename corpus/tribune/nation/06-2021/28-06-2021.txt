The feedback from the meeting is also expected to help the BJP prepare its political pitch for poll-bound states, including UP.Notably, CM Adityanath is also facing resistance from within the state unit amid murmurs of “lack of coordination between his government and party MLAs and MPs”.Though BJP leaders deny it, it is widely believed that a recent meeting between Adityanath and Keshav Prasad Maurya at the latter’s residence in the presence of top Sangh functionaries, Dattatreya Hosabale and Krishna Gopal, was aimed at sorting out the differences between the CM and his deputy.Sources say after a string of meetings between the RSS and BJP top brass in Delhi and Lucknow, it was decided to go with the incumbent CM as party’s face in the UP elections due early next year.Meanwhile, the Chitrakoot meeting will also review the welfare work by Sangh’ affiliated organisations, including the Seva Bharti. ‘Prant (state) pracharaks’ will give details of the Sangh works, including campaigns regarding water crisis and environment conservation, the sources say.The Sangh is making efforts to bring together environmentalists, organisations/NGOs working in the area on a single platform. The top brass will brainstorm and prepare a roadmap on preparations for the expected third wave and strengthening welfare work in different states, they add.It is one of the three key meetings held by the Sangh every year. Apart from Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat and Sarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabale, top functionaries, including Krishna Gopal, Manmohan Vaidya, and Arun Kumar, are expected to hold virtual discussions with ‘pracharaks’ across the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-crucial-assembly-elections-next-year-rss-to-hold-its-annual-manthan-in-chitrakoot-275316

A video of the incident was widely circulated on social media.A video from Loni in Ghaziabad showing a group of men thrashing an elderly Muslim man and cutting off his beard went viral earlier this month as a large number of users posted a muted video of the incident.It was alleged that the victim was forced to chant “Jai Shri Ram”. But later many of the users deleted the video after the Police said there was no communal angle as it was the handiwork of some youth from the same community.Loni Border Police, Ghaziabad lodged an FIR against Rana Ayyub and four others on June 15 under Sections 153, 153A, 295A, 505 and 120B of IPC for sharing the video without verifying its authenticity. The Bombay High Court had granted protection from arrest to Ayyub.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghaziabad-assault-video-case-twitter-india-md-manish-maheshwari-files-caveat-in-sc-275309

28-06-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan’s ‘vaccine sceptic’ views spark row||Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan vaccine sceptic views have drawn criticism on Twitter—a development that comes at a time when India’s trying to scale up vaccination drive in an attempt to help slow the spread of Covid-19.Bhushan, who has been, and remains, one of the most vocal critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP-led central government, sparked a row on Twitter when he said it was irresponsible to promote universal usage of a vaccine that was still untested. Bhushan, who’s voiced his skepticism over vaccines on social media before, shared a news article about a man who lost his wife to what he claims were the adverse effects of the Covid vaccine. In his post, he accused the central government of not monitoring adverse events from the vaccine.Along with the news article, Bhushan wrote the words: “The govt is not monitoring adverse events from vaccine nor releasing data.”In a second post, Bhushan clarified that he wasn’t “anti-vaccine per se” but was opposed to universal usage of “untested vaccines”.“A lot of people including friends & family have accused me of promoting Vaccine hesitancy, let me clarify my position. I am not anti Vaccine per se. But I believe it is irresponsible to promote universal vaccination of experimental & untested vaccines esp to young & Covid recovered,” his post read.A second one only seconds later—this one flagged as misleading by Twitter—said: “The healthy young have hardly any chance of serious effects or dying due to covid. They have a higher chance of dying due to vaccines. The covid recovered have much better natural immunity, than the vaccine gives them. Vaccines may even compromise their acquired natural immunity”.“For the record, I have not taken, nor do I intend to take any Covid Vaccine,” he said in his post.Backlash from these posts prompted another one hours later, this one saying he was “shocked” at the attack on what he said were his “contrarian views”.  “I have been attacked by many for tweeting about my views on Covid vaccines. The piece below summarises my Vaccine skepticism & the reasons for this. Apart from the vaccines being untested & having serious adverse effects, I am shocked by attempts to censor such contrarian views,” he said.A lot of people including friends & family have accused me of promoting Vaccine hesitancy, let me clarify my position.I am not anti Vaccine per se. But I believe it is irresponsible to promote universal vaccination of experimental&untested vaccines esp to young & Covid recovered https://t.co/SVHwgyZcvU  I hope that doctors will respond to Prashant Bhushan's statements about the supposed inefficacy of vaccines, and clarify so that people do not panic. It seems that vaccine hesitancy isn't coming only from people who do not trust allopathy. There are others who are skeptical.  I am shivering rn. Took a cab and asked the cab driver whether he has taken the vaccine, he said “Lene wale the bhaiya par Prashant Bhushan ji ka tweet padha ab darr lag rha hai ” I somehow managed to to convince him but look at the fear one irresponsible tweet creates.  I have written about vaccine hesitancy in one village but pockets of hesitancy among the urbane, well-informed types who idolise Prashant Bhushan very much exist. This is extremely unhelpful and downright dangerous.  And Prashant Bhushan is qualified to talk about how vaccines are efficient in youngsters how??||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/senior-advocate-prashant-bhushans-vaccine-sceptic-views-spark-row-275307
28-06-2021||New Delhi||Over a third of Kumaun Himalayas susceptible to moderate damage in case of major quake: Study||More than a third of the Kumaun region of the Himalayas is susceptible to moderate damage in case of earthquakes of magnitudes ranging from 7 to 8.6, says a new study by scientists at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.Kumaun Himalayas is in the west-central section of the mountain range and lies mostly in Uttarakhand.Several studies suggest that this region is prone to earthquakes of magnitude 8 or higher. In this context, mapping of the co-seismic landslide—which is caused by earthquakes—has become important.Co-seismic landslides are one of the prime hazardous phenomena in the hilly and seismically-active mountainous region. Often, destruction due to earthquake-induced landslides is much greater than that caused directly by shaking of the ground.A team of scientists, including Sandeep Kumar, Vikram Gupta, Parveen Kumar and Y P Sundriyal, from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology in Dehardun, carried out a probabilistic assessment of co-seismic landslides for the Goriganga Valley in the Kumaun Himalaya.The Valley lies in the highest seismically active area in the seismic zoning map of India.The scientists estimated the Newmark permanent displacement which provides the distribution of predicted slope failure in the area.“It was found that more than one-third of the area was vulnerable to co-seismic landslides and that earthquakes of 7, 8 and 8.6 magnitudes might moderately damage an area of 1,459 square km, 1,256 square km, and 1,134 square km in the study region respectively,” the research found.The study has been recently published in the ‘Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment’.This work is the first of its kind in the Himalayas region, in which earthquake-induced landslides have been explored in view of future major to great probabilistic earthquakes.

Wrong lane driving and illegal parking are a very common offence in Khoda area,” the traffic police constable who lodged the complaint told PTI.“Next I saw the car speeding towards me from which I had a narrow escape. The car driver, Ajay Singhal, was outraged as he thought I was taking his picture with his car parked on the road and that's why he tried to run me over,” the constable, who was in his duty uniform at the time, said.Later, Singhal had an argument with the traffic police personnel, who immediately called for back-up around 7 pm and the accused was held, according to officials.Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said the accused, who had parked his car illegally on the road, also assaulted the constable during the argument and has been arrested.“He informed that he is a government official so the police, according to the due process, are informing his office also about the matter,” Singh said.The FIR was lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 279 (rash driving on a public way), 353 (assault to deter public servant from discharging duty), 307 (attempted murder), among others, the police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-official-arrested-for-attempt-to-run-over-car-on-traffic-cop-in-noida-275301

However, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of the Pangong Lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points. India has been particularly pressing for disengagement of troops in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.According to military officials, each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive high altitude sector.

He had also served as Additional Solicitor General during the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party Government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-extends-kk-venugopals-tenure-as-attorney-general-275294

Across 24 wards of Mumbai, 2, 176 blood samples were collected.The overall sero-positivity was found to be 51.18 pc, including 54.36 pc from the public sector and 47.03 pc from private sector. Seropositivity was the highest among 10 to 14 year olds at 53.43 pc corresponding to 51.04 pc (1 to 4 years); 47.33 pc (5 to 9 years); 51.39 pc (15 to 18 years).The findings are consistent with a recent AIIMS study that also revealed over 55 per cent children with Covid antibodies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-50-per-cent-children-in-mumbai-show-covid-antibodies-finds-sero-survey-275277

He was named in the chargesheet in the 1996 Hawala Jain case. Why has the central government allowed a governor like this to continue?” she told reporters at the state secretariat, without elaborating.Banerjee said Dhankhar’s visit to North Bengal was a political stunt as he only met MLAs and MPs of the BJP.“Why did he suddenly tour North Bengal? I can sense a conspiracy to divide North Bengal,” the CM alleged.The Trinamool Congress supremo also said she has written multiple letters to the Centre for the removal of Dhankhar.“As per the Constitution, I will continue to meet him, talk to him… and follow all the courtesies... But, the union government should act based on my letters,” she said.Dhankhar rejects Mamata's claimMeanwhile, Governor Dhankhar accused Mamata of spreading "lies and misinformation".Dhankhar described Banerjee's accusations against him as a "knee-jerk reaction" to his raising questions over the contents of the speech he is supposed to read out at the start of the upcoming Assembly session."The allegations levelled by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee don't have an iota of truth. It is unfortunate that she is spreading misinformation and misinterpreting facts. It doesn't suit a chief minister to make such allegations," he told reporters today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-governor-jagdeep-dhankhar-corrupt-should-be-removed-mamata-banerjee-275274
28-06-2021||New Delhi||Government to spend Rs 93,869 crore this year on free foodgrains scheme||The Centre will spend Rs 93,869 crore this year to provide 5 kg of foodgrains per month free of cost to over 80 crore people during May-November for providing relief to the poor amid the second wave of COVID-19, the finance minister said on Monday. Last year, the Centre had launched the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) to provide free foodgrains to over 80 crore beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), as part of its effort to reduce the hardships of people during the pandemic. The scheme was operational during April-November period of 2020. After the outbreak of the second wave in April 2021, the PMGKAY scheme was reintroduced, initially for May-June and then extended till November this year. Addressing a press conference to announce fresh stimulus measures for the economy, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the estimated financial implication for providing free foodgrains is Rs 93,869 crore for this year. The Centre spent Rs 1,33,972 crore last fiscal on this scheme. The total financial implication is estimated at Rs 2,27,841 crore for PMGKAY, Sitharaman added. The scheme has been reintroduced to minimise the economic hardships being faced by the vulnerable PDS (Public Distribution System) beneficiaries during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the nation had announced that the Centre's free food programme PMGKAY will be extended for five months till Diwali. Five kgs of foodgrains per person per month is provided free of cost under the PMGKAY to 81.35 crore beneficiaries covered under the NFSA. This is over and above the distribution of 5 kg foodgrains per person every month at highly subsidised rates of Rs 1-3 per kg via ration shops to NFSA beneficiaries. Sitharaman also highlighted that wheat procurement has touched an all-time high of over 432 lakh tonnes in the rabi marketing season of 2021-22. Wheat farmers have been paid Rs 85,413 crore. The finance minister also announced that the government has provided an additional subsidy amount of Rs 14,775 crore for DAP and other complex fertilisers under the Nutrient Subsidy Scheme (NBS). The NBS subsidy has been raised to Rs 42,275 crore this fiscal from Rs 27,500 crore in the previous year. Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said out of the total Rs 14,775 crore of additional subsidy, Rs 9,125 crore is towards DAP (Di-ammonium phosphate) and Rs 5,650 crore for NPK based complex fertilisers. Recently, the Union Cabinet approved hike in subsidies for DAP and complex fertilisers by Rs 14,775 crore to keep the price of crop nutrients for farmers low despite the rising costs. After urea, DAP is the most widely used fertiliser in the country. Last month, the Centre decided to increase subsidy on DAP fertiliser by 140 per cent. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-to-spend-rs-93-869-crore-this-year-on-free-foodgrains-scheme-275271

28-06-2021||New Delhi||No scientific data so far to show Delta plus variant adversely impacts vaccine efficacy: Paul||It will be unfair to put a date for any Covid wave as the behaviour of coronavirus is unpredictable and a disciplined and effective pandemic response can help the country get away from any significant outbreak, Covid Task Force chief V K Paul said on Monday.Amid rising concerns over the Delta plus variant of the virus, Paul, who is also a Niti Aayog Member, asserted that there is no scientific data so far to establish that the new variant is highly transmissible or reduces vaccine efficacy.In an interview with PTI, Paul said that another wave of any size would be dependent upon several factors, including overall discipline in terms of Covid-appropriate behaviour, testing and containment strategies, and vaccination rates."And in addition, the unpredictable behaviour of the virus can also change the pandemic dynamics. In such a scenario, their complex factor will determine the chain of transmission and outbreak."Occurrence or non-occurrence of any wave is in our own hands. To my mind, it is not fair to put any date for any wave," he said.Daily fresh cases of Covid have come down from four lakhs during the peak of the second Covid wave to around 50,000 in the past few days and the unlock process or lifting of restrictions is underway in many parts of the country."If we are determined and disciplined and marshal effective pandemic response, we should be in a position to get away from any significant outbreak," Paul said.Currently, three Covid vaccines -- Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, Covishield by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Russia's Sputnik V -- are being used for inoculation in India.When asked about the Delta plus variant, Paul said scientific knowledge about it is still in the early stage."The so-called Delta plus variant exhibits an additional mutation in the Delta variant and since this is a new variant, scientific knowledge is still in the early stage."Whether this additional mutation in the Delta variant is associated with increased transmissibility or excess severity of disease, or any adverse effect on vaccine efficacy is currently not established and we should wait for this information to emerge."And we should wait for these aspects to be studied systematically," he pointed out.A new viral variant of the coronavirus, Delta Plus, was identified on June 11 and was recently classified as a variant of concern.Regarding the effectiveness of Covaxin and Covishield against the Delta variant of the coronavirus, Paul said that based on the scientific evaluation by the ICMR, both vaccines are effective against the coronavirus, including the Delta variant, which is presently the predominant variant in the country.ICMR is the Indian Council of Medical Research.When asked if India is close to giving indemnity to foreign vaccine makers like Pfizer and Moderna, Paul said the issue has multiple dimensions and it is not wise to give a timeline for such issues."The discussion for paving the way for internationally developed vaccines to India, is going on. The issue has multiple dimensions and we are trying to find an agreed way forward at the earliest."We are trying to expedite the progress in every possible way," he said.However, he did not delve into the indemnity issues with respect to approving the vaccines made by foreign companies.Indemnity is one of the issues that is still to be sorted out between the authorities and the companies -- Pfizer and Moderna -- with respect to approving their respective vaccines for use in India.About the progress in Bharat Biotech's Covaxin application for getting Emergency Use Listing (EUL) certificate from the World Health Organisation (WHO), Paul said the process is proceeding very well."Additional documents were submitted by the company last week. We would like to see an expedited review of the data and hope that the decision will come very soon," he noted.On whether the government was looking at reducing the gap between two Covishied doses, the Niti Aayog member pointed out that the country has taken the decision to increase the inter-dose interval for Covishield to three months after careful evaluation of the scientific data."The decisions such as this are taken by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), whose members include our top scientists. It is for this group to look at the additional data, additional scientific information and to take a decision based on scientific principles," he noted.Last month, the government extended the gap between two doses of Covishield from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks."As of now, their decision is to continue with the present dose schedule," Paul said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-scientific-data-so-far-to-show-delta-plus-variant-adversely-impacts-vaccine-efficacy-paul-275269

It has been decided to hold the interactions tomorrow also,” the official said on Monday.The committee was set up by the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on a direction by the Calcutta High Court to look into allegations of human rights violations during post-poll violence in the state.The committee will receive representations and complaints on the issue on Tuesday at the West Bengal State Human Rights Commission office in Salt Lake, the official said.The members of the committee met victims/complainants till Monday at the Staff Officer Mess of the CRPF in Salt Lake.The panel and several teams of the NHRC have been touring various places of West Bengal and inquiring into the veracity of the allegations, according to an NHRC official.A five-judge bench of the high court had on June 18 directed the chairperson of NHRC to constitute a committee to examine all cases about alleged human rights violations in incidents of post-poll violence in the state.The bench, hearing a bunch of PILs alleging post-poll violence in the state, had directed that the committee will examine all the cases, the complaints of which have already been received by the NHRC or which may be received, and “may be by visiting the affected areas” submit a report before it about the present situation.The panel would also suggest steps to be taken so that the alleged victims can peacefully live in their houses and carry on with their occupation or business to earn their livelihood, the bench had directed.The five-judge bench had on June 21 dismissed a prayer of the West Bengal government for recalling the order passed in respect of the PILs alleging displacement of people from their residences, physical assault, destruction of property and ransacking of places of business owing to post-poll violence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-post-poll-violence-nhrc-panel-to-take-representations-from-stakeholders-on-tuesday-275266
28-06-2021||New Delhi||Conducive time to hold CA exams as COVID-19 spread substantially low: ICAI to SC||ICAI told the Supreme Court on Monday that it is the most conducive time to hold CA exams as the Covid-19 spread is now at a substantially low level, offering an opportune moment for chartered accountants to further their professional career.The CA examinations which are conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) in May, were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and are now scheduled to be held from July 5-20.ICAI told the top court that as on date, the numbers of Covid-19 cases are comparatively low and thus it would be in the best interests of the candidates if the examinations are held as per the schedule and not cancelled or postponed. A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose said that since it has not received the ICAI note, it will hear the matter on Tuesday.The top court is hearing a batch of pleas seeking different reliefs including an opt-out option for the candidates, postponement of the exam, and increase in number of centres this year.At the outset, senior advocate Ramji Srinivasan, appearing for ICAI, said that they have circulated a note which if taken into consideration deals with some of the issues raised in the petitions.Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, appearing for one of the petitioners, said that they are not seeking deferment but want more centres to be given as many of them have been unilaterally closed by ICAI.The bench said it will hear the matter on Tuesday and asked Srinivasan to take instruction on the contention raised by Arora.In the note, ICAI has said the “chartered accountant exams are professional examinations and ought not to be equated with CBSE or other State Board Examinations for Class 10 or 12”, and it is in the interest of the candidates to start their “professional lives and earn livelihoods”.It said the ICAI has no vested interest in holding the exams but to safeguard the interest of the aspiring CAs, ensuring that the exams are held at the most appropriate and conducive time. The ICAI further told the top court that whenever the risk has been minimum this court has allowed exams to be held, like Class 12 exams in Kerala and Bihar which were held in April, 2021 and February, 2021 respectively.“Further, the 3rd wave of Covid-19 cases is expected only by September-October. The Institute of Company Secretaries of India and the Institute of Cost Accountants of India are scheduled to hold examinations in August-September, 2021.”“Many candidates appear for 2 or more of these exams, hence the three Institutes hold the exams in a manner that the same do not overlap. Therefore, since Covid is dynamic in nature, the ICAI has got this very narrow window to hold the exam in July, 2021,” it said.The ICAI said the CA exams are normally scheduled to be held in May, but owing to the high number of cases at that time it postponed them, and after evaluating all factors, has now decided to hold the exams this month when the number of Covid-19 cases is comparatively low.It said that the present Covid situation in the country is similar to when this court had allowed ICAI to hold examinations in November, 2020 and there is no reason to believe that it will not take adequate precautions. About the arrangements, it said that the average number of examinees in an examination room will be 12 and in any case not more than 50 percent of the capacity of the room.It said there will be 10,820 exam rooms in 847 centres and the total number of examinees will be 3,74,230.It further added that of these 580 centres have less than 200 candidates, 208 centres have 201-250 candidates, 58 centres have 251-300 candidates and one centre has more than 500 candidates. It said that candidates are eager to appear in the examination, as out of 3,74,230 candidates, as on June 27, more than 2, 82, 000 candidates have downloaded their admit cards. “It is understandable that some of the candidates would have inhibitions in appearing for the exams, but that cannot be allowed to jeopardize the aspirations of a majority of the candidates,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/conducive-time-to-hold-ca-exams-as-covid-19-spread-substantially-low-icai-to-sc-275264

We have seized several fake documents and some stamps with logos of various departments of the state government. We have also seized three debit cards and bank passbooks,” the official said.Deb was arrested a few days back for masquerading as the joint commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and operating a dubious immunisation camp in the Kasba area, where actor and Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty also took a jab.Three of his associates were arrested on Saturday as police included the charge of an attempt to murder along with other sections of the IPC against them.

The Delhi government on Saturday allowed them to operate at 50 per cent capacity.Gym-owners and instructors have devised plans including frequent sanitisation and slots allowing only up to 50 per cent of their establishment’s capacity in accordance with the Covid guidelines.The city government has also allowed weddings at banquet, marriage halls and hotels with 50 people in attendance under the phased unlock process initiated with an improvement in the city’s Covid-19 situation.Chirag Sethi, the vice president of Delhi Gym Association, said the fitness industry welcomed the opportunity to reopen while following the guidelines.Sethi, also the owner of Anytime Fitness in Malviya Nagar, said they were allowing gym members to come in about 16 slots of 50-60 people from 6 am till 9 pm.“People are excited about coming back as they have realised it’s important to be healthy to fight Covid-19,” Sethi told PTI.Along with segregating groups of gym-goers, Sethi has also vaccinated his staff and directed them to sanitise all the equipment frequently.“We are also giving discount offers for members who have been vaccinated.

28-06-2021||New Delhi||GoM may consider privatisation of IOB, Central Bank this year||Inching closer to privatisation of two public sector banks, a high-level panel of secretaries headed by Cabinet secretary is believed to have zeroed in on Central Bank and Indian Overseas Bank as possible candidates for sell off this year.Sources said that the high level panel of secretaries met in the middle of last week to thrash out the regulatory and administrative issues concerning the PSU bank privatisation and have identified banks that would be put up disinvestment. The panel will now send the names of the shortlisted PSU banks to the group of ministers on disinvestment or Alternative Mechanism (AM) for approval.Earlier, NITI Aayog has submitted the names of a few public sector banks (PSB) and one public sector general insurer which can be sold off under the government's new privatisation policy to the Core Group of Secretaries on Disinvestment.People in the know also said that Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) and Central Bank are the top two candidates that have been favoured for privatisation, though Bank of Maharashtra has also found favour for the exercise either this year or possibly later.Further, according to sources, United India Insurance may be suggested to the ministers panel for privatisation among the three general insurers, given its relative better solvency ratio. However, financial sector experts also contend that Oriental Insurance,  with the least solvency ratio among the three, may be favoured as it does not have overseas operations and inviting a private investor may be easier for it.Government had earlier indicated that banks under prompt corrective action (PCA) framework or weaker banks would be kept out of privatisation as it would be difficult to find buyers for them. This would have left three PSBs - Indian Overseas Bank, Central Bank and UCO Bank out of the government's disinvestment plan. But they could be bought out of PCA as there are visible signs of improvement in some of the key parameters such as profitability and asset quality (in net NPA terms as they have stepped up provisioning) in the last 3-4 quarters. This could allow them to be considered for privatisation.In this year's budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that two state-run banks along with IDBI Bank would be privatised in FY22. She also said that one general insurance company would be sold off in the current fiscal.Going ahead with the privatisation process of IDBI Bank on May 5, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) gave its in-principle approval for strategic disinvestment along with transfer of management control in the PSB.The extent of respective shareholding to be divested by the GoI and LIC, shall be decided at the time of structuring of transaction in consultation with the RBI.The Finance Minister while delivering the budget speech on February 1 announced a capital infusion of Rs 20,000 crore in state-owned banks for the financial year 2021-2022.Prior to the privatisation process, the government also undertook merger of the state-run banks, amalgamating weaker banks with the stronger and larger ones. A total of 10 public sector banks were merged with effect from April 1, 2020.With the merger coming into effect, India currently has 12 public sector banks, down from 27 in 2017.The government has budgeted Rs 1.75 lakh crore from stake sale in public sector companies and financial institutions. The target, however, may turn out to be ambitious given the global and domestic economic scenario amid the second wave of Covid-19.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gom-may-consider-privatisation-of-iob-central-bank-this-year-275254

28-06-2021||New Delhi||Indian armed forces capable of giving befitting reply to every challenge: Rajnath in Ladakh||In a clear message to China from eastern Ladakh, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said India is a peace-loving nation that never resorts to any kind of aggression but is always prepared to give a befitting reply if provoked or threatened.Addressing soldiers in a forward location on the second day of his visit to the region, Singh said India wants to resolve disputes with the neighbouring countries through dialogue but asserted that the nation’s safety and security will not be compromised at any cost.The defence minister also paid glowing tributes to the 20 soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley clashes in June last year and said the country will never forget their sacrifices.Singh’s three-day visit to the region comes in the midst of a stalemate in resolving over a year-long standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in several friction points in eastern Ladakh though they withdrew troops and weapons from Pangong lake areas in February.The defence minister said India is a peace-loving country and does not threaten anyone but the country will not tolerate if anyone threatens it, seen as a direct message to China.“We had to face a big challenge along the Northern border last year. But our armed forces displayed their courage and dedication to deal with it...Our Army has the capability to give a befitting reply to every challenge,” he said.The defence minister said disputes can be resolved through dialogue if there is a clear intent for it.“We have always worked for world peace. We never attack anyone. Our objective has never been to achieve victory against anyone. India has neither attacked any country nor occupied an inch. Our intention is very clear,” he said.“Our neighbours should think that we have been neighbours for ages, we will remain neighbours for ages. Can we not find permanent solutions to the disputed issues through talks. We were neighbours, we are neighbours and we will remain neighbours. I am talking about all the neighbours. We can find solutions provided we have clear intent,” he said.He said India never resorts to any kind of aggression, but at the same time, it is always prepared to give a befitting reply if provoked.The defence minister also assured all possible support to the armed forces, reaffirming the vision of the government of having a strong military that is capable of dealing with every eventuality.Lauding the exemplary courage displayed by the Indian Army during the incident, Singh said the nation is proud of its armed forces and “will never forget the sacrifice of soldiers who laid down their lives in Galwan Valley for the country.”                Twenty Indian Army personnel laid down their lives in clashes with Chinese troops in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.In February, China officially acknowledged that five Chinese military officers and soldiers were killed in the clashes with the Indian Army though it is widely believed that the death toll was higher.From Ladakh, Singh dedicated to the nation 63 bridges built by Border Roads Organisation (BRO).On Sunday, Singh carried out a comprehensive review of India’s military preparedness in eastern Ladakh.The defence minister, accompanied by Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, was given a detailed briefing about the prevailing situation as well as India’s combat readiness in the region by top commanders of the Army at the Leh-based headquarters of the 14 Corps, officials said.India and China were locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year. However, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points. India has been particularly pressing for disengagement of troops in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.According to military officials, each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control in the sensitive sector.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach on it at the 11th round of military talks.

As many as 103 villages have become totally devoid of Hindus. In 82 villages, only 4-5 Hindu families are left," the plea submitted, adding, “There is significant decline of Hindu population in the district of Mewat-Nuh giving rise to a demographic change which will be disastrous for the unity of the nation.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-plea-seeking-sit-probe-into-forcible-conversion-of-hindus-in-haryanas-nuh-275231

He fought caste supremacy, poverty and inequality during his political journey,” the 31-year-old leader said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tejashwi-yadav-reaches-out-to-chirag-paswan-tells-him-to-join-bihar-opposition-275050

The Defence Minister, accompanied by Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, also met a number of veterans and discussed issues relating to their welfare as well as national security.“Our aim is that all of you should be taken care of in the same way you had taken care of the country’s security. Despite this, if you have any problems somewhere, a helpline has been arranged,” his office quoted him as saying. Official sources said the minister will carry out a comprehensive review of India’s operational readiness in eastern Ladakh amid a stalemate in the next stage of disengagement with China at several friction points.His visit to the sensitive region comes two days after India and China held a fresh round of diplomatic talks to resolve the prolonged military standoff that began in early May last year. Rajnath is scheduled to visit various key formations and high-altitude bases in the region to assess the ground realities as well as to boost the morale of the troops guarding the Line of Actual Control in a hostile environment.It is Singh’s first visit to eastern Ladakh after the Indian and Chinese militaries pulled back troops, tanks, infantry and other equipment from the Pangong lake areas in February as part of an agreement. The disengagement process in the remaining friction points is deadlocked as China is reluctant to withdraw its troops from these areas. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-china-tension-rajnath-in-ladakh-to-review-preparedness-275047

Samyukt Kisan Morcha condemns this and demands that the FIRs be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally,” it said.In many places, farmers were not allowed to even take out rallies to Raj Bhavans and there were detention and lock-ins of SKM leaders, it said.“SKM condemns this and points out that this itself is an illustration of the failure of democracy and the undeclared emergency that we are going through,” it said in the statement.Noting that cases have been filed against 15 farmers in Hisar who had taken part in a protest against a BJP meeting on June 25, the SKM said the FIRs should be withdrawn immediately.The farmers started their stir against the contentious farm laws in November by camping at Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana, besides at Tikri and Ghazipur borders.The protesting farmers have demanded the withdrawal of the Centre’s farm laws and that a new law be made to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The protesting farmers will mark Monday “Kisan Mazdoor Bhaichara Diwas” at Sunehra protest site near the Haryana-Rajasthan border, it added.

28-06-2021||New Delhi||Twitter interim grievance officer for India quits||Twitter’s interim resident grievance officer for India has stepped down, leaving the micro-blogging site without a grievance official as mandated by the new IT rules to address complaints from Indian subscribers, according to a source.The source said Dharmendra Chatur, who was recently appointed as interim resident grievance officer for India by Twitter, has quit from the post.The social media company’s website no longer displays his name, as required under Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021.Twitter declined to comment on the development.The development comes at a time when the micro-blogging platform has been engaged in a tussle with the Indian government over the new social media rules. The government has slammed Twitter for deliberate defiance and failure to comply with the country’s new IT rules.The new rules which came into effect from May 25 mandate social media companies to establish a grievance redressal mechanism for resolving complaints from the users or victims.All significant social media companies, with over 50 lakh user base shall appoint a grievance officer to deal with such complaints and share the name and contact details of such officers.The big social media companies are mandated to appoint a chief compliance officer, a Nodal Contact Person and a resident grievance officer. All of them should be resident in India.Twitter in response to the final notice issued by the government on June 5 had said it intends to comply with the new IT rules and will share details of the chief compliance officer. In the meantime, the microblogging platform had appointed Chatur as interim resident grievance officer for India.Twitter now displays the company’s name in the place of grievance officer for India with a US address and an email ID.According to a government official, the company has lost legal protection as an intermediary and will be legally held responsible for all content posted by its users on the platform.

28-06-2021||New Delhi||Have capacity to store Covid vaccines requiring low temperatures: Centre to SC||India has the capacity to store vaccines that may require a lower temperature in the range of minus 15 to minus 20 degrees Celsius and there are over 29,000 cold chain points (CCPs) across the country where vaccines are stored at the recommended temperatures, the Centre has told the Supreme Court.In an affidavit filed in the apex court in a suo motu case on distribution of essential supplies and services during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre has said at present, the two vaccines—Covishield and Covaxin—are required to be stored at a temperature range of two to eight degrees Celsius.The Centre has said the requirement for cold storage may change with the arrival of other Covid-19 vaccines in the future and it is fully prepared to take appropriate steps as and when such vaccines are available.“The country also has the capacity to store vaccines which may require a lower temperature in the range of minus 15 to minus 20 degrees Centigrade. The Sputnik V vaccine requires storage at minus 18 degrees Centigrade,” said the affidavit filed on Saturday.“It is submitted that there are more than 29,000 cold chain points (CCPs) across the country in states/UTs, where the vaccines are stored at recommended temperatures,” it said, adding, “Of the above CCPs, four national level stores i.e. Government Medical Store Depot (GMSD) are managed by the Government of India and the remaining are managed by the respective state/UT governments,” it added.It said there are 37 state vaccine stores, 114 regional vaccine stores, 723 district vaccine stores and 28,268 sub-district vaccine stores.The affidavit said that based on the requirement of both the universal immunisation programme and COVID-19 vaccination, the government has centrally procured and supplied cold chain equipment (CCE) to the states and Union territories (UTs).“Further, funds are allocated to the states/UTs under the National Health Mission-Programme Implementation Plan (NHM-PIP) for maintenance of CCEs and also for provisioning cold chain technicians (CCTs) for undertaking the repair and maintenance of CCEs,” it said.The affidavit said there are 29,116 CCPs, located from the national to the sub-district level across the country, which have CCEs like walk-in coolers, walk-in freezers, ice-lined refrigerators, deep freezers, cold boxes for the storage of vaccines and freezing of ice packs.“The capacity of these CCPs has been augmented for the Covid-19 vaccination drive,” it said.The affidavit said the cold storage equipment procured by the government through the domestic budget is indigenously manufactured.“The cold storage equipment supplied as aid by the donors i.e. UNICEF constitutes both indigenously-manufactured equipment and imported equipment,” it said.In the affidavit, the Centre has also that the digital divide is no more a constraint as walk-in Covid vaccination has been allowed and a poor person and a multi-millionaire in the 18 years and above age group are equally entitled to get the vaccine for free.Till June 25, over 31 crore doses of the Covid vaccines have been administered in the country, the government has said while responding to a slew of questions raised by the apex court in its May 31 order.

28-06-2021||Vijay Mohan||Amidst increased drone threat, military installations placed on high alert||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 27Military installations have been placed on high alert following two low-intensity explosions inside the Jammu Air Force Station on Sunday morning that are suspected to have been caused by low flying drones.“The possibility of such incidents at other places cannot be ruled out. Surveillance in and around military bases has been stepped up and additional resources have been deployed,” an officer said.Read also: Drones used for attack on Jammu Air Force base, IAF probes terror angleSince the deployment of anti-drone systems is still in a nascent stage, more guards have been deployed around the periphery to keep an eye out for suspicious flying objects, he added.Sources said constant liaison is also being maintained with the local police as well as intelligence agencies. Radio signals as well as internet traffic and social media are also being monitored.The highly sensitive Air Force Station in Jammu is located just 14 km from the international border with Pakistan and is an important installation as it houses helicopter, UAV and ancillary units. It also has a co-located civil enclave maintained by the Airports Authority of India for commercial operations.The Border Security Force (BSF), responsible for the peacetime management of the Indo-Pakistan border, is also on the alert. The BSF has been reporting increased drone activity along the border over the years.In the past five months alone, there have been a number of instances where illegal arms and ammunition are believed to have been dropped on the Indian side of the border. This is in addition to incidents of drones being used by Pakistan for reconnaissance violating Indian airspace in the Jammu region.On May 16, BSF personnel had observed a drone hovering along the international border in Kanachak Sector at night, which prompted a massive search operation to be launched in the area.Only a couple of days before this, BSF had recovered some arms and ammunition from the Samba sector, which it said had been dropped by a drone on May 14.On April 24, BSF personnel had fired upon two drones that had crossed into the Indian side of the border in Arnia sector of Jammu. On February 14, six pistols and some improvised explosive devices were recovered by the BSF in Samba.The preceding years also witnessed several incidents of arms and ammunition from Pakistan being dropped across the border along the Samba-Jammu-Akhnoor axis. The international border with Pakistan ends at Akhnoor and the Line of Control that separates Jammu and Kashmir from Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir runs further north.While the central government has come up with a policy to regulate the ownership and operations of drones in India, the use of rogue drones by terrorists or hostile nations have been cited as a serious security risk.  Most types of drones being used are much smaller than conventional aircraft and since their minuscule radar cross-section and low altitude makes them difficult to track electronically, ground forces have to rely primarily on visual sightings and audio signature to detect them.The armed forces as well as police organisations are developing anti-drone capability  that includes a doctrinal approach to counter the threat as well as the technology and physical systems to detect and neutralize drones. There are several means by which a drone can be detected, identified, disabled or destroyed.Last year, the Defence Research and Development Organisation had unveiled an anti-drone system designed by it, which is reported to have been deployed selectively so far, with state-owned Bharat Electronics Limited designated as the production agency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amidst-increased-drone-threat-military-installations-placed-on-high-alert-274847
28-06-2021||Lucknow/Kanpur Dehat||Never imagined that a village boy like me would occupy India’s highest post: Prez Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday said he had never imagined that an ordinary village boy like him would have the honour of occupying the highest post in the country, and thanked the people of his birth place for this.He was addressing a gathering at the Paraunkh village, which is his birthplace, in Kanpur Dehat district.“I had never imagined even in my dreams that an ordinary village boy like me would have the honour of occupying the highest post in the country.

Today, I feel happy that this tradition of giving respect to the elders in our family is still continuing,” Kovind said.He said that the scent of soil of the village and the memories of its residents always remain etched in his heart. “For me Paraunkh is not only a village, it is my ‘maatribhoomi’ (motherland) from where I get inspiration to serve the country,” Kovind said.“This inspiration has made me reach from high court to the Supreme Court to the Rajya Sabha. From the Rajya Sabha, I moved to the Raj Bhavan and from there to the Rashtrapati Bhavan,” the president said.Kovind also recited a Sanskrit phrase to highlight the pride of ‘janmabhoomi’ (place of birth), and said, “The pride of a mother who gives birth (to a child) and the ‘janmabhoomi’ is greater than heaven.”         Kovind on Sunday morning reached Paraunkh village where he was welcomed by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, said Vikas Rai, the PRO to SP Kanpur Dehat.He took a round of the village along with Patel and Adityanath.Kovind, along with his wife and daughter, also visited the Pathri Devi temple where they offered prayers.
