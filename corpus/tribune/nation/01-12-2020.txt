Our government is transparent and will not spare anyone, he said. Though the previous government made tall claims on Internet-based services, they failed to see how the youth and young people were lured and duped by the online platform. Driven to debts, some of the young people have committed suicide, said the minister.The Bill was passed by voice vote and members welcomed it.The House also passed the AP Municipal Laws (Second Amendment) Bill which proposes to amend the house tax structure by a nominal hike. However, there will be no burden on people living in 375 square foot which is just Rs 50 per annum. The Bill also was passed by voice vote while the Opposition took objection to the contents of the Bill which was clarified by the Minister. The Assembly also passed three Bills to give impetus to aquaculture – The Andhra Pradesh Fisheries University Bill 2020, Andhra Pradesh Aquaculture Seed (Quality Control) (Amendment) Bill 2020, and the Andhra Pradesh Fish feed (Quality Control) Bill 2020.The Bills have a provision to set up a regulatory mechanism to check the quality of fish feed and fish seed as the aqua farmers have been experiencing losses due to spurious and low-quality fish feed and fish seed.The Fisheries University will also be coming up in West Godavari district.During his padayatra Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was told by aqua farmers about their plight and the losses they were incurring due to low-quality fish feed and seed, which form the main investment component, the said Sucharita.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ap-brings-legislation-to-curb-online-gambling-178501

01-12-2020||Hyderabad||Despite star-studded campaign, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation election registers low polling||The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GMCH) polling saw a very dull response despite having a hectic campaign which attracted national leaders to Hyderabad.The State Election Commission (SEC) authorities reported 42.22 per cent polling in these civic polls which gained national attention.The voting scene turned out to be a huge photo opportunity for people to take pictures with Telugu Cine Stars and local politicians.The SEC released a mere 35.8 per cent of polling at 5 pm.It was by and large peaceful, barring some skirmishes between the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) supporters in the old city area.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Bandi Sanjay accused the opposition workers of damaging his car, and preventing him from going to several polling stations.The SEC has announced re-poll in some wards of Malakpet segment.Around 4 pm—when two hours of polling was still pending—the SEC reported only 30 per cent of voting, which slightly went up at the end of the polling, but this was still "disappointing", according to some politicians.The COVID-19 pandemic, and series of holidays, is said to have acted as a spoilsport in terms of the low percentage. The weather was bright and clear, and people were interested in coming to see their political and cine stars from the Telugu Film Industry.According to reports tabulated so far, Bagh Amberpet division recorded the highest turnout with 62.82 per cent while the lowest 6.77 per cent was reported from Monda Market.The elections were held through paper ballots instead of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) at the request of some political parties. For voters above the 80 years, physically challenged, and those who tested COVID-19 positive after November 1 were offered with postal ballot facility— but at some areas, people above the age of 90 years did cast their vote in person.Actors Chiranjeevi and Nagarjuna were among the two popular Telugu film personalities present. They gave their vote as well.The former union minister Chiranjeevi and his wife Surekha gave their vote at Jubliee Hills. Nagarjuna and his wife Amla also gave their vote at the polling station at Women Co-operative Society at Jubliee Hills.A large number of voters, who came to see South Indian film stars Vijay Devarkonda, Bellamonda Sai Sreenivas, etc besides well-known filmmaker Shyam Prasad Reddy, writer Parachuri Gopalakrishna and singer Vandemataram Srinivas, along with family members voted at the polling booth in Film Nagar Club.Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao's daughter and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader K. Kavitha, and her brother, and TRS working President KT Rama Rao cast their votes in Banjara Hills.The counting of votes would be held on December 5.In the 150-member outgoing GHMC House, the TRS has 99 seats; the AIMIM 44 and the remaining are shared between various other opposition parties.The GHMC polls are very important because those elected to the GHMC House can directly influence voting in about 22 assembly segments, spread across four districts in and around Hyderabad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-star-studded-campaign-greater-hyderabad-municipal-corporation-election-registers-low-polling-178493
01-12-2020||Kolkata||Mamata asks Modi to ‘maintain’ dignity of his office||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should “maintain” the dignity of his office.Addressing a press conference here, Banerjee said, “You are the Prime Minister. We respect your chair. Please maintain it. Don’t accuse and abuse us every day”. The Chief Minister said that Bengal, where people cutting across religious and cultural differences live peacefully side by side, would not take these affronts lying down.Modi, who was in Varanasi on Monday, indirectly targeted the West Bengal government and said that some states were not implementing the “Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana” of the central government.Banerjee, who talked to reporters after a meeting of the state cabinet, exploded when she was questioned about Modi’s remark at Varanasi.The Chief Minister said BJP primarily talked about three central schemes, which were not implemented in West Bengal. Mamata said that while the crop insurance scheme introduced by the central government entailed contribution from beneficiary, similar scheme offered by the state government provided insurance coverage totally free of cost.On the refusal of West Bengal to implement the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme in the state, Banerjee said the state government gave Rs 5,000 to farmers annually in two instalments of Rs 2500 each. Also, agricultural land is revenue free in West Bengal. Moreover, in West Bengal Rs 2 lakh is given to the next of the kin in the case of death of any farmer who might be in the age group of 18 to 60 years, Mamata said.On the non-implementation of the ‘Ayushman Bharat’ health insurance scheme in West Bengal,   Banerjee said while the central scheme would have covered only a section of people, the ‘Swasthya Sathi’ scheme introduced by the TMC government gave free health coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh to all residents of West Bengal.While all three above schemes entailed joint funding, these had been named after Prime Minister and were designed to give the impression to beneficiaries that these were largesse offered by the central government, Mamata said.The Chief Minister said that with the abolition of the Planning Commission, the Modi government had done away with the system of obtaining input from states regarding allocation of funds.“The Rs 1000 crore announced by Prime Minister while touring West Bengal after Cyclone Amphan for giving relief to people affected by the calamity was actually an advance and money was being deducted from the state on account of the monetary help,” Mamata said.The state government had already spent over Rs 5000 crore for tackling the Covid pandemic. The only help that came from the central government in this regard were some ventilators, Mamata alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-asks-modi-to-maintain-dignity-of-his-office-178491

The BJP government is trying to divert the attention of people from real issues,” Singh told reporters in Damoh on Monday.In recent weeks, BJP-run states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have revealed plans to enact laws to counter alleged attempts to convert Hindu women to Islam in the guise of marriage, which party leaders often refer to as ‘love jihad’.Singh also hit out at the Centre for the new farm laws which he said were aimed at ending the mandi and MSP mechanisms and handing over the agriculture sector to “multinationals and rich people”.He said the Congress would look into its defeat on a majority of the 28 MP Assembly seats that witnessed bypolls on November 3. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-raising-contentious-issues-to-divert-attention-digvijaya-178487

Later, he was granted bail by the court.The co-accused in the case, actors Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Neelam, had, however, been acquitted by the trial court, which gave them the benefit of doubt.The state government has challenged their acquittal in the upper court. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/salman-khan-gets-exemption-from-appearance-in-blackbuck-poaching-case-hearing-after-counsel-cites-covid-risk-178482

01-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||Never said whole nation will be inoculated with COVID vaccine: Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 1The Centre on Tuesday said there was never a talk of administering the COVID-19 vaccine to the entire population and that reaching a critical mass of people to break the chain or transmission would be enough.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said it was important for people to get the right information on sensitive issues and that “never has it been said that the entire country will be inoculated”.Clarifying the matter further, Secretary, Health Research, Balram Bhargava said the purpose of COVID vaccine drive would be to break the chain of viral transmission.“The purpose is to break the chain of transmission of the virus. We may not have to vaccinate all the people if we can break the chain of transmission by inoculating a critical mass of people,” Bhargava said, as India’s active cases continued to remain below five lakh and the cumulative recoveries through November exceeded cumulative new cases.The government also doused all doubts raised recently in a section of the media about an adverse event reported in the ongoing COVID vaccine trials of the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech.“Due processes under the clinical trials institutional framework were followed in both the cases and no reason was found by the Drug Controller to halt the trial,” said Bhushan, adding that countering disinformation around vaccine was not just the responsibility of the government but also of the vaccine makers and the media.The Centre is working on a guidance document on COVID vaccine rollout where it would devote an entire chapter to communication around the vaccine.Polio vaccine drive was for long years hampered by myths.Bhargava said the alleged adverse event during the Serum Institute trial was probed by the Drug Control and no causal relation was ascertained between the vaccine and the event.“Preliminary studies found no reason to halt the trial,” he said.Both Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech vaccine trials have entered third phase after drug controller’s approval and due process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/never-said-whole-nation-will-be-inoculated-with-covid-vaccine-centre-178475

The corporate sector is destroying us."If government does not take these laws back in two days, then we will remove our vehicles from the roads. We request all drivers across India to stop their vehicles from December 3," Bhullar said.Peaceful sit-ins by farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, continued for the fifth day at the Singhu and Tikri borders, while the numbers of protestors swelled at the Ghazipur border.Farmers have come to Delhi for a "decisive battle" and will continue their stir against the new agri-marketing laws, their leaders said, adding that they will continue their agitation until their demands are met.Security was beefed up by the Delhi Police and concrete barriers placed at all borders points connecting the city with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as the farmers threatened to block all highways to the national capital after rejecting the Centre's offer that they shift the protest to Burari to start a dialogue before the scheduled date of December 3. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-india-taxi-union-threatens-to-go-on-strike-if-demands-of-agitating-farmers-not-met-within-2-days-178473
01-12-2020||New Delhi||Unwarranted, says MEA after Canadian PM Justin Trudeau’s comments on farmers' stir||The Ministry of External Affairs has unfavourably viewed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remarks on the farmers’ stir made during a virtual interaction organised by his Parliamentary colleague Bardish Chagger to mark Guruparb.Trudeau is the first world head of government to comment on the protest by Indian farmers, which entered its sixth day on Tuesday.In a brief riposte, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava referred to “some ill-informed comments by Canadian leaders” relating to farmers in India and said they were “unwarranted”. Srivastava was also targeting Canadian ministers Navdeep Bains and Harjit Sajjan whose comments had preceded those of the Canadian PM.Trudeau indicated that his government’s concerns about the protest had been conveyed to South Block but Srivastava said, “it is also best that diplomatic conversations are not misrepresented for political purposes”.Trudeau’s observations on the farmers’ stir came during a Facebook video interaction on Guruparb. Ministers Bains and Sajjan, also critical of the handling of the farmers’ stir, along with several of the 18 Sikh Canadian MPs had joined the interaction.The thrust of his opening address was on underlining Guru Nanak’s teachings of compassion, equality and selfless service, which, he said, were at the heart of both Sikhism and Canadian values.But Trudeau spent considerable time on the farmers’ stir. “I know that’s a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns,” he said.The Canadian prime minister also sought global solidarity and indicated his continuing interest to “help each other out”.Sources here said Trudeau’s observations were aimed at his domestic constituency of which the Indian-origin diaspora was a major part. His hold on the Sikh community is under challenge by Jagmeet Singh Dhaliwal-led New Democratic Party.The attempt to downplay Trudeau’s comments comes when New Delhi is actively soliciting investment from Canada’s deep-pocketed pension funds. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently virtually addressed an Indo-Canadian business gathering which was seen as a repairing of ties as New Delhi thought Ontario was soft on Sikh separatists.Earlier last month, a “virtual trade mission to Canada” had featured Canadian Minister John Hannaford, Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan and the two respective High Commissioners Nadir Patel and Ajay Bisaria.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unwarranted-says-mea-after-canadian-pm-justin-trudeaus-comments-on-farmers-stir-178471

But, definitely there was some pressure,” the former official alleged.However, Babu did not elaborate on from whom he faced pressure and for what purpose.Stepping in, Haasan said since Babu had all along been a bureaucrat, he would suppress his ‘social anger’ unlike him and the former official could disclose information related to his service only to an extent.“He may have escaped, but not us. Corruption is affecting us. It is not important which department is scam tainted. Wherever it is, it has to be ended,” Haasan said.The MNM chief alleged that corruption originated from the level of those at the helm of governance and graft should be eliminated as a whole by ushering in change of political leadership.“This has to be changed soon and we have come together towards achieving that.”Lauding Babu, a 1995 batch official and a native of Kerala, Haasan said the former bureaucrat earned all round appreciation for his honesty, dedication and efficiency when he held several positions in the government.“I am very happy to announce that Santhosh Babu has joined hands with us in our endeavour. I appreciate him for having taken a very correct decision. There is no doubt that the arrival of people like him will strengthen our party,” Kamal Haasan said, giving him the MNM membership.The former top official said he joined the ‘democratic’ MNM, with a honest leadership committed for clean politics to bring about change.Babu is a medical doctor and graduated from the government medical college in Tiruvananthapuram. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-tn-ias-officer-santhosh-babu-joins-haasans-party-alleges-pressure-during-stint-as-it-secy-178468
01-12-2020||New Delhi||India plans dam on Brahmaputra to offset Chinese construction upstream||India is considering a plan to build a 10 gigawatts (GW) hydropower project in a remote eastern state, an Indian official said on Tuesday, following reports that China could construct dams on a section of the Brahmaputra river.The river, also known as the Yarlung Tsangbo in China, flows from Tibet into India’s Arunachal Pradesh state and down through Assam to Bangladesh. Indian authorities are concerned Chinese projects could trigger flash floods or create water scarcity.“The need of the hour is to have a big dam in Arunachal Pradesh to mitigate the adverse impact of the Chinese dam projects,” TS Mehra, a senior official in India’s federal water ministry, told Reuters.“Our proposal is under consideration at the highest level in the government,” Mehra said, adding the Indian plan would create a large water storage capacity to offset the impact of Chinese dams on flows.Diplomatic relations between India and China are at a nadir, with troops locked in a border face-off in the western Himalayas for months.Some analysts warned that damming the Brahmaputra could potentially develop into another flashpoint, as Beijing’s dam building activities moved closer to the Indian border.“India is facing China’s terrestrial aggression in the Himalayas, maritime encroachments on its backyard and, as the latest news is a reminder, even water wars,” Brahma Chellaney, a specialist on India-China ties, said in a tweet.On Monday, Chinese state media reported the country could build up to 60 GW of hydropower capacity on a section of the Brahmaputra, citing a senior executive.Yan Zhiyong, chairman of state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China, speaking at an industry conference, said plans to dam the river were a “historic opportunity”.“Formally, we are telling them (the Chinese) that any project you undertake should not cause an adverse impact on India. They have given an assurance, but we don’t know how long their assurance will last,” Mehra said.Hydro projects on Asia’s great rivers have been a growing source of regional tensions in recent years. In Southeast Asia, China has faced accusations a series of dams it has built on the Mekong have worsened drought in downstream countries, which Beijing denies.India would be concerned if the Chinese built a dam around a so-called “great bend”, where the Yarlung curves southward before entering India and where the river gains substantial volume of water, said Sayanangshu Modak, a researcher at the New-Delhi based Observer Research Foundation think-tank.This region, however, is also geologically unstable, making potential dam construction challenging, he said.In Bangladesh, Sheikh Rokon, secretary general of environment campaigners Riverine People, said multilateral discussion should be held before China builds any dams.“China’s downstream neighbours have a legitimate cause for concern. Water flow will be disrupted,” he said.--- Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-plans-dam-on-brahmaputra-to-offset-chinese-construction-upstream-178466

01-12-2020||Mumbai||States’ indebtedness may soar 36 per cent to Rs 68 lakh crore this year: Report||The pandemic-hit states are staring at a record 36 per cent jump in their indebtedness to Rs 68 lakh crore, which will be a decadal high this fiscal year as their revenue is seen plunging 15 per cent, according to a report.This will have their economic output shrinking by at least 2-4 per cent this fiscal year, Crisil said in the report on Tuesday.This is mainly attributable to the falling goods and services tax (GST) collections and sticky revenue expenditure of the states that has gone up massively after the lockdowns, which began in late-March, the report said.The report is based on the state of finances of the top-18 states, including Goa and excluding Delhi, which account for 90 per cent of the aggregate gross state domestic product (GSDP).The states are set to face a revenue deficit of 6 per cent this fiscal, up from 1.5 per cent last year, it said. Capital outlay will fall to 2.7 per cent from 3.8 per cent, increasing their gross fiscal deficit to 8.7 per cent from 5.3 per cent in 2019-20 and total debt to Rs 68 lakh crore from Rs 58 lakh crore in 2019-20.The indebtedness of the states is going to hit a decadal high this fiscal year, rising at least by a hefty 36 per cent or Rs 10 lakh crore to Rs 68 lakh crore by the end of this financial year, CRISIL said in the report.States’ overall revenue is estimated to decline by almost 15 per cent on-year this fiscal in line with a shrinking economy, it added.The rating agency also said all the revenue sources of the states will take a hit, with almost 65 per cent of the decline attributable to a fall in state GST collections, and GST compensation payments and tax devolutions to the states from the Centre’s own tax pool. They together form nearly 50 per cent of states’ revenue receipts, it added.CRISIL Director Ankit Hakhu said the overall debt of the states, including guarantees and loans provided by the Centre to partly compensate for the GST shortfall, will increase sharply by Rs 10 lakh crore this year to Rs 68 lakh crore by the end of this financial year. This will expand the states’ indebtedness to at least 36 per cent, which is an expansion of 600 bps on-year.The math assumes a likely shrinkage of 2-4 per cent in states’ nominal GDP this year. This will remain sensitive to containment of pandemic and states’ policies towards unlocking the economy, he added.Manish Gupta, a senior director at the agency, said that amid falling revenue receipts, the states’ revenue expenditure would remain largely sticky due to high committed expenditures towards salaries, pensions and interest costs, and essential developmental expenditures.These cumulatively contribute to 75-80 per cent of the total revenue expenditure of the states and will be difficult to cut down, he said.Given the stretched revenue accounts, the states may moderate their capital expenditures by around 30 per cent, largely to remain within fiscal borrowing limits, Gupta added.But, despite this capital expenditure moderation, the states’ gross fiscal deficit is likely to expand by around 65 per cent year-on-year this year, substantially increasing their borrowing needs.However, the report expects a substantial recovery in revenue mop-up to the pre-pandemic levels next fiscal, supported by the ongoing economic revival but any delay in this will result in continuing elevated indebtedness and will be credit-negative. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-indebtedness-may-soar-36-per-cent-to-rs-68-lakh-crore-this-year-report-178459

These laws should be withdrawn immediately". "We extend our full support to our farmers. We are with them in this fight," he said.Even as farmers of Punjab and Haryana continued to rally at Singhu and Tikari border entry points, scores of Uttar Pradesh farmers gathered at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Ghazipur border on Sunday morning in their bid to enter the national capital.Earlier in the day, farmer unions decided to attend a meeting with the Centre as protesters continued their agitation at Delhi border points against the government's new farm laws.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday had invited leaders of farmer unions for talks on Tuesday, instead of December 3, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and cold."In our meeting, we have decided to accept the central government's offer to hold talks at 3 pm today. Representatives of protesting farmers will attend the meeting with Union ministers," farmer leader Baljeet Singh Mahal said.Thousands of farmers stayed put at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system and corporatise farming. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhim-army-chief-joins-protesting-farmers-at-delhi-ghazipur-border-178457

The accused had used alcohol-based sanitizer to burn the house so that the murder could look like an accident.Superintendent of Police (SP), Balrampur, Dev Ranjan Verma said that the arrested persons were Lalit Mishra, Keshvanand Mishra and Akram Ali.They were arrested on Monday from a jungle near Bahadurpur crossing.The trio have confessed to their crime, he added.The SP said that Keshvanand's mother was a village head and Rakesh Singh had exposed corruption in her working.The accused held a grudge against the victim over it."They went to his house on the pretext of some talks. They made Rakesh Singh and his friend consume alcohol and later set the house on fire," the SP said."To burn the house using the chemical, Lalit Mishra and Keshvanand Mishra took the help of Akram Ali a.k.a Abdul Qadir, who is an expert in executing incidents like these," the police officer said.Rakesh Singh, 35, who was working for a local newspaper, and his friend Pintu Sahu, 32, had suffered serious burns in the fire at the house in Kalwari village on Saturday.Sahu died on the spot and Rakesh Singh, with 90 per cent burns, was referred to a Lucknow hospital where he died during treatment.According to the police, Rakesh Singh's wife and children had gone to a relative's house two days before the incident.In the intervening night of Friday/Saturday, there was an explosion in the house after which one of the walls collapsed and one of the rooms caught fire, police said.The Balrampur district administration has given a compensation of Rs five lakh to the wife of the journalist. The cheque was handed over to the family of the victim by legislator Palturam.Meanwhile, the management of Balrampur Sugar Mills has assured the district administration that they will provide employment to Vibha Singh, wife of the victim.The administration has also promised free education for the daughters of the victim.Earlier, the wife of the journalist had threatened to set herself on fire if the police failed to arrest the accused. Police said the arrested accused have been sent to jail. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sanitizer-used-to-burn-journalist-to-death-in-uttar-pradeshs-balrampur-3-held-police-178456
01-12-2020||New Delhi||SC unhappy over Gujarat’s report on Rajkot fire incident, says facts should not be suppressed||The Supreme Court Tuesday expressed displeasure over Gujarat government’s report regarding the recent fire in a designated COVID-19 hospital in Rajkot, in which several patients had died, saying no attempts should be made to “suppress the facts”.“We have seen Gujarat’s reply. Five people have died on the seventh floor. What kind of affidavit is this? No attempts should be made to suppress the facts,” said a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan which had last week taken cognisance of Rajkot fire incident.“Inquiry committee has been constituted. The FIR was lodged but people have got bail for whatever reasons. Commissions after commissions are constituted but nothing happens,” said the bench, also comprising Justices RS Reddy and MR Shah.The bench asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to look into the report and ensure that better affidavit was filed in the Apex Court.“Mr Mehta, you look into the affidavit and see what are they filing,” the bench said.Mehta told the bench he would look into the report and talk to the state government on this.The bench has posted the matter for hearing on December 3.Mehta apprised the bench that the Centre had issued guidelines on fire safety in hospitals across the country.“The Central Government have issued guidelines on fire safety. I have filed the affidavit,” Mehta told the bench.The Centre on Monday had asked all states to ensure proper fire safety in hospitals and nursing homes, saying utmost precautions must be taken at a time when the country is fighting the coronavirus pandemic.Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla had written a letter to the chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories in the wake of recent fire incidents in two hospitals in Gujarat which killed 14 people.The Home Secretary had said occurrence of various fire incidents in hospitals and nursing homes in recent past and non-adherence of fire safety measures by authorities in their respective jurisdiction is a matter of concern.The Apex Court had on November 27 taken cognisance of fire outbreak in the ICU of a designated COVID hospital at Rajkot in Gujarat, in which five patients died and had pulled up the states for not taking any concrete action to mitigate the problem despite repeated instances.The top court had termed the Rajkot fire incident as “shocking” and said this was a “very serious thing” and it reflected the situation of designated government hospitals as similar instances have taken place in other places also.It had said such incident showed that there are no proper fire safety measures in place there to deal with such situation.Mehta had assured the Apex Court that home secretary would convene a meeting on this issue preferably today or latest by tomorrow and proper directions would be given.Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel had earlier said 26 patients at the hospital in Rajkot were rescued and shifted to other facilities while five other patients died.The fire broke out around 12.30 am last Friday in the ICU ward located on the first floor of the four-storey Uday Shivanand Hospital in Anand Bungalow Chowk area, where around 31 patients were admitted, Patel had added.The issue cropped up before the bench which was hearing the matter in which it had taken cognisance regarding need for proper treatment of COVID-19 patients and dignified handling of dead bodies in the hospitals.The top court on November 23 had said that the COVID-19 pandemic has “worsened” in Delhi and gone “out of control” in Gujarat and had directed the Centre and all states to apprise it of the steps taken to contain the situation nationwide.

sportspersons to return awards||Several former sportspersons including Padma Shri and Arjuna awardees have extended their support to the agitating farmers and said they will return their awards in protest against the "force" used against the peasants' en route to Delhi.Among them are Padma Shri and Arjuna awardee wrestler Kartar Singh, Arjuna awardee basketball player Sajjan Singh Cheema and Arjuna awardee hockey player Rajbir Kaur.They said they will proceed to Delhi on December 5 and will place their awards outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan.They slammed the Centre and Haryana government for using water cannons and teargas against the protesting farmers to stop them from going to Delhi."We are the children of farmers, and they have been holding peaceful agitation for the last several months. Not even a single incident of violence took place."But water cannons and teargas shells were used against them when they were going to Delhi. If turbans of our elders and brothers are tossed, then what will we do with our awards and honour? We are in support of our farmers. We do not want such awards and that is why we are returning the same," said Cheema on Tuesday.Farmers had faced water cannons and teargas when they were heading towards the national capital as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march against the farm laws.Singh said several former players will go to Delhi on December 5 and will return their awards."If farmers do not want such laws, then why the central government was imposing on them," asked Singh, who has retired as Inspector General in the Punjab Police.He further said that former players would also join farmers' stir at the Delhi borders on December 5.Singh said they are also trying to contact former players in Haryana for coming out in support of farmers' agitation.Cheema said several former players including Kaur and Arjuna awardee (shotput) Balwinder Singh have backed them.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have stayed put at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-several-punjab-ex-sportspersons-to-return-awards-178450
01-12-2020||Mumbai||Malegaon blast: All accused asked to appear in court on December 3||A special NIA court here conducting trial in the 2008 Malegaon blast case on Tuesday directed all the seven accused, including BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit, to appear before it on December 3.The court's direction came on a plea of one of the victim's family, seeking day-to-day trial in the case, which is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Judge P R Sitre asked all the accused to remain present in the court on Thursday.Responding to the plea of one of the victim's family for day-to-day trial,Special Public Prosecutor Avinash Rasal said they are ready to conduct a speedy trial, but they need to locate the witnesses, which is also a tedious task."Most of the time advocates of the accused persons have requested for adjournment of the trial for one reason or the other," he said.The court had framed terror charges against Lt Col Prasad Purohit, Pragya Singh Thakur and five other accused inOctober 2018.The NIA said after framing of the charges, it was making all efforts to expedite the case.It pointed out that around 140 witnesses out of 400 have been already been examined in the case.The probe agency also told the court that the trial in the case was delayed due to retirement of the previous judge and the COVID-19 pandemic.On September 29, 2008, six people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon, a town located about 200 km from Mumbai in north Maharashtra.The accused have been charged under Sections 16 (committing terrorist act) and 18 (conspiring to commit terrorist act) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).They have also been charged under Indian Penal Code (IPS) Sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 153 (a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups), and relevant provisions of the Explosive Substances Act.

Pls respect the courtesies that we always extend to other nations. Request PM @narendramodi ji to resolve this impasse before other countries find it okay to opine," tweeted Chaturvedi, a Rajya Sabha member.Chaturvedis tweet came after Trudeau, in a Facebook video interaction on the occasion of Gurpurab or the 551st birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, on Tuesday said, "I would be remiss if I didnt start also by recognising the news coming out of India about the protest by farmers. The situation is concerning and were all very worried about family and friends.""I know that's a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that's why we've reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns," Trudeau had said.Farmers are protesting at Delhi's borders for six days against the new farm laws. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/our-internal-issue-not-for-your-politics-sena-mp-to-trudeau-178441

Australia was backing a demand being made by the US and some of its allies.The tussle entered cyber space after the Australian military was accused of murdering 39 Afghan civilians.The social media has erupted with western think tanks calling on Joe Biden’s transition team to demonstrate solidarity. Jaishankar’s conversation with Pyne, whom he met in-person in October during the "Quad" talks, should be seen as standing by Australia, an important strategic partner for India in the post-Covid world, said sources.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had called an unscheduled press conference to demand an official apology from China after one of its wolf-warrior diplomats posted a picture of an Australian soldier threatening a young child with a knife.On Monday evening, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying counter-attacked by saying, "The Australian side has reacted so strongly to my colleague’s Twitter, does that mean that they think the cold blood murder of Afghan innocent civilians is justified while other people’s condemnation of such crimes are not justified?"The Australians seemed to be at the receiving end after the editor-in-chief of The Global Times, Hu Xinjin, also jumped in. The allegations of throat slitting have not been in the Australian government’s Brereton Report.Hua continued the offensive by saying Australian anger over the tweet was misplaced but asking its government to bring the culprits to justice and offer an official apology to the Afghan people and "make the solemn pledge that they will never repeat such crimes"."They said that the Chinese government should feel ashamed. It is Australian soldiers who committed such cruel crimes. Shouldn’t the Australian government feel ashamed? Shouldn’t they feel ashamed for their soldiers killing innocent Afghan civilians?" she added.Morrison had also said the cartoon posted by the Chinese diplomat was "deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform, every Australian who serves in that uniform today."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-pitches-in-as-australia-china-engage-in-fierce-social-media-war-over-afghan-civilian-killings-covid-spread-178419
01-12-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 patients treated as untouchables once posters pasted on their homes, says SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said once posters were pasted outside the homes of COVID-19 patients, these people were treated as “untouchables”, reflecting a different “ground reality”.The Centre informed the Apex Court that although it had not prescribed this rule, the practice had nothing to do with “stigmatising” COVID-19 patients as it was aimed at protecting other people.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah said the ground reality was “something different” and as once such posters were pasted at their homes, they were treated as untouchables.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said that some states on their own were pursuing this practice to prevent the spread of the virus.Mehta said the Centre had filed its reply to the plea in pursuance of the top court’s direction asking it to consider issuing nationwide guidelines to do away with the practice of pasting posters outside the homes of COVID-19 patients.“Let the counter filed by Union come on record we will take it up on Thursday,” the bench said.The Apex Court on November 5 had asked the Centre to consider issuing the guidelines to do away with the practice of pasting posters outside the homes of COVID-19 patients.It had directed so without issuing any formal notice to the Centre on one Kush Kalra’s plea seeking framing of the guidelines.The bench had observed that when the Delhi government had agreed in the high court not to paste posters, why cannot the Centre come up with guidelines dealing with the matter for the entire country.On November 3, the AAP government had told the Delhi High Court that it has instructed all its officials not to paste posters outside homes of COVID-19 positive persons or those in home isolation; and the ones pasted have been ordered to be removed.The government had told the high court that its officials had also not been allowed to share details of COVID-19 positive persons with their neighbours, resident welfare associations or WhatsApp groups.Kalra, in his plea before the high court, had contended that freely circulating to Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and on WhatsApp groups, the names of persons who tested positive for COVID-19 was “leading to stigmatisation and drawing of unnecessary attention”.The petition had stated that COVID-19 positive persons “ought to be given privacy to cope with and recover from the illness in peace and away from prying eyes”.“Rather, they are being made the centre of public attention..,” it had said.It had also claimed that this has resulted in persons “shying away and deliberately choosing not to test themselves” to shield themselves from the “public embarrassment and stigmatisation” which is also caused by pasting posters outside homes of COVID-19 positive patients.

01-12-2020||New Delhi||SC rejects Chanda Kochhar’s appeal against HC order dismissing her plea regarding termination||The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Chanda Kochhar’s appeal against the Bombay High Court order which had dismissed her plea against her termination as the managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, saying the issue falls within the realm of a private bank and employee.“Sorry, we are not inclined to interfere with the high court order,” a bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said, adding, “This fall within the realm of private bank and employee.”The top court was hearing Kochhar’s appeal against the March 5 order of the high court which had dismissed her plea against termination as managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, while noting that the dispute arose from a contract of personal service.The high court had accepted the bank’s contention that Kochhar’s plea was not maintainable as the dispute was contractual and concerns a private body.During the arguments before the Apex Court, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Kochhar, said the high court had dismissed her plea on the grounds of maintainability.“I (Kochhar) was the MD of ICICI bank but bank recalled my earlier resignation and converted it into termination,” he said, adding, “This was wrong as it was against the norms”.Rohatgi said that Kochhar’s resignation was changed into a termination and there was no prior approval.“The RBI was under obligation. You cannot convert resignation into termination. There is no question of termination as there was no previous approval as per the clause,” he said.The bench observed, “As far as we understand, it is the RBI who can raise the issue with the bank. You were in service with a private bank. RBI has to deal with the bank saying that no approval was taken.”Rohatgi said for a certain class of employees, prior approval was needed.“You show us a judgement which says that you have a role, then your writ petition will be maintainable,” the bench told Rohatgi.After Rohatgi referred to some judgements, the bench said: “RBI has given post-facto approval. You are saying there was no prior approval. You are saying that it is not the proper manner. Your whole grievance is against the private bank. There cannot be grievance with RBI.”To this, Rohatgi said: “No. My whole grievance is against the RBI.”He said if the RBI had not granted approval then Kochhar’s termination would have been nullified.“What about my (Kochhar’s) reputation,” Rohatgi argued.The bench observed: “You can claim damages if your reputation is tarnished and if it was wrong.”Rohatgi said “everything cannot be damages” and the RBI could be asked to explain its approval as the RBI had no jurisdiction to give post-facto approval.Kochhar was terminated from the ICICI Bank months after she had voluntarily left the second-largest private sector lender.The former banker had moved the Bombay High Court on November 30, 2019, challenging the “termination” of her employment by the ICICI Bank.She had contended before the high court that the bank also denied her remuneration and clawed back all the bonuses and stock options between April 2009 and March 2018, for her alleged role in granting out of turn loans to the Videocon Group which purportedly benefitted her husband Deepak Kochhar.Her counsel had earlier argued in the high court that her termination came months after the bank approved her voluntary resignation on October 5, 2018, and therefore, the termination was “illegal, untenable and unsustainable in law”.The ICICI Bank had then filed an affidavit, contending the reliefs in the petition are not maintainable and it deserves to be dismissed as ICICI is a private bank and is administered under the Companies Act, not the state or its agency.On November 20, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had assured the Apex Court that it would not take any coercive action against Chanda Kochhar in a separate money laundering case.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the Apex Court that ED would not take any coercive step in pursuance of the enforcement case information report (ECIR) registered in the ICICI Bank-Videocon Group loan case. ECIR is equivalent to a police FIR.The ED has recently filed a charge sheet against Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot on money laundering charges.The Kochhars, Dhoot and others have denied the allegations.ED has slapped money laundering charges against the Kochhars and their business entities for “illegal sanctioning of loans amounting to Rs 1,875 crore to the Videocon Group of companies”.

You have to be careful,” Justice Chandrachud had observed.In June, a lawyer had appeared in a virtual hearing in the apex court while lying on bed and donning a T-shirt, drawing displeasure of the judge who observed that "minimum court etiquette" should be followed given the public nature of hearings.The apex court had observed that lawyers appearing in matters via video-conferencing should be "presentable" and avoid showing images which are not appropriate.In April this year, a similar incident had come to light when a lawyer had appeared in a bail hearing conducted through video-conferencing in a vest, drawing the ire of the Rajasthan High Court.The high court had criticised the advocate for not appearing in proper uniform during the hearing.

They were mowed down by bullets fired from the rooftops.Eight days later, on July 10, Dubey was shot dead by police when he was allegedly trying to escape from police custody while being brought back to Kanpur after his arrest in Ujjain.The SIT was initially asked to submit its report by July 31 after looking into all angles, studying related documents and conducting inspections in Kanpur. The deadline was later extended by the government.

The 24-hour average AQI was 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".The maximum wind speed is expected to be 8 kmph on  Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department.The minimum temperature was 8.1 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and the maximum is expected to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the "very poor" category due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the "severe" category between December 4 and December 7, it said.The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – will be around 2,000 m2/s on Tuesday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution has reduced as the harvesting season has ended.The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's PM2.5 levels was 7 percent on Monday and 6 percent on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-remains-very-poor-178402

Can such people be called terrorists?" Sirsa asked.Peaceful sit-ins by farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, continued for the sixth day at the Singhu and Tikri borders.The farmers, who on Sunday had announced that they would block five points of entry into Delhi in coming days while rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, said they had come for a decisive battle and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their "mann ki baat".

We all are indebted to the hard work of farmers. This debt will be over only by giving them justice and their rights, and not by mistreating them or by beating them with batons or using tear gas against them," he said in a tweet in Hindi."Wake up and come down from the chair of arrogance and think of giving the farmers their rights," he also said.The Centre has invited agitating farmer unions for talks on Tuesday.

01-12-2020||Kolkata||UNESCO chief wants timely probe in Assam journalist’s death||Director-General of UNESCO Audrey Azoulay has called on the Indian authorities to clarify the circumstances surrounding the death of journalist Parag Bhuyan, who was fatally injured on November 11 in a hit and run car accident in Kakopathar, Assam.The driver who hit the journalist was arrested on the day following the incident.“I deplore the death of Parag Bhuyan. I trust that the Indian authorities will ensure a timely investigation to shed light on the circumstances of Parag Bhuyan’s death. No effort should be spared to enable journalists to exercise their profession safety, without let or hindrance”, a press release posted on UNESCO website (en.unesco.org) on Monday quoted Azoulay as having said.Bhuyan, an experienced journalist of the Pratidin Time group, specialized in issues relating to corruption and local crime, added the press release.The Editors’ Guild of India also recently wrote to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal expressing concern about “growing incidents of violence against journalists in Assam”.The Guild’s letter mentioned the unnatural death of Bhuyam who was run over by a car. According to the editor of the paper Bhuyan was working for, the reporter was murdered for exposing corruption and illegal activities in the Kakopathar area of Assam.The letter, signed by Guild president Seema Mustafa, general secretary Sanjay Kapoor and treasurer Anant Nath, also mentioned the recent incident of journalist Milan Mahanta being tied to a pole and beaten mercilessly for daring to expose land and gambling mafia of Kamrup district.

01-12-2020||Washington||US govt opposes release of Tahawwur Rana, says he is a flight risk||The US government has moved a motion in a federal court in California opposing the release of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who has been declared a fugitive by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack case, describing him a flight risk.Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai terror strike in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.Rana is a declared fugitive in India. His extradition hearing is scheduled for February 12.In a motion filed before the US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chelonian, on Monday, US attorney Nicola T Hanna urged the court to deny Rana’s motion for release for failure to prove that he was not a flight risk or that special circumstances exist and continue to detain him pending resolution of this extradition proceeding.Hanna’s motion comes in opposition to the latest effort of Rana to avoid detention pending extradition, by capitalising on the developments of the COVID-19 pandemic.Rana’s attorney has argued that pandemic warrants his release from custody.Hanna said a fugitive facing extradition is entitled to bail only if he could demonstrate that he was not a flight risk, was not a danger to the community, and that “special circumstances” warranted his release from custody.Rana in his court filing has said the Bureau of Prison (BOP) was unable to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and as such he should be released from custody. Hanna argued that BOP was committed to fighting COVID-19 and protecting the inmates in its custody.“In addition to ignoring the BOP’s ability to manage the pandemic, Rana ignores the significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the population in which he wishes to be released,” Hanna said, adding, unlike the BOP, Rana will not have immediate access to frequent COVID testing, and should he test positive, treatment.Following the increase of COVID-19 cases, Los Angeles Metropolitan Detention Centre began testing inmates, including Rana. MDC-LA has not received the results of his COVID-19 test conducted on November 27. Accordingly, it has placed Rana in isolation, pending confirmation that he is not positive for COVID-19.In denying Rana’s initial motion for release in July, the court had said he constituted a flight risk given his significant foreign contacts and the possibility he could face a death sentence in India.The court further found that this extreme risk of flight was not mitigated by the approximately $1.5 million of property and cash offered by Rana’s associates.

01-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt will reach a solution after discussing their issues, Tomar says before meeting farmers||The government on Tuesday expressed confidence that it would reach a solution after discussing issues raised by protesting farmers, as a meeting got under way between union ministers and representatives of over 30 farmer organisations.For the meeting at Vigyan Bhawan here, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar was accompanied by Railways and Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, also an MP from Punjab."We are ready for a discussion to resolve their issues.

01-12-2020||United Nations||India recorded largest reduction in malaria cases in South-East Asia from 2000-2019: WHO||India made “strong progress” in the fight against malaria, recording the largest reduction in cases in South-East Asia from 20 million in 2000 to about 5.6 million last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.The World Malaria Report 2020, released Monday, said that in 2019, malaria cases globally numbered about 229 million, an annual estimate that has remained virtually unchanged over the last four years.Last year, the disease claimed about 409,000 lives, compared to 411,000 in 2018."Countries in South-East Asia made particularly strong progress, with reductions in cases and deaths of 73 per cent and 74 per cent, respectively. India contributed to the largest drop in cases region-wide – from approximately 20 million to about 6 million,” WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the report's forward.The report said that the WHO South-East Asia Region accounted for about 3 per cent of the burden of malaria cases globally.Malaria cases reduced by 73 per cent in the region, from 23 million in 2000 to about 6.3 million in 2019.WHO noted the “impressive gains” made by India in the fight against malaria, with reductions in cases and deaths of 18 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, over the last 2 years.India also recorded decrease in number of deaths from malaria between 2000 and 2019.Malaria deaths in India declined from about 29,500 in 2000 to about 7700 last year, the report said.In the WHO South-East Asia Region, malaria deaths reduced by 74 per cent, from about 35,000 in 2000 to 9,000 in 2019.India, however, still accounted for 88 per cent of malaria cases and 86 per cent of malaria deaths in the WHO South-East Asia Region in 2019.The WHO is calling on countries and global health partners to step up the fight against malaria, a preventable and treatable disease that continues to claim hundreds of thousands of lives each year.A better targeting of interventions, new tools and increased funding are needed to change the global trajectory of the disease and reach internationally-agreed targets.The report noted that the 11 highest burden countries - Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, India, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania - account for 70 per cent of the global estimated case burden and 71 per cent of global estimated deaths from malaria.According to the WHO report, progress against malaria continues to plateau, particularly in high burden countries in Africa.Gaps in access to life-saving tools are undermining global efforts to curb the disease, and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to set back the fight even further.                         As in past years, the African Region shouldered more than 90 per cent of the overall disease burden.Since 2000, the region has reduced its malaria death toll by 44 per cent, from an estimated 680,000 to 384,000 annually.However, progress has slowed in recent years, particularly in countries with a high burden of the disease.A funding shortfall at both the international and domestic levels poses a significant threat to future gains.In 2019, total funding reached USD 3 billion against a global target of USD 5.6 billion.Funding shortages have led to critical gaps in access to proven malaria control tools.This year, COVID-19 emerged as an additional challenge to the provision of essential health services worldwide.According to the report, most malaria prevention campaigns were able to move forward this year without major delays.Ensuring access to malaria prevention – such as insecticide-treated nets and preventive medicines for children – has supported the COVID-19 response strategy by reducing the number of malaria infections and, in turn, easing the strain on health systems.                  WHO worked swiftly to provide countries with guidance to adapt their responses and ensure the safe delivery of malaria services during the pandemic, the report said.

Demanding that those camping at Nirankari Ground in Burari be allowed to return to the Singhu border, they stressed they would not change their stand on the three “black” agri laws and warned the PM to listen to their ‘mann ki baat’ or else the government would have to “pay dearly” for it.In Varanasi, addressing a public meeting, the PM said: “We are seeing a new trend in the country. Protests are based on creating doubts through misinformation. We must remember that those doing so are the ones who had for decades deceived the farmers.” He also claimed that crops worth much more were procured during the first tenure of his BJP-led NDA government than during the Congress-led UPA-II government. The PM said that small farmers would now be able to take legal action on deals struck outside the mandis, which would protect them from being cheated. “I want to tell them (farmers) that our intentions are as pure as Ganga... Those who have doubts about these laws will see the benefits in future,” he stressed.Meanwhile, more protesters have converged on the borders of the national Capital, prompting the Delhi Police to enhance security and place concrete barriers at all entry points from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The farmers, who had on Sunday announced that they would block five points of entry into Delhi in the coming days, said they had come for a decisive battle. Peaceful protests continued for the fifth day at the Singhu and Tikri borders.‘Can’t weaken our resolve’Flaying the government for its ‘farmers being misled’ claim, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha leader GS Charuni said: “We want to tell Modi if they (govt) think our resolve will weaken, they are mistaken. Let this be a warning. He (PM) should defuse the situation at the earliest or else we may have to take harsher steps.” An angry Balbir S Rajewal of the BKU said: “The PM has a forked-tongue. He is selling the country to corporates.”Amit Shah assesses situationAfter his meeting with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Agri Minister Narendra Singh Tomar at the Delhi residence of BJP chief JP Nadda on Sunday night, Union Home Minister Amit Shah met Tomar again on Monday morning for an assessment of the ground situation.Farmers misledThe farmers are being deceived on these historic agriculture reform laws by the same people who have misled them for decades.

We need to create conditions for stability and economic sustainability - Venkaiah Naidu, VP“We are particularly concerned about states that leverage terrorism as an instrument of state policy. The most important challenge faced by us is terrorism, particularly cross-border terrorism,” said Vice President Venkaiah Naidu here while chairing the virtual meet of the Council of Heads of Government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).Parts of several SCO countries are in an “arc of radicalism” stretching from Pakistan to the Caucasus running through several central Asian countries. The Vice President’s observations seemed to hint at Pakistan, but MEA’s Secretary (West) Vikas Swarup said at a media briefing that the SCO’s charter prohibits the raising of bilateral issues. “We do not raise bilateral issues and expect others to do the same,” he said. Naidu also expressed similar sentiments in his opening address: “It is unfortunate to note that deliberate attempts have been made to bring bilateral issues in the SCO forum. Such acts are counterproductive. We should respect each others’ territorial integrity and sovereignty.”His reference was to the Pakistani representative putting up a map behind him at the SCO NSA’s virtual summit that inaccurately depicted Kashmir. NSA Ajit Doval had then walked out of the virtual meeting.India is hosting a SCO CHG summit for the first time since it became a full member in 2017. The highest body is the SCO Heads of State summit whose last virtual meeting, chaired by Vladimir Putin from Moscow, was addressed among others by PM Modi, Imran Khan and Xi Jinping.Over 60 per cent of the vaccines for the global immunisation programme are being manufactured in India. This production and delivery capacity will be used to help all the countries in fighting this crisis, assured Naidu.He also sought fair and transparent trade as the world recovers from the pandemic-induced disruption.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/terror-main-threat-to-region-india-at-sco-178278

The Centre has initiated a robust vaccine manufacturing and delivery ecosystem to meet the demand,” the government said.The PM today followed up his three-city visit to the facilities of Zydus in Ahmedabad, Serum Institute in Pune and Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad with a virtual review of the progress of indigenous vaccine development undertaken by Gennova Biopharma of Pune and Biological E and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories in Hyderabad today.

This grant will go to the Department of Biotechnology for Research and Development of Indian Covid-19 vaccines and ensure that they are fast-tracked for introduction in public health systems, subject to regulatory clearances.Ten vaccine candidates have been supported by the biotechnology department so far at academia and industry level and of these five are in human trials stage.Meanwhile, India saw 38,772 new infections in 24 hours as against higher recoveries 45,333 over the same period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-party-covid-meet-on-dec-4-178279

The rapidly growing petitions have in fact been started by Indian nationals living in the UK, Canada and the US.A large part of Indian diaspora in these countries comprises Sikhs from India’s Punjab province, which also happens to be the hotbed of the ongoing farmers’ agitation.The biggest petition among these was started by the American Sikh Council and has been signed by over 50,000 people over the last three days. Similarly, a petition by Prabhjot Bath, a resident of the UK, has received over 50,000 signatures.Another rapidly growing petition, titled “Justice for farmers of India”, was started by Canada-based Gina Takhar on Saturday. Mindy Athwal’s petition, started from Wolverhampton in the UK, has been signed by over 30,000 persons, while a similar number of people have signed another petition by Parminder Brar, a resident of Canada. A petition by Ravinder Uppal from Birmingham in the UK has been signed by almost 10,000 citizens, while another one started by US-based Kiran Badesha has received over 4,000 signatures.“The backbone, sweat and tears of our farmers have fed millions and raised generations of Indians.

However, some like Chandigarh resident Shubh Karman wants Navdeep Singh, son of a farmer, to be acquitted in his petition.

Navdeep was charged with attempt to murder.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/digital-support-pours-in-lakhs-sign-petitions-178291
