Says India sends dirt up into the air India 'air is filthy'. Called India 'tariff king'. The result of 'Howdy Modi'," Sibal tweeted.Another party leader, Anand Sharma, said, "President Donald Trump has insulted 'Namaste India' and exposed his lack of knowledge on climate change and the Paris Agreement." "A fact check would have told him that the US is the largest polluter historically and its per capita green-house gas emissions are six times India's 'filthy air'," the former External Affairs minister said. Trump has accused China, India and Russia of not taking care of their "filthy air" as he justified America's withdrawal from the "unfair" Paris climate agreement.Trump, a known climate change sceptic, wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protection in America.  "Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India, it's filthy. The air is filthy," Trump said during the final presidential debate with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday night.

And after they win, they think only about their families," he said in an apparent attack on the RJD and its supremo Lalu Prasad."For these people, family just means the husband, wife, son and daughter. But for me, the entire Bihar is my family," he added.Referring to the Bhagalpur riots of 1989-90, he said that the past governments had not done anything for justice."But when we got the opportunity to work, we got it probed and took action. We gave the victims Rs 2,500 financial aid raised it Rs 5,000 after 2013."He also responded to the opposition's attack on his government over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the migrant crisis.He said everybody knows about the aid handed out by the Centre during the crisis.He said special trains were run with the help of the Centre to bring back Bihari migrants stranded elsewhere.Kumar said the pandemic has affected the entire world but India has put up an impressive fight under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi."It is because of the cooperation that we received from the Centre that our people could come back by trains and the state's coronavirus recovery rate has reached 94 per cent," he said.The chief minister said that 500-bed hospitals were set up with the help of the Centre, ration cardholders were given Rs 1,000 each and the state government also handed over ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh to those who died because of coronavirus.During the day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and the RJD's Tejashwi Yadav raised several questions over the government's handling of the pandemic and the migrant crises.Kumar also attacked the past government over law and order.

However, she claimed that she did not receive any such intimation by the company.“Firstly, I did not change my email address... and secondly, I did not receive any email from Amazon regarding the aforementioned change in my email address,” Aggarwal, a Supreme Court lawyer, claimed, adding that she had asked the company to resend the intimation mail they sent her in June but got it only in August.She alleged that her account was hacked, credentials changed and orders placed, like earphones worth Rs 3,887, and even Amazon Pay activated on the account but the transactions were not carried out by her.She said she later got a reminder from the company to clear her Amazon Pay Later (an Amazon service to get credit and return in EMIs) payments pending since August 5.“Immediately upon receiving the Amazon Pay Later repayment reminder on August 8, I wrote a mail to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, narrating the whole incident and also forewarning that if no action is taken by Amazon, I shall be constrained to file an FIR,” Aggarwal alleged.“I again received an Amazon Pay Later repayment reminder mail on August 9 for clearing dues pending since August 5. On August 11, I received a mail from the office of Jeff Bezos, CEO, Amazon stating that my Amazon Account security breach issue has been investigated and resolved. I state that the same is not true. I was never informed of the results of the investigation conducted by Amazon, or my query being resolved as my Amazon account continues to remain suspended and I continue to receive the Amazon Pay Later repayment reminder mails,” she alleged.Aggarwal said she again informed the office of Bezos but has not been contacted by Amazon thereafter, nor received any update or intimation electronically.“Instead, yet again I have received an Amazon Pay Later repayment reminder mail on August 13,” she claimed.The FIR has been lodged under Indian Penal Code section 420 (cheating) and under provisions of the Information Technology Act, the police said.

Considering everything, in fact I dont like the word package, but we will give Rs 10,000-crore assistance. This moneywill be used for different purposes," Thackeray told reporters here. "We will try to give this entire help till Diwali."It will be our honest effort to see that there are no tears in the eyes of farmers, he added.Thackeray said that the government will do whatever it takes to give relief to the affected people and will take loan if need be.The chief minister said he will also speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue or meet him, if required.Thackeray said that a sum of Rs 5,500 crore, out of the total Rs 10,000-crore assistance, will be provided to the agriculture sector.For repairing damaged bridges and roads, an amount of Rs 2,635 crore will be made available, while for rural roads and drinking water supply restoration, Rs 1,000 crore will be spent.The urban development, energy and water resources departments will be given Rs 300 crore, Rs 239 crore and Rs 102 crore, respectively.Thackeray said that the MVA government has so far provided assistance of Rs 30,800 crore for different purposes, including farm loan waiver.The chief minister said the state government had sought central help of Rs 1,065 crore for giving relief to those hit by cyclone Nisarga (in eary June) and Rs 800.88 crore for helping people affected by floods in East Vidarbha in August.But the state government has not received any help from the Centre yet, he said.The chief minister demanded the Centre send its teams to assess the damage caused by heavy rains and subsequent floods in parts of the state this month.Meanwhile, NCP president Sharad Pawar, whose party is an ally in the ruling coalition, welcomed the governments move.They (the government) have said that the relief will be given immediately...I am sure those in the power will stand behind farmers strongly, Pawar said at a party event to induct former BJP leader Eknath Khadse into the NCP.However, Leader of Opposition in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP criticised the Thackeray-led government over the assistance announced for the flood-hit people.Referring to the demands made by Thackeray during the crop loss last year, when he was a BJP ally, Fadnavis said, "Earlier, Thackeray himself had demanded financial assistance of Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 per hectare for rain-affected farmers."He had even demanded compensation of Rs 1 lakh per hectare. But today's announcement has betrayed the trust of farmers."The Maha Vikas Aghadi government was showing budgeted provisions as a special package and trying to portray a false picture of helping farmers, the BJP leader alleged.

Turkey was pressing for Pakistan’s progress on the remaining points to be considered proof of good intentions and wanted FATF to close the matter with an on-site inspection.Pakistani diplomats said they would now make another attempt to get out of the grey list at the next FATF meeting in June next year.The deadline for Pakistan to complete its FATF file was June this year, but it earned a reprieve after the plenary was postponed due to the pandemic.The MEA had on Thursday said Pakistan has addressed only 21 action items so far out of a total of 27. “As is well known, Pakistan continues to provide safe havens to terrorist entities and individuals and has also not yet taken any action against those proscribed by the UNSC such as Masood Azhar, Dawood Ibrahim, Zakir-ur-Rahman Lakhvi etc,’’ said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.Pakistan has been under pressure from the international community for well over two years to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing.Pakistan had in August imposed financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including masterminds of Mumbai and Pulwama attacks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-stays-on-fatf-grey-list-for-terror-funding-160080

If you do so then the question of the respondent (BARC) taking any coercive steps does not arise,” the court said.The BARC had on April 27 issued a show-cause notice to the petitioner after the statistical data provided by BARC’s Measurement Science Team allegedly showed abnormal and inexplicable increase in viewership.Finding the media group’s response unsatisfactory, the BARC on July 31 asked the network to pay Rs 5 lakh as fine.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||Government imposes stock limits on onion traders to check prices||To boost domestic supply and provide relief to consumers from rising onion prices, the Centre on Friday imposed stock limits on both retailers and wholesalers with immediate effect till December 31.Now, retailers can stock onion only up to 2 tonne, whereas wholesale traders are allowed to keep up to 25 tonne. This will check hoarding and blackmarketing, it said.Onion prices have shot up sharply to over Rs 75 per kg in the past few weeks in the wake of damage to the standing kharif crop in producing areas due to heavy rainfall as well as hoarding.Addressing media, Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan said, “This is a decisive step. We have imposed stock limits on onion traders with an immediate effect till December 31 after concerns that traders were releasing their stored stocks slowly, creating artificial price rise situation.”     She said the government had to invoke the recently passed Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which provides regulation of agri-commodities “only” in the times of extraordinary price rise situation.“Under this law, normally, we would not be regulating agri-food stuff like cereals and onion. But, in times of extraordinary price rise, we can regulate if the retail price breaches the trigger levels specified in the law,” she said.In case of onion, the average all-India retail price of onion of Rs 55.60 per kg that prevailed on October 21 breached the trigger level as per the formula specified under the EC Amendment Act, she said.The all-India average retail price of Rs 55.60 per kg was higher by 22.12 per cent compared with last year’s rates of Rs 45.33 per kg and by 114.96 per cent as against average rate that prevailed in past five years. So, the retail price had actually more than doubled and, therefore, decided to impose the stock limits on the commodity, she added.Later, Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted that the Modi government has taken third step to curb hoarding and check prices. Stock limits have been imposed on retailers and wholesale traders of onion.The government said action under the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980, would be taken to prevent any hoarding, black marketing of onions by unscrupulous elements.Highlighting other measures taken to cool down the spiralling trend in onion prices, the secretary said the government has decided to augment domestic supplies through imports for which state-owned MMTC would soon float a tender for red onions to meet the demand supply gap.Recently, the government relaxed fumigation and phytosanitary norms for import of onion and activated Indian consulates to facilitate trade, she said.The secretary said the government had taken a pre-emptive step by announcing a ban on onion export on September 14 itself so as to ensure availability to domestic consumers at reasonable rates, before the expected arrival of kharif onion from next month.“Thus, the retail price rise was moderated to some extent but recent reports of heavy rainfall in the onion-growing districts of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have created concerns about damage to kharif crop,” she said.She also said the developments on the weather front have contributed to the sharp increase in onion prices.However, to tide over the present situation, the government has stepped up offloading of onion from its buffer stock of 1 lakh tonne created in 2019-20, which is being carried out swiftly but in a calibrated manner from the second half of September, she said.The secretary further said onion from the government’s buffer stock is being sold in major mandis as well as retail suppliers such as Safal, Kendriya Bhandar, NCCF, and NAFED outlets in major cities and also via states.Currently, Assam and Kerala governments are being supplied from the retail disposal mechanism. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Lakshadweep have also placed their requisition for onions, which are being dispatched, she said.Further, onions are also being disposed of through open market sales and this will be stepped up further to bring down the price rise.The government said kharif crop is likely to hit mandis from next month. The estimated arrival of 37 lakh tonne of kharif onion crop will improve availability, she added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-imposes-stock-limits-on-onion-traders-to-check-prices-160074

If we take adequate precaution and follow COVID appropriate behaviour in the coming festival and winter season, we will be in a better position to fight coronavirus,” Vardhan said.“For a big state like Uttar Pradesh, it becomes important that maximum thrust is given to simple precautionary measures which are effective in preventing the spread of the disease to a large extent like wearing masks/face cover, especially in public spaces, and following hand and respiratory etiquettes,” he added.The health minister also spoke to officials of the districts where fresh COVID-19 cases or deaths are increasing.He said as on date, Uttar Pradesh has a fatality rate of 1.46 per cent which is less than the national average. The recovery rate of the state (92.2 per cent) is also more than the national recovery rate. The positivity rate is 3.44 per cent, the statement said.Vardhan also stressed that the northern state needs to focus on increasing testing, surveillance, contact tracing and early diagnosis to keep the fatality rate low. He appreciated the efforts of the state in vaccinating those children who were left out of immunisation due to the pandemic, it added.

23-10-2020||---||US poll: Indian-Americans can swing results in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia,Texas and North Carolina||New Delhi, October 23Joe Biden, Democratic Party’s nominee for the US presidential elections, did not touch on India during the two debates with contender and President Donald Trump.But in an op-ed written for the influential IndiaWest media group, Biden wrote on why he is confident of the Indian-American vote going towards him.With Trump’s “Indian air is filthy’’ comment still reverberating, Biden contrasted his “long-lasting’’ ties with the Indian-American community as opposed to the US President’s transactional nature.“And as we value the Indian-American diaspora, we’ll continue to value the US-India relationship. For Donald Trump, it’s photo-ops. For me, it’s getting things done,” he said in a reference to Trump’s two stadium addresses with PM Modi. The Indian-American electorate of nearly 20 lakh can make the difference in tightly contested states such as North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Texas.“This lasting relationship continues on this campaign, including at the top with Kamala Harris as the Vice Presidential nominee,’’ wrote Biden while pointing out that one of the last events he hosted at the Vice President’s residence was a Diwali reception.“But the truth is, President Trump doesn’t share our values. As a result, today’s America doesn’t feel like the America of our dreams.’’Biden’s observations on affordable health care and home, free education and restoring H-1B visas would be words of comfort for the largely middle class Indian-Americans seeking stability. In contrast, Trump has asked the Supreme Court to wipe out the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, clamped down on legal immigration and is opposed to free education, wrote the former US Vice President.“It’s likely you and your family have been caught in the middle of Trump’s crackdown of legal immigration and his decisions on the H-1B visa program. And his dangerous rhetoric about immigrants has even fueled hate crimes against Indian Americans,’’ wrote Biden.On education, he promised free college tuition for families making less than $ 125,000 a year, and help Indian American families through a first-time home buyer’s credit worth up to $15,000.Biden also sought to address India’s concerns regarding terrorism and China by promising to work  with New Delhi to promote regional peace and stability where “neither China nor any other country threatens its neighbors.’’“We’ll open markets and grow the middle class in both the US and India,’’ he also assured.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-poll-indian-americans-can-swing-results-in-virginia-pennsylvania-michigan-georgia-texas-and-north-carolina-160070

23-10-2020||New Delhi||Army Chief Naravane to visit Nepal to bolster bilateral ties||Indian Army Chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane, will be visiting Nepal for two days early in November in a bid to strengthen the bilateral relationship that was undergoing through a rough patch.During his visit November 4-6, he will meet his Nepalese counterpart Gen Purna Chandra Thapa, President Vidya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.Naravane would be conferred the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army at an investiture ceremony during his visit.His visit, seen as an attempt to reboot the relationship between the two countries and explore further avenues for defence cooperation, follows Research and Analysis Wing (RA&W) chief Samant Kumar Goel’s visit to Kathmandu on Thursday where he also met Prime Minister Oli.Goel’s discussions with Oli focussed on not allowing any interruption in friendly relations between the two countries and resolving all outstanding issues through dialogue and continuing mutual cooperation.Ties between the two countries came under strain recently after China increased its influence in Nepal.It was India’s road construction in the Lipulekh area at 17,000 feet that had sparked a diplomatic row as Kathmandu claimed the area to be its territory. The road was constructed to shorten the travel time for pilgrims visiting the Kailash Mansarovar.Lipulekh is a tri-junction between India, Nepal and China situated atop the Kalapani Valley in Uttarakhand. After this, Nepal brought out a new political map showing the contested area as its own. India has rejected this new map, saying it is not based on historical facts or evidence.Taking the strains between India and Nepal as an opportunity, China, which is already having a border dispute with India in eastern Ladakh, increased its troop deployment at Lipulekh.Its 150th Light Combined Arms Brigade was moved in August to the Lipulekh tri-junction, while the People’s Liberation Army had also reinforced troops in Pala, around 10 km from the Indian border.In July itself, around 1,000 troops were deployed near Pala and a permanent post was built there by China. In August, 2,000 more additional troops were deployed at the post. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-chief-naravane-to-visit-nepal-to-bolster-bilateral-ties-160061

Hence, regional cooperation is very important in conserving them,” Dr Jena said.Mishra said the mission to rejuvenate Ganga, which is habitat of bulk of Gangetic dolphin, is also linked to conservation of the animal.Namami Gange project, carried out by NMCG has given importance to biodiversity and ecological improvement, including dolphin conservation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced “Dolphin Project” on the lines of “Project Tiger” which has helped in improving population of the big cat in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-nepal-bangladesh-and-myanmar-join-hands-for-conservation-of-dolphins-160058

Sensing that something suspicious was going on inside the bus, the constable boarded the vehicle to check but the attendants and the co-driver overpowered him and made him sit on the floor. The bus then sped away, police said.           The attendants and co-driver also snatched Sachin’s service pistol and two mobile phones. When he resisted, they manhandled him. Seeing this, a few passengers on board objected but they were also threatened, a senior police officer said.The accused then released the constable at Makkhanpur area near Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh.With the help of local people, the constable managed to reach Makkhanpur police station and informed his seniors about the incident, the officer said.During investigation, police found that the bus was operated by a man named Munna alias Rajeev Chaurasia and his son Ankit.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||New Parliament Building to be completed by October 2022: Lok Sabha Secretariat||Construction of a new Parliament building will begin in December this year and is likely to be completed by October 2022, while necessary measures have been put in place to ensure that Parliament sessions can be held uninterrupted during this period in the existing buildings, Lok Sabha Secretariat said on Friday.Officials also said that sufficient steps have been taken to control air and noise pollution during the construction work for the new parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs and those will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating ‘paperless offices’.The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India’s democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for the upper house members, sources said after a review meeting chaired by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses.At present, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha of 245.The ground-breaking ceremony is expected to be held in December and may be attended by President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, besides the presiding officers of the two houses among other dignitaries including political leaders.The existing building is a British era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi.The Foundation Stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921 and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on January 18, 1927, by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin.At the meeting, Birla said there should be no compromise in ensuring quality control and timely completion of the work relating to the new Parliament House.A monitoring committee will be constituted to oversee the construction work, which would include officers of Lok Sabha Secretariat, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, CPWD, NDMC and architect/designer of the project.Last month, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.In a statement, the Lok Sabha Secretariat said Birla chaired a review meeting regarding the construction of the new Parliament House today. The meeting was also attended by Union Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri.During the meeting, Birla was briefed about the progress made in the shifting of facilities and other infrastructure from the area proposed for the construction of the new building.“The barricading plan and the various mitigating measures to control the air and noise pollution during the construction process were elaborated. The officers of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs further briefed Birla about the proposed movement plan of VIPs and staff during this period, including during Parliament sessions,” the statement said.The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building, officers said.Reviewing the various aspects and progress of the project, Birla stressed on the smooth coordination and resolving issues between various agencies involved on a regular basis.The ‘Constitution Hall’ will house the original copy of the Constitution, digital displays for showcasing India’s democratic heritage etc. Visitors will be given access to this hall to help them to appreciate and understand India’s journey as a parliamentary democracy.The redevelopment project of Central Vista—the nation’s power corridor—envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.Under the Central Vista redevelopment project, the prime minister’s residence and office are also likely to be shifted near the South Block and the vice-president’s new house will be in the vicinity of the North Block.According to the plan, the vice-president’s current residence is among those buildings identified by the government for demolition in Lutyens’ Delhi for the purpose of the project. There are plans to convert the North and South Blocks, which symbolise the government’s authority since their inception in Lutyens’ Delhi, into museums.Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has designed the Central Vista redevelopment project. The firm has the responsibility of preparing the master plan of the project, including designs landscape and traffic integration plans, and parking facilities among others.In September last year, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the British ruled India for 190 years and they had good architects who built buildings that is now part of the country’s cultural heritage.The government is likely to demolish buildings such as Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan and Shastri Bhawan to facilitate a new Central Secretariat that will house offices of several ministries. Puri had said that buildings that had been built in 1960s and 70s should have been torn down many years ago.The existing building is a massive circular edifice of 560 feet in diameter.The Parliament House Estate is enclosed by an ornamental red sandstone wall or iron grills with iron gates that can be closed when occasions demand. The building has in all twelve gates.Estimated to cost Rs 20,000, the Central Vista redevelopment project has come under major criticism from historians and opposition leaders. Critics accuse the government of trying to rewrite history through the project. Some critics have questioned the need to undertake such a massive project at a time of a major economic crisis.  --- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-parliament-building-to-be-completed-by-october-2022-lok-sabha-secretariat-160049
23-10-2020||Hisua/Bhagalpur (Bihar)||PM Modi ‘insulted’ soldiers, did not help migrants: Rahul in Bihar||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having “insulted” the soldiers with his comment that nobody had intruded into Indian territory in Ladakh, and also alleged that his government did not help the migrant workers from Bihar during the lockdown.Addressing his first poll rallies in the state, Gandhi said the BJP’s election promise of providing 19 lakh jobs is akin to its pledge of depositing Rs 15 lakh in bank accounts of the people.Raising the China issues at both his rallies—the first at Hisua in Nawada district and another at Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur—he said the Chinese army had indeed intruded into the Indian territory, and the prime minister should tell the country when they will “be thrown out”.“They have seized 1,200 sq km of our land. But when the Chinese army intruded, why did our prime minister insult our soldiers by saying that nobody entered into the Indian side?” Gandhi said.“You ask any Army jawan, he will tell you that today the Chinese army is standing in the area which we used to patrol earlier. Our land has been snatched away from us,” he claimed.“The question is, Modi ji, when will you throw out the Chinese soldiers sitting in our territory?” he asked.Earlier in the day, the prime minister also addressed his first election rally in Bihar and referred to the Galwan Valley clash with Chinese troops, stating that the sons of Bihar laid down their lives for the tricolour but did not let “Mother India bow her head”.Upping the ante, Gandhi said that the prime minister who calls himself a nationalist and a patriot has weakened the country over the last six years.“Hindustan is weak today. Its economy is suppressed, farmers oppressed and small shopkeepers restless. That is why China has intruded into Indian territory,” he said.At his rally in Hisua, where the Congress’s Neetu Singh is contesting against sitting BJP MLA Anil Singh, Gandhi was joined by RJD leader and Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial face Tejashwi Yadav.The Congress leader also hit out at the Centre over the recent farm laws, saying that these have been brought to attack the farmers.“They had ended the mandi system and the MSP regime in Bihar already and now, they are doing that across the country,” Gandhi said.He also accused the prime minister of working for large corporates.“You say that you bow before the Army, the farmers, the labourers and small businesses, but when you go home you work for the Adanis and the Ambanis,” he said.He also alleged the government did not help migrant workers from Bihar during the lockdown.“Workers from Bihar were chased away from Delhi and other states. They travelled on foot. When you were walking hungry and thirsty, did Modi help you? Did he help workers of Bihar?” Gandhi asked.“When you were dying of starvation and walking thousands of kilometers, Modi didn’t offer you trains or buses,” he alleged.He also demanded that the prime minister tell Biharis how many jobs he gave them and when.“The BJP promising 19 lakh jobs in Bihar is akin to its pledge of depositing Rs 15 lakh in bank accounts of people,” he said.In its manifesto for the Bihar polls, the BJP has promised that it would provide 19 lakh jobs to the people in Bihar over five years.“You had promised two crore jobs before the last election. Did you fulfil that promise? No,” Gandhi claimed.He said the policies of the governments at the Centre and the state have broken the backbone of farmers, and medium and small businesses which used to create jobs.“The country and the state can no longer provide employment to its youth. This is the truth of our country now.Narendra Modi ji and Nitish ji have broken the backbone of farmers, labourers and small shopkeepers,” he said.The Congress has fielded Shubhanand Mukesh, son of sitting MLA Sadanand Singh, from Kahalgaon seat against Pawan Yadav of the BJP.At the Hisua rally, where Tejashwi Yadav also spoke, a huge gathering was seen.Tejashwi attacked the state government over several issues, and also said his father and party supremo Lalu Prasad will come out of jail on November 9 after securing bail in a fodder scam case, and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will have his farewell the next day.“This fight is not between Nitish and Tejashwi, neither is it between Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi. It is a fight between the people and a dictatorial government,” he said.As he ended his two rallies, Gandhi tweeted, “Whenever I go to Bihar, I get peoples affection and respect. But today, I witnessed another resolve among the people—a resolve for change. This resolve is imperative for getting rid of misrule.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-insulted-soldiers-did-not-help-migrants-rahul-in-bihar-160048
23-10-2020||Ahmedabad||Ishrat Jahan case: Discharge pleas of 3 cops rejected by CBI court||A special CBI court on Friday rejected the discharge applications moved by three policemen, including IPS officer GL Singhal, who are accused in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan alleged fake encounter case.The other two who moved the pleas are retired Deputy Superintendent of Police Tarun Barot and Sub Inspector Ananu Chaudhary.A fourth accused, retired Deputy SP JG Parmar, who had also moved a discharge plea died recently.Special CBI court judge VR Raval on Friday refused to drop proceedings against the three and directed the Central Bureau of Investigation to get prosecution sanction under section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the Gujarat government.Under Section 197 of the CrPC, government sanction is necessary for the prosecution of a public servant for an act done as part of official duty.The court, while admitting the policemen were discharging official duty, noted the CBI has not initiated “any process for getting sanction”.“The accused are involved in a serious case as there is an encounter by the accused police officers. Therefore, when it was established the accused acted while performing their official duties, the CBI ought to have got sanction. CBI should be directed to go for sanction for prosecution or to make declaration in this regard,” the court noted in its order.The accused sought discharge from the trial saying the investigating agency had not obtained the mandatory sanction from the government, and on grounds of parity as other accused were granted discharge last year after the state government refused to give sanction.Last year, the same CBI court had dropped proceedings against former police officers D G Vanzara and N K Amin in the fake encounter case after the Gujarat government refused to grant sanction to the CBI to prosecute them.In 2018, the court had discharged former Gujarat in charge DGP P P Pandey in the case.Ishrat Jahan, a 19-year-old from Mumbra near Mumbai, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjadali Akbarali Rana and Zeeshan Johar were killed by Gujarat police in an encounter on the outskirts of Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004.The police claimed the four were terrorists planning to kill then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.However, an HC-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) held that the encounter was fake, after which CBI registered a case against several police officials.

23-10-2020||Mumbai||We didn't leak information about Sushant Singh Rajput case: CBI to HC||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which is probing actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death told the Bombay High Court on Friday that it had not leaked any information related to the case to the media.Hearing PILs about "media trial" in the case, the court remarked that the media has become "polarised" and it was a question not of regulation but "checks and balances".Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, representing the CBI, asserted that the Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau, which are also probing cases related to the actor's death by suicide in June, too had not leaked any information.All the three central agencies had filed affidavits in the court stating that they had not leaked any probe-related information, he said."We know our responsibilities and there is no question of leaking information by any of the agencies," the ASG added.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni was hearing final arguments on public interest litigations seeking that the media be asked to be restrained in its coverage of the probe into the actor's death.The HC is hearing arguments on whether a statutory mechanism is required to control the TV news content.At an earlier hearing, the petitioners, which include a group of retired police officers, had claimed that news channels were broadcasting sensitive information.How were the channels getting access to such information, the petitioners asked, alleging that the probe agencies must have been their sources.The Union government, National Broadcasting Standards Authority and the news channels which are party to the case told the HC that the electronic media has a self-regulatory mechanism and the state must not have any control over their content.On Friday, as lawyers of news channels cited old judgments to argue against a statutory regulatory mechanism, the HC remarked that the media has changed."The media was neutral then (in the past). It is now highly polarised....This is not a question of regulation, this is a question of checks and balances. People forget where to draw lines. Do it within lines," the judges said."You want to criticize the government, do it. The issue is someone has died and the allegation is you are interfering," the HC said.The hearing will continue next week.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||'Didnt know 19 was a smaller number than 10': Chidambaram on BJP's 19 lakh jobs promise in Bihar||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Friday took a dig at the BJP for "mocking" RJD over its 10 lakh jobs promise and then itself talking about creating 19 lakh jobs in its Bihar election manifesto, saying he did not know that 19 was a smaller number than 10.In its Bihar election manifesto released on Thursday, the BJP sought to reach out to the youth with the promise of 19 lakh jobs in the next five years."After mocking the RJD for promising to create 10 lakh jobs, the NDA has promised to create 19 lakh jobs in Bihar if elected," Chidambaram tweeted."I did not know that 19 was a smaller number than 10. I think I should go back to primary school," he said.In another tweet, the former finance minister also attacked the government over the state of the economy."Principal Economic Adviser, Dr Sanyal, has joined the three distinguished gentlemen in trying to 'talk up' the economy," he said and cited that 34 out of 39 economists polled by a news agency have said that the fiscal stimulus "does not go far enough to significantly boost" the economy."Are the PM and FM listening?" Chidambaram asked.After the RBI Governor, the SEBI chief and the DEA secretary spoke on the economy, Chidambaram on Thursday had taken a dig at them, saying he wishes the economy was a "circus lion" that would respond to the stick of the ringmaster.

Low pressure area is the first stage of any cyclone and a well-marked low pressure area is the second stage.This is the third low pressure area that developed in the Bay of Bengal in October and the second to intensify into a depression.Issuing an impact based forecast for the northeastern states that are likely to be affected due to this, the IMD said localised flooding of roads, water logging in low-lying areas and closure of underpasses mainly in urban areas is expected.It also said there is a possibility of landslides in hilly areas of northeastern states, occasional reduction in visibility due to heavy rainfall and disruption of traffic in cities.The rains may also lead to damage to horticulture and standing crops in some areas due to inundation and squally winds and riverine flooding in some river catchments.Light to moderate rainfall at many places, with isolated heavy falls are likely over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on October 24, the IMD said.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||Republic TV's Arnab Goswami can use tagline ‘NATION WANTS TO KNOW' as part of speech: HC||The Delhi High Court Friday said Republic TV's editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami can use the tagline ‘NATION WANTS TO KNOW' as part of his speech or presentation.The high court noted in its order that Bennett Coleman and Co. Ltd, which has filed a suit against Goswami or ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, which owns Republic TV, has submitted that the journalist is free to use the same as part of his speech/presentation of any news channel.However, if Goswami or ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd choose to use ‘NATION WANTS TO KNOW' as a trademark regarding any of their goods/ services, they will have to maintain accounts for such usage and the accounts shall be filed in court regularly, it said.“Regarding the tagline NATION WANTS TO KNOW, no interim order is passed at this stage in favour of the plaintiff (Bennett Coleman). As submitted by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, defendant No. 2 (Goswami) is free to use the same as part of his speech/presentation of any news channel, etc,” Justice Jayant Nath said.Meanwhile, the court allowed an interim application of Bennett Coleman group and passed an interim injunction in its favour and against the defendants retraining them from using the trademark ‘NEWSHOUR' or any other mark which is deceptively similar to the trademark ‘NEWSHOUR' of the Bennett Coleman.The plaintiff has filed the suit seeking to restrain Goswami or ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd from using the trademark or title or tagline ‘NEWSHOUR' and ‘NATION WANTS TO KNOW' as it infringes its registered mark.The plaintiff said ‘Times Now' is a news channel operated by the plaintiff having several segments of programmes, one of which was launched in 2006 titled ‘THE NEWSHOUR' pertained to discussions, panel discussions and debates on current topics.It said Goswami, who was earlier associated with Times Now and resigned in 2016, launched his channel ‘Republic TV' and website www.republicworld.com, and they also filed trademark applications for registration of the mark ‘NATION WANTS TO KNOW', ‘ARNAB GOSWAMI NEWSHOUR' and ‘GOSWAMI NEWSHOUR SUNDAY' claiming proprietary rights.The journalist told the high court that viewers of the two news channels are well-informed, literate and can never associate or confuse between the shows or programmes aired on the respective news channels.He claimed that the Bennett Coleman's animosity with the Republic TV is well known and publicised and hence, there is no question of any passing off in such circumstances and alleged that the proceedings have been initiated in the form of vendetta litigation and merely in a purported attempt to harass and arm-twist the defendants.The high court said it was of the opinion that “it is only after evidence has been led that it can be ascertained as to whether the plaintiff was using the aforesaid mark as a trademark or it was merely being used as a form of speech in the course of conducting the news channel or in the course of carrying on interviews/presentations by defendant No. 2 (Goswami). These are aspects on which, prima facie, no view can be made at this stage based on the documents placed on record, namely, screenshots of various sites of Twitter, Facebook, etc.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/republic-tvs-arnab-goswami-can-use-tagline-nation-wants-to-know-as-part-of-speech-hc-160027
23-10-2020||Aditi Tandon||Convalescent plasma doesn’t stop COVID deaths or severity: ICMR study in BMJ||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 23The enthusiasm around the protein-rich convalescent plasma, generated in the earlier days of the COVID-19 pandemic, has been shattered with a path-breaking study by Indian researchers published on Friday in the reputed British medical journal showing that the therapy neither prevents deaths nor progression of moderate disease to severe.The excitement around plasma therapy stemmed from its 100-year history of use in the treatment of other infectious diseases, including influenza and Ebola, and rapid availability from voluntary donors.However, experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in this latest study on 464 adults across 39 hospitals, have shown that “convalescent plasma was not associated with a reduction in progression to severe COVID-19 or mortality over 28 days since patient enrolment”.Researchers actually found that progression to severe disease or death mortality at 28 days happened more in moderate COVID-19 patients who received plasma than those who received standard care.Disease severity or mortality after enrolment occurred in 44 (19 per cent) participants in the intervention arm (those who got plasma) and 41 (18 per cent) in the control arm.The study titled “Convalescent plasma in the management of moderate COVID-19 in adults in India: Open-label phase II multicentre randomised controlled trial (PLACID Trial)”, published in BMJ today, meant to investigate the effectiveness of using convalescent plasma to treat moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults in India.Participants in the intervention arm received two doses of 200 ml convalescent plasma, transfused 24 hours apart. The other arm received normal care without plasma.A higher proportion of patients in the intervention arm, however, showed resolution of shortness of breath and fatigue at day 7, whereas the resolution of fever and cough did not differ between the two arms.Several state governments, including Delhi, had gone all out to set up plasma banks for the treatment of COVID patients, who are now shown not to have benefitted from the therapy, which was allowed in the Indian COVID protocol.Government is now working to delete its approval.The WHO Solidarity Trials have earlier already shown the inefficacy of other repurposed drugs to reduce the severity of disease in COVID patients, including Remdesivir and the combination of anti-viral drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir.Why plasma?In the pre-vaccine era, convalescent plasma was used to treat viral diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, mumps and influenza, and more recently, influenza, Ebola virus disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome as in the case of coronavirus, with varying degrees of success.Evidence suggests that convalescent plasma collected from survivors of COVID-19 contains receptor binding domain-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity. So far, only two randomised controlled trials on convalescent plasma use in COVID-19 have been published — one from China and the other from the Netherlands.Both were stopped prematurely.The Indian ICMR trial is, therefore, the largest randomised trial to have been completed with results published in the BMJ today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/convalescent-plasma-doesnt-stop-covid-deaths-or-severity-icmr-study-in-bmj-160023

23-10-2020||Hisua (Bihar)||Lalu coming out on bail on Nov 9, Nitish’s farewell next day: Tejashwi||RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Friday asserted that his father and party supremo Lalu Prasad will come out of jail on November 9 after securing bail in a fodder scam case and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will have his farewell the next day.The votes for the state assembly polls will be counted on November 10.Prasad is in judicial custody in Jharkhand capital Ranchi after his conviction in fodder scam cases. He was recently granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court in the case related to Chaibasa treasury but could not come out of jail as his bail plea in another case of fraudulent withdrawals from Dumka treasury is being heard.“Lalu ji is getting released on November 9. He has got one bail and will secure another on November 9, which also happens to be my birthday. The next day, Nitishji will have his farewell,” Tejashwi told a poll rally here, exuding confidence about winning the elections.The state is voting in three phases on October 28, November 3 and November 7, and the results will be announced on November 10.In his address, he accused the Nitish Kumar government of failing to root out corruption, bring industries, provide employment and check migration for livelihood.“Nitishji, you have got tired. You won’t be able to take care of Bihar,” the 30-year-old Tejashwi told Kumar (69).He took a jibe at the Chief Minister for his remark that Bihar lacked industrialisation because it was landlocked, and reaffirmed his commitment of sanctioning 10 lakh government jobs in his first cabinet meeting if the grand alliance comes to power.“Those who didn’t give you jobs, education, health facilities and industries in 15 years will not do so in the next five years as well,” he said.In his address, delivered mostly in Bhojpuri in a tone that appeared a loose copy of his father’s famous style of speech-making, Tejashwi also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in Bihar to address his first rallies in the polls.“The PM has come to Bihar. I was expecting him to tell when Bihar will get the special state status and a special package. You should have revealed how many government jobs you provided,” he said.Continuing his tirade against Kumar, the Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial candidate said the JD(U) president did not come out of the CM’s House for 144 days due to the fear of coronavirus.“Coronavirus is still there but now he is coming out because he wants votes, wants chair,” he said.Responding to the NDA’s persistent question about where will he bring the fund from for his promised 10 lakh jobs, Tejashwi said Bihar had a budget of Rs 2.13 lakh crore and the Nitish Kumar government managed to spend just 60 per cent of it.“There still is Rs 80,000 crore left,” he said.He sought to reach out to voters of every age group with the promise of waiving examination fees and fare for commuting to exam centres, making contractual teachers permanent, and raising the old-age pension to Rs 1,000 from Rs 400.“This fight is not between Nitish and Tejashwi, neither is it between Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi. It is a fight between the people and a dictatorial government,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lalu-coming-out-on-bail-on-nov-9-nitishs-farewell-next-day-tejashwi-160020

23-10-2020||New Delhi||India needs to fix domestic issues, economy to face world with more credibility: Tharoor||Underlining that India has been more of a “rule taker” than a “rule maker” at the UN, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday said the country needs to fix its domestic issues, including that of the economy, and have “moral authority” if it wants to be a rules contributor to the world.The former union minister said he had always argued that India’s international credibility is often a reflection of its domestic postures and the success at home is the best guarantee that “we will be respected and effective abroad”.“Now we have unfortunately been going through a few very bad years domestically in terms of crumbling social cohesion, the eruption and uncontrollable spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the border troubles with China, the economic collapse after demonetisation, unemployment figures worst recorded in the history in these years, everything is wrong,” he said at a session of the 7th national forum of the Public Affairs Forum of India.Tharoor said India must use its capacity to demand constructive changes in global governance.“India has to be what it was trying to be before the last five years or so which was a sort of an example to the developing world — the world’s first development power,” the former UN under-secretary-general said.Tharoor hoped that India would contribute to initiatives to catalyse a new consensus for the world.“But before it does so, we really have to fix our internal situation first so that we can face the world with greater credibility and with renewed admiration that we used to enjoy till very recently,” he said.Asked about reforms at the UN and whether they were linked with monetary contributions by member states, Tharoor said: “I don’t think cheque book alone is important.”India is a state that has contributed generously and was among the leading donors to UN’s democracy fund, initiatives on ideas, decolonisation, racism, apartheid, and also contributed in kind through peacekeeping, Tharoor said.“India has nothing to be ashamed of. We have very much been in the forefront of international efforts at the UN to do a lot of good work and to contribute in terms of leadership. Yet, we have been more of a ‘rule taker’ than a ‘rule maker’ and these rules have been made by the big powerful countries and we haven’t been counted amongst them,” he said.“Which is why we need both economic growth and prosperity on the one hand, which has gone down the tubes in the last few years, and we also need moral authority if we want to be a rule contributor,” Tharoor said.That moral authority came from the successful management of our own challenges, including the great challenges of religious, ethnic and linguistic diversity in India, which the country had been managing very well till recently, he said.It also involved managing some of the contradictions in the neighbourhood and being magnanimous to neighbours rather than being hostile to them, Tharoor added, claiming that India had slipped on that count recently.Tharoor said it was important for India to come across to the rest of the world as an example of a thriving and harmonious society.“If we can get our act together and lead our country in the direction that we have traditionally aspired to — that has been hailed as a success in the past, we will once again be in a position to set an example whether on the Security Council or off it,” he said.If India did this and also prospers economically, people from other countries would state that they cannot imagine a Security Council without India “rather than us demanding it as we are doing it now”, Tharoor said.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||Govt plans special immunisation programme for COVID-19 vaccine||The coronavirus vaccine, once available, will be distributed under a special COVID-19 immunisation programme with the Centre procuring the doses directly and making it available for priority groups, official sources said.According to them, the Centre will procure the vaccine directly to make it available to the priority groups free-of-charge through the existing network of states and districts.States have been asked not to chart separate pathways of procurement, they said.The Centre, with the help of state and union territory governments, has started the process of identifying around 30 crore priority beneficiaries who would be given vaccine dose in the initial phase.This special COVID-19 immunisation programme would run in parallel with the Universal Immunisation Programme, but will use its processes, technology and network of the existing vaccine distribution framework, sources said.The government has demarcated four categories of people for vaccination in the initial phase—around one crore healthcare professionals including doctors, MBBS students, nurses and ASHA workers, etc.; around two crore frontline workers including municipal corporation workers, personnel of the police and armed forces; about 26 crore people aged above 50; and a special group of those below 50 years of age with co-morbidities and requiring specialised care."States have been asked to enlist by mid-November the priority population groups.... Each person in the immunisation list will be linked with their Aadhaar cards so as to track them," a source said.The existing digital platform and processes used for the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) are being enhanced to track COVID-19 vaccine administration and movement—from procurement to storage to distribution to individual beneficiaries—as and when the vaccine becomes available, Health Ministry officials have said.Also, online training modules are being developed for vaccinators. The digital platform that is being enhanced is Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN), which provides real-time information on vaccine stocks and storage temperatures across all cold chain points in the country under UIP.Under UIP, children, adolescents and pregnant women are currently vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases free-of-cost by the state.The National Expert Committee on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 has already mapped the existing cold chain being utilised under the government's immunisation programme and has also made a projection of the additional requirement, Health Ministry officials had said earlier.Presently, the committee is engaged in mapping private sector facilities that could serve the needs of supplementing the cold chain equipment.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said that the Centre estimates to receive and utilise 40-50 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine covering around 25 crore people by July next year.Vardhan had said the government is working round-the-clock to ensure that there is a fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, once they are ready.The biggest benefit that India has is that it has a robust immunisation programme in place and it is implementing the largest immunisation programme of the world, with nearly 27 million newborns targeted for immunisation annually, the minister said."We have an established infrastructure for supply, storage and delivery of vaccines to the last mile, under our Universal Immunisation Programme, where we are administering around 600 million doses to children every year," he said."The strength of these experiences in the vaccination landscape, our best practices and the robustness of our health delivery System will be leveraged and augmented using a strong IT backbone to ensure that this humongous national mission of vaccinating the identified priority groups with COVID-19 vaccine is achieved in a timely manner. The Indian government will leverage the integrated IT platform eVin for managing vaccine distribution," Vardhan said.Vardhan re-affirmed the commitment of the Indian government and assured that it has accorded top most priority to the research and manufacturing to ensure that the vaccine reaches to the last person.A controversy erupted on Thursday after the BJP in its manifesto for the Bihar assembly elections promised free COVID-19 vaccines, once it is available, for all.

23-10-2020||Hisua (Bihar)||PM ‘insulted’ soldiers when he said nobody intruded into Ladakh: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday again accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having “insulted” the soldiers with his comment that nobody had intruded into the Indian territory in Ladakh and demanded that he told the country when would the Chinese “be thrown out”.Addressing his first rally during the Bihar assembly elections, Gandhi insisted the Chinese army had indeed intruded into Indian territory.“They have seized 1,200 km of our land. But when the Chinese army intruded, why did our prime minister insult our soldiers by saying that nobody entered into the Indian side?” he said.Earlier in the day, Modi also addressed his first poll rally in Bihar and referred to the Galwan Valley clash with Chinese troops and said the sons of Bihar laid down their lives for the tricolour but did not let “Mother India bow her head”.“The question is, Modi ji, when will you throw out the Chinese soldiers sitting in our territory,” Gandhi said.He also attacked the Centre over the migrant crisis triggered by the pandemic-induced lockdown, alleging when workers from Bihar were being “chased away” from other states the Prime Minister did nothing to help them.“He bows before the labourers but does not help them when they need it,” he said.He demanded that the Prime Minister told Biharis how many jobs he gave them and when.Congress’ Neetu Singh is contesting from Nawada district’s Hisua seat where she taking on sitting BJP MLA Anil Singh.A huge gathering was seen at the Hisua rally venue, with people also crowding the roof a college building where it was held.RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, the chief ministerial candidate of the ‘Mahagathbandhan’, said the elections that were under way will not be fought on the issue of caste or religion but unemployment and poverty.

23-10-2020||Morbi (Gujarat)||Congress a sinking ship, uses farmers for its benefit: Irani||Union Minister Smriti Irani on Friday dubbed the opposition Congress as a sinking ship and accused it of using farmers and their issues for its benefit.She also took a veiled dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying that one cannot predict when he would go on a vacation.Irani was in Morbi to campaign for BJP candidate Brijesh Merja. Morbi is one of the eight assembly constituencies in Gujarat, where bypolls will be held on November 3.“Congress party needs to first decide who is their leader. Is it a person or a family? In politics, you cannot understand the pain of poor and middle-class citizens if you are blinded by the love for one family. Since Congress is a sinking ship, I wonder how it can help the people of Morbi?” Irani asked while addressing a gathering.In this time of coronavirus, not a single Congress leader was seen among the people. On the other hand, BJP workers remained with the people all the time, she said.“The former Congress president was not even present in the Parliament as he went on a vacation. He was not there when his people needed him,” the Textiles and Women and Child Development Minister said without naming Gandhi.“One cannot predict when the person to whom the party is planning to hand over its reins would go on a vacation. He goes on vacation despite knowing that his party is sinking. Do not waste your vote on such a party. Choose BJP, which always served you,” she added.She alleged that when the people of India were extending their full cooperation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the battle against coronavirus, the Congress has “waged a war against India's intent and indulged in spreading false propaganda”.On the issue of farmers, Irani claimed that Rahul Gandhi was not even present when such issues were being discussed in the Parliament.“These people are selfish. They always talk about farmers. But the former Congress president and former MP of Amethi was not even present in the Parliament when farmers issues were discussed. Congress always used farmers,” she alleged.“The BJP is trying to unite the country by abrogating Article 370 while the Congress tried its best to keep the country fragmented by not supporting the move to scrap the provision,” the Minister added.Bypolls in Gujarat are necessitated after Congress MLAs resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections held earlier this year.

It was then the idea struck me that I could be making Maa Durga's idol with medicine strips to mark the pandemic," Basak, who had last year made the figurine with discarded electric wires, told PTI.It took the district official nearly five months and 40,000 strips of tablets, capsules and injection vials of different colours to give shape to his idea."Initially, I was worried that I won't be able to make the idol this year due to work pressure and strict safety protocols. But I managed to create one with expired medicines."Paper, thermocol and board, among other things, were used to fix the medicine strips to a frame and create the idol," Basak added.

23-10-2020||Manali||Coronavirus gives fragile Rohtang Pass recovery time||The Coronavirus-induced lockdowns have cleaned up the fragile Rohtang Pass with the piles of trash almost vanished and nature making a comeback in the cold, rugged and rocky mountains of the Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas – the origin of one of north India's major rivers, the Beas.Also the vehicular pollution plummeting to levels unseen in the living memory."What a pleasant surprise to see no littering of trash in hills en route to the Rohtang Pass," remarked Nikita Pandey, a tourist from Delhi."We should be thankful to Covid-induced lockdowns that gave nature a recovery time to regain its glory," she said while pointing towards spots where non-biodegradable waste was normally dumped carelessly along the banks of the glacial-fed Beas river near Marhi, en route the Rohtang Pass from Manali.The Rohtang Pass is located at an altitude of 13,050 feet and 52 km from tourist resort Manali in Himachal Pradesh.Her friend Gauri Vaidya said in her past visits, the ninth this time in as many years, she felt angry to see the stunning amount of waste like beer and liquor bottles and food sachets dumped haphazardly in the mountains."This visit is memorable to see nature blooming again amid pine forests and gurgling streams," she added.The picturesque Rohtang Pass, which remains under snow even during the onset of summer, is a major attraction for both domestic and foreign tourists.According to the state tourism department, more than 1,00,000 tourists visit the Rohtang Pass every year and tourism, including skiing, trekking and paragliding, is a key source of income for the local people.For more than five months from December, the pass remains cut off from the rest of the country due to heavy snowfall.After nearly six months of sealing borders, the state government on September 15 threw open its doors for free movement of people and goods."In the last one or two weeks, the trend of tourists is picking up in Manali and its nearby areas. Compared to thousands of tourists that normally descend here daily ahead of Diwali, now tourists, mainly from the northern states, are thronging that too on weekends," said an official of the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corp.Travel agent Naresh Thakur said the tourists from Manali now prefer to travel towards the Lahaul Valley via the newly opened Atal Tunnel, beneath the Rohtang Pass, rather than taking the long, treacherous route of the pass."Snow is the only attraction for the tourists and the mighty Rohtang Pass is the only destination near Manali that remains marooned in snow cover till end of May. In this season, Rohtang slopes are totally bereft of snow cover, so they are not on their preferred list," he added.Government officials said the Rohtang Pass normally closes for the traffic every year in December owing to snowfall."This time the Rohtang Pass remained closed for the tourists for a longer duration, i.e., from December to mid of September. Firstly, due to snapping of road links by snow and then due to coronavirus lockdowns. This has given enough time for nature to revive," said an official.Trekking along the Rohtang Pass is another adventure pursuit, the backbone of the state's economy, from June to September.Excessive emission of carbon monoxide from the vehicles and huge quantities of trash left behind by tourists on the Rohtang Pass are taking a heavy toll on the snow cover, says the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), a Nagpur-based institute that has carried out studies on the impact of pollution on the local ecology.Besides tourist vehicles, a major component of the traffic is also the defence vehicles, with the forces taking supplies to strategic points through the Rohtang Pass.The deteriorating ecology of Rohtang, meaning "piles of dead bodies" in Persian, has also caught the attention of the National Green Tribunal (NGT).With its direction, the government has checked unregulated plying of vehicles by imposing an environmental cess on each of the 1,300 vehicles permitted every day to cross the Rohtang Pass, besides construction of eco-friendly toilets and installation of garbage collection bins en route.According to a journal of the Asiatic Society, Lieutenants A Broome and A Cunningham trekked to the Rohtang Pass on July 7, 1839, to trace the sources of the Punjab's rivers.

They don’t care about nation but middlemen....whenever there are attempts to remove the middlemen, they get upset,” he said also referring to the Congress onslaught against the Centre on the Rafale jet deal.Speaking several times in local dialect, the Prime Minister also remembered the Bihar soldiers who were martyred in the Galwan valley clash.Praising Nitish Kumar for the work in Bihar, the Prime Minister said to keep the state on the path to the development of the people should vote for the NDA.Modi began by greeting people of Bihar, praising them for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and paying ‘shradhanjali’ to two top leaders from the state who passed away recently — LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan and RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad.Speaking at Sasaram from a combined NDA platform, the Prime Minister called Bihar the bowl of rice and said the state was celebrating democracy while keeping in mind all precautions. Recounting various steps taken by the Centre and the state governments for uplift of the poor and the backward in the state, he outlined the plans for generating jobs and also promoting Hindi as a language in technical education like medicine and engineering.“People of Bihar are never confused,” he said, adding that people of Bihar had already given their verdict.“All surveys indicate abki baar NDA sarkar. This even as some people are trying to confuse by projecting some faces,” he said in obvious reference to RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, who reports claim is drawing lot of traction.“Bihar is no longer a ‘bimaru’ state and people will reject those who made it one, he said.The Prime Minister also spoke about the improved law and order situation in the state.“Bihar has got the power of double engine and it is progressing,” Modi said, recounting the pro-poor measures by the Centre during the pandemic.Speaking about the long-pending schemes in Bihar, he said the NDA was completing the projects.“We fulfilled the promises made by the Opposition which used Bihar only to fill their coffers. They wasted 10 years of Nitish Kumar and you all are aware what they did in the state,” he said slamming Lalu Prasad-led RJD, without naming it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-begins-first-bihar-poll-rally-says-vote-for-nda-to-ensure-development-159989

Analysts say 32 seats are such that the party has not bagged in the last three decades.To compound Congress’ woes, it has had to trade off seats it won last time when it bagged 27 of the 41 seats contested in the grand alliance with Nitish Kumar in 2015.Party sources add that many of the Congress candidates have also had to settle with seats that were not their first preference seats.As the grand old party piggy rides RJD yet again, it remains to be seen what political stock it musters going forward.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahuls-twin-rallies-in-bihar-congress-banking-on-tejaswis-charisma-to-wade-through-159988

23-10-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||LAC to be on the table during Pompeo-Esper visit to India: US||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 23The situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) will be discussed during the simultaneous visit to India next week by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Mark Esper, senior State Department officials have said at a media briefing late on Thursday.When asked if the LAC tensions will figure, an official said: “We’re watching the situation closely. I think both sides have expressed a desire to de-escalate violence.”The two sides are in the process of finalising several agreements with a critical military pact called BECA also in the works.The meeting comes a month before Quad countries — the US, India, Japan and Australia — will launch joint naval war games.Officials said instead of talking of countering China, the US would prefer to frame a discussion in a more positive trajectory with the end goal to “empower these countries to push back”.Like the MEA here, the US diplomats sought to convey the impression that the diplomatic calendar has its own dynamics.“The 2+2 had previously been scheduled and delayed. Now the schedules worked out, so that’s really what’s driving the opportunity for this trip right now,” the official said.Pompeo and Esper, possibly accompanied by their spouses, would hold a series of meetings in New Delhi. They will call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and NSA Ajit Doval and separately meet their counterparts and hold the 2+2 meeting that is “reserved for our closest friends and partners”, said Dean Thompson, State Department’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs.“The LAC tensions will figure at ‘some point’ during these meetings,” he elaborated.Pompeo will carry on to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia in a bridge-building exercise with Asian countries sitting astride key shipping lanes.The focus areas of the Pompeo-Esper visit listed by the US side are similar to those mentioned by the MEA.The US side mentioned global cooperation, challenges in the Indo-Pacific, economic, space and energy collaboration, people-to-people ties, and defence and security cooperation as the priority areas. The MEA had listed political, security and defence, economic, commercial, technology and people-to-people contacts as the key focus areas.In the case of Sri Lanka, which is close to China, the message from the Americans will be stark. Colombo will be asked to review “the options we offer in contrast to discriminatory and opaque practices” (by China). The US will also question Sri Lanka on issues related to human rights, reconciliation and democracy.“Right now, we think they’re at a point to make some choices about where they head…. We want to partner on sustainable economic development and a free and open Indo-Pacific,” said Thompson.The message was milder for Indonesia which recently rebuffed a US request to fuel maritime surveillance planes.David Stilwell, State Department’s Assistant Secretary for East-Asian and Pacific Affairs, called Jakarta a “pillar” of “free and open Indo-Pacific”.“We’re looking forward to strengthening critical relationships with our friends and partners, emphasising our deep commitment to the Indo-Pacific and advancing our vision for long-term partnership and prosperity in the region,” said Thompson when asked about the basic purpose of the trip.The officials said the US will help countries to assert their claims to resources in their exclusive economic zones. Washington’s backing to Mekong River basin countries, they claimed, led to China agreeing to share water information, which is critically important to downstream nations. The maritime partnerships the US has in mind also involve maritime domain awareness, security and law enforcement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-to-be-on-the-table-during-pompeo-esper-visit-to-india-us-159977

How filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India, it’s filthy. The air is filthy,’’ said Trump in a remark that cut several strategic analysts to the bone. On the other hand, the US has the “lowest number in carbon emissions”, he claimed.Several questioned on social media the need for Trump to make an unsavoury reference to India when they were expecting Indo-US ties to turn the strategic corner during the forthcoming visit of two top American cabinet ministers to India. They also wondered if Trump had this view of India why did he pay a return stadium-visit to Ahmedabad barely six months after being hosted in a Houston stadium by PM Narendra Modi.Biden did not mention India.Trump was responding to debate moderator Kristen Welker’s question on how would he simultaneously combat climate change and support job growth.The debate was expected to feature India and the wider neighbourhood. During the first debate, the two candidates did not speak much on the American foreign policy, especially in the Asia Pacific, which seems to be the focus of the current administration.One reason for the cursory references to foreign policy is also because one debate was cancelled after Trump refused to participate in an on-line format.Welker had chosen six topics for in-depth discussions. Three of them were domestic issues while the other three - climate change, leadership and national security – had foreign policy ramifications.Trump, however, was consistent in his observations in blaming the three countries. In the first debate on September 29, he had said, “China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does, India does — they all do.’’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trumps-filthy-comment-on-india-dismays-strategists-159970

The RJD, Congress, SP, TMC, AAP, Shiv Sena and NC were among those that slammed the ruling BJP for seeking “political gains” from the issue even as health experts asked if it was moral to promise mass allocation of a vaccine that would be in short supply to start with.“The GoI just announced India’s Covid vaccine access strategy. Kindly refer to the state-wise election schedule to know when you will get it along with a hoard of false promises,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said. His colleague Shashi Tharoor too posted a caustic tweet attacking Nirmala Sitharaman, who announced the sop: “You give me votes, I will give you vaccines.

He reaffirmed his government’s irrevocable commitment to women’s empowerment and safety.Drawing a parallel from mythology, Modi said while only a fraction of her own strength would have been enough to kill the demon “Mahishasura”, Goddess Durga was helped by various other divine characters who formed what was akin to an organisation to help her defeat the adversary.The PMwas addressing an audience in West Bengal from New Delhi through video-conferencing on the occasion of the “Mahashashti” day of Bengal’s famous Durga Puja.While the speech was meant primarily for the Durga Puja at Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre in Kolkata organised by the state BJP’s women wing, the live footage was also beamed to various other places of the state.“From opening Jan Dhan accounts for 22 crore women, giving soft loans to them under Mudra Yojana, to launching Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao initiative, granting permanent commission to women in the armed forces and extending maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks, we have taken a number of steps for their empowerment,” he said. In an attempt to connect with the masses ahead of next year’s Assembly elections, he listed out various development projects that the Centre has launched for Bengal.He complimented people for showing restraint in view of the prevailing pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-reaffirms-commitment-to-women-safety-empowerment-159677

23-10-2020||---||Rescinded order to ensure CBI not misused: Maharashtra minister||New Delhi, October 22A day after the state government withdrew “general consent” given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the state, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the step was taken to ensure that the Central agency was not misused for political purpose.“The CBI will need Maharashtra Government’s permission henceforth (to operate in the state). It can’t carry out investigation here in Mumbai till we issue permission,” the minister said today.The Maharashtra Government on Wednesday withdrew general consent given to the agency to probe cases in the state, a day after the CBI took over a case registered by the UP Police against “unknown” channels and persons over alleged fudging of TRPs.The move follows apprehension in the state government that the CBI would take over a similar case on alleged fudging of TRPs in Maharashtra in a bid to move it away from the purview of the Mumbai Police.Agency sources, however, said the Maharashtra Home Department’s decision would have no impact on the cases that the CBI has already been investigating in the state. “Even in cases where courts order probe by the CBI, there will be no impact of this order,” a senior official said.It would be interesting here to note that in the recent past several opposition-ruled states, including West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and more recently, Rajasthan, had withdrawn general consent, effectively creating hurdle for the CBI to enter their territories.Incidentally, the Maharashtra Government’s move is also seen in the backdrop of the CBI filing a case to investigate the TV ratings scam on the basis of a complaint filed in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.“Earlier, the CBI had taken up the investigation in some cases. We are concerned about use of CBI to intervene in the ongoing TRP scam and hence Maharashtra decided to withdraw its permission,” the minister said.Deshmukh said a Supreme Court judge had a few years ago described CBI as the “government’s parrot”. “We want to avoid it happening now,” the minister said.Maha among 5 states to withdraw consentMaharashtra is the fifth state to withdraw general consent for CBI operations within its territory. The move comes amid the opposition’s allegations that the Centre is using the agency to circumvent investigations by the state police. The governments of West Bengal, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh had recently withdrawn the general consent to the CBI.
