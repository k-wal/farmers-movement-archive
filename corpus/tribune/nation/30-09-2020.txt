30-09-2020||Lucknow||Vandals responsible for demolition of disputed structure at Ayodhya: Special CBI court||Vandals were responsible for demolition of the disputed structure at Ayodhya in 1992 and it was the volunteers of the RSS and the VHP who handled the situation, a special CBI court on Wednesday said.The court, in its judgment, said that such ‘kar sevaks’ (volunteers) who were unruly and rowdy can never be called ‘Ram bhakts’ (disciples of Lord Ram) because their actions adversely affected the secular fabric of the nation and it also compelled the Supreme Court to make certain observations in its November 2019 judgment.Special Judge SK Yadav, in his 2,300-page judgment, said that there is no evidence to prove that the accused and the unruly elements planned and met each other at any time to hatch the alleged conspiracy.The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) managed the situation and directions were being given by them. They had made seating arrangements for women, senior citizen and reporters, the CBI court said.The disruption was caused by a different group of kar sevaks who were vandals, it said.The case is related to the razing of the disputed structure in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, which triggered riots for several months leaving nearly 2,000 people dead across the country.The structure was demolished by ‘kar sevaks’ who claimed that the 16th century Babri mosque in Ayodhya was built on the site of an ancient Ram temple.The 32 accused include former deputy prime minister L K Advani, former Union ministers M M Joshi and Uma Bharti, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh during whose tenure the structure was pulled down, besides VHP leaders Vinay Katiyar and Sadhvi Rithambara.Charges were framed against 49 people, but 17 (including stalwarts like Ashok Singhal, Balasaheb Thackeray, Vijayraje Scindia) have died during the course of the trial.The serious criminal conspiracy charge against the accused was first dropped by the trial court in 2001. The verdict was upheld by the Allahabad High Court in 2010, but the Supreme Court ordered restoration of the conspiracy charge against the accused on April 19, 2017.The charge of conspiracy was in addition to other charges, including promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had argued that the accused conspired and instigated ‘karsevaks’ to demolish the 16th-century mosque.   However, the accused had pleaded innocence, maintaining there is no evidence to prove their guilt and claiming that they were implicated by the then Congress government at the Centre as political vendetta.

30-09-2020||New Delhi||Monsoon withdraws from Delhi; Assam flood situation marginally deteriorates||The monsoon withdrew from Delhi on Wednesday while the flood situation in Assam marginally deteriorated with over 2.83 lakh people affected across eight districts.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the country received above normal monsoon during the four-month rainfall season, recording the second highest precipitation in the last 30 years.It said the national capital recorded 467.7 mm rainfall against the normal of 585.8 mm between June 1 and September 30.The IMD said conditions are becoming favourable for further withdrawal of southwest-monsoon from some more parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and some parts of northwest Madhya Pradesh during the next 2-3 days.Parts of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, Sikkim, Karnataka, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Manipur received rainfall along with thundershowers.In Delhi, the wind system had reached the city on June 25, two days earlier than normal, and stayed five days longer than usual. Normally, it withdraws from the city by September 25, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said.“Change in the low-level wind pattern to north-westerlies, reduction in moisture content and cessation of rainfall indicates that the southwest monsoon has further withdrawn from some more parts of Rajasthan, remaining parts of Punjab, entire western Himalayan region, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and some parts of Uttar Pradesh,” the IMD said.According to Met department data, the city recorded 20 per cent less rainfall this monsoon season.For smaller areas like Delhi, 19 per cent more or less than long-period average rainfall (50 years) is considered “normal”. Between minus 20 per cent and minus 59 per cent is “deficient”, and anything less than that is “scanty”.The country received 109 per cent rainfall of the Long Period Average (LPA) with three of four months—June (107 per cent), August (127 per cent) and September (105 per cent) -- witnessing above normal rainfall, while July recorded (90 per cent) below deficient rainfall.In Assam, over 2.83 lakh people are hit due to floods in Biswanath, Goalpara, Morigaon, Hojai, Nagaon, Golaghat, Dibrugarh and West Karbi Anglong districts, according to daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA).At present, 432 villages are under water and 26,652 hectares of crop areas have been damaged across Assam, ASDMA said.Nagaon is the worst hit with 2.08 lakh people suffering, followed by Morigaon with more than 40,600 persons and Goalpara with over 11,400 people, the report said.The toll in the three waves of floods in the state stands at 120.Roads, bridges, culverts and other infrastructure have been damaged by floodwaters in Morigaon, Nagaon and Kokrajhar districts, ASDMA said.The Brahmaputra river is flowing above its danger marks at Dhubri town, Nimatighat in Jorhat and Tezpur in Sonitpur district, while its tributaries Jia Bharali is doing so at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur, Kopili river at Dharamtul and Kampur in Nagaon are flowing above their respective danger marks.The IMD has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall very likely at isolated places over Odisha and heavy rainfall at isolated places for Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura.It has also forecast thunderstorm with lightning at isolated places very likely over Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura, Madhya Maharashtra, Telangana. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-withdraws-from-delhi-assam-flood-situation-marginally-deteriorates-149000

The two leaders will report back to the BJP leadership on Thursday, they added.Yadav told the reporters that the NDA will contest the elections under the leadership of the chief minister Nitish Kumar.It has been reliably learnt that the JD (U) will contest more number of assembly seats than the BJP so that the party can accommodate the outfit led by the former state chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi. It is also learnt that BJP may get LJP to settle with 27 seats.“The meeting was attended by Shah, the BJP chief JP Nadda, Organisational secretary B L Santosh, deputy chief minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi, and other senior state leaders. The party leaders took stock of the Assembly constituencies divided in A, B, C, D and E categories on the basis of the perceived strengths of the constituents of the NDA,” a source said.Sources said that Shah took stock of the political situations in Bihar, with the party leaders stressing on the unity and harmonious seat adjustments among the alliance partners. Bihar has a total of 243 Assembly seats. The BJP on Wednesday also officially named Fadnavis as the election in-charge of the party in the poll bound state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-bhupender-yadav-devendra-fadnavis-in-patna-to-work-out-seat-sharing-with-jd-u-ljp-148998
30-09-2020||Bhopal||Vijayvargiya on Hathras: ‘A car can overturn anytime in UP’||Calling for exercising patience over the Hathras gang-rape incident, BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Wednesday said under the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, a “vehicle can overturn anytime”.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was raped in a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital where she died on Tuesday.The brutal incident has caused a nationwide outrage and led to criticism of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.Answering a question on the Hathras gang-rape, Vijayvargiya told reporters here, the accused in the case have been arrested.“The case will be tried in a fast-track court and I think we should all wait and have patience. All of them will go behind bars.“Because under Yogiji, who is the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, I know that in his state a vehicle can overturn anytime.”Vijayvargiya did not elaborate, but he was apparently referring to the death of dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey in an alleged encounter with the UP police in July.According to the Uttar Pradesh police, Dubey was shot dead while trying to escape after the police vehicle carrying him overturned near Kanpur on July 10, a day after his arrest from Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh.In another incident, a gangster, who was being taken to Lucknow from Mumbai, died when the police vehicle carrying him overturned after being hit by a ‘nilgai’ in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district on Sunday, police had said.Referring to the judgement in the Babri masjid demolition episode, Vijayvargiya said after the Supreme Court verdict last year, which paved the way for construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya, there was nothing left in the 28-year-old case.Asked about the Congress criticism of the judgement by a special CBI court in Lucknow, the BJP leader, who is in-charge of West Bengal affairs, said it seems the national party has no faith in judiciary.Our judiciary is very prestigious and it has opened its doors at 2 AM also for terrorists. If Congressmen raise questions (over court rulings) then there is nothing more shameless than that, he remarked.Asked about an alleged Bollywood-drug nexus, Vijayvargiya termed it as shameful and said actors are icons for people.It reveals black face of Bollywood. Youths are disappointed with it. People like me who have high hopes from Bollywood are also disappointed, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vijayvargiya-on-hathras-a-car-can-overturn-anytime-in-up-148997

30-09-2020||New Delhi||Army's poor gun maintenance, design change causing accidents: OFB||The state-run Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), one of the oldest defence establishments, has countered the Indian Army's claim that its faulty ammunition was leading to injuries and deaths of soldiers and damage to equipment, saying that the accidents could also be because of "poor gun maintenance", "faulty firing drill", and "unvalidated design changes in the weapon".Sources in Indian Army had stated that between 2014 and 2020, 403 accidents, where OFB ammunition was involved, had taken place, causing the exchequer a loss of Rs 960 crore. This, they said, could have financed the purchase of 100 artillery guns. These accidents also left 27 personnel dead.Questioning the Army's logic, the OFB said: "The same logic, if applied to the faulty Krasnopol ammunition imported during the Kargil war amounting to Rs 522.44 crore could have financed another 55 artillery guns."The OFB contended that in the accidents that occurred between January 2015 to December 2019, and defect investigations have been completed, only 19 per cent of the cases were attributable to it.It stated that the investigation into the defect was carried out by a committee headed by the Authority Holding Sealed Particulars (AHSP) which is the custodian of the manufacturing documents."The committees include representatives of all the stakeholders, including the user. The investigations carried out by these committees are seldom holistic in nature, despite the fact that the OFB has been insisting on such an approach," the OFB claimed.Further, out of the total number of accidents where defect investigation has been completed, only 2 per cent of the cases where casualties have been reported are attributable to the OFB, it said. In 98 per cent of the cases where there have been casualties, these are not attributable to the OFB, it added.Between 2011 and 2018, there have been more than 125 accidents involving ammunition procured from sources other than the OFB, both domestic and foreign, it said.The OFB also said that of the 27 fatalities reported, 19 were in May 2016 incident at the Central Ammunition Depot, Pulgaon (Maharashtra), involving anti-tank mines. "This mine had been developed by the DRDO (ARDE) and was manufactured strictly according to their design. Design deficiencies were subsequently noticed and suitable changes are being evaluated," the OFB said.The OFB also said that most of these accidents involved vintage ammunition manufactured prior to 2006 when inspection of all input materials was undertaken by the Director General, Quality Assurance (DGQA), and the OFB had no control on the quality of input material."In fact, after 2005-06, when the responsibility for inspection of input material was given to the OFB, there has been a decrease in the number of accidents," it maintained.It also said that since 2013, a system of advanced early user exploitation, based on a random sample drawn from each freshly manufactured lot of ammunition, was in place, in addition to the established schedule of inspection and validation conducted by the DGQA.The results of this system have demonstrated a satisfaction level of more than 99 per cent which is comparable to international standards, the OFB said, adding that the quality of ammunition manufactured by it is also amply testified to by the receipt of repeat export orders of ammunition supplied under self-certification.Noting that the Army report mentions 125 mm tank ammunition, it said: "Accidents in T-72/T-90 tanks are a dated issue wherein incidents have been observed in all combinations of ammunition and barrel - imported as well as domestic. Various investigations including those involving Russian specialists and investigation led by the user were conducted and their recommendations implemented."The OFB was given the bulk production clearance for the ammunition in 2016 and since 2017, ammunition manufactured strictly in accordance with Transfer of Technology documents is being supplied, without the earlier modifications suggested by DGQA and the Army, and no accident has been reported since then, it said.The case of 23 mm ammunition is intriguing, the OFB said, noting only 23 per cent of the accidents were due to OFB ammunition, and the balance 77 per cent involved imported ammunition.Currently, hundreds of thousands of rounds/pieces of defective imported ammunition is available in various depots, it said.

30-09-2020||New Delhi||Not advisable to give Rs 100 per quintal incentive to farmers for not burning stubble: EPCA||A Supreme Court-mandated pollution control authority has said it “may not be a viable option” to provide an incentive of Rs 100 per quintal of paddy produced to farmers for not burning stubble.If at all necessary, any such incentive should be provided by state governments from their own budget, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority told the apex court in a report submitted on Wednesday.Following the Supreme Court guideline to incentivise farmers to stop stubble burning, the governments of Punjab and Haryana last year announced a bonus of Rs 2,500 an acre for small and marginal farmers.Farmers say the incentive can help them cover the cost of fuel used in operating machinery for in-situ management of stubble.Last year, the Punjab government provided incentives amounting to Rs 28.51 crore to 31,231 farmers. The state has sought funds from the Centre this year, saying it won’t be able to pay on its own.The Haryana government provided incentives amounting to Rs 1.63 crore to 3,930 farmers last year. This year, it plans to disburse bonuses worth Rs 301 crore.          The EPCA report said, “After deliberations, it was found that inclusion of cost of stubble removal in MSP (minimum support price) may not be a viable option.”   “It has been agreed that any such incentive, if at all necessary, should be provided by the state government from their own budget,” it said.EPCA member Sunita Narain said, “Incentive should not be given to stop people from doing something bad.”“We believe the farmers can be incentivised in different ways – by giving free machinery or buying stubble from them. An incentive for not burning stubble is a perverse incentive. This has been our view for the last three years,” she said.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR. Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue. Farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it.Farmers in Haryana burnt 1.23 million tonnes out of the 7 million tonnes of paddy residue produced.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat.The high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn it.State governments are providing 50 to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw, installing paddy straw-based power plants and running a massive awareness campaign against stubble burning.But these measures are yet to make any significant impact on the ground. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-advisable-to-give-rs-100-per-quintal-incentive-to-farmers-for-not-burning-stubble-epca-148991
30-09-2020||New Delhi||DMK Rajya Sabha MP moves SC against newly-enacted farm Acts||A Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Rajya Sabha MP has moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the newly enacted three contentious legislations on farmers and  agriculturists.     Parliament has recently passed the ‘Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020’, ‘Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020’ and ‘The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020’, which got the assent of President Ram Nath Kovid and have come into effect from September 27.   DMK leader Tiruchi Siva, in his plea said that these new legislations “are prima facie unconstitutional, illegal and arbitrary”.He contended that the impugned three Acts are anti-farmer and anti-agriculturists, brought out during pandemic time with the sole intention to benefit few corporations who are close to the corridors of power.         “These Acts would pave way for cartelisation and commercialisation of the agricultural produces and if allowed to stand, are going to ruin India as the corporates can, with one stroke, export our agricultural produce without any regulation, and may even result in famines,” he said in his plea.Siva added that “Very soon, the country which fought for its independence from the British will have to wage war to free itself from the clutches of crony capitalism”.        He said that these new laws are unconstitutional not only for want of legislative competence of the Union on the subject of Agriculture and Land Tenure but also would usher a new exploitative regime for the poor farmers of the Country, who are entirely dependent on earning their livelihood, by selling their produce in the market.The five-time Member of Parliament said that the Amendment to Essential Commodities Act under the impugned Act 2020 is to facilitate such business in agricultural produces being carried out under the new enactments “which loosen the strings of black markets of regulating stock limit and stocking the agricultural produces for marketing”.            “Suffice it to say that the impugned Acts attack the very foundation of the agricultural fabric of the country that was built to safeguard the interests of the farmers and not leave them at the mercy of the new era of privatisation,” he said in his plea.Siva said that the impugned Acts would now create an alternative that’s outside the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), which could result in two perverse consequences.    “One is that the APMC continues to set the reference price which will make no sense because if the private players still look to the APMC for a reference price, then the whole idea of getting rid of the inefficient APMC doesn’t hold. Furthermore, Large-scale trade outside the mandi is bound to happen because new players will prefer to trade outside the mandi where they don’t have to pay charges. APMC traders too might now prefer to operate outside the mandi for the same reason,” he said.The Rajya Sabha MP said that Parliament lacks the legislative competence to enact these legislations under Art 246(3) and all the three impugned enactments are in violation of Article 14, 21, 23 and of the Constitution of India and “is therefore, accordingly liable to be struck down as unconstitutional, illegal and void”.         Earlier, a Congress MP T N Prathapan, who represents Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala has moved the top court challenging the constitutional validity of the new farm laws.

30-09-2020||---||I expected a different outcome: Ex-home secy on Babri verdict||Pune, September 30Retired bureaucrat Madhav Godbole said on Wednesday he was expecting a “different result” in the Babri mosque demolition case.Godbole was union home secretary when the demolition of Babri mosque took place in 1992.A special CBI court in Lucknow on Wednesday acquitted all the 32 accused in the case, including BJP veterans LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, saying there was no conclusive proof against them. The case relates to the razing of the disputed structure in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.Godbole said there could be some difference of opinion over the verdict on the ownership of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case in Ayodhya.“But in this (Babri mosque demolition) case, wherein a criminal offence was registered, I thought the court would do proper verification before giving the verdict,” he told PTI.He added that because of the Supreme Court, the case at least came to this stage.“As the case was being heard on a daily basis, I was expecting a different result, but that decision did not come. This result has come as a surprise to me,” Godbole said.“The trial had been going on since the last several years. Hundreds of witnesses and thousands of documents were examined and now the court is coming to the conclusion that there was not enough evidence. This is something difficult to accept,” he said.An appeal should be made in the high court against the verdict and the matter should also be pursued in the Supreme Court.“I think that public pressure has to be created to ensure that appeal is made in the higher court,” he said.Godbole said he does not believe that the structure could be demolished within five to six hours.“I do not believe that such a big structure can be demolished within five to six hours. I don’t believe that just a few thousand people climbed on to the dome (of the mosque), tried to pull it down and it fell down due to it. There must have been some preparation before that,” he said.“I will not say it was a conspiracy, but there must have been some preparation before it...without that preparation, it was not possible,” he added.When asked whether he felt that the foundation of secularism was still strong, he answered in the negative.“I do not think that the foundation of secularism is still strong. Today no one is ready to speak about it. Forget taking action, the parties which we call secular and were instrumental in preparing the Constitution, are not ready to do anything,” he said.“What worries me is the intermixing of religion and politics. That is what we are not able to separate. The demands made related to Varanasi and Mathura, all pronouncements that are made time to time regarding Hindu Rashtra, all these are disquieting features,” he said.“Nobody, not even secular parties, is ready to talk about the separation of religion from politics,” he said.Godbole added that at least 20 per cent population in India belonged to a religious minority.“The country will not run smoothly if it is said that we will only think about 80 per cent population and not bother about 20 per cent.

He convened a high-level meeting with the Water Resources Department officials on Thursday to discuss on the strategy to be adapted at the Apex Council meeting and instructed the officials concerned to come with complete data and information and issues to be placed before the Central government.  “Andhra Pradesh state is intentionally creating disputes on the river water sharing. We have to give a befitting reply to the AP state’s arguments at the Apex Council meeting. Give an absolute clarity on issues so that the AP government will not raise the issues again in future,” a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office quoted him as saying. “Take the opportunity to expose the seven years delay caused by the Centre and its inactive role on the matter. Oppose and reject the attempts made to undermine the rights of Telangana people. Utilise the Apex Council meeting to tell the whole country about the facts,” KCR said.  He pointed out that under the States Bifurcation Acts, whenever a new state is formed, it should be allocated its water share.“The Telangana state was formed on June 2, 2014 and we wrote a letter to the prime minister on June 14, 2014 requesting for the allocation of water to the Telangana state.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-unhappy-over-centres-handling-of-water-sharing-issue-148971

She died around 3 am on Tuesday.She was admitted to Aligarh Muslim University’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital before being shifted to Safdarjung Hospital.The accused, who had allegedly tried to strangle her to death as she resisted their rape attempt, have been arrested.The plea filed by a social activist Satyama Dubey sought transfer of the probe to the CBI or SIT under the sitting or retired judge of the top court or the high court.It sought transfer of the case from UP to Delhi for trial, alleging that the state authorities had failed to take any action against accused persons who first raped an innocent woman belonging to Schedule caste community and thereafter brutally assaulted her.The plea said as per the media/medical report the victim’s tongue was chopped and her neck-bone and back bone were also broken by the accused persons.“That petitioner no.1 is a Social Activist and also a female being aggrieved against injustice done to females and no action has been taken by the concerned authorities even in this present scenario the dead body of the deceased had been buried by the Police personals which is a grave injustice against family persons of the deceased..,” the plea said.The petition claimed that the police had said that the cremation was being carried out “as per the wishes of the family” which is not true as the police personnel have themselves buried the dead body of the deceased and even media personnel were barred from reporting it.“The Petitioner herein is demanding justice for the victim for the brutal attack, rape and murder of the victim,” the plea said.The petitioner also sought speedy trial of the case.On Tuesday, protests had erupted at the Safdarjung Hospital here as the father and the cousin of the victim sat on a dharna before the woman’s body was taken to Uttar Pradesh amid heavy police deployment at late evening.The incident has prompted outrage, protests and calls for justice from various sections of the society. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-gang-rape-plea-in-sc-for-cbi-probe-transfer-of-trial-to-delhi-148969
30-09-2020||Chandigarh||Rajasthan, Haryana record highest gangrape rate in country||Rajasthan followed by Haryana has the highest gangrape rate cases in country in 2019, says National Crime Record Bureau’s ‘Crime in India’ report. The rate has been calculated with number of crime incidents per lakh women population. Rajasthan reported 902 gangrapes, as registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), while Haryana recorded 159 with 2.4 and 1.17 cases per lakh population respectively. In absolute numbers, Haryana is on fourth spot in gangrapes while Rajasthan tops.The neighbouring Delhi recorded 47 gangrapes while 29 were committed in Punjab and four in Himachal Pradesh. J&K didn’t record any such incident.   In 2018, Rajasthan had reported 556 gangrape cases while Haryana had registered 155. In rapes under all categories, four cases were reported daily in 2019 under the IPC in Haryana as 1,480 cases were registered with a rise of 14.2 per cent from the previous year.Haryana had 49 cases where repeat offenders were involved, which was also the second highest in the country with Madhya Pradesh recording 52 such cases. There were 308 cases of repeated rape on same women in Haryana. In 97 per cent cases, offender was known to the rape victim. Besides that, 1,117 girl child rape cases were registered under Section 4 and Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSOA) with a rise of 9.5 per cent from 2018 in the state.  There were six cases of murder with rape too, but they are being counted under the head of murder, as the NCRB records the cases with multiple offences under that head which attracts maximum punishment. There were 14,683 crime incidents against women in Haryana in 2019 which was a rise of 2.5 per cent from 2018. These cases also included 248 incidents of dowry deaths, 4,867 cases of cruelty by husband or his relatives, four cases of acid attack and 2,803 incidents of kidnapping and abduction. Haryana recorded a rate of 108.5 crimes against women per lakh population which is the fifth highest in the country. Assam was the most unsafe for women with 177.8 crime incidents against women per lakh population followed by Delhi (144), Lakshadweep (115.2) and Rajasthan (110.4). In Haryana courts, the conviction rate in crime against women in 2019 was just 16.1 per cent and for crime against children too it was 27 per cent only, which points towards poor investigations.  In crime rate of murder and dacoity cases, Haryana is ranked third in the country with 1,137 and 153 cases in 2019 respectively. As many as 84 murders took place due to love affairs and illicit relationships alone. In crimes against Scheduled Castes (SCs) there was rise of 13 per cent in 2019 as the state recorded 1,086 cases which included 221 rapes (under IPC), 101 child rapes (under POCSOA) and 43 murders.

30-09-2020||---||India, China agree to hold more talks to resolve LAC issue||New Delhi, September 30India and China on Wednesday held an inter-ministerial meeting to review the current situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) while Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong called on both sides to follow up the five-point consensus reached by the two foreign ministers in Moscow on September 10.The 19th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) had “frank and detailed discussions” on the developments since its last meeting on August 20. The “frank and detailed discussions” would have touched upon the first-ever instance of shots being fired on the LAC for the first time in 45 years.In line with the sentiments expressed by the Chinese Ambassador, the MEA said the working mechanism meeting also underlined the importance it attached to the meetings earlier this month between the two Defence Ministers followed by an agreement between the two Foreign Ministers to sincerely ensure disengagement at all the friction points along the LAC.The meeting also decided to hold the seventh round of the meeting of Senior Commanders at an early date. Military commanders had last met on September 21 and for the first time, come up with a joint press release which had spoken of the need to implement steps to avoid misunderstandings and maintain stability on the ground.China is committed to seeking a solution through dialogue and negotiation, and restoring peace and tranquillity in the border areas at an early date, said the Chinese envoy. “We need to remain rational and calm, and resist the talk of “confrontation” and “decoupling”, so that we will not lose our way due to any individual incident or issue,” he said during a virtual meeting to commemorate China’s 71st national day with state chapters of India-China Friendship Association.In the Chinese Ambassador’s extensive address, there was no trace of the rancor expressed by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) just a day back.  On Tuesday, the Chinese MFA had refused to recognise the existence of Ladakh and insisted that India accept a vaguely defined 1959 claim line for the western sector of the India-China land border.India had reacted sharply to the observations and said both sides have reached several agreements intended not to advance one side’s perception of the border but to decide it by unanimity. By forwarding a 1959 claim line China was doing just the opposite, the MEA had contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-agree-to-hold-more-talks-to-resolve-lac-issue-148962

The karsevaks claimed that the mosque was built on the site of an ancient Ram temple.The central agency produced 351 witnesses and 600 documents as evidence before the court in the case.Sharma was the first CBI director to get an assured stint of two years following a Supreme Court ruling on fixing tenure of the agency’s chief.It was only after his appointment for a fixed tenure that the government in 2004 initiated the process of fixing a two-year tenure for home secretary, foreign secretary, director of Intelligence Bureau and RAW chief.

Of the four, the east and northeast India, central India and south India have received above normal rainfall. The northwest India division has recorded deficient rainfall.Nineteen states and union territories have received normal rainfall this year, while nine states and union territories saw excess rainfall.

It is consecutively for two monsoon years, when India received good rainfall of 9 per cent above LPA or more.“Data shows similar consecutive good monsoon rainfall years in 1958 and 1959 when it was 10 per cent and 4 per cent above LPA respectively,” Jenamani added. Monsoon made an onset over Kerala on June 1, its normal annual onset date. Its timely onset was also aided by cyclone Nisarga. The monsoon covered the entire country by June 26, 12 days ahead of its normal date of July 8.The withdrawal was also late. It withdrew from west Rajasthan and parts of Punjab on September 28, 11 days after its normal onset date.   One of the main features of the monsoon was the rainfall in August. The month saw five low pressure areas (cyclonic circulations) that brought large amount of rainfall over central India.        Total number of low pressure days was 28 against normal of about 15 in August.    “It caused 2-3 spells of riverine floods over Odisha, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, south Gujarat and south Rajasthan. As a result, it was a record rainfall in August 2020, when all India rainfall was 127 per cent of LPA. It is highest in last 44 years, after August 1976 (128.4 per cent) of LPA. It is also fourth highest in last 120 years. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/country-received-above-normal-rainfall-during-4-month-monsoon-imd-148948

After your death you will realise your folly. There won’t be any excuses for you”.Jahan, who is under routine security cover as an MP, has already taken up with West Bengal government and Ministry of External Affairs the issue of additional security arrangement during her outdoor shoots in London from September 27 to mid October, her close aide told PTI on Wednesday.In a letter to the Indian High Commissioner in the UK on September 29 she said: “I would like to inform you that I reached London two days back on my professional purpose and after reaching here I have received a death threat via my social media pages from some fundamentalists who belong to India and neighbouring country”.A copy of her letter was made available to PTI.Informing that she will be in London till October 16, Jahan said in the letter: “During my stay in London I require an immediate police protection as the threat is very serious and it is affecting my mental health. I would request you to kindly arrange to provide me a necessary protection in London”.She attached screen shots of two trolls on her mail box. One of them read “Your time of death has come. You are fearful of Allah but cannot cover your body. Shame on you”. A member of Jahan’s team said: “She has always stood up for secular and inclusive views and these trolls do not deter her”.Jahan had been trolled in the past by a section of Muslim fundamentalists for sporting sindoor and inaugurating ISKCON rathyatra. She had hit back by strongly asserting her faith in the religion of humanity and secularism which, she had said, does not prevent her from participating in other religious festivals while believing in Islam.

It is time to look forward and work towards completing the Ram temple," said VHP working president Alok Kumar. The verdict given by the Special CBI Court at Lucknow acquitting all 32 accused has not gone down well with the CPI(M)."All the top leaders of the BJP-VHP-RSS who were present at the scene guiding the criminal act have been found to be innocent of the charge of conspiracy to demolish the mosque," said the party.It highlighted that the Supreme Court in its Ayodhya judgment on November 8, last year had called the demolition an egregious violation of the law.Now, the Lucknow court has found the main perpetrators of this crime not guilty, said the CPI(M) as it demanded of the CBI to immediately appeal against the judgment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/babri-demolition-verdict-vindication-of-truth-for-vhp-travesty-of-justice-for-cpim-148939

30-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Nadda keeps some posts vacant in BJP central executive, likely to be filled after Bihar elections||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 30BJP president JP Nadda's new team of office-bearers reflects the current position of the saffron party in the national polity. While the selections, made on Saturday, showed the BJP's focus areas (West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and some outhern states), it was generally perceived as a team designed to promote and augment the policies and programmes of the government headed by its biggest star Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Sources say some more names could be added after the Bihar elections and a possible reshuffle of the Cabinet by the Prime Minister. However, the fact remains that apart from some leaders like Rajya Sabha MP Bhupendra Yadav (known for his organisational skills and understanding of government matters) and senior Madhya Pradesh leader Kailash Vijayvarghia (with established credentials of ground support), a majority of the new general secretaries are those who have neither won elections nor have any mass appeal of their own.That is besides four-time Karnataka legislator CT Ravi and Assam MP Dilip Saikia.Unlike powerful general secretaries of yore, late Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Pramod Mahahan, they are generally ones seen as names in the vast organisational network of the party, say observers. “But that was the time the BJP was not in power and needed men and women with a mind and standing of their own. Now with PM Modi as the face and Amit Shah its chief strategist, the party just needs people to implement,” they add.While the post of vice-president is generally considered ceremonial (though the party gave election responsibilities to some holding the position in the outgoing team), it is the general secretaries who have real power, serving as a link between states and the central leadership.  Nadda has retained three general secretaries from the team of former president and Home Minister Amit Amit Shah--Yadav, Vijayvardhia and Arun Singh. Political observers say the man to watch out here (apart from young and fiery advocate of Hindutva 'plank' Tejasvi Surya who is now  president of the youth wing) is Yadav who enjoys the confidence of Shah and is also believed to be among the frontrunners for a post in the powerful parliamentary board, which has vacancies after the passing away of Ananth Kumar, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley and the election of veteran leader M Venkaiah Naidu to the post of the Vice-President of the country.Some other posts are still vacant in the team, including of a general secretary. As per the party constitution, one-third functionaries have to be women. Apart from the president, the team is supposed to have 39 functionaries (13 vice-presidents, 10 general secretaries, 15 secretaries and a treasurer). Nadda’s team has 12 vice-presidents, eight general secretaries, one general secretary (organisation) and 13 secretaries. The post of president of Mahila Morcha is also vacant. Besides, members of the national executive also have to be announced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-keeps-some-posts-vacant-in-bjp-central-executive-likely-to-be-filled-after-bihar-elections-148919
30-09-2020||Lucknow||Muslim bodies to collectively decide on challenging Babri case verdict: Firangi Mahali||All-India Muslim Personal Law Board senior member Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali on Wednesday said organisations representing the community will together decide whether they need to challenge or not the CBI court verdict in the Babri mosque demolition case.On Wednesday morning, the special court had acquitted all 32 accused, including former deputy prime minister L K Advani, ex-Union minister M M Joshi, Uma Bharti and former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh.Refusing to comment on their acquittal, Mahali said, "I don't have anything to say on the verdict. Everybody knows how the Babri mosque was sacrificed on December 6, 1992, in Ayodhya and how all rules were flouted."  In its verdict on the Ramjanmabhoomi land dispute case on November 9 last year, the Supreme Court had said Muslims were wrongly deprived of their mosque, he said, adding that the demolition of the masjid was an illegal act. “It is for the court to decide if anyone is guilty or not. Now, Muslim organisations will sit together and decide if an appeal is to be made against it; whether there would be any benefit in filing an appeal or not, only time will tell,” he said. He said Muslims in the country have always honoured court verdicts and will continue to do so.

30-09-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to postpone UPSC prelims exam scheduled for Oct 4 in view of Covid||The Supreme Court Wednesday refused to postpone UPSC civil services preliminary exam, to be held on October 4, because of Covid-19 pandemic and floods in several parts of the country.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari asked the Centre to consider granting one more chance to those aspirants who may not appear in their last attempt allowed for the exam due to the pandemic.It also refused to consider the plea for clubbing of this year's exam with that of 2021 saying “this will have a cascading effect”.The bench was hearing a plea seeking postponement of the Civil Services Exam for two to three months, so that the flood/incessant rains recede and the Covid curve flattens.The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) opposed the plea saying all necessary precautions had been taken and adequate arrangements made for holding the exam.The bench said that as some public exams had recently been conducted successfully by the authorities by observing proper protocols, it is possible to conduct the UPSC preliminary examinations. It added that the grievance of lack of transport facility at 72 examination centres and sub-centres had not been substantiated by the petitioners.  Dealing with the grievances of the aspirants that due to the Covid situation students could not take the coaching and other facilities, the bench referred to the availability of facility of online study material to them.The top court said that it had impressed upon ASG SV Raju, appearing for the Centre, to explore the possibility of giving one more opportunity to such students who fail to take up the exam in their last attempt.It said that a formal decision can be taken by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) expeditiously.  On allowing suspected COVID-19 aspirants to take up their exams, the bench said that it is not possible to enter into this arena as a matter of fact medical SoP required that a patient is needed to be quarantined as it may result in exposure of other candidates.It noted that the UPSC has made separate arrangements for students suffering from cough and cold.On September 28, the top court had asked the UPSC to apprise it of the "logistical arrangements" made for conducting civil services preliminary exams on October 4 in view of alarming spurt of COVID-19 cases as also floods in various parts of the country.The top court had earlier said that it would take up for hearing the plea seeking postponement of civil services 2020 examinations in view of alarming spurt of COVID-19 pandemic and floods. It had granted the liberty to the petitioner to serve advance copy of the petition on the Standing Counsel for the UPSC as well as on the Standing Counsel for the Central Agency representing Union of India through email/online.The petitioners have sought postponement of the Civil Services Exam for two to three months, so that the flood/incessant rains recede and the COVID-19 curve flattens.The plea submitted that the UPSC decision to conduct the exam in accordance with the impugned Revised Calendar, violates the rights of the petitioners and those similarly situated, under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution to practise their chosen profession/occupation of serving the public.According to the plea this seven-hour offline exam, will be taken by approximately six lakh aspirants at test centres in 72 cities.“Conducting the aforesaid examination across India at such perilous time is nothing else but putting lives of lakhs of young students (including petitioners herein) at utmost risk and danger of disease and death. Also, the natural calamities like flood, incessant rain, landslides etc are likely to directly affect the life and health of the petitioners and many similarly situated students,” it said.“Hence, the impugned Revised Calendar is utterly arbitrary, unreasonable, whimsical and patently violative of the “Right to Health” and “Right to Life” of the petitioners herein and lakhs of similarly situated students, under Article 21,” the petition stated.The plea said the Civil Services Exam, being a recruitment examination, is altogether different from an academic examination and in the event of its postponement, there would not be any question of delay or loss of any academic session.It said that due to non-availability of exam centres in their home towns, many aspirants are facing “unimaginable” hardship due to non-availability of or unsafe health conditions in, the PG accommodation/ hostels/ hotels etc, where they are forced to stay with their family members, once they are travelling to an outstation Examination Centre.“It is pertinent to mention here that despite alarming spurt in COVID-19 pandemic, the UPSC did not increase the number of Examination Centres, resulting into a situation where many candidates from rural areas will be forced to travel for around 300-400 kilometres, in order to reach their Examination Centres and there will be high probability of such aspirants, getting affected while using public transportation for such travel,” the plea said.

Last night the victim's father was robbed of the chance to take his daughter home for the last time and perform her last rites," she said in a series of tweets.Tagging Adityanath, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi said, "RESIGN. Instead of protecting the victim and her family, your government became complicit in depriving her of every single human right, even in death. You have no moral right to continue as chief minister."               In another tweet in Hindi, she alleged that at 2:30 am Wednesday the "victim's kin kept requesting", but the UP administration "forcibly" cremated the deceased."The government did not protect her when she was alive.

After her death, the government took away the right of the family to perform the last rites of their daughter and did not respect the deceased," Priyanka Gandhi said.Hitting out at the chief minister, she alleged, "Gross inhumanity. You did not stop the crime but behaved like criminals. You did not stop the atrocities, but committed atrocity on an innocent child and her family twice."      Tagging Adityanath and asking him to resign, Priyanka Gandhi said, "There is no justice in your rule, only injustice."            The Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also hit out at the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh and asked why was the victim's family was denied the right to perform her last rites and why was the body cremated at 2:30 am.He alleged that all limits of atrocities and brutality had been crossed and demanded Yogi Adityanath's resignation.On September 14, the young woman had gone to the fields with her mother and went missing soon after. She was found later, beaten and tortured, her tongue cut as she bit it when the accused attempted to strangle her.She was first admitted to Aligarh Muslim University's Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital and then shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi on Monday.

Fake news is being spread that I am taking drugs and stocking it. I am a non-smoker, teetotaller," submitted Hingorani on behalf of the actress.Meanwhile, the NBA through its counsel submitted that many of the channels are not even a part of it and the issue which is currently being dealt with is factual and would require the channels to respond.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma appearing for the I&B Ministry informed the court that the Ministry is in the process of addressing the actor's complaint."We are looking into the matter...I can understand that my friend's client would be under mental agony," said the ASG.On September 17, the Delhi High Court while asking the Centre, National Broadcasters Association and others to respond to the petition filed by Rakul Preet's plea against media reports on her relating to drug case involving Rhea Chakraborty."There has to be some restraint. Media gets to know info even before the officers themselves. Reputations are getting tarnished," Rakul's plea had said.On September 26, Rakul had again knocked the Delhi High Court seeking urgent interim directions from the court restraining media from running shows or publishing articles against her in connection with the Sushant case.The petition filed through advocates Himanshu Yadav, Aman Hingorani and Shweta Hingorani claims that Rakul Preet has been in Hyderabad for a film shoot and was shocked to see media reports in the evening of 23.9.2020 to the effect that the Narcotics Control Bureau, Mumbai has summoned her to appear before it in Mumbai in the morning of 24.9.2020 in connection with the ongoing investigation in the Rhea Chakraborty's narcotic drugs case."...the Petitioner had received no such summons from the NCB at either of her Hyderabad or Mumbai addresses, and accordingly she remained in Hyderabad. The Petitioner's father, Col. Kulvinder Singh (Retd), decided to take the morning flight on 24.9.2020 to Mumbai from Hyderabad to ascertain the truth of such reports," the plea said."...however, from the evening of 23.9.2020 itself, the media started running fake news to the effect that the Petitioner, who was in Hyderabad, had supposedly reached Mumbai on the evening of 23.9.2020 for the NCB investigation," it said further.It added that around 11.20 a.m. on 24.9.2020, the Petitioner received in Hyderabad, through WhatsApp, summons under Section 67 of the NDPS Act dated 23.9.2020 and which required her to appear in person before the NCB, Mumbai on 24.9.2020 at 10 am.It is from the email dated 24.9.2020 from the NCB that the Petitioner learnt that case in which she has been required to appear has been registered, the actress said.

30-09-2020||Lucknow||Special CBI court acquits all 32 accused in Babri demolition case||All the 32 accused in the Babri mosque demolition case, including BJP veterans L K Advani and MM Joshi, were on Wednesday acquitted by a special CBI court here, which said there was no conclusive proof against them.Delivering the much-awaited verdict in the 28-year-old case, CBI judge S K Yadav did not accept newspapers and video cassettes as evidence.The court also observed that late Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal wanted to save the structure because Ram idols were inside.The case relates to the razing of the disputed structure in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, which triggered riots for several months leaving nearly 2,000 people dead across the country.The structure was demolished by ‘kar sevaks’ who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built on the site of an ancient Ram temple.Also read: Security stepped up in vicinity of Lucknow court ahead of Babri case verdictHistoric verdict, should bring an end to issue: MM Joshi on Babri case judgementBabri demolition verdict: ‘Vindication of truth’ for VHP, ‘travesty of justice’ for CPI(M)Raman Singh welcomes Babri case verdict, terms it ‘historic’Babri case verdict vindication of my decision of dropping criminal conspiracy charge against Advani: Ex-CBI chiefThe 32 accused, include former deputy prime minister Advani, former Union minister Joshi and Uma Bharti, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, during whose tenure the structure was pulled down, besides Vinay Katiyar and Sadhvi Rithambara.Champat Rai, the general secretary of the trust in charge of constructing the temple, was among the accused.Yadav had on September 16 directed all the 32 surviving accused to remain present in the court on the day of the judgment. Today was the last working day of Yadav.However, Bharti (61) and Singh (88) are convalescing in separate hospitals after coronavirus infection and were not present in the court at the time of pronouncement of order.Advani (92), Joshi (86), Nritya Gopal Das and Satish Pradhan were also not present in court.         Singh, during whose tenure as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh the disputed structure was demolished, was put on trial in September last year after his tenure as governor (of Rajasthan) came to an end.With the Supreme Court setting August 31 as the deadline and later extending it by a month for the CBI court to give its verdict, the trial court started day-to-day hearing to complete the task on time.The central agency produced 351 witnesses and 600 documents as evidence before the court. Charges were framed against 48 people, but 16 have died during the course of trial.The trial under the serious criminal conspiracy charges commenced against them after having been dropped by the trial court in 2001. The verdict was upheld by the Allahabad High Court in 2010, but the apex court ordered restoration of the conspiracy charge against them on April 19, 2017.The top court ordered daily hearing in the high-profile case and directed the special judge to conclude it in two years.The charge of conspiracy was in addition to the existing charges against them for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion.The accused were also facing charges of having made assertions “prejudicial to national integration and injuring or defiling a place of worship”.The other charges against them included indulging in “deliberate and malicious” acts intended to outrage religious feelings, uttering statements leading to public mischief, rioting and unlawful assembly.The CBI had argued that the accused conspired and instigated ‘kar sevaks’ to demolish the 16th century mosque. However, the accused had pleaded innocence maintaining that there is no evidence to prove their guilt and claimed they were implicated by the then Congress government at the Centre as a political vendetta.In a significant judgment last year, the Supreme Court allotted the disputed site in Ayodhya for construction of a Ram temple, while calling the demolition of the mosque a violation of the rule of law.An alternative five-acre site was marked in the city for building a mosque.Before the 2017 verdict of the apex court, two sets of cases were being heard in Lucknow and Raebareli.The trial of the first case involving unnamed ‘kar sevaks’ was going on in a Lucknow court, while the second set of cases relating to the eight VVIPs, including Advani, Joshi, Vishnu Hari Dalmiya, Singhal, Katiyar, Bharti, Giriraj Kishore and Sadhvi Ritambhara, were going on in a Raebareli court.The apex court, had while restoring the charge of criminal conspiracy, directed clubbing of two cases relating to the demolition and had also ordered that the trial be concluded in two years.

You know how many people died in Russia? You don't know how many people died in India.

A statement from the Home Ministry said owing to illegal practices of Amnesty International, the previous government had also rejected its applications to receive funds from overseas.  “This led Amnesty to suspend its India operations once during that period as well. This bipartisan and purely legal approach towards Amnesty, under different governments, makes it clear that the entire fault lies in the dubious processes adopted by Amnesty to secure funds for its operations,” the government said, adding that Amnesty International received permission under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act only once, 20 years ago. “Since then Amnesty International, despite its repeated applications, has been denied FCRA approval by successive governments since as per law it is not eligible to get such an approval. To circumvent the FCRA regulations, Amnesty UK remitted money to four entities in India, by classifying it as Foreign Direct Investment. A significant amount of foreign money was remitted to Amnesty (India) without MHA’s approval,” said the government. Amnesty is free to continue humanitarian work in India, but it must remember Indian law does not allow interference in domestic political debates by entities funded by foreign donations. Amnesty today announced halting of India operations over “reprisal by the government” and said the Centre had frozen its bank accounts bringing it to a grinding halt. “The continuing crackdown on Amnesty over the past two years and freezing of bank accounts is not accidental,” said the NGO. For a movement that has done nothing but raise its voices against injustice, this latest attack is akin to freezing dissent,” said Avinash Kumar, Executive Director of Amnesty International India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-true-says-govt-as-amnesty-cries-reprisal-on-ending-ops-148571

Over 600 cases of stubble burning in the last 10 days have adversely affected the air quality in the state.Officials are concerned about its impact on Covid patients since the virus attacks lungs and leads to breathing problem.Read also: Exploring all avenues to oppose farm legislations, says Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief MinisterSources say if immediate steps are not taken, the smoke from Punjab would soon reach the neighbouring states and even Delhi. Information gathered by The Tribune reveals that the air quality in Punjab deteriorated suddenly from “good” or “satisfactory” in August to “moderate” in September. An analysis of data from air quality monitoring stations in six cities shows the pollution has doubled in less than a month, with three districts recording high pollution levels soon after the paddy harvest season began. The air quality index (AQI) in Jalandhar has now risen to 89 from 50 in August; in Patiala 103 from 41; in Mandi Gobindgarh 130 from 53; in Ludhiana 80 from 50; in Khanna 94 from 51; and in Amritsar 104 from 54.The National Capital’s air quality was recorded at 170 on Tuesday, which falls in the “moderate” category.A senior official says farmers are burning stubble since they only have about four weeks to prepare fields for sowing wheat. “With farmers waging a war against the contentious farm laws, any major action against them is likely to see stiff opposition,” he adds. Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary, BKU (Ugrahan), says: “We have been demanding compensation to manage stubble, but the government did not pay any heed. We have no other option but to burn the stubble to prepare fields for the next crop.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-sees-600-farm-fires-in-10-days-148574

Normally, patrolling is done as per fixed schedule while majority of troops are at fully furnished bases where heated accommodation with bunker-type beds exists.With additional troops, habitat is being created on a war footing and “arctic” tents are being provided. Sources said the review was done to assess what all was needed.The cold desert of Ladakh has military deployments at an altitude of 13,000 feet. In summer months, ample water flows in rivers, including Indus, Shyok, Galwan, Chang Chenmo and Chip-Chap. Barring Indus, all of them freeze in winter.The night temperature is already touching minus 5 degrees and will plunge up to minus 20 in some days.The drinking water in places like Siachen is sourced from natural snow. But unlike Siachen, eastern Ladakh doesn’t have abundant snow.Clothing and boots have been sourced in multiple pairs as these tend to get wet in snow. The other task is to feed the troops. The calorie intake has been calculated as the per a Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences study. The daily per-person energy requirements in high altitude (over 12,000 feet) vary between 4,270 and 4,550 calories.The ration list allows the battalion commander to get what his troops may like to eat as culinary tastes vary across India. Troops operating in high-altitude areas suffer from anorexia, says the study. There will be an increased supply of fresh vegetables, fruits, chicken, meat, eggs and even chocolates and energy bars. These will be supplied by air from Chandigarh, the logistics base for Ladakh.Temperature already -5°C||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-army-gears-up-for-long-lac-winter-focus-on-water-bedding-148576

Even amid the ongoing pandemic, terrorism continues to pose a critical threat to international peace and security. Terrorists have stepped up the use of ICT for propaganda and for issuing threats further exacerbating the stress on victims of terror,” she said.“This meeting is, therefore, very timely to discuss our collective way forward to address the critical needs of the victims of terrorism,” said the MEA Secretary.She pointed out that the first UN Global Congress of Victims of Terrorism in 2021 and the 7th Review of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy should help build on the momentum gathered so far.A dedicated voluntary fund to support the victims of terrorism would strengthen United Nation’s capacity-building and technical assistance to requesting member states in assisting and supporting victims of terrorism, she suggested.However, the three options proposed for setting up of a funding mechanism by the Secretary General need further deliberations at the expert level so that the funding can be effective and efficiently use resources, she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-targets-pak-says-26-11-accused-not-yet-punished-148570

The recovery rate rose to 83.01 per cent. Daily new deaths fell below 1,000 to 776.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said India’s recoveries of more than 51 lakh were the highest and deaths per million (70) the lowest. “Daily recoveries are now outnumbering daily new cases despite high levels of testing. We hope this trend will hold,” Bhushan said.The government, however, warned people against laxity and asked everyone to wear masks in the festive and winter seasons, which would present fertile conditions for the Covid spread. The warning followed ICMR’s launch of the second sero survey findings that estimate around 6.6 per cent of people over 10 years (one in 15 people) had likely been exposed to the virus by August. “Disease prevalence in 18 years plus population is estimated at 7.1 per cent, up from 0.73 per cent in the first survey,” ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said.‘Have funds for vaccine cost’Countering Serum Institute, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said: “We do not agree with the Rs 80,000 crore vaccine math, but the government has funds.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1st-in-a-month-cases-below-75k-deaths-1k-148584

By torching farming equipment, which the agriculturists worship, these people are now insulting farmers,” he said without naming the Congress.He asserted that the government would not be deterred by the opposition and the reform measures would continue apace.Referring to the farm laws, he said they would emancipate the farmers, including from middlemen and brokers, as they give freedom to sell produce in the open market.The MSP regime would continue simultaneously.Regarding the agitation against the laws, he said the Congress leaders were peeved as they “plug one more of their avenues to amass black money”.He said the project to clean the Ganga during earlier governments was pockmarked with loopholes.Homing in on the government’s flagship Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), he announced a project under it to connect all schools and anganwadi centres in the country with piped water within 100 days.He also inaugurated a museum on the Ganges at Chandi Ghat in Haridwar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-wants-middlemen-not-farmers-to-prosper-prime-minister-modi-148588

Police personnel manning barricades at these two places claimed they had “orders from Deputy Commissioners that PR varieties of paddy shouldn’t enter the state”. In Hisar, Divisional Commissioner Vinay Singh has issued directions to check the entry of outside bajra for sale in Hisar, Bhiwani and Charkhi Dadri markets.Paddy is procured in Haryana by central agency FCI under a decentralised system where the state government’s expenditure is reimbursed by the Centre. The MSP for grade-A paddy variety this time is Rs 1,888 a quintal. However, crops like bajra, maize and moong are purchased by the state government at a support price on the condition that the entire stock will be consumed in the state itself.An official said the ban on the sale of outside crops could also be due to an illegal practice adopted by unscrupulous traders. “The traders purchase bajra outside the state at a lower price (around Rs 1,400 a quintal) and get it procured in Haryana at a higher MSP — Rs 2,150 per quintal. The neighbouring states don’t offer any support price,” he said.To counter the illegal practice, the government has made it mandatory for state farmers to register on “meri fasal mera byora” portal and mention in advance how much land they had sown their crops on. “But traders have been making fake entries to skirt this norm too,” said the official.PK Das, Additional Chief Secretary, Food Supplies and Consumers Affairs, said prior registration on the portal was a must for paddy farmers bringing their produce for procurement. “The same norm applies to non-Haryana farmers, but they have to wait for a message we send prior to procurement,” he said.As far as bajra, moong and maize were concerned, Haryana didn’t purchase these crops from outside farmers, maintained Das.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-ban-on-outside-crops-negates-centres-free-market-policy-148589

These include the1993 Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility, the 1996 Agreement on Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs) in the military field, 2005 Protocol on Implementation of CBMs and 2005 Agreement on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for settlement of the India-China Boundary Question.‘No war, no peace’The present security scenario along our northern frontiers is at an uneasy no war, no peace status. — Air Chief Marshal RKS BhadauriaAll these pacts commit India and China to clarification and confirmation of the LAC to reach a common understanding of its alignment, it said. “Therefore, the insistence now of the Chinese side that there is only one LAC is contrary to the solemn commitments made by China in these agreements,’’ noted the MEA statement.Making it clear that the Indian side had always respected and abided by the LAC, the MEA said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had stated in Parliament that Chinese troops had tried to transgress the LAC in several parts of the western sector in an attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo.As China has repeatedly said the current situation should be resolved in accordance with the agreements signed between the two countries, “we, therefore, expect that they will sincerely and faithfully abide by all agreements and understandings and refrain from advancing an untenable unilateral interpretation of the LAC,’’ added the MEA statement.Incidentally, China had last spoken of the 1959 line after troops had scuffled along the Pangong Lake in August 2017.Twists and Turns||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-rejects-chinas-1959-claim-line-148590
