It has been agreed that the National Health Service (NHS) is to establish a clinical advisory group led by NHS England Chief People Officer Prerana Isaar to support India's COVID response. "The UK will always be there for India in its time of need," said Johnson."The terrible images we have seen in India in recent weeks are all the more powerful because of the close and enduring connection between the people of the UK and India. I am deeply moved by the surge of support the British people have provided to the people of India and am pleased the UK government has been able to play our part in providing life-saving assistance," he said.The new NHS advisory group effort will work with Indian institutions such as the All India Institute of Medical Services (AIIMS) to share experience on managing COVID outbreaks. The group will include researchers in public and global health, alongside nursing and other health professionals who have experience of the Indian healthcare system."This support will help urgently meet some of India's acute needs, particularly oxygen for patients. We are determined to help our Indian friends in their hour of need,” said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who will be hosting External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in Britain for the G7 Foreign and Development Ministers Meeting and bilateral talks next week."We need to all work together to defeat Covid-19. No one is safe until we are all safe," Raab said.The UK government has welcomed the "powerful demonstration" of what Modi calls the diaspora “living bridge” between India and the UK, with British people coming to the support of India in huge numbers."Businesses, civil society and the wider public have responded to appeals for help and launched funding drives. This includes the British Asian Trust's ‘Oxygen for India' emergency appeal, which is raising funds for oxygen concentrators to be rapidly deployed to Indian hospitals. The BAT appeal, which has been personally backed by the Prince of Wales, has raised more than GBP 1.5 million in the last week,” the government said. Virgin Atlantic also flew 200 boxes of oxygen concentrators to Delhi on Saturday, after partnering with Khalsa Aid. Further cargo space will be given free of charge on six flights to India in the next week, in association with the Red Cross."India has also provided support to the UK throughout the coronavirus pandemic. As the ‘pharmacy of the world' the country has kept its borders open to supply the UK with vital medicine and PPE [personal protective equipment] – exporting over 11 million face masks and 3 million packets of paracetamol over the course of 2020,” Downing Street said.It added that the world is "safer and stronger" because of work between the UK and India, using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine as an example, which was developed in the UK, is currently being produced in the millions by India's Serum Institute and will be distributed to the world at cost through COVAX - the global equitable vaccine access facility. "It is those shared values of openness and the pursuit of knowledge and scientific advancement for the betterment of our societies that lie at the heart of the relationship between the UK and India," Downing Street said."India is the largest democracy in the world, a fellow Commonwealth country and in June Prime Minister Modi will travel to the UK to attend the G7 Summit as a guest – one of four world leaders invited to join the Summit of leading democracies," it added.

02-05-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee: Soldier who trumped BJP war machine||She's the soldier, she the commander and she the army.The distinction between Mamata Banerjee the leader and TMC the party evaporated into nothingness as she conquered West Bengal fighting the BJP's election war machine led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah almost single-handedly.The victory for Banerjee, by far the biggest mass leader since the redoubtable Jyoti Basu who ruled West Bengal with an iron fist from 1977 to 2000, will not only help fortify her position in the state but also enhance her standing at the national level where voices from the opposition are getting feeble with time.A masterful practitioner of modern-day politics, she has wielded considerable influence beyond her own state, in the corridors of power in New Delhi, for a long time, sewing up alliances with both the Congress and the BJP.Since leading thousands of hungry, half-clad and angry farmers on the dusty streets of Singur and Nandigram over a decade ago, she ruled the state virtually unchallenged for eight years before the BJP vastly extended its influence and won 18 of the state's 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019.For the 66-year-old spinster, the political journey from the restive alleys of Nandigram and Singur in 2007-08, when she waged a relentless battle against the Left Front government, to 'Nabanna', the seat of power in Kolkata, was as captivating as it was punishing.Although she cut her teeth in politics as a young Congress volunteer in her student days and rose to become a minister in UPA and NDA governments, it was in the crucible of Nandigram and Singur movements against forcible acquisition of farm land by the Communist government for industrialisation that her destiny and that of the TMC took shape.She founded the TMC in January 1998 after parting ways with the Congress and it was through struggles, big and small, against the Communist dispensation that her party grew.In 2001, when the state had its first assembly polls after the launch of the TMC, the party bagged an impressive 60 seats in the 294-member House, while the Left Front clinched a staggering 192.In its second outing in the 2006 assembly elections, the TMC's strength came down by half as it could pocket only 30 seats, while the Left scored a resounding victory with 219.The four years that followed were the most momentous in the contemporary political history of West Bengal as she put up a spirited fight against the Left Front government over alleged excesses in Singur and Nandigram.The assembly elections of 2011 were historic, as she decimated the Left in one of its longest-standing bastions.Banerjee's party ended the Left Front's 34-year unbroken stint in power, winning a whopping 184 seats, riding a massive public outrage against the communists, who were restricted to just 60 seats. It was then the longest-serving democratically elected communist government in the world.But power has many pitfalls and rising aspirations is one of them. A string of influential TMC leaders including Suvendu Adhikari, the MLA from Nandigram and a minister, deserted Banerjee and joined the BJP.Born into a Bengali Brahmin family, Banerjee, as a young Congress activist, formed 'Chhatra Parishad' unions in colleges.She rose through the Congress ranks rapidly and was called a giant slayer when she defeated CPI-M heavyweight Somnath Chatterjee in Jadavpur in the 1994 Lok Sabha elections held in the aftermath of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi's assassination.She lost the seat to Malini Bhattacharya in 1989, when an anti-Congress wave swept the country after the Bofors scandal came to light, the only time she lost an election.She won the Kolkata South Lok Sabha seat in 1991 which she retained in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2009.As Minister of State for Sports in the P V Narasimha Rao government, the quick tempered leader announced her resignation and held a rally in Kolkata's Brigade Parade Ground against what she believed was government's neglect of sports. She was divested of all her portfolios including Women and Child Welfare and Human Resource Development in 1993.In 1996, she accused the Congress of behaving like a "stooge" of the Left and founded the Trinamool Congress in 1998.She joined the NDA in 1999 and was appointed the railway minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, and launched new trains and rail projects in West Bengal.Banerjee quit the NDA in 2001 in the aftermath of the Tehelka expose, which brought under cloud several ministers in the Vajpayee government, and aligned with the Congress again the same year.She was back in the NDA in 2003 and was appointed the coal and mines minister in 2004.She contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2004 as part of the NDA and her party lost badly. She was the lone Lok Sabha MP of the TMC from West Bengal.In 2006, the TMC fared abysmally in the state assembly elections.Before the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, she joined the Congress-led UPA and the alliance won 26 of the state's 42 seats. She was beck as the railway minister.As public outrage grew over the Left Front government's crackdown on protests in Nandigram that killed 14 people and injured scores more in police firing, Banerjee's popularity grew exponentially.Singur and Nandigram became emblematic of mass resistance against the communist rulers, and in 2011 assembly elections, the TMC won a landslide. The TMC-Congress-SUCI alliance won 227 of the 294 seats.After being sworn in as the chief minister on May 20, 2011, one of the first decisions of her government was to return 400 acres of land acquired by the governent for Tata Motors Nano project to the farmers. The Tatas had already exited Singur.Banerjee launched a slew of welfare projects in health and education sector and for empowerment of women, and tried to strengthen the law and order machinery by setting up police commissionerates in Howrah, Bidhannagar, Barrackpore and Durgapur-Asansol.The BJP, rapidly expanding its influence in the state at the Left's expense, accused her of minority appeasement after she instituted a stipend for thousands of imams and muezzins of mosques. The Kolkata High Court called it unconstitutional and stopped payment.She earned the BJP's wrath when she banned the immersion of Durga idols in October 2016 till after observation of Muharram by Muslims.Ministers in the Banerjee government and key TMC leaders got embroiled in the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scam cases. Quite a few were jailed.Though these allegations indeed chip away at Banerjee's popularity reflected in the BJP's impressive showing in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, nothing stuck in the assembly elections.'Didi' became the real 'Dada' as she got past the post, on a wheelchair and a foot in cast, a souvenir from the Nandigram battle against former protege-turned-rival Suvendu Adhikari.

02-05-2021||New Delhi||Historic day for Left: In Kerala, gets second term but fails to bag even one seat in West Bengal||The Left rewrote history in Kerala on Sunday by becoming the first government to get a second term in four decades but its fortunes fell to a historic low in West Bengal where it failed to bag even one seat, resulting in its complete decimation in a state it once ruled for over three decades.The Left’s fall in Bengal was a sharp one. It not only drew a blank in the 2019 national elections but lost its traditional supporters to the BJP, as conceded by its own leaders.Matters came to such a pass that the 2021 assembly polls became a bipolar contest between the BJP and the TMC, with the CPI(M), CPI and the Congress playing in the background.The CPI(M) in a politburo statement said the results of the five assembly polls were a resounding defeat for the BJP, but shed very little light on its own losses.“The BJP suffered a severe setback despite its money power and manipulations in West Bengal. The people of Bengal have very clearly rejected the ideology of communal polarisation.“The performance of the Sanjukta Morcha and the Left has been very disappointing. People’s urge to defeat the BJP led to a sharp polarisation squeezing out the Sanjukta Morcha. A self-critical review of these results will be undertaken by the party to draw needed lessons,” it said.In the run-up to the assembly polls, the Left continued to cut a sorry figure in Bengal. Its vote share fell to 40 per cent in 2011 from 50 per cent in 2006. It plunged further to 26 per cent in the 2016 assembly polls.While questions and murmurs within the party remained about partnering with the Congress, which had little or no presence on the ground in the state, senior leaders of the party weighed in and chose to ally with them. Many even questioned the logic of partnering with the party which fails to even transfer votes to its allies.“In Bengal, the Left will have to do a serious review of its political line and assessment of its situation, on how and why the bipolar situation was allowed to emerge. Why did we lose our grip and why was BJP allowed a foothold,” said CPI general secretary D Raja.When asked if their choice of ally in Bengal let them down, Raja said that the post- election introspection will lead to a “churning” where all these questions would be addressed.However, a cause of concern is that despite the Left’s efforts to change—shedding its sombre image by releasing videos on social media, putting up young candidates and even stitching an alliance with the Furfura Sharif cleric Abbas Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front (ISF) to dent the TMC’s Muslim votebank—nothing seems to have worked.In Kerala though, well laid out plans worked seamlessly. Pinarayi Vijayan, the 76-year-old CPI(M) leader, became the third chief minister in Kerala’s history to be re-elected and the first to continue in office after completing a full term. The LDF’s win is just the second instance of a ruling front receiving consecutive terms.The LDF is expected to finish between 95 and 100 seats, eclipsing its 2016 tally of 91 seats.“We have closed the account that the BJP opened in the Kerala assembly in 2016 election. Kerala has become the only assembly in India that has no representative from the BJP. Kerala will remain the citadel of secularism in the country,” said CPI(M) leader Thomas Isaac on Twitter.Fighting on the plank of development, the LDF won both hearts and votes because of its apt handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“The people of Kerala have voted on the performance of the incumbent government, the alternative policies pursued, the manner in which all the natural calamities were tackled, the pandemic and its fall out were handled, welfare measures undertaken and for safeguarding the secular, democratic, harmonious character of Kerala society.” the CPI(M) politburo said in a statement.“Kerala and Tamil Nadu deserve congratulations for giving a befitting reply to the BJP and those who aligned with the BJP. The BJP is a party that believes in imposing a monolithic culture. In Kerala, people have gone with the LDF for its performance. The UDF needs to seriously introspect. Instead of fighting the BJP they were fighting us,” Raja said.The CPI(M) politburo’s statement also said the party considers the results of the five assembly polls to be collectively a “severe setback for the BJP” with political parties opposed to the saffron party winning in Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.“Overall, these results are a severe setback for the BJP. Despite all its efforts to rouse communal feelings, of spending huge amounts of money, manipulating the system and the electoral apparatus, they failed to elicit people’s support.“These results must further strengthen the people’s movements and struggles in the country to safeguard the secular, democratic character of the Indian Republic and for vastly improving the living conditions of the people,” the party said.Till late evening, the CPI had got 0.21 per cent of the votes, while CPI(M) got 4.62 per cent and CPI(ML) only 0.03 per cent of the votes. The Congress bagged only 3.02 per cent of the votes. On the other hand, the BJP managed to get 38.07 per cent votes, while the TMC bagged 47.98 per cent of votes in Bengal.

As soon as a doctor attended her, she died.“As soon as the video went viral on social media, District Magistrate Shambhu Kumar and senior doctors of the medical college reached to the woman patient and tested her. Maharaj Suheldev Medical College principal AK Sahni on Sunday when the patient was brought to the emergency unit, her family members claimed that she was on death bed.”              “By the time, the doctors could start her treatment, she died,” Sahni said.“The daughters of the deceased woman were giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as they became emotional.”             He said there was no shortage of oxygen in the medical college.

02-05-2021||Vibha Sharma||Gains and lessons for BJP from assembly poll results||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 2Registering a convincing return in Assam, taking some of the sheen off incumbent West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s spectacular victory and making inroads into uncharted space, Puducherry, it has not been such a bad day for the Bharatiya Janata Party. The saffron party also has a lot to cheer about the fact that the NDA, led by ally AIADMK, gave rival DMK-led coalition a reasonable fight in Tamil Nadu, which, many felt, was completely headed one way. It also registered more than 2,000 per cent increase (BJP had won just three seats in the 2016 assembly elections) in number of seats in Bengal, a no small feat by any means. However, this was not good enough for the BJP to get the state its top leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and president JP Nadda, had been vying for five years now.The spectacular victory of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee against the mighty election machinery of the BJP has given its rivals a new hope to take on Prime Minister Modi, who enjoys the TINA (there is no alternative) factor when it comes to winning elections. It may have also given the saffron party many points to ponder. The larger message for the BJP from West Bengal, and Kerala, may be that creating ‘hawa’ and smart IT/social media management may not be a recipe to success against a strong regional satrap. While Prime Minister Modi continues to be its strongest, most popular leader at the national level, when it comes to states the lack of strong regional leadership is showing.  West Bengal and Kerala have both demonstrated the importance of a strong regional leader and that national and state elections are fought on different planks and ideas. In the state where the BJP had strong regional leadership, like Assam, it had returned.“The BJP’s lack of regional leadership in West Bengal is visible, its sitting MPs have lost. The fact is people vote differently in central and state elections. No doubt, it made an impact, emerging as an alternative to the TMC, but that has been at the cost of the Left and the Congress. Polarisation also has its limits. It is not as if all Hindu votes will be consolidated in its favour, this the BJP should understand. It needs to rework this part of the strategy,” say political observers.Meanwhile, pointing that the party has registered “more victories than losses” under the leadership of PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP leaders say they gave Bengal all they had “but these elections have demonstrated a scenario where anti-BJP votes were consolidated”. “We will do a thorough analysis of results. We are the biggest challenger at the national and a major regional force but that does not mean we will win all elections. The aim should be to give a good fight, which we did in Bengal and Kerala,” BJP leaders say, also dismissing the observation that results may be a reflection on either Centre’s Covid management or the farmers’ agitation against the three laws.  The “thorough analysis” will come useful for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, the next big one in line and where minority votes matter, along with Gujarat. The year 2022 will also see Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, and Manipur voting to elect fresh assemblies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gains-and-lessons-for-bjp-from-assembly-poll-results-247317

The Centre will continue to extend all possible support to the West Bengal Government to fulfil people’s aspirations and also to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic,” he tweeted.In another tweet, Modi said, “I would like to congratulate Shri @vijayanpinarayi and the LDF for winning the Kerala Assembly elections. We will continue working together on a wide range of subjects and to ensure India mitigates the COVID-19 global pandemic.”In a tweet to Stalin, who is set to be the next Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Modi said they will work together for enhancing national progress, fulfilling regional aspirations and defeating the COVID-19 pandemic.The prime minister also expressed his gratitude to the people of West Bengal for boosting the BJP’s presence.“From a negligible presence earlier, BJP’s presence has significantly increased. BJP will keep serving the people. I applaud each and every Karyakarta for their spirited effort in the polls,” he said.“Gratitude to the people of Kerala who supported our party in these elections, he said in another tweet and lauded party workers for their efforts,” he tweeted.In another post, he said, “I would like to thank the people of Tamil Nadu who supported NDA. I assure the people of Tamil Nadu that we will keep working towards the state’s welfare and to further popularise the glorious Tamil culture.

Eleven patients died at the Anantapur Sarvajana Government Hospital last evening due to shortage of oxygen, while 5 deaths were reported from a private hospital in Kurnool. Relatives of the deceased at the Ananta Sarvajana Government Hospital alleged interruption in oxygen supply resulted in the deaths. They also alleged negligence on the part of the hospital staff, but officials denied it and attributed the deaths to complications of COVID-19. The administration is contemplating an inquiry.Five other Covid patients died in a private hospital in Kurnool due to failure of oxygen supply. The said hospital is not an authorised centre for the treatment of COVID 19. District Collector Veerapandian said all the Covid patients were immediately shifted to Kurnool Government General Hospital and action was being initiated against the private hospital. Given the rising cases of coronavirus, the Andhra Pradesh Government has postponed the Intermediate Examinations scheduled to be held shortly. Announcing this here on Sunday, Education Minister Adimoolapu Suresh said the decision to put off the examinations was taken consequent on the views expressed by the High Court and the opinion of the parents. The fresh dates for examinations would be announced after the COVID situation in the state eased, he stated.To curb the spread of the virus the government has announced stopping half the private buses and now around 880 private travel buses have been directed to be off roads in Andhra Pradesh. Even the buses that are operating have been asked to operate with only 50 per cent seats to maintain social distance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/interruption-in-oxygen-supply-kills-16-in-two-andhra-hospitals-247309

So, we have around 200 such medical officers, who were to retire, we will continue to have their services.“So, we are holding back these medical officers who would have otherwise left us,” Lt Gen Kanitkar, the Deputy Chief of Integrated Defence Staff (Medical) under the Chief of Defence Staff, told PTI here.The orders for implementation of this plan are expected soon as the proposal is in advance stages of approval, said Lt Gen Kanitkar, the third women officer to have reached to the level of three-star general in the armed forces.The other two were Punita Arora, who worked with the army and later shifted to the Navy, and Air Marshall Padma Bandopadhyay.     The SSC medical officers are granted commission in the armed forces for a tenure of five years which is extendable by another 5 years for those who are willing to continue subject to laid down eligibility criteria.Lt Gen Kanitkar feels that the present Covid-19 crisis has taken every country back to the drawing board and rework their plans according to the age-old saying ‘health is wealth’.“I think we need to ramp up basic primary health infrastructure. In this kind of pandemic even countries with the best of the infrastructures collapsed. If we look that way, we have performed much better during the first wave of the pandemic,” she said.Among the host of services launched by the armed forces include starting a website ‘SeHAT’ (Services eHealth Assistance and Teleconsultation) to provide assistance to the families of armed forces as well as ex-service personnel.Having served during the Kargil war in 1999, when she was posted to the Northern Command, Lt Gen Kanitkar feels that today the doctors are frontline workers while soldiers are helping the medical fraternity in fighting the pandemic.In addition, those retired from AFMS have been advised to help in their respective localities and the local army commanders can be their facilitator.“Already senior doctors including a retired Director General of Armed Forces Medical Services have started providing teleconsultation to needy as well as to the ex-servicemen,” she said.State government hospitals would be provided with Nursing Assistants, who have retired from the service, she said.“Some of the SSC medical officers, who have recently retired from the armed forces, may also be roped in on a voluntary basis and used for Covid-19 management,” she said.

02-05-2021||Lucknow||3.19 lakh candidates elected unopposed in UP panchayat elections: SEC||A total of 3.19 lakh candidates have been elected unopposed in the Uttar Pradesh panchayat elections, the State Election Commission said on Sunday.“As many as 3,19,317 candidates have been elected unopposed in the panchayat elections. This includes seven members of zila panchayat, 2,005 members of kshetra panchayat and over 3.17 lakh members who have been elected unopposed in this panchayat election. As many as 178 candidates for the post of pradhan of gram panchayats were also elected unopposed,” the SEC said in a statement.In Ballia, Shailesh Singh (45), a candidate for the post of pradhan of Rampur village panchayat under Maniyar block, died on Sunday morning. Family sources said Singh’s condition deteriorated suddenly and he was taken to a doctor who declared him dead.Counting of votes for the panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh began on Sunday morning, an official said.“The counting of votes will continue till all the ballots are counted. The entire process may take two days,” a senior SEC official told PTI.The State Election Commission (SEC) had said the candidates and their agents will be allowed to enter the counting centres only if they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 48 hours prior to the commencement of the counting process or taken both doses of the vaccine.The Supreme Court on Saturday had refused to stay the counting process. In a special urgent hearing on a holiday (Saturday), a bench of Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice Hrishikesh Roy passed the order after taking note of several notifications and assurances of the SEC that the COVID-19 protocols will be followed at all the 829 counting centres.The court directed that there will be a strict curfew in the entire state till Tuesday morning and no victory rallies will be permitted.It also asked the SEC to fix the responsibility for observance of COVID-19 protocols at the counting centres on gazetted officers.The bench directed the poll panel to preserve the CCTV footage of the counting centres till the Allahabad High Court concludes its hearings on the related petitions before it.It also ordered that the government officials, candidates and their agents will have to produce RT-PCR test reports to show that they are COVID-19 negative before entering the counting centres.The SEC official said generally counting of votes takes place in eight-hour shifts.The SEC said at every counting centre, a health desk will be established where a doctor will be present with medicines.Those showing symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cold and cough will not be allowed at the counting centres. Everyone entering the counting centre has to undergo thermal scanning, the SEC said.It categorically stated that there will be a complete ban on victory processions.Voting for the panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh ended on April 29 with a 75-per cent voter turnout in the fourth and final phase.Lakhs of candidates were in the fray for over 7.32 lakh seats in the gram panchayat wards, 58,176 in the gram panchayats, 75,852 in the kshetra panchayats and 3,050 in the zila panchayats in the statewide elections held over four phases.

02-05-2021||New Delhi||RSS affiliate SJM asks govt to provide clearance for local production of Sputnik; technology transfer of Covaxin, Covishield||RSS affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) has urged the Narendra Modi government to provide regulatory clearance for the local production of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine and a ceiling on prices of Covid-19 medicines and vaccines.Citing the surge in Covid cases, the SJM urged the BJP government to facilitate technology transfer of vaccines, including trade secrets to all potential manufacturers to scale up the production of Covaxin and Covishield."Transfer the technologies for the production of medicines and vaccine globally. Licence vaccine production widely to more pharma companies with technological capabilities, instead of a few companies. Articulate the need to waiver of IP and facilitation of technology transfer in all relevant international forums at the global level and accelerate diplomatic efforts at G7, G20 and other groupings," the SJM told the BJP government."The second wave of COVID has swept the country and the number of new cases on each day has crossed 4 lakhs. There is an urgent need for various medical products to effectively respond to the second wave of pandemic especially medicines and vaccines to be made available at affordable prices in the country," said Ashwani Mahajan, National Co-Convenor of the SJM.Other recommendations of the SJM include license under Section 100 or compulsory licence under section 92 to scale up production of medicines like "Remdesivir, Faviracire, Tociluzumab and new medicines like Molnupiravir"Mahajan said though the local production of Remdesivir and Favirapvir is taking place, the available quantity is highly inadequate to meet the increasing demand due to the severity of the problem.Another important medicine to treat COVID-19 patients with a deadly "cytokine storm" is Tocilizumab, which is not produced in India. The importation of this medicine is highly inadequate to meet the requirements, he said."Though there is a voluntary price reduction for Remdesivir it is still very high and ranges between Rs 899 and Rs 3490 per vial. Reports in this regard state the cost of the full course of Remedsivir including reasonable profit is around USD 9 i.e. around Rs 666. On the other hand, the cost of Tocilizumab is Rs 40000 per vial. Under the present scenario the general public is reeling under the corporate greed, which needs to be curbed at any cost," he said.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch also condemned the statement of global corporate leader, Bill Gates that vaccine formula shouldn’t be shared with India and other countries."This is nothing but yet another manifestation of corporate greed to profit from the worst pandemic of the century. There is an urgent need to invoke measures like a ceiling on the prices of these medicines. The prices of vaccine announced by both companies for the state government procurement and private hospitals are exorbitant and affect the acceleration of vaccination in the country. Unreasonable profit for medicines and vaccines are unjustifiable in all circumstances, especially in a pandemic," he said.Introduction of the competition is the best way to lowering the prices. Patent protection is the major barrier to the generic production of these medicines, he added.The SJM said though 7 Indian companies are making Remdesivir under the voluntary license, the quantity is not enough to meet the demand, and the price is very high from the point of view of affordability.The Government should use the public health safeguards in the Patents Act and permit more companies to produce these medicines in the coming days.In the case of vaccine, the country needs nearly 195 crores of doses to cover at least 70% of the population. This cannot be fulfilled by the two companies alone. There is an urgent need to bring more manufactures to start the production. To facilitate the technology transfer, Government has to take measures to overcome the intellectual property barriers including patent and trade secret.The government of India should treat all medical products to respond to COVID 19 as a global public good and take the following measures to translate the idea of a global public good into a reality, Mahajan added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-sjm-asks-govt-to-provide-clearance-for-local-production-of-sputnik-technology-transfer-of-covaxin-covishield-247277
02-05-2021||New Delhi||‘Could not predict exact nature of 2nd wave’: Scientists working on mathematical models||A group of scientists working on mathematical models to forecast the surge of coronavirus cases said Sunday they could not predict the exact trajectory of the devastating second wave as the virus dynamics and its transmissibility changed substantially over time.A statement issued by the Department of Science and Technology, and signed by IIT-Kanpur Professor Manindra Agrawal, Integrated Defense Staff Deputy Chief Madhuri Kanitkar and IIT Hyderabad Professor M Vidyasagar, said mathematical models had predicted a second wave of coronavirus and its peak in the third week of April with daily cases of around I lakh.They also rejected reports that the scientists working on the SUTRA model cautioned in March about the second wave, but that their warning was ignored.“This is incorrect,” they said in the statement.Last year, the government had formed a group of scientists, mathematicians and experts to forecast the surge of cases.They said the nature of the virus has been changing very rapidly, and in such a scenario, any prediction must be continually readjusted, sometimes almost daily.“We are working closely with the government and our inputs have always been received positively. While we could not predict the exact nature of the second wave earlier, we continue our efforts to better estimate its future trajectory,” they said.They added that the government sought its inputs on April 2 when they predicted a peak would come around the third week of that month.“A meeting was called on 2nd April to seek our inputs by one of the very senior officers of the government coordinating the national pandemic response. We indicated that the SUTRA model predicted the second wave to peak by the third week of April and to stay most likely around 1 lakh daily cases,” the scientists said in the statement.However, the daily figures actually reported were thrice the predicted numbers.On April 15, India reported 2,00,739 cases, while it recorded 3,14,835 cases on April 22. Breaching its all previous records, the country hit a record daily high with over 4 lakh new infections on May 1.“Clearly, the model predictions in this instance were incorrect because of the reasons below,” they said, listing reasons why.A mathematical model, they said, can only predict the future with some certainty so long as virus dynamics and its transmissibility do not change substantially over time.Mathematical models can also provide a mechanism to predicting alternate scenarios corresponding to various policy decisions such as non-pharmaceutical interventions, they added.

02-05-2021||New Delhi||Vehicle ownership transfer: Road ministry notifies changes in motor vehicle rules||The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has notified certain changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, to facilitate the owner of a vehicle for nominating a person in the registration certificate, which would help the motor vehicle to be registered or transferred in the name of the nominee, in case of death of the owner.Now, the owner can put the name of the nominee at the time of registration of the vehicles and can also add it later through an online application.The process is otherwise cumbersome and non-uniform across the country.According to the notified rules, the owner of a vehicle has to submit proof of the identity of the nominee, in case the nominee is mentioned.“Where the owner of a motor vehicle dies, the person nominated by the vehicle owner in the certificate of registration or the person succeeding to the possession of the vehicle, as the case may be, may for a period of three months from the death of the owner of the motor vehicle, use the vehicle as if it has been transferred to him, Provided that such person has, within thirty days of the death of the owner, informed the registering authority of the occurrence of the death of the owner and of his own intention to use the vehicle,” the notification said.It further said the nominee or person succeeding to the possession of the vehicle shall apply in Form 31 within the period of three months from the death of the owner of the motor vehicle, to the registering authority for the transfer of ownership of the vehicle in his name.For change in nominee in case of contingencies like divorce or division of property, the owner may change the nomination with an agreed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), it added.Currently, in case of death of a registered owner of a vehicle, the procedure of transferring the vehicle to a nominee requires complying with a raft of procedures and frequent visits to different offices.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways on November 27, 2020, had proposed to amend the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, to facilitate the owner of a vehicle for nominating a person in the registration certificate.The government “has invited suggestions and comments from public and all stakeholders on the proposed amendment...,” it had said.Under the proposed amendment, “an additional clause is proposed to be inserted wherein ‘proof of identity of nominee, if any’ to enable the owner to nominate anyone to be the legal heir of the vehicle in case of death,” it had said.For transferring the vehicle to the legal heir in case no nominee has been specified by the owner, it is proposed that an additional clause may be inserted to enable the owner to nominate a nominee.In case where the nominee is already specified, the vehicle will be transferred in his/her name.

02-05-2021||Washington||Over 100 US lawmakers urge Biden to support TRIPS waiver proposal of India||More than 100 US lawmakers have written to President Joe Biden urging him to support India's proposal to the WTO to temporarily lift certain intellectual property barriers and allow countries to locally manufacture COVID-19 diagnostics and vaccines.The Biden administration has not made a decision on the issue yet. The proposal by India and South Africa will be a focus at the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) meeting on May 5.“We write to convey the urgent need for the United States to support the temporary waiver of some Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) rules proposed by India and South Africa at the WTO, during the COVID-19 emergency,” a group of influential American lawmakers wrote in a letter to Biden.In their letter dated April 30, the lawmakers said that from a global public health perspective, this waiver is vital to ensuring sufficient volume of and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics around the world.The TRIPS waiver is also essential to ensure all global economies, including the US' economy, can recover from the pandemic and thrive. Simply put, we must make vaccines, testing, and treatments available everywhere if we are going to crush the virus anywhere, the letter said.Among others, the letter has been signed by Congresswoman Karen Bass, Chair of House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health; Rosa DeLauro, Chair of the House Appropriations Committee; Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair of the House Committee on Science and Technology; Pramila Jayapal, Chair of the Progressive Caucus; Brad Sherman, Co-Chair of House Caucus on Indian and Americans; Ro Khanna, Co-Vice Chair of the House Caucus on India and Indian Americans and Raja Krishnamoorthi.In the letter, the lawmakers impressed upon the President that from a global health perspective, the waiver is vital to ensure volume and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Unless countries cooperate and share medical technology, there simply will not be sufficient supply of vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments for many countries – particularly developing countries – to effectively fight COVID-19, they wrote.Lawmakers said that the globalised economy cannot recover if only parts of the world are vaccinated. The TRIPS waiver will help everyone across the world.  As such they urged Biden to swiftly act to bring the pandemic to its quickest end and save the lives of Americans and people around the world and announce US support for the WTO TRIPS waiver.Two weeks ago, a group of 10 influential Senators wrote a similar letter to Biden urging him to support India and South Africa's proposal at the WTO for a temporary TRIPS waiver during the COVID-19 pandemic.The letter was written by Senator Bernie Sanders (Chairman, Budget Committee).In the letter, the Senators endorsed the temporary lifting of restrictions of intellectual property barriers to allow countries to locally manufacture COVID-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines to ensure equitable access to healthcare.They have said that supporting the TRIPS waiver would help everyone and the current flexibilities in TRIPS are ill-suited to a global crisis. A targeted, time-limited waiver would help to flatten the curve and also help restore America's leadership in public health on the global stage.“Your administration has the opportunity to reverse the damage done by the Trump administration to our nation's global reputation and restore America's public health leadership on the world stage. To bring the pandemic to its quickest end and save the lives of Americans and people around the world, we ask that you prioritize people over pharmaceutical company profits by reversing the Trump position and announcing US support for the WTO TRIPS waiver,” the Senators wrote.In their letter, the 108 US Congressmen argued that the TRIPS waiver proposed by India and South Africa in October 2020 would temporarily lift certain intellectual property barriers and allow countries to locally manufacture COVID-19 diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines, thereby increasing timely global access.“The waiver is supported by more than 100 nations. The Trump administration led opposition to the waiver and, with a handful of other WTO signatories, has blocked its adoption,” they said.According to the letter, this temporary TRIPS waiver is key for countries to manufacture necessary supplies of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. The current flexibilities included in TRIPS are ill-suited to an urgent, global crisis.TRIPS allows countries to negotiate compulsory licenses, a flexibility that was reaffirmed in the Doha Declaration. However, compulsory licenses must be negotiated by each WTO member country and for each patent or other protection applying to each individual product.“This country-by-country and product-by-product approach is unworkable given the speed and global scope of access necessary to combat a global pandemic. Additionally, the 2020 Special 301 Report makes it clear that the United States applies diplomatic power to discourage developing countries from using compulsory licenses.,” they said.“The temporary TRIPS waiver would allow countries and manufacturers to directly access and share technologies to produce vaccines and therapeutics without causing trade sanctions or international disputes,” they wrote.

02-05-2021||Chennai/Thiruvananthapuram||DMK on comeback mode, CPI(M) likely to buck Kerala trend; NDA leading in Pondy||After a ten year stint in the opposition, DMK in Tamil Nadu on Sunday was set for a comeback to the ruling saddle, while the CPI(M) was on course to retain power for the first time in Kerala in four decades and the AINRC-led NDA was leading in Puducherry.Counting of votes polled in the assembly election in the respective states and the Union Territory on April 6 was going on at a brisk pace in all three.All major names-- Chief Ministers K Palaniswami and Pinarayi Vijayan, former CMs O Panneerselvam and Oommen Chandy, DMK president M K Stalin and MNM leader Kamal Haasan were leading from their respective constituencies in the two states and the UT.According to initial trends, the BJP, for which Tamil Nadu has remained a virtual final frontier with no preference from the electorate for long, was leading in four seats, while the saffron party was ahead in three in neighbouring Puducherry.The party has no elected representatives in the outgoing Assemblies, although Puducherry had three nominated BJP legislators.While no visible sweep was seen in favour of the Stalin-led DMK, it was ahead in 119 segments, one more than the minimum for a simple majority in the 234-member Tamil Nadu Assembly and its allies in 19, giving the front a comfortable leeway.The AIADMK is ahead in 81 seats and together with its partners, in 93 constituencies, according to trends made available by the Election Commission for 232 segments till 2 pm.A key pointer in the trends available so far is that the AIADMK continued as a force to be reckoned with, despite the burden of a 10-year anti-incumbency.The party was doing well in its traditional stronghold of western region, comprising districts like Coimbatore, Salem, and Tirupur, besides in parts of North, while DMK was surging ahead in many parts, including the Cauvery delta region, even as it was leading in most of the 16 seats in Chennai, often described as its stronghold.DMK allies-- the Congress was leading in 12 segments, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi in three, and the two Left parties together in four seats.AIADMK's allies the PMK and BJP are ahead in seven and four segments resepectively. This included state BJP chief L Murugan from Dharapuram.In Kerala, the ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front is all set to retain power as it is leading in at least 94 of the 140 assembly seats as counting is still in progress.With Vijayan managing to steer the Left bloc for a successive term, LDF will be bucking the over four decade-old trend of swinging between the Communists and the Congress- headed UDF in the southern state.As per theElection Commission (EC) figures, the ruling front is ahead in 85 seats, UDF in 44and the BJP-led NDA in three constituencies.Senior Congress leaders, including Ramesh Chennithala, Chandy, Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan and P T Thomas established leads, but many front candidates are facing an uphill task.The BJP continued to maintain its lead in Palakkad, where it has fielded 'Metroman' E Sreedharan.The 88-year-old technocrat is ahead of his nearest rival and two-time sitting MLA, Shafi Parambil by over 4,000 votes.Also read: Assembly polls: Mamata trails even as TMC leads in West Bengal; LDF, DMK ahead in Kerala, TNSenior BJP leader and former Mizoram Governor, Kummanam Rajasekharan and actor-turned-Rajya Sabha MP, Suresh Gopi are also leading in Nemom and Thrissur constituencies respectively.Also read: Kerala poll results: Ruling LDF continues to maintain leadIn Puducherry, AINRC founder and former Chief Minister N Rangasamy was trailing behind Congress-backed Independent candidate in Yanam, an enclave of Puducherry in Andhra Pradesh, in a surprise development.Rangasamy, leading the NDA, is also seeking election from Thattanchavady constituency, his pocket borough in Puducherry.

02-05-2021||Sreevalsan Thiyyadi||Debu Chaudhuri: Stickler for Spartan tradition||One trend that veteran Debu Chaudhuri particularly disliked about contemporary Hindustani music was of sitarists swaying the instrument even during meditative moments. “Ye kya hota hai,” he would ask, contemptuously imitating the showmanship with a carefree throw of the right hand after plucking a critical note. The demonstration of the “despicable” act amounted to a tacit salute of his beloved guru.“Our system doesn’t permit such indiscipline. My teacher used to be very particular about us never swinging the sitar,” the Padma Bhushan awardee would say, referring to Ustad Mushtaq Ali Khan (1911-89). Pride borderingon cockiness distinguished Chaudhuri, who died in Delhi on Saturday amid dementia complicated by Covid-19.A steady sitar was least the hallmark of Chaudhuri’s school. True, Khan sahib styled himself primarily on celebrated Senia gharana, but a ring of austerity defined his artistry. So focal was the Spartan purity of the sound that ornamentation became secondary. Often it looked like the ustad was playing the weighty rudra vina known for its gravitas, old-timers say.This feature sustained its resonance in Chaudhuri. For all that acquired heritage, his family had no member into music anywhere up the generations. Nonetheless, his native village near Mymensingh in present-day Bangladesh wasn’t unfamiliar to Hindustani classical. When a sitar master in the neighbourhood school at Ramgopalpur invited Debu to learn under him, the six-year-old’s father responded with a smack on the boy’s cheeks. That apart, Debu performed as a 12-year-old at the radio studio soon after India attained Independence and the family chose to migrate to West Bengal. Panchu Gopal initiated Chaudhuri into sitar and soon Khan sahib groomed him in higher music studies as a college-goer in Kolkata. The new master prompted him to start from scratch, following which the teenager consistently topped university-level music competitions.Into the 1950s, Chaudhuri continued to struggle amid the rise of titans Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan.In 1960, he shifted to the national capital after Delhi University started a music department. He joined there and taught sitar four decades, also guiding PhD aspirants.Gwalior gharana vocalist Laxman Krishnaro Pandit describes Chaudhuri as a paramparawadi — a stickler for tradition. “He was uncompromising and always sought to nurture that trait in the new practitioners,” the octogenarian adds. The sitarist, with assistance from his instrumentalist son Prateek Chaudhuri, founded the UMAK Centre for Culture in 1993, nurturing youngsters. Khayal vocalist Tejpal Singh saw an “ideal tutor” in late Chaudhuri. “His alaap would stem from a deep understanding of the raga,” he says about the instrumentalist, who had to his credit a day-long CD series of 24 ragas spanning an hour each. Chaudhuri came up with eight ragas and half-a-dozen books on music.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/debu-chaudhuri-stickler-for-spartan-tradition-246888

The country saw 4,01,993 cases over 24 hours even as active cases crossed 32 lakh, crippling the health systems.With vaccine shortage plaguing the ambitious national drive, the Ministry of Health rushed doses to all the states for the first fortnight of May to handhold them through the drive until it stabilised. In the northern region, Punjab got 6,16,520 doses (4,63,710 Covishield and 1,52,810 Covaxin).Over 2.5 crore 18 to 44-year-olds have registered on the CoWIN platform after the drive opened on April 28.As of today, Gujarat managed the widest coverage of the adult inoculation drive starting with 10 districts, followed by Uttar Pradesh in seven districts, Maharashtra one, Chhattisgarh three and Jammu and Kashmir two. The rest of the states said they would delay the drive until vaccine orders arrived.Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said the plan would start from Monday while Goa, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala announced postponement of the drive subject to the availability of doses. Odisha conducted a dry run ahead of the May 3 rollout.Hiccups marked the vaccinations at three private hospital chains in Delhi—Max, Appollo and Fortis.The government insisted the states had 79 lakh balance doses of the 16.37 crore it had provided them free of cost.

Now we mean business. Enough is enough,” a visibly upset Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said.Oxygen shortage: Delhi's Madhukar Rainbow Children Hospital raises alarm, says 50 lives at risk“We direct the central government to ensure that NCT of Delhi receives its allocated supply of 490 MT during the day itself,” the Bench ordered.As Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma requested deferment of the order till Monday or at least for half-hour, the Bench said “Do you mean we shut our eyes to people dying in Delhi?”12 die as Delhi’s Batra Hospital runs out of oxygen, many criticalIt said, “Considering the fact that Delhi is not an industrial state, and does not have availability of cryogenic tankers of its own which could be requisitioned under the Disaster Management Act – like other states have done, it falls upon the Centre to arrange the tankers as well, so that the allocation made to Delhi could be fulfilled, lest it remains only a paper allocation.” “The Centre shall ensure availability of cryogenic tankers as well for the said supply,” it said, posting the matter for further hearing on Monday.“In case, this order is not implemented, the officers concerned — Piyush Goyal and Sunita Dawra — shall remain present during the hearing on May 3. Looking at the situation, we make it clear that we may even consider initiating contempt proceedings in case of non-compliance,” the HC said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enough-is-enough-ensure-oxygen-supply-delhi-high-court-directs-centre-246903

The hospital said many more patients were on the edge as they had remained without oxygen for over 80 minutes today.Hospital executive director Sudhanshu Bankata claimed he had been pleading for oxygen replenishment since 7 am today. He said he wanted this “torture to end”. “Eight patients died for want of oxygen initially. The toll has climbed to 12. Our senior gastroenterologist Dr MK Himthani too succumbed to the virus. I hope this situation does not arise again,” he said.Bankata, in a grim prophecy, said more patients could die as supplies remained weak. “Let’s hope and pray that this torture and trial by fire ends soon. We have 230 patients on high flow oxygen and all of them were without oxygen for over 80 minutes,” he said.Against daily 7 MT oxygen requirement, Batra Hospital has been receiving 4.9 MT. It has faced this situation for the second time in a week.Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal extended the lockdown for another week till May 10 (5 am) saying the daily infections were still above 25,000 and this needed to be controlled. The capital has been under lockdown since April 19.Kejriwal again demanded allocated liquid oxygen quota for the state saying the demand was 976 MT daily and the state only received 312 MT yesterday. “How will Delhi breathe with such low supplies,” the CM said even as the Centre raised Delhi’s allocation from 490 to 590 MT a day from today.Another tragedyApril 23, 2021: 25 die at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi due to oxygen shortageApril 24: 20 choked to death at Jaipur Golden Hospital319 MT Delhi’s daily oxygen supply976 MT needed daily, claims Delhi govt657 MT shortageNo PSA plant in a yearDelhi’s oxygen crisis has been building up since last year.

02-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: CBSE announces marking policy for class 10 board exams, results by June 20||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Saturday announced a policy for tabulation of marks for class 10 board exams which have been cancelled in view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the country.According to the policy, while 20 marks for each subject will be for internal assessment as every year, 80 marks will be calculated on basis of the students’ performance in various tests or exams throughout the year.“The students will be assessed out of maximum 100 marks for each subject. As per the policy of the board, 20 marks are for internal assessment and 80 marks are for year-end board examinations. (Read the policy here)“The weightage in terms of maximum marks for schools which have conducted the tests and exams through the year will be—periodic test/unit test (10 marks), Half year exam (30 marks) and pre-board exams (40 marks),” CBSE Examination Controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said.The board has asked schools to form a result committee consisting of principal and seven teachers for finalising the results. Five teachers from the school should be from Mathematics, Social Science, Science and two languages, and two teachers from neighbouring schools should be co-opted by the school as the external members of the committee. “In the pandemic situation, delivering fair and unbiased results to students on time is a challenging task. But the board is confident that every school leader and every teacher of CBSE affiliated schools will complete this process with the highest degree of professionalism, consistency, and care to ensure accurate and fair results. Schools will also have to ensure that the marks awarded by them should be in consonance with past performance of the school in class 10 board exams,” he said.“Schools are expected to provide a fair and objective assessment of the student and have been given the autonomy and flexibility to do so. However, to take care of the variations in school level evaluation processes, there is a need to standardize the scores across schools through a process of moderation of marks,” he added.The CBSE has also warned schools against indulging in unfair and biased practices for assessment or they will have to face penalty or disaffiliation.The board said the result will be announced by June 20.“The schools will form eight-member result committees by May 5. The provision for school-wise distribution of marks as well as finalisation of rationale document will happen by May 10. For candidates who have not appeared in enough tests through the year, the schools will conduct online or telephonic assessment for them by May 15 and will have to finalise the result by May 25,” Bhardwaj said.The controller said the marks will have to be submitted to the CBSE by June 11 and the result will be declared by June 20.The CBSE had on April 14 cancelled class 10 exams and postponed class 12 exams in view of surge in COVID-19 cases.The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The board exams are usually conducted in February-March. However, the board had decided to conduct them in May-June this year due to the pandemic situation.Schools across the country were closed in March last year to contain the spread of COVID-19 ahead of a nationwide lockdown.Several states started reopening the schools partially from October last year, but physical classes are again being suspended because of the rise in coronavirus cases.Last year, the board exams had to be postponed mid-way in March. They were later cancelled and the results were announced based on an alternative assessment scheme.

02-05-2021||London||‘Everything falls on my shoulders’: SII CEO Adar Poonawalla on vaccine pressure in India||Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonwalla on Saturday spoke out about the pressures he was under over the production of COVID-19 vaccines to meet the ever-increasing demand in India as the country battles through a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.In his first comments since he was provided with ‘Y’ category security by the Indian government earlier this week, Poonawalla told ‘The Times’ in an interview about receiving aggressive calls from some of the most powerful people in India, demanding supplies of Covishield—the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that the Serum Institute is producing in India.That pressure is largely behind his decision to fly into London to be with his wife and children, the 40-year-old entrepreneur said.“I’m staying here (London) an extended time because I don’t want to go back to that situation. Everything falls on my shoulders but I can’t do it alone...I don’t want to be in a situation where you are just trying to do your job, and just because you can’t supply the needs of X, Y or Z you really don’t want to guess what they are going to do,” Poonawalla told the newspaper.“The level of expectation and aggression is really unprecedented. It’s overwhelming. Everyone feels they should get the vaccine. They can’t understand why anyone else should get it before them,” he said.The businessman indicated in the interview that his move to London is also linked to business plans to expand vaccine manufacturing to countries outside India, which may include the likes of the UK.“There’s going to be an announcement in the next few days,” he said, when asked about Britain as one of the production bases outside India.According to the newspaper, by the time the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was approved in January this year, the Serum Institute of India had increased its annual production capacity from 1.5 to 2.5 billion doses at a cost of USD 800 million, and stockpiled 50 million doses of Covishield.The company began exporting to 68 countries, including Britain, as India seemed to have been over the worse, until the situation worsened in recent weeks.“We’re really gasping for all the help we can get,” Poonawalla said in the ‘Times’ interview.“I don’t think even God could have forecast it was going to get this bad,” he said.On the charge of profiteering as the cost of Covishield was recently hiked, he termed it as “totally incorrect” and added that Covishield will still be “the most affordable vaccine on the planet” even at a higher price.“We have done the best we can without cutting corners or doing anything wrong or profiteering. I’ll wait for history to judge,” he said.“I’ve always had this sense of responsibility to India and the world because of the vaccines we were making, but never have we made a vaccine so needed in terms of saving lives,” he added.

02-05-2021||New Delhi||Delhi CM announces extension of lockdown till May 10||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced an extension of the ongoing lockdown in Delhi by another week on Saturday amid a sudden surge in COVID-19 cases as the national capital battles an acute shortage of beds and medical oxygen in its hospitals.“Lockdown in Delhi is being extended by one week,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.The lockdown that was scheduled to be in force till 5 am on Monday now stands extended by another week till May 10.Lockdown in Delhi is being extended by one week  The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), in its order on the extension of the lockdown, stated that a review of the pandemic situation showed that the numbers of positive cases, positivity rate as well as bed occupancy (oxygen-supported or ICU beds) in the dedicated COVID-19 hospitals are very high.“...therefore, in order to contain the spread of the virus and break the transmission chain, the curfew needs to be extended for another week in the territory of NCT of Delhi (except for essential activities and services),” it said.In view of the spiralling number of fresh COVID cases and a high positivity rate, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government imposed the lockdown in Delhi on April 19. It was subsequently extended by a week on April 25.The DDMA has directed to extend the curfew (lockdown) on the movement of individuals (except for essential activities and services) till 5 am on May 10 or further orders, whichever is earlier.The COVID situation in the national capital is extremely grim as the festering crisis due to the shortage of oxygen claimed 12 lives in the Batra hospital on Saturday, even as the Centre and the city government are involved in a blame game.The number of fresh COVID cases is still soaring, despite the lockdown.The number of positive cases in a 24-hour period stood at over 27,000 with a positivity rate of 32.69 per cent and 375 deaths, according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin on Friday.“We will have to watch the situation for a few more days whether the number of cases decreases or increases,” Kejriwal had said on the first extension of the lockdown.Chamber of Trade and Industry chairman Brijesh Goyal said 65 per cent of the traders are in favour of an extension of the lockdown.Community platform LocalCircles said 75 per cent respondents in a survey conducted by it in the national capital favoured extending the lockdown.Many believe that till Delhi goes back to a daily caseload of 10,000 and a test positivity rate of less than 10 per cent, the lockdown would be needed, LocalCircles chairman Sachin Taparia said.
