30-05-2021||Satya Prakash||Soli Sorabjee was a man with unflinching faith in constitutional ideals: CJI||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 30Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Supreme Court judges and prominent legal luminaries on Sunday paid rich tributes to noted jurist and former Attorney General Soli J Sorabjee who passed away a month ago.“He (Soli) was a man with an unflinching faith in the constitutional ideals, particularly those relating to the freedom of speech and human rights. He was a defender of civil liberties during the tough Emergency era. He played a crucial role in some of the most iconic cases which have defined the legal landscape of this great nation,” the CJI said, heaping praise on the departed legal giant.The CJI, several judges and senior lawyers spoke at a memorial organised in remembrance of Sorabjee who passed away on April 30 due to COVID-19 at the age of 91.Recalling how Sorabjee assisted veteran senior lawyer Nani Palkhivala in the Golaknath and Kesavananda Bharati cases, CJI Ramana said, “The true tribute to Sorabjee would be to continue to uphold fundamental rights and freedoms that are essential for human existence in a civilised society.”“Apart from his courtroom genius, Soli was an epitome of grace, modesty, humility, integrity and kindness, which always stood out to me…Though he has passed into the realm of the immortal, his memory will endure.“We have lost a great soul but we shall continue to remember the great human qualities he possessed which can help us through these difficult times. His spirit and confidence in the constitutional ethos of this country, and his never-ending quest for justice should be our guide,” the CJI said.Sorabjee obtained his LLB degree from Government Law College, Mumbai, and got enrolled at the bar Mumbai in 1953. He was designated a senior advocate in 1971. He served as the Attorney General for India twice - from 1989-90 during VP Singh’s Government and from 1998 to 2004 during the AB Vajpayee government.Justice DY Chandrachud described Sorabjee as his mentor on whose advice he accepted judgeship in 1998. “I accepted that advice...and I have never regretted it even for a day,” he said.Apart from the CJI and Justice Chandrachud, Justice UU Lalit and senior advocates Arvind Datar, Harish Salve and Gopal Subramanium recalled their association with the veteran jurist.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/soli-sorabjee-was-a-man-with-unflinching-faith-in-constitutional-ideals-cji-260772

It is more virulent now, spreading fast and taking longer for the patient to recover," he said."We also have another devil to deal with: black fungus. We have 3,000 cases of mucormycosis in the state. The coronavirus task force is keeping track," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cases-in-maharashtra-down-but-numbers-at-last-years-peak-thackeray-260769

30-05-2021||Chennai||Sasikala hints at efforts to regain control of AIADMK, a political comeback||VK Sasikala, eased out from the AIADMK years ago, has hinted at the resumption of efforts to regain control of the party, a political comeback, by telling her supporters that there would soon be a "good decision." After announcing ahead of the April 6 Assembly polls, that she would stay away from politics, Sasikala said she could not see the party getting ruined due to "infighting." Her reference to the feud, though has no direct mention of the AIADMK or its leadership, it is seen as a pointer to alleged differences between top two leaders, K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam.Confidante of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, Sasikala's brief conversation with two of her loyalists over the phone has surfaced and this has dropped hints about her rethink.In the first audio clip she could be heard saying, "we will for sure streamline the party...certainly, I will come", In the second, she could be heard telling the supporter that the party, apparently a reference to AIADMK, was built through hard work of leaders including her and it was anguishing to see "them fighting," and she could not be a mute spectator to the party getting ruined due to it.Hence, Sasikala said she would come soon and meet supporters after the second wave of coronavirus faded. The party could be brought back to good shape and there was no need to worry.There would soon be a good decision and she shall come soon, she said.This is seen as a hint at the resumption of efforts to regain control of AIADMK, which she and her nephew Dhinakaran lost years ago after she was imprisoned in 2017 February following conviction in a disproportionate assets case.Known as EPS and OPS, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam do not reportedly see eye to eye and they have been issuing statements individually on political matters but give joint- statements on party matters.AIADMK spokesperson and state joint secretary of the legal wing, R M Babu Murugavel said, "we have got nothing to with her comments."The reference Sasikala was making, including infighting, would have relevance only for the AMMK and and the matter is related to that party alone and the AIADMK has got nothing to do with her comments, he told PTI.In March this year, Sasikala had said that "she will stay away from politics," but would pray for Jayalalithaa's "golden rule".Sasikala became AIADMK interim general secretary following Jayalalaithaa's demise in 2016 and this appointment was rescinded at a general council meet in 2017 and it also announced the invalidation of all the appointments made by Dhinakaran.This meet also created new posts of coordinator and co-coordinator for OPS and EPS respectively, giving them all powers and their factions came together, while Sasikala and her followers were dislodged.Since then, the AIADMK had made it clear that there was no scope for rapprochement with Sasikala or her relatives.Eventually, Dhinakaran floated the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) in 2018 and had said often that retrieval of the AIADMK was his outfit's goal.A case by Sasikala challenging the 2017 AIADMK general council resolutions, including removing her from the post of interim general secretary, is pending in a city civil court and the matter is posted for the next hearing on June 18, her counsel told PTI.Dhinakaran, who was also previously a petitioner, subsequently withdrew as he was leading AMMK.After completing her four-year prison term in Bengaluru, Sasikala, who had real clout in the AIADMK during the days of Jayalalithaa, returned to Tamil Nadu on February 8, 2021.On her return, she had indicated that she would be involved in active politics but later announced her decision to stay away. The two audio clips featured in a bulletin in Jaya Plus Tamil television channel, seen as pro-Sasikala besides other channels. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sasikala-hints-at-efforts-to-regain-control-of-aiadmk-a-political-comeback-260764

They are still at the office,” the official told PTI.Pithani was Rajput’s friend and was also staying with the late actor at his Bandra residence in suburban Mumbai.According to his statement to Mumbai Police, Pithani was among the first to see the actor’s hanging body when Rajput (34) allegedly committed suicide on June 14, 2020.The NCB began a separate probe when some WhatsApp chats of the late actor indicated drug use.Rajput’s former girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, and the actor’s staff members Samuel Miranda and Deepesh Sawant were arrested in the drug case last year and later got bail.

30-05-2021|| Hyderabad||Telangana extends lockdown by ten days||Telangana extended the lockdown in the state on Sunday but also eased restrictions by four hours at the same time. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting that Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) held on Sunday after taking various inputs from across the state.  The lockdown is opposed by All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), a friendly party of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) saying the people were finding it hard to sustain in the absence of livelihood. AIMIM President and Hyderabad MP Asadudin Owaisi appealed to the government to keep people’s plight in mind while deciding on the extension of the lockdown.    Consequently, the ground situation, where the number of cases of Covid-19 has come down but still much beyond the desirable, the cabinet decided to extend the lockdown by another ten days but relax the curfew by four hours. From the current curfew of 10 am to 6 am the next day, the government would allow people to indulge in necessary activities from 6 am to 1 pm. Another one hour has been accorded to people to reach home. The extension comes with a strict warning saying anyone found loitering would be booked and tried under the Disaster Management Act and other laws. The Hyderabad Police is registering close to 9,000 cases each day against people who are out of their homes without any valid reason, police commissioner Anjani Kumar has said. The government said lockdown will be implemented strictly from 2 pm to next day 6 am and there will be no laxity for anyone violating it. Chief Minister’s son and IT Minister announced the government decision and tweeted saying a decision has been taken as per the report submitted by the state health department. All the commercial establishments shall close at 1 pm. The grace time of one hour is being allowed enabling the people to reach their destinations.  Earlier Owaisi has said that data showed Covid cases were declining in the state much before the lockdown was imposed adding, “I must reiterate my opposition. It’s not a strategy to combat Covid-19. It appears a ‘hard on pandemic’ strategy but all it does is destroy the lives of poor”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-extends-lockdown-by-ten-days-260758
30-05-2021||Islamabad||Pak would hold talks with India if New Delhi restores Kashmir’s pre-Aug 2019 status: Imran||Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Sunday that Pakistan would hold talks with India if New Delhi restores the pre-August 5, 2019 status of Jammu and Kashmir.India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated it into two Union territories.“If Pakistan revives its relations with India (without the latter restoring the status of Kashmir), it will be similar to turning our back on the Kashmiris,” Khan said during a live questions and answers session with the people.Khan said that if India takes back the steps it took on August 5, “then we can definitely hold talks”.New Delhi has repeatedly said Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and the country is capable of solving its own problems.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with it in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.Ties between India and Pakistan nosedived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories.However, lately there has been some improvement when the two countries agreed in February to restore peace on the Line of Control. It is said that the rival officials have been interacting through the back channel diplomacy to ease tension.Khan also responded to several questions about domestic issues including inflation and promised that his government was working hard to bring down prices of commodities. He also said that Pakistan will continue to achieve economic growth in the days to come as he termed the process gradual and one that would take time.

30-05-2021||Lucknow||It’s safer in jail: 21 prisoners in UP don’t want parole amid Covid pandemic||Most people would do anything to get out of jail. But that’s not the case with 21 inmates in nine prisons of Uttar Pradesh who have written to authorities saying they don’t want parole as staying incarcerated is “safer and healthier” for them during the Covid-19 pandemic.Parole is a temporary suspension of prison sentence.The inmates who have made such a request are lodged in nine jails of the state, including in Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Meerut, Maharajganj, Gorakhpur and Lucknow, Director General of Jail Administration Anand Kumar told PTI on Sunday.The reason is that if they get a 90-day parole, then this will get added to the punishment term, he said.“The other overriding reason which they give is that if they go out, they will not get food and other healthcare facilities, which they get in the jails.”“The inmates say health checkup is done regularly in the jails. They get food on time, they are safe and healthy in jails. The inmates say that once they go out of the jail, they will have to struggle to earn a living,” Kumar said.There are four such requests from Lucknow jail, three from Ghaziabad and two from Maharajganj jail.Asked what is the jail administration’s response to the request of the inmates, Kumar said, “Since they have given it in writing, obviously we have to accept their stand and honour it”.   Kumar also said over 2,200 inmates have been released on interim parole, and more than 9,200 prisoners have been given interim bail.In all, around 11,500 inmates have been released following recommendations of a high-powered committee on the orders of the Supreme Court, he said.Taking note of an “unprecedented surge” in Covid-19 cases in the country, the Supreme Court on May 8 passed directions for decongestion of prisons and ordered forthwith release of all those prisoners who were granted bail or parole last year in view of the pandemic.In March last year, the Uttar Pradesh government had decided to free 11,000 prisoners from 71 jails pursuant to a Supreme Court directive to decongest jails across the country in the wake of the Covid-19 contagion.On March 16, 2020, the top court had taken suo motu cognisance of overcrowding of prisons across the country and had said it is difficult for jail inmates to maintain social distance to prevent the spread of coronavirus.The Supreme Court had directed all states and union territories to constitute high-level committees to consider giving parole or interim bail to prisoners and undertrials for offences entailing up to seven-year jail term. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-safer-in-jail-21-prisoners-in-up-dont-want-parole-amid-covid-pandemic-260746

30-05-2021||New Delhi||Govt may lift restrictions on oxygen use for some priority industries in 2-3 days||The government is likely to lift restrictions on the use of liquid oxygen for some priority industries in the next 2-3 days as demand for medical oxygen has come down, a top government official said on Sunday.To make oxygen available to more people during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19, the Centre on April 25 had barred the use of liquid oxygen for any non-medical purpose and asked manufacturing units to maximise its production and make it available to the government for medical use.“Demand for medical oxygen has come down. Some priority industries will get oxygen in the next 2-3 days,” the official told PTI.Exercising the powers conferred under the Disaster Management Act, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla had directed the states to ensure that “use of liquid oxygen is not allowed for any non-medical purpose and all manufacturing units may maximise their production of liquid oxygen, and make it available...for medical purposes only”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday also said that providing medical-grade oxygen to different states during the second wave of COVID-19 was a challenge.In normal times, daily production of liquid medical oxygen was 900 million tonnes (MT), which has now risen over 10 times to nearly 9,500 MT, the prime minister said.Liquid oxygen is used in steel making, chemical, pharmaceuticals, petroleum processing and paper manufacturing industries.As per the Union health ministry’s update on Sunday, India recorded a single-day rise of 1,65,553 in new Covid-19 cases, the lowest in 46 days, taking the country’s infection tally to 2,78,94,800.The daily positivity rate declined to 8.02 per cent, remaining below the 10 per cent-mark for five consecutive days, while the weekly positivity rate dropped to 9.36 per cent, it said.

30-05-2021||Mumbai||As Modi government completes 7 yrs, Sena calls for introspection||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said India is surviving as a nation due to the good deeds of previous governments since the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, and the present Modi government needs to introspect on whether it has been able to fulfil the basic needs of people.Besides, the Maharashtra Congress observed the seventh anniversary of the Narendra Modi government as a ‘black day’, and accused the Centre of pushing the country into a “gorge” of COVID-19 crisis.The Congress, which shares power with the Shiv Sena and NCP in Maharashtra as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), held protests in different parts of the state and claimed PM Modi had no moral right to continue in power as the central government “failed on all fronts”.Talking to reporters here, Raut said, “The country is surviving on the good deeds of previous governments since the time of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to Manmohan Singh,” the Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson said.A lot more needs to be done, he said, adding that there are problems of inflation,unemployment and unrest due to the COVID-19 pandemic.“When you get majority, it means people have handed you the power with faith and trust. The people’s needs and demands are veryfew. They need livelihood - roti, kapda makan (food, clothing and shelter) are important along with health and education facilities,” the Rajya Sabha member said.He said the central government should “introspect” if this has been achieved in the last seven years.“More focus and hard work is required. PM Modi has theleadership capability and hope he will give a proper direction to the country,” he said.To a question, Raut said it is good that there has been “nocorruption charge” on the Modi government.“Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has raised some issues which have still not been answered,” said Raut, whose party shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra.He said the Centre is the “guardian” of all states.“Take care of all states like your own children, equal justice to all states is expected,” he said.Raut also said that opposition leaders were called only in West Bengal and Gujarat for meetings convened by the prime minister on cyclone relief, and (WB Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee has raised these issues.Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said his party was observing the Modi government’s anniversary as a “black day”.He alleged that the Modi government was busy welcoming the then US president Donald Trump (in Gujarat last year) during the first COVID-19 wave, and then gave the pandemic a “communal colour” by putting the blame for the virus spread on a congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat.When the COVID-19 cases and death toll were rising during the second wave, the Modi government was busy campaigning for Assembly polls (in West Bengal and other states), he said.“The Modi government has pushed the country into a COVID-19 crisis gorge and has no right to continue in power.Prime Minister Narendra Modi should resign,” Patole asserted.He said inflation, fuel price rise, unemployment, “crumbling economy” and the COVID-19 pandemic had made the lives of citizens miserable.He also hit out at the Centre over alleged mismanagement of the COVID-19 vaccination drive.“The Modi government had planned its vaccination policy effectively,there would have been no shortage (of vaccines). Without considering the needs of 130 crore people, the vaccines were exported,” he said.Referring to farmers’ protest underway since November last year against the Centre’s three agri-marketing laws, Patole said the Modi government had no time to address the issues of cultivators.“The Modi government has decided to sell the Railways, airports, state-owned telecom firms, LIC, petroleum companies, banks to select industrialist friends,” Patole claimed.Meanwhile, Former Maharashtra CM and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan led a protest against the Centre in Pune, while state PWD minister Ashok Chavan led a protest in Aurangabad.State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat held a protest in Nashik, Energy Minister Nitin Raut in Nagpur, Relief and Rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar in Amravati and Medical Education minister Amit Deshmukh in Latur.Those taking part in the protests wore black bands to mark their displeasure against the Centre and its policies.Talking to reporters in Nagpur, minister Nitin Raut claimed the seven years of the Modi at the Centre had been “fatal” for the country with people reeling under the burden of broken promises and skyrocketing inflation.The price of petrol has crossed Rs 100 per litre, while diesel is retailing at Rs 90 per litre, affecting common citizens, he said.Farmers were promised that their incomes would double by 2022, he said, adding that prices of fertilisers and seeds have gone up.He alleged that new agri-marketing laws and labour reforms brought in by the Centre were anti-people.“The Centre has failed on all fronts, be it business, agriculture, education, GDP, inflation, international relations. It has also left people to fend for themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the MLA from Nagpur-North claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-modi-government-completes-7-yrs-sena-calls-for-introspection-260730
30-05-2021||New Delhi||Modernisation of Indian Army well on course: Army Chief Gen MM Naravane||The modernisation of the Indian Army is well on course, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane has said, dismissing apprehensions that the need for devoting more resources to guard the Line of Actual Control in the face of the prolonged standoff with China in eastern Ladakh may starve the force of funds for buying new weapons and platforms.Emphasising his point, Gen Naravane said that 59 contracts worth Rs 21,000 crore have been concluded since last fiscal while a number of other capital acquisition proposals are in the pipeline.In an exclusive interview to PTI, he said the modernisation drive in the Army has been going on without facing any difficulty and that required resources are being provided by the government."The modernisation drive of Indian Army is well on course. Recently 15 contracts worth more than Rs 16,000 crore have been concluded under normal schemes of procurement and 44 contracts worth Rs 5,000 crore have been concluded in 2020-21 under emergency procurements," Gen Naravane said."A number of capital acquisition proposals too are underway concurrently," the Chief of Army Staff said.He was replying to a question on whether the much-needed modernisation of the Army has been impacted due to the need for allocation of greater resources to keep a large number of troops for guarding the LAC in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere in the wake of the standoff since last one year."We are not facing any difficulty," he said, referring to the modernisation drive.In February, the government allocated Rs Rs 4.78 lakh crore for the defence budget for 2021-22. Out of the total allocation, Rs 1,35,060 crore was set aside for capital expenditure that includes purchasing new weapons, aircraft, warships and other military hardware.The capital outlay for 2021-22 is an increase of 18.75 percent compared to last year's allocation of Rs 1,13,734 crore.In the last few years, military experts have been pitching for rapid modernisation of the Indian armed forces to effectively deal with China's increasing assertiveness.It has been more than a year since the military standoff between the two sides erupted in eastern Ladakh on May 5 during which there were fatalities on both sides for the first time in 45 years.They have made limited progress in achieving disengagement at the Pangong lake area while negotiations for similar steps at other points remained deadlocked.Gen Naravane said that the Indian Army is currently holding onto all important areas in the high-altitude region and it has adequate personnel in the form of "reserves" to react to any contingencies.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.The ties between the two countries came under severe strain after the deadly clashes at the Galwan valley following which both sides rushed in thousands of additional troops as well as battle tanks and other large weapons to the region.Nine months after the military standoff at multiple friction points, both sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of the Pangong lake in February as part of an agreement reached following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides have held 11 rounds of military talks to ensure disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points. Both the militaries are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modernisation-of-indian-army-well-on-course-army-chief-gen-mm-naravane-260729

The DM should be immediately transferred, as he is hiding data," Mathur told PTI, and accused the state government of "patronising" liquor mafia."The toll is likely to touch 40... The deaths are due to the negligence of the district administration and the excise department. Things have gone out of hand for the BJP government and the public is affected by its non-performance," Mathur said.The other Congress leaders in the delegation were Vivek Bansal, Deepak Kumar, Yogesh Dixit, Badruddin Quereshi and Mukesh Dhangar.On Sunday afternoon, a row broke out at a post-mortem house when some staff members allegedly tried to prevent mediapersons from taking pictures of bodies lined up there.

We had sent our corona testing team to Aultari, Jamtari and Kuta Chaurani villages to test them. A total of 191 members of the community from Aultari and Jamtari came forward to undergo the test but residents of Kuta Chaurani fled to the forests to avoid tests," Goswami said."The villagers were afraid that the swab strip taken for the test would infect them," the SDM said.Jagat Singhingh Rajwar, an elderly member of the community from Kuta Chaurani village, said the swab tester could cause further infection to them."We are ready to go for a health check, take medicines but do not agree to let the strip enter our body, " Rajwar said.According to the SDM, his team has persuaded some literate members of the community to create awareness among the locals about the necessity of the tests."We will make another attempt to test them in two-three days," Goswami said.Sanju Pant, the coordinator of Didihat youth society, said corona kits have been distributed among some members of the community after taking them into confidence.The administration has also been informed about the poor conditions in which the members of the endangered tribal community are forced to live with no work for them due to the coronavirus lockdown, Pant said."We have requested the administration to distribute consumer goods other than food material to the community members," he said.The SDM said packets of spices, edible oil and other essential items besides food packets have been distributed among them for free. According to Didihat youth society sources, the community is facing a dire shortage of essential goods as there is no earning for them due to the lockdown."If their plight is not addressed, they might face hunger and death," Pant said.SDM Didihat said he has written to the block development officer of Didihat and the district development officer of Pithoragarh to give members of the community work under the MGNREGA."We will not let the community face hunger. We maintain a vigil on them through our revenue officials lest they should face any shortage of food," he said.

30-05-2021||New Delhi||Monsoon onset over Kerala to be delayed; likely to hit state by June 3: IMD||The arrival of Southwest Monsoon over Kerala is likely to be delayed by two days and it is now expected to make an onset over the state by June 3, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.However, Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said monsoon has already made an onset over Kerala.G P Sharma, President (Meteorology) of Skymet Weather said it is a “very weak onset” this year.Skymet Weather had earlier predicted that monsoon will make an onset over Kerala on May 30.IMD Director General M Mohapatra said there is cyclonic circulation along the Karnataka coast which is hindering the progress of the Southwest Monsoon.“The southwesterly winds could strengthen further gradually from June 1, resulting in likely enhancement in rainfall activity over Kerala. Hence the monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place around June 3,” the IMD said.Due to strengthening of lower level southwesterly winds, fairly widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy falls are very likely over northeastern states during the next five days.    The normal onset date for the monsoon over Kerala is June 1. This marks the start of the four-month rainfall season for the country.Earlier this month, the IMD had predicted the arrival of monsoon over Kerala by May 31 with an error margin of plus or minus four days.On Sunday morning, the IMD, in its daily bulletin, said the onset of the monsoon over Kerala was expected to be around May 31. However, by afternoon it said the onset is expected to be by June 3.According to the IMD, the onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala depends on three parameters.If after May 10, 60 per cent of the 14 stations—Minicoy, Amini, Thiruvananthapuram, Punalur, Kollam, Allapuzha, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Thalassery, Kannur, Kudulu and Mangalore report rainfall of 2.5 millimetres or more for two consecutive days, the onset over Kerala be declared on the second day, provided other two criteria are also in concurrence.This has to be supplemented by the wind speed. The depth of westerlies should be maintained up to 600 hectopascal (hPa), in the box equator to Latitude 10-degrees north and Longitude 55 degrees to 80-degrees east. The zonal wind speed over the area bounded by Latitude 5 to 10-degrees north, Longitude 70-80-degrees east should be of the order of 15 – 20 knots at 925 hPa.The Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) should be below 200 watt per square meter (wm-2) in the box confined by Latitude 5-10 degrees north and Longitude 70-75 degrees east.Sharma said all the IMD parameters are fulfilled to declare the onset of Southwest Monsoon over Kerala.“In the absence of any major monsoon trigger, the onset may be slightly mild. Conditions are favourable for its further advancement to more parts of the south peninsula and east-central Bay of Bengal. Timely progress is expected over northeast India,” Sharma said.Mohapatra said the depth of westerlies is not as much as it is expected. Plus, the rainfall parameters remain unfulfilled to declare onset of monsoon over Kerala.Monsoon is expected to be normal this year.

30-05-2021||Kolkata||Assam activist arrested for 'offensive posts' against CM Himanta Biswa Sarma||A member of the Assam-based Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), led by jailed rights activist Akhil Gogoi, has been arrested for "offensive posts" against Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.Nipom Chutia is the third person to be arrested in the state for "maligning the image" of Chief Minister Sarma.He was arrested from Gogamukh in Dhemaji district late Saturday for his Facebook posts that raked up controversies about Sarma's past.The posts rakes up police cases against Sarma for extortion on behalf of the separatist ULFA and the murder of Congress trade unionist Manabendra Sarma, in which the now Chief Minister was prime accused.Sarma says he was cleared by the court on both cases and the FaceBook posts were a "deliberate attempt" to malign him.The KMSS is led by Gogoi who won this year's Assembly elections despite contesting from jail, where he is lodged on charges of triggering "violent agitations" against the BJP-piloted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).The KMSS has also spearheaded an agitation against big dams in the Arunachal Pradesh-Assam region on grounds this is a seismic hotbed and a strong earthquake like the 1897 or 1950 in Assam can cause what Gogoi describes as a "land tsunami".Dhemaji, Assam's northernmost district bordering Arunachal Pradesh, has been the hotbed of the anti-dam agitation, which the state's BJP government has sought to crush on grounds it was "anti-development".Sarma, initially with All Assam Students Union (AASU), joined the Congress during the tenure of late Chief Minister Hiteswar Saikia and rose to become number two in late Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi's cabinet.Then before the 2016 state Assembly polls, he switched to the saffron camp.The Congress alleged that the CBI investigating the Sarada chit fund scam, in which Sarma's name figured like the Louis Berger scandal, allegedly went easy on him.Two journalists were arrested and three others detained in February for an alleged attempt to "malign with salacious intent" Harma after they shared a photo of him along with his daughter.The Chief Minister's wife had filed a complaint with the Dispur police stationunder the POCSO Act, following which the Guwahati City Police began probing the case.Taufiquddin Ahmad, the Editor-in-Chief of local news website 'Pratibimba Live', and its News Editor Iqbal were arrested for investigation into the "conspiracy", while three others were detained, Guwahati City Police Commissioner Munna Prasad Gupta has said.The three employees who were detained were being interrogated to ascertain their involvement in the case, he said.The Minister told reporters here that this was a clear case of political conspiracy but to "stoop so low and not spare even my minor daughter, reflects a very low mentality"."I have been attacked on all fronts by my opponents but when they failed to create any impact, they have adopted a different strategy to malign my character and I have been noticing this recently," Sarma said.He said that the photograph posted with a malafide intent was disturbing and "we could not sleep the whole night".Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order), G.P. Singh said that the police will take strong action against all such attempts under stringent provisions of the POCSO Act, he said.They were arrested on the basis of a case registered with the Dispur police station under IPC Section 509 (intending to insult the modesty of any woman), and Sections 14 and 21 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, he said."Action shall be taken against all persons irrespective of their place of residence who use any of the social media platforms to maliciously use such platforms for furthering this conspiracy," Singh added.The website had shared a photo of the minister hugging his daughter, following which it went viral on social media. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-activist-arrested-for-offensive-posts-against-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma-260706

30-05-2021||New Delhi||Google, Facebook updating website to reflect new grievance officer appointed under IT rules||Large digital companies like Google and Facebook have begun updating their websites to reflect the appointment of the grievance officers under the new social media rules that came into effect recently.According to government sources, large social media companies like Google, Facebook and WhatsApp have shared details with the IT Ministry as per the requirement of the new digital rules, but Twitter is still not following the norms.The new rules require significant social media intermediaries -- those with other 50 lakh users -- to appoint a grievance officer, nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel are required to be resident in India.Industry sources said Facebook and WhatsApp have already shared their compliance report with the Ministry of Electronics and IT, and that the details of the new grievance officers appointed are being updated to replace the existing information on these platforms. Google’s ‘Contact Us’ page shows details of Joe Grier as a contact person with an address from Mountain View, US. The page also contains details on the grievance redressal mechanism for YouTube.As per the rules, all intermediaries have to prominently publish on their website, app or both, the name of the grievance officer and his/her contact details as well as the mechanism by which a user or a victim may make a complaint.The grievance officer will have to acknowledge the complaint within 24 hours and dispose of such complaint within a period of 15 days from the date of its receipt; and receive and acknowledge any order, notice or direction issued by the authorities.The government sources on Friday had said that Twitter is not following the norms.Twitter has not sent details of the chief compliance officer to the IT Ministry, and shared details of a lawyer working in a law firm as a nodal contact person and grievance officer, they added.This when the IT rules clearly require these designated officers of the significant social media platforms to be employees of the company and resident in India, they pointed out.While Twitter did not respond to email queries on the issue, its website mentions Dharmendra Chatur as the ‘Resident Grievance Officer for India (Interim)’.Google, Facebook and WhatsApp also did not respond to detailed email queries on the appointment of the personnel as required by the new IT rules.The sources had earlier said that besides Google, Facebook and WhatsApp, other significant social media intermediaries like Koo, Sharechat, Telegram and LinkedIn too have shared details with the ministry as per the requirement of the IT norms.Under the new rules, social media companies will have to take down flagged content within 36 hours, and remove within 24 hours content that is flagged for nudity, pornography etc.The Centre has said the new rules are designed to prevent abuse and misuse of platforms, and offer users a robust forum for grievance redressal.Non-compliance with the rules would result in these platforms losing the intermediary status that provides them immunity from liabilities over any third-party data hosted by them. In other words, they could be liable for criminal action in case of complaints. After the new norms came into effect on May 26, the IT Ministry had turned up the heat on significant social media companies, asking them to immediately report compliance and provide details of the three key officials appointed.The new IT rules also require significant social media intermediaries -- providing services primarily in the nature of messaging -- to enable identification of the “first originator” of the information that undermines the sovereignty of India, the security of the state, or public order.The large platforms have to also publish periodic compliance reports every month mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken thereon, and the number of specific communication links or parts of information that the intermediary has removed or disabled access to in pursuance of any proactive monitoring conducted by using automated tools or other reasons.

Often, trial courts recorded the statement of an accused in a “very casual and cursory manner, without specifically questioning the accused as to his defence” and sometimes family members of the husband were roped in, even though they had no active role, it noted. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/establish-live-link-between-dowry-death-cruelty-supreme-court-260504

30-05-2021||New Delhi||Image dented, tough road ahead for govt||PM Narendra Modi will complete two years of his second term in office tomorrow.What made the first year of Modi 2.0 tough was the party’s poor show in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Delhi, and Haryana, and then there were protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.Things went from bad to worse last year with the farmers protesting against the three farm laws and questions being raised over the handling/management of the second wave of Covid by the Modi government.As the PM completes one more year in power amid what has been described as “once in a century pandemic”, the going for him and his party is expected to get tough. In the past year, the BJP lost one state it had been politically investing in for five years, West Bengal, and is now facing an uphill task in one of the most crucial states in the country — Uttar Pradesh.Restoring the confidence of people will be one of the biggest challenges before the PM. The future of BJP governments in poll-bound states like UP, Gujarat and Uttarakhand depends on how well he addresses the issues concerning the people, and compensates those who suffered due to the deadly second wave. Observers say the pandemic has exposed huge gaps, denting the reputation of the PM and party. The BJP is not celebrating his seventh year in power with its usual blitzkrieg.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/image-dented-tough-road-ahead-for-govt-260506

Seven persons have died since Friday night, he said, adding that the condition of 28 undergoing treatment at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, AMU, and Malkhan Singh District Hospital was critical.Local BJP MP Satish Gautam, however, told the media that the death toll had “crossed 30”, citing information he has received from the ground.District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh, while confirming the death toll of 22, said, “Exact figures would be available after the post-mortem examination of the bodies lined up at the mortuary.”Locals fear the death toll may rise further as reports from several villages are still trickling in. A cursory count of the bodies lined up at the district hospital mortuary suggests the death toll could be considerably higher than the official figure.On Friday, Additional District Magistrate (Finance) Vidhan Jaiswal had said 15 persons had died in villages falling under three police stations — Lodha, Khair and Jawan — after consuming spurious liquor. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kalanidhi Naithani said five persons havd been arrested so far, including Anil Chaudhary, the alleged kingpin of the spurious liquor racket.The police have booked 12 persons in three cases till now. A reward of Rs 50,000 each has been announced on the arrest of Rishi Sharma and Vipin Yadav, associates of Anil Chaudhary, the SSP said.The district magistrate has recommended Rs 5 lakh ex gratia to the kin of the deceased. To a question as to whether those who had been reportedly cremated in their villages without any post-mortem examination would also be given the relief, BJP MP Gautam said teams of local officials had been deputed to contact the village pradhans for confirming such deaths. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toll-in-aligarh-hooch-tragedy-rises-to-22-260507

The concentrators were imported from China and were being sold at an exorbitant price of Rs 50,000 to Rs 70,000 each as against its cost of Rs 16,000 to Rs 22,000, the police alleged.However, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Arun Kumar Garg ordered Kalra’s release on bail subject to the accused furnishing a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and two sureties in the like amount. The case was primarily based upon documentary evidence that had already been seized, he noted.The CMM directed Kalra not to contact the customers to whom he had sold the concentrators, not to tamper with evidence or influence the witnesses and join the investigation as and when called by the police.“In my considered opinion, no purpose will be served by keeping the accused behind bars… the purpose of bail is neither preventive nor punitive but to secure the appearance of the accused person at his trial by reasonable amount of bail and the right to bail is not to be denied to the accused merely because sentiments of the community are against the accused,” the court noted.Kalra was picked up from Gurugram on May 16 and formally arrested the next day before being on the run ever since the police raided his restaurants and seized the medical devices.Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava alleged that Kalra committed a white-collar crime and made illegal profit by selling medical devices at exorbitant price to those on deathbed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kalra-granted-bail-in-oxygen-concentrator-case-260518

The CM said she was ready to touch Modi’s feet, if told to do so, for the sake of West Bengal’s development.West Bengal CMLet him work for the covid-hitI appeal to you to end this political vendetta, withdraw the letter (calling back CS) and allow him to work for Covid and cyclone-affected people.“Because you (Modi and Shah) cannot digest BJP’s defeat in Bengal, you have started creating problems for us. Recalling the Chief Secretary amid the Covid crisis shows the Centre is indulging in political vendetta,” the feisty TMC supremo said.On her skipping the cyclone review meeting, Mamata explained: “It was originally decided that only the PM and CM would meet. Later, a revised list was given which looked like a big BJP team,” Mamata said, accusing the PM of creating “confusion and confrontation” each time he visited Bengal. The CM said that accompanied by the Chief Secretary, she met the PM and handed over the papers on cyclone losses. “I sought PM’s permission to leave as the weather was bad and I had to visit Digha. There was no need for me to be there. Anyway, the chairs were too far from where the PM was seated,” she held. Mamata, reportedly upset over the PM’s decision to invite Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari to the meeting, questioned him on not giving due recognition to the Opposition in Parliament. She also asked why Modi had not called the Opposition leader during his recent Gujarat visit. “The Opposition leader was not present at the Bhubaneswar meeting too,” she pointed out. Bandyopadhyay, who was to retire on May 31, was given a three-month extension on state government’s request. Mamata said the state government was not consulted prior to calling the CS back to New Delhi and that her government might explore legal options regarding the matter.She said her government might explore legal options with regard to Bandyopadhyay’s transfer. Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh alleged the CM skipped meeting to avoid giving detail of her Rs 20,000 cr demand for cyclone relief.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didi-asks-modi-not-to-recall-chief-secretary-260491

Both sides, however, are engaged indirectly due to their common memberships of the BRICS and SCO whose summits will be hosted by India this year.Jaishankar observed that Indo-US ties have grown stronger over the years and especially mentioned the “strong support and solidarity at a moment of great difficulty for us”.Blinken responded by pointing out that Washington had noted that in the earlier days of Covid, India was there for the US, “something we’ll never forget, and now we want to make sure that we’re there for and with India”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-high-on-agenda-in-jaishankars-us-visit-260478

30-05-2021||New Delhi||MHA seeks applications for citizenship from non-Muslim refugees from Afghan, Pakistan, Bangladesh in 13 districts||The Union Home Ministry has issued a notification under the 2009 rules of the Citizenship Act, 1955 asking non-Muslims belonging to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan and residing in 13 districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Punjab to apply for Indian citizenship.The fresh order is in no way connected to the Citizenship Amendment Act passed in 2019 as the rules under it are yet to be framed by the government, officials said.Centre's latest citizenship move back door entry of CAA, exposes govt's fascist nature: LeftThe Union home ministry on Friday night issued the notification for immediate implementation of the order under the Citizenship Act 1955 and Rules framed under the law in 2009.This benefit is extended to minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who fulfil all conditions applicable to any foreign citizen seeking citizenship by naturalisation after a minimum of 11 years of residency in India.Under the CAA, the period for this category was cut to five years."In exercise of powers conferred under Section 16 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby directs that powers exercisable by it for registration as citizen of India under Section 5, or for grant of certificate of naturalisation under section 6 of the Citizenship Act 1955 in respect of any person belonging to a minority community in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, residing in the districts mentioned and the states mentioned below," the fresh notification said.People who are eligible to apply for Indian citizenship are those currently living in the districts of Morbi, Rajkot, Patan and Vadodara of Gujarat, Durg and Balodabazar in Chhattisgarh, Jalore, Udaipur, Pali, Barmer and Sirohi in Rajasthan, Faridabad in Haryana and Jalandhar in Punjab."The application for registration as citizen of India or grant of certificate of naturalisation as citizen of India under the said rules (Citizenship Rules, 2009) shall be made by the applicant online," the notification said.In 2016, the central government had in a similar step sought applications from members of these minority communities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh living in 16 districts in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.The district magistrates of the districts and home secretaries of the seven states were allowed to receive and process the applications of these refugees for two years by the home ministry.In 2018, the said notification was extended for an indefinite period or till further order.With Friday night's order, the total number of districts where such facility is available has gone up to 29 districts in nine states.The home ministry said the verification of the application is to be done simultaneously by the collector or Secretary (Home) at the district-level and the state-level and the application and the reports thereon shall be made accessible simultaneously to the Centre on an online portal.The collector or the secretary will make enquiries as considered necessary for ascertaining the suitability of the applicant and for that purpose forward the application online to such agencies for verification and comments.The instructions issued by the Centre from time to time in this regard shall be strictly complied with by state or union territory and district concerned, it said."The comments of the agencies referred to in clause (C) are uploaded online by such agencies and accessible to the collector or the secretary, as the case may be, and the central government," it said.The collector or the secretary on being satisfied with the suitability of the applicant, will grant him the citizenship of India by registration or naturalisation and issue a certificate of registration or naturalisation, as the case may be, duly printed from an online portal and signed by the collector or the secretary in the form as prescribed in the said rules, the notification said.The collector or the secretary shall maintain an online as well as physical register, in accordance with the said rules, containing the details of the person registered or naturalised as a citizen of India and furnish a copy thereof to the central government within seven days of such registration or naturalisation, it said."This order shall come into force on the date of its publication in the official gazette and shall remain valid until further orders," the notification said.When the CAA was passed in 2019, there were widespread protests in different parts of the country and communal riots erupted in Northeast Delhi in early 2020 after clashes between those opposing and supporting the law.According to the CAA, Indian citizenship will be given to non-Muslim persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan—Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian—who had come to India till December 31, 2014. —
