23-05-2021||Ratlam||MP: Video shows woman doctor propagating religion during govt’s Covid-19 campaign||A controversy has erupted after a woman doctor, hired on contract by the Madhya Pradesh government, was captured in a video purportedly asking people to offer prayers to the god of a particular religion for staying away from coronavirus infection or for recovery from the disease. The incident occurred in Bajna village of Ratlam district on Saturday.Talking to PTI on Sunday, tehsildar BS Thakur said the administration has received a complaint that the woman, a government contract doctor, was propagating Christianity during the ‘Kill Corona’ campaign (to curb the pandemic) in Bajna.Religious pamphlets were also found with the woman, he said.Thakur said that a report is being prepared, which will be submitted to senior officers.In the video, the woman doctor, who is wearing a mask, is seen talking to a man who was shooting the incident on his mobile camera.The man is heard saying, “Why are you telling people that they will recover by praying to Jesus?…Why are you not saying that people should pray according to their own religion?”  In response, the woman is heard saying that people are getting cured by offering prayers to Jesus.Some BJP leaders, including Bhopal Huzur seat MLA Rameshwar Sharma, shared the video on Twitter.“This is not the time to propagate any religion. Doctors and medical professionals are engaged in selfless service of humanity. In such a situation, the woman doctor is propagating a religion. This is condemnable,” Sharma told PTI.When asked about the episode, Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) Dr Prabhakar Nanaware said that a report is being sent to the district collector about this incident.In the report, the termination of services of this contract doctor is being recommended, he said.Bajna police station in-charge Dilip Rajoriya said the case will be registered after investigation.So far, no case has been registered, he said.

23-05-2021||Jodhpur||Every Indian will be vaccinated against Covid by December: Union minister Shekhawat||Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Sunday asserted that India has been working fast to increase the production of Covid-19 vaccines and said each citizen of the country will be inoculated by December.He also attacked the opposition, saying it has been trying to politicise matters related to the vaccination drive against the coronavirus.“We have been constantly working on increasing the production and availability of vaccines, and will have each Indian vaccinated by December, which will be a huge record,” Shekhawat said.He added that this will all happen on account of the country’s own endeavours.“It is for the first time in history that India developed its own vaccines for any virus parallel to the rest of the world. Earlier, it took years for vaccines of any virus to reach India,” he told a press conference here.Shekhawat said that the opposition did their best to politicise the vaccination drive through “malicious” narratives questioning quality and authenticity of vaccines developed in India.“They acted with their vested political interests and blemished the image of the country. But now the same persons have been queuing up for a vaccine shot,” the Union minister for Jal Shakti said and added that the opposition should apologise.Referring to medicines like remdesivir, used in Covid treatment, and amphotericin-B for black fungus treatment, Shekhawat said the country has already reached a surplus state with production of 1.5 crore vials of remdesivir per month and efforts are on to meet the growing requirement of amphotericine vials now.“We are sourcing (amphotericine) vials from foreign countries. Three lakh vials have already reached and three lakh more are expected to come in the next three days,” he said.Six companies have been producing amphotericine vials in the country and five more companies have been given permission, the minister said.“Considering a 30 days gestation period of the (amphotericine) vial before it is finally ready for administration, we will have adequate vials after 30 days,” he said.Shekhawat also stressed on the need for strengthening medical and health infrastructure in rural areas.“We need to strengthen our Community Health Centres (CHC) in villages. We will have to work to improve infrastructure at CHCs and ensure the presence of doctors there”, he said.He said that 30 such centres will be upgraded in the next three months at a cost of Rs 15 crore.

This convoy of farmers from Karnal and nearby areas reached the Singhu border under the leadership of farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chadhuni,” the SKM said.“Farmers, who had gone to villages for the harvesting season, are now returning to the protest sites. The farmers are enthusiastic and will end the movement only when their demands are met,” it said.The farmers also organised a “tiranga march” at the Ghazipur border, it said.The protesting farmers will celebrate the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Kartar Singh Sarabha on Monday, the SKM said.“Kartar Singh Sarabha sacrificed himself for the country and society at an early age. This movement considers him an idol for struggle,” it said.The SKM said its members will gherao the Hisar commissioner’s office on Monday “to demand registration of a police case against Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and police personnel who violently attacked the farmers”.On May 16, the Hisar police lobbed tear gas shells and used force to disperse a group of farmers who tried to march towards the venue for the inaugural event of a Covid hospital where Khattar was present.Farmers claimed that over 50 of them sustained injuries in what they alleged was a police lathicharge. An official spokesperson said over 20 police personnel, including a DSP, were also injured.

The entire country and the world are sad seeing such photos, but one has to understand the pain of those who left their kin along the river Ganga out of compulsion. They are not at fault,” the former Congress chief said in a tweet in Hindi.“It is not a collective responsibility, but is only of the Central government,” he said.मुझे शवों के फ़ोटो साझा करना अच्छा नहीं लगता। देश-दुनिया फ़ोटो देखकर दुखी है लेकिन जिन्होंने मजबूरी में मृत प्रियजनों को गंगा किनारे छोड़ दिया, उनका दर्द भी समझना होगा- ग़लती उनकी नहीं है।इसकी ज़िम्मेदारी सामूहिक नहीं, सिर्फ़ केंद्र सरकार की है!

But on account of the political objection, the police are unable to do much.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-hits-at-telangana-government-for-sealing-border-257314

23-05-2021||Bhopal||MP CM slams Kamal Nath over ‘coronavirus’ remarks||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday wondered whether state Congress president Kamal Nath’s alleged remarks on the spread of coronavirus in India amounted to sedition.“Will this (statement) not hurt the country’s respect and does this not amount to sedition? Chouhan asked in a series of tweets and also spoke to reporters.Nath, the Opposition leader, on Friday said in a press conference, “Indians in the world have become synonymous with corona and our ‘Mera Bharat’ has turned into Covid (epicentre)”.Questioning the number of Covid-19 fatalities “projected by India”, Nath had claimed that in reality, 1,02,002 Covid-19 patients had died in Madhya Pradesh in the March-April period.“We are working day in and day out to combat Covid-19 and I hoped that all political parties would be onboard given this national crisis. But I am deeply saddened that former MP chief minister Kamal Nathji was destroying the morale of the country and the state (with his remarks),” Chouhan said.“Does using words like, ‘Mera Bharat Covid’, ‘Indian Corona’ suit Congress? Won’t the morale of Indians living in other countries dip with such statements? Won’t it hurt the country’s respect?

23-05-2021||Indore||Covid: Team of engineers in Madhya Pradesh provides free technical service related to ventilators||A team of three engineers from Indore in Madhya Pradesh has been rendering their ventilator-related technical services free of cost in government-run hospitals in different parts of the state amid the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The team, popularly known as 'Ventilator Express' on social media, not only installs new ventilators sent under the Central government's PM Cares Fund, but also repairs old ones and makes them operational once again.In the last one-and-a-half months, the members of the team- Pankaj Kshirsagar (production engineer), Chirag Shah (mechanical engineer) and Shailendra Singh (environmental engineer) - have travelled hundreds of kilometres in the state to provide their services.Talking to PTI on Sunday, Kshirsagar said his team has already rendered technical services in Indore as well as in Dhar, Shajapur, Rajgarh, Sagar, Damoh, Katni, Mandla and Shahdol districts."During the past one-and-a-half months, we have started around 100 ventilators in different government hospitals in the state. These include the installation of new ventilators sent under the PM Cares Fund as well as the repair of old ventilators," he said.He said they were playing a small role in the ongoing war against Covid and do not charge any fee for their services and small parts related to ventilators. Kshirsagar said the 'Ventilator Express' used to initially take four hours to install a new ventilator. "But with continuous practice, the team now starts this medical equipment within an hour," he said. Divakar Patel, a doctor in Damoh's government-run hospital, about 450-kms from Indore, said the Ventilator Express team helped selflessly in setting up new ventilators at his facility.  Kshirsagar also said that his team has received calls from hospitals in Nashik in neighbouring Maharashtra and Hubli in Karnataka after information about their initiative spread on social media. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-team-of-engineers-in-madhya-pradesh%C2%A0provides-free-technical-service-related-to-ventilators-257290
23-05-2021||New Delhi||Non-Covid patients suffer prolonged agony amid lockdown in Delhi: Doctors||From delayed cancer surgeries to teeth and eye issues, patients having non-Covid ailments in Delhi are suffering in agony in absence of adequate medical attention as hospitals are overburdened during the second wave of the pandemic and the city is under a lockdown, say doctors.The restrictions imposed in the national capital on April 19 in the wake of the brutal second wave of the pandemic have hit the migrant labourers and the poor the hardest, but the interruption of non-Covid medical services has also added to the travails of many others.Doctors at leading government and private hospitals say that as the majority of the machinery is currently engaged in fighting the deadly Covid-19 on a war-footing and movement restrictions are in place, non-Covid patients who need surgeries or have ENT issues and have to be examined physically and pregnant women are especially at a loss.According to Dr Suresh Singh Naruka, senior consultant, ENT, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, “Non-Covid services have been largely impacted, but our hospital is trying to do best for such patients brought to the emergency”.At the hospital, non-Covid emergency patients are treated as suspected cases of Covid-19 and intervention is immediately made, “otherwise, we could lose lives, if we wait for Covid test results”, he said.“Once we had a case, where a person had swallowed an electric bulb, and every second was precious to save his life. So, we immediately started the procedure and saved him,” he said.However, for cancer patients, the wait adds to the agony, as delayed surgeries mean prolonged pain.“I have an old patient who is suffering from cancer, and he was to be operated in April, but then due to the Covid situation and lockdown in Delhi, his surgery got delayed by over a month.“As a result, his cancer stage progressed in this period, and the accompanying suffering. It’s a difficult time for non-Covid patients too,” Naruka said.The ENT doctor said, at the moment, he is trying to see patients over video calls or teleconsultation and call them to the hospital only if it’s unavoidable as bringing non-Covid patients to hospitals treating coronavirus patients poses a risk.“My domain is ear, nose and throat, and in many cases, we have to probe deeper inside nose and treat using specialised instruments, which can only be done through physical examination.“So, it’s a handicap for both doctors and patients. But due to Covid fear, we tell patients to not visit hospitals if it can be managed via teleconsultation, after which we prescribe medicines as needed,” Naruka said.Besides, cancer and ENT (ear, nose throat) patients, those people having old dental issues or who have recovered from Covid, but having complications in teeth and gums due to lowered immunity, and with injury or ailments in eyes or skin are also suffering a lot of pain in the lockdown, doctors say.Noted dentist Dr Anil Kohli, whose clinic in south Delhi has been serving people for over four decades, said, “We have to serve people, and so we have adjusted ourselves to the new normal”.“The first wave last year caught us unawares and there was a lot of fear among both healthcare workers as well as patients who felt anxious stepping out of their homes, despite having an unbearable toothache,” he told PTI.However, as the vaccination process got underway, all the staff got vaccinated and so they too feel safe while rendering services, Kohli said, adding, doctors wear PPE kits while examining patients.“But, most of the dental clinics in Delhi are closed during the lockdown due to the Covid situation. Also, as we examine patients’ mouths, so the risk is very high. Therefore, not many feel comfortable attending to patients. But we are serving with reduced business hours,” he added.A staff at Cloves Dental, a pan-India chain of clinics based in Delhi, said that only emergency cases are being seen at their clinics with “proper Covid safety precautions” like the use of hand sanitisers, social distancing, and avoiding aerosol-generating procedure.“We are also providing teleconsultation and only if the case needs a clinic visit, we ask patients to come as there is Covid situation and lockdown restrictions,” she said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced that the lockdown in Delhi will be extended till May end, and if cases continue to decline, the unlock process will be started in a phased manner.Delhi has been registering a fall in daily cases in the last few days, and on Saturday 1,649 Covid-19 cases, the lowest since March 30, and 189 deaths were recorded, while the positivity rate dipped to 2.42 percent, as per the latest health bulletin.

But she was firm and stuck to her decision. There were several criticisms from within the Muslim community that she was not supposed to do the work of a cremator in a Hindu crematorium but Subina was unfazed and continued with the job.Subina says, “In pre-Covid days it used to be one or two dead bodies, but now during the second wave, we are cremating seven to eight bodies each day which is beyond the capacity of this crematorium.”She adds, “It takes 2 hours to clear a body and get its ashes but now we are working 14 hours and still we are not able to complete it and have often postponed to the next day. It’s really sad and terrible situation as the number of deaths has increased in the second wave of the pandemic.”The 29-year-old Muslim woman has to fight a battle against the society which includes close friends, classmates in school and colleges, close relatives and many other known people and none was supportive of her decision but only one person supported her and that was her husband, Kuzhikandathil Veetil Rahman.She was however honest and straight when she said that she was doing this work to support her family and not as women empowerment.Her husband Rahman, a mason, was the only support of her family which includes her father, mother and an 8-year-old son.Subina said that her father who was into cutting of trees had a fall and is bed ridden and her mother is a housewife. She said that she could marry her sister off with the money that she saved while working in the crematorium.With barriers and walls are created between people in the name of religion, the example of Subina Rahman is one to be emulated even though she had admitted that this was her vocation.

The brigade headquarters of the Indian contingent is located adjacent to the Goma airfield.As a precautionary measure, contingents of various countries were told to be on alert by the UN's internal security system, observing that evacuation will not be required, the officials said.However, a majority of the teams, including aviation contingents, evacuated immediately, they added.The officials said the Indian brigade headquarters held on to its ground in a calculated and calm manner, thinned out 70 per cent of the strength of the camp and sent some of the personnel to the Himbi company operating base (COB) for safety.They said a minimum strength continued to hold on to the camp, ensuring that there was no threat to UN and national assets as also providing security to the empty aviation base and the aviation fuel stored there."An observation point is also established that is giving real-time updates of the lava flow to the brigade headquarters, enabling it to pass correct information to the UN and, hence, creating a semblance of orderliness in the civilian evacuation," one of the officials said.He said it was ascertained that the lava flow has considerably slowed down now.The broad mandate of the United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) is to ensure the protection of civilians, support the strengthening of public institutions and major governance and security reforms. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-army-contingent-protects-civilians-un-assets-after-volcano-erupts-near-congolese-city-257275
23-05-2021||Bhopal||Cheetah to be re-introduced in India from Africa in November: Madhya Pradesh govt||Cheetah, the world's fastest land animal which was declared extinct in India in 1952, is expected to be re-introduced into the country in November this year at the Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh, state Forest Minister Vijay Shah said on Sunday. The country's last spotted cheetah died in Chhattisgarh in 1947, and it was declared extinct in the country in 1952.The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) some years back prepared a cheetah re-introduction project.The Supreme Court had earlier given its approval to introduce African cheetahs to a suitable habitat in India on an experimental basis."We have started the process of creating an enclosure for around 10 cheetahs, including five females, to be brought from South Africa to Kuno in Sheopur district, and it is going to be completed by August," Shah told PTI.Officials from India will be sent to South Africa for sensitisation and training in June and July this year and according to the plan, the transportation of the cheetahs will take place in October and November, he said. Kuno, located in the Chambal region, is spread over an area of over 750 sq km and has a conducive environment for the cheetah, he said. The protected area, comprising a considerable population of four-horned antelopes, chinkara, nilgai, wild boar, spotted deer and sambar, has a good prey base for the cheetahs, he said."According to the approved timeline sent to us by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change this week, the tentative budget outlay of the 'Project Cheetah' is Rs 1,400 lakh for this fiscal," the minister said.The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is going to release the money for the project to Madhya Pradesh and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) at Dehradun next month, Shah said.An expert from South Africa visited the Kuno National Park on April 26 this year along with scientists from the WII and inspected the facilities and habitat created there for the introduction of African cheetahs. They approved it and now the final process of bringing the cheetah is underway, a forest official said.Earlier, experts from the WII had visited four places in Madhya Pradesh to look for the best habitat for the introduction of African cheetah in the country last year, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests J S Chauhan, told PTI.The WII team had visited the Kuno National Park in MP's Sheopur district, the Nauradehi sanctuary in Sagar district, the Gandhi Sagar sanctuary on the northern boundary of Mandsaur and Neemuch districts and the Madhav National Park in Shivpuri district, Chauhan said. "Madhya Pradesh had in the past been home to cheetahs. The state has a long conservation history...we have the habitat. We also have a successful animal translocation track record," Chauhan said, referring to the tiger reintroduction programme in the Panna Tiger Reserve in 2009.Cheetah is considered vulnerable under the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) red list of threatened species, with a declining population of less than 7,000 found primarily in African savannas.The Supreme Court last year set up a three- member committee to guide the NTCA on the cheetah re-introduction project.The panel has asked the WII to carry out a technical evaluation of all possible sites for the re-introduction of cheetah in the country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cheetah-to-be-re-introduced-in-india-from-africa-in-november-madhya-pradesh-govt-257272

23-05-2021|| Dewas||Madhya Pradesh: 21-year-old man's body taken in garbage vehicle for last rites||The body of a 21-year-old man, who allegedly committed suicide, was taken for last rites in a garbage vehicle in Madhya Pradesh's Dewas district, prompting the local civic administration to suspend its health official and terminate the services of three temporary employees.The incident took place in Sonkatch town on Saturday, following which a video of it went viral on social media.In the video, some civic employees were purportedly seen dumping the body in an empty garbage vehicle.The opposition Congress hit out at the BJP over the incident, but the ruling party said immediate action was taken by local civic authorities. According to sources, the victim, who was a resident of Rolupipalia village, had allegedly committed suicide and the body was being sent for last rites to a burial ground from the mortuary of a local health centre after post-mortem. Sonkatch Municipality's chief municipal officer Ravi Bhatt told PTI on Sunday that the civic body performed the last rites of 67 people since April 18 this year.Referring to Saturday's incident, he admitted that  the unclaimed body was sent for last rites in a garbage vehicle. He said an inquiry has been ordered into the incident and taking a serious note of it, the civic body's health department in-charge was suspended and the  services of three temporary employees, including a sanitary supervisor,  were terminated. Meanwhile, local Congress MLA and former state minister Sajjan Singh Verma targeted the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led MP government over the incident. In a couple of tweets, Verma said he had provided Rs 85 lakh for amenities in the Sonkatch Hospital from his local area development fund. "Despite this, dead bodies are being transported in garbage vehicle," he said. He also accused the BJP-ruled state government of "managing headlines and not performing the actual work". However, state BJP secretary Rahul Kothari told PTI that local civic authorities took immediate action into the matter."Verma, who represents this area in the state Assembly since a longtime, had earlier been a state cabinet minister. He also has some responsibility for such a situation in his constituency," Kothari said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-21-year-old-mans-body-taken-in-garbage-vehicle-for-last-rites-257261

23-05-2021||Raipur||Chhattisgarh to hold Class 12 board exams from June 1 in 'exam from home' pattern||The Chhattisgarh Board of Secondary Education (CGBSE) will conduct its Class 12  exams from June 1 wherein students would be allowed to collect question papers from specified centres, take them home and submit the answer copies within five days, officials said.As per an order issued late Saturday evening by CGBSE secretary V K Goyal, the board has decided to conduct the tests in this pattern in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the safety of over 2.86 lakh students across the state.The order said students of Class 12 will be given five days from June 1 to 5 to collect the question papers and blank answer sheets from the specified centres.They can collect the question papers on any date between June 1 and 5.The students would have to submit the answer copies at their respective centres within five days from the date of collection of the question papers, the order said.For example, if a student takes the question papers on June 1, then he or she must submit the answer copies by June 6 during working hours, Goyal said, adding that those who fail to submit the answer papers within the stipulated time will be considered absent.The answer copies can also be submitted on Sunday and holidays. Students are advised to get the question papers of their own subjects only, he said.They should write the answers on their own instead of taking help from others, he said.The first page of the answer copy should carry all the information regarding the student such as name, roll number, subject, subject code, signature and date, he said.Students should come to submit the answer sheets personally with their signature in the attendance register.  If a student takes 20 pages for writing the answers, then he or she needs to submit the same number of pages mandatorily even if they are blank.

Their health and safety MATTERS,” Gandhi said in a tweet. “Why are we not learning our lessons?” she asked.        Gatherings in closed spaces promote the spread of Covid-19 and this wave has shown that children are vulnerable to new strains, she said in a series of tweets.“In any case expecting children who are already under immense pressure to sit for their exams wearing all sorts of protective gear for hours at a stretch day after day is insensitive and unfair,” the Congress leader said.Many of them are likely to have family members who are down with Covid-19 too and they are already dealing with enough stress, she asserted.“I fail to understand the reasoning behind holding these exams, not to mention having stretched this decision out for months,” Gandhi said.“I have said this before and am repeating it again. The mental health of children is as important as their physical well being. It’s about time our education system incorporates sensitivity towards children’s well being and starts taking these issues seriously,” she said.The high-level meeting called by the Education Ministry will be chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Union Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani as well as Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar will be among those present. Education ministers and secretaries of all states and union territories have been asked to attend the meeting.The CBSE had on April 14 announced the cancellation of Class 10 exams and postponed Class 12 exams due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The CBSE had announced that a decision on the Class 12 board exams will be taken on or after June 1.

The police have recovered their identity cards and some documents and further investigation is underway, the official said.“From their uniform and life jackets, it appears they are the missing victims of the barge or the tugboat that sank off the Mumbai coast during cyclone Tauktae,” Jhala said.He said out of the four bodies found on Saturday, one was identified as that of the captain of tugboat ‘Varaprada’ that sank last Monday.“We are trying to identify the other five bodies,” he said.Barge P-305, which housed personnel engaged in maintenance work of an offshore oil drilling platform of the state-run oil and gas major ONGC, sank on Monday evening off the Mumbai coast after it went adrift due to the high-speed winds and huge tidal waves caused by the extremely severe cyclone which brushed the Mumbai coast on its way to Gujarat.Apart from the nine missing personnel of the barge P305, the Navy and the Coast Guard are also searching for 11 missing persons from the tugboat Varaprada.Of the 13 people on Varaprada, two have been rescued, officials earlier said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-tauktae-2-more-bodies-found-on-valsad-coast-in-gujarat-257232

However, in his zeal to return, he boarded the wrong train, which took him to Rajasthan's Bikaner, Choubey said.Dehri spent the next 13 years of his life at a 'Baal Grih' (children's home) run by the Social Welfare Department in Bikaner, where he would often turn emotional, reminiscing his childhood days and providing vivid descriptions of his village.Intrigued by his accounts over the years, the superintendent of the remand home, Aravind Acharay, contacted the Massanjore police, said Choubey, who then made video calls to Dehri and showed him places similar to those he had narrated about.It took Dehri no time to identify the area in the vicinity of Massanjore Dam where he lived. He also recounted that his father was a fisherman and recognised nearby locations where his relatives resided, the officer said.During further video calls, his maternal uncle also identified the young man.Dehri was finally handed over to his family members in Dumka by two constables from Bikaner in the presence of Choubey and other police officers on Friday evening."My joy knows no bounds. I am ready to do anything to earn a livelihood here among my own people," an elated Dehri, who could barely speak his native language 'Maundo', told PTI in Hindi.Several members of his family made special offerings to Gods and celebrated his return, remaining witness to a fact that is often fictionalised in cinema and literary works.

23-05-2021||United Nations||Recent surges of Covid-19 in India, S America left people gasping for breath before our eyes: UN chief||Recent surges of Covid-19 in India, South America and other regions have left people “literally gasping for breath before our eyes”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, warning that the pandemic is still “very much with us, thriving and mutating"."From the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I warned that no one is safe until everyone is safe….Grossly unequal access to vaccines, tests, medicines and supplies, including oxygen, have left poorer countries at the mercy of the virus,” Guterres said in his statement to the Global Health Summit on Friday.He said “recent surges of Covid-19 in India, South America and other regions have left people literally gasping for breath before our eyes. The pandemic is still very much with us, thriving and mutating.”“Let's be clear, we are at war with the virus. And if you are at war with the virus, we need to deal with our weapons with rules of a war economy, and we are not yet there. And this is true for vaccines, and it is true for other components in the fight against the virus,” he said.While the COVAX should have delivered 170 million doses around the world by now, vaccine nationalism, limited production capacity and lack of funding have led to that figure being just 65 million.“I call on G20 countries to lead by example and contribute their full share of funding. An investment of billions could end up saving trillions – and saving lives,” he said.  Guterres stressed that vaccinating quickly and thoroughly around the world, together with continued public health measures, are the only way to end the pandemic and prevent more dangerous variants from gaining a foothold. He, however, noted with concern that so far, more than 82 per cent of the world's vaccine doses have gone to affluent countries while just 0.3 per cent have gone to low-income countries. Guterres repeated his call for the G20 to set up a Task Force that brings together all countries with vaccine production capacities, the World Health Organization, the ACT-Accelerator partners and international financial institutions, able to deal with the pharmaceutical companies and other key stakeholders.“The Task Force should address equitable global distribution by using the COVAX facility. It should aim to at least double manufacturing capacity by exploring all options, from voluntary licenses and technology transfers to patent pooling and flexibility on intellectual property rights,” he said.The UN chief noted that the G20 Task Force should be co-convened at the highest levels by the major powers who hold most of the global supply and production capacity, together with the multilateral system.The European Commission and Italy, as chair of the G20, co-hosted the Global Health Summit on May 21 in Rome. Leaders of the G20 committed to a series of actions to accelerate the end of the COVID-19 crisis everywhere and better prepare for future pandemics, according to information on the summit's website.“The Summit was an opportunity for G20 and invited leaders, heads of international and regional organisations, and representatives of global health bodies, to share lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic. The leaders adopted a ‘Rome Declaration', committing to common principles to overcome Covid-19 and to prevent and prepare for future pandemics,” it said.G20 stressed the need to ensure equitable access to vaccines and to support low and middle-income countries.BioNTech/Pfizer (1 billion), Johnson & Johnson (200 million) and Moderna (around 100 million) pledged 1.3 billion doses of vaccines, to be delivered to low-income countries at no profit, and to middle-income countries at lower prices by the end of 2021, many of which will go via COVAX.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that the cyclone is expected to cross West Bengal and north Odisha coasts by May 26 evening with the wind speed ranging 155-165 kmph and gusting to 185 kmph.It is likely to cause heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of West Bengal and north Odisha. The IMD has also warned of storm surge in coastal areas of West Bengal and Odisha.

In addition, 13 teams are being airlifted on Sunday for deployment and 10 teams have been kept on standby, the PMO noted. Home Minister Amit Shah, other ministers and senior officials attended the meeting.In a tweet, Modi said he emphasised timely evacuation as well as ensuring that power and communications networks are not disrupted."Also emphasised on ensuring COVID-19 treatment of patients in affected areas does not suffer due to the cyclone. Praying for everyone's safety and well-being," he said. The PMO said the Indian Coast Guard and the Navy have deployed ships and helicopters for relief, search and rescue operations, while the Indian Air Force and engineer task force units of the Army, with boats and rescue equipment, are on standby for deployment.

23-05-2021|| New Delhi||Rahul Gandhi accuses PM of shedding crocodile tears on Covid deaths||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said a crying prime minister is the government of India’s response to “the highest Covid deaths” in the country, devoid of vaccines and having the lowest GDP.Gandhi made the frontal attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the grim pandemic situation in the country, leading two other senior Congress leaders, P Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh, too to join him in the attack.Both IMF and WHO have cautioned India about the consequences of the slow pace of vaccination.  “No Vaccines. Lowest GDP. Highest Covid deaths... GOI’s response? PMCries,” he said in an acerbic tweet on Friday, while also accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of shedding “crocodile tears” while paying homage to the people who died of COVID-19.“Crocodiles are innocent,” said the Congress leader in another tweet, in a dig at Prime Minister Modi turning emotional during his digital interaction with doctors in his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi on Friday.On his Twitter handle, Gandhi also shared a chart on the global economic condition and pandemic situation, tweeted by the Union government’s former Chief Economic Advisor Kaushik Basu.The chart showed India’s GDP at minus eight against 3.8 of Bangladesh, 1.9 of China and O.4 of Pakistan.In the same chart, India was shown suffering 212 deaths for each million of its population due to COVID-19 against 0.4 deaths in Vietnam and two in China.Claim—Jan 2021: Modi Govt will vaccinate 30cr Indians fully by July end.Reality—22nd May: 4.1cr Indians got both doses.Claim—21st May: India will fully vaccinate all adults by end of 2021. Reality—21st May: Only 14 lakh vaccinated whole day.We need vaccines, not 🐊 tears! https://t.co/mqLM9CaUG9  “Due to the mismanagement of the Modi system, India has the black fungus epidemic along with the Covid pandemic,” Gandhi said in yet another tweet, targeting the prime minister.“Along with the shortage of medicines for Covid, India also has a huge shortage of medicines for this big disease. The prime minister will soon be making a ‘taali-thaali’ (clapping and beating of plates) announcement to deal with the disease,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.Another Congress leader Jairam Ramesh too attacked the government over the alleged poor pace of anti-Covid vaccination, saying the country needs vaccines, not “crocodile tears”.“Claim—Jan 2021: Modi Govt will vaccinate 30 cr Indians fully by July end.Reality -- 22nd May: 4.1 cr Indians got both doses.Claim -- 21st May: India will fully vaccinate all adults by the end of 2021.Reality -- 21st May: Only 14 lakh vaccinated whole day,” he said on Twitter.“We need vaccines, not crocodile tears,” Ramesh added in his tweet.Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also cautioned the government saying both the IMF and WHO have cautioned India against the consequences of the slow pace of vaccination.Crocodiles are innocent. मगरमच्छ निर्दोष हैं।  “The claim of the Union health minister of getting 216 crore vaccine doses by December 31 to vaccinate the entire adult population by that date must be backed by hard data. So far, it is not,” he said in a series of tweets.“We need data on the capacity of domestic producers, orders placed vaccine-wise, import contracts concluded, agreed schedule of delivery etc. Nothing has been disclosed so far,” he said in a tweet.“The final warning to the government is that if vaccination is not accelerated, it will not be possible to prevent a third wave,” he said.Chidambaram said the Modi government cannot say “we did not anticipate these consequences”’.“The government has been duly forewarned,” he said.The Congress has been critical of the government’s vaccination policy and slow pace of inoculations.The tweets invited a strong reaction from BJP leaders.History will remember for lowering discourse using low language and strengthening low political moral in public discourse. @RahulGandhi https://t.co/dlARqLUREm  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-accuses-pm-of-shedding-crocodile-tears-on-covid-deaths-257211

Former CM Devendra Fadnavis said he was surprised to know that Thackeray was making political comments during his “merely three-hour long” tour of Konkan. Leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar sought to know how the CM could understand in “just three hours” the extent of damage caused by the cyclone.“It’s okay if my tour lasted four hours.

Union Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani and Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar will be in attendance.Education ministers and secretaries of all states and union territories have been asked to attend the meeting. According to CBSE sources, the possible options that can be explored are—conducting pen and paper mode exams for only major subjects, conducting all exams in two phases planned as per the COVID-19 situation in different states or districts, or cancelling the exams and announcing results as per an alternative assessment scheme.A senior board official, however, said: “Nothing has been finalised yet. A final call will only be taken by the Education Ministry after considering suggestions from all stakeholders”.Other senior Union ministers and state education ministers are expected to attend the meeting.While a large section of students and parents have been demanding that the exams be cancelled, school principals have varied views on the possible options that can be explored.“Under present circumstances, I visualize JEE type of online exams, through the involvement of the NTA. It would require setting up of the centres as per different locations, involving schools as self-centres or perhaps both. It would be a humongous exercise but can be at least considered for all major subjects opted for by a large number of students.“For subjects with very few enrolments, the OTP linked delivery of paper to be printed and conducted at home Centres, is also a possibility,” said Sangeeta Hajela, Principal, DPS Indirapuram.Rajat Goel, Director, MGR School Rohini, said, the assessment exam can be conducted online by the CBSE or the school may be allowed to plan an internal exam.“It can contain MCQs with some objective type questions. The exam can be conducted for every subject wherein the question paper is framed in such a way that student has to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills in attempting those questions,” he said.“There can be another part of aptitude test that can be made an intrinsic part of question papers as it will help them in passing the entrance exams of various universities or colleges,” he added.However, Pallavi Upadhyaya, Principal, DPS-RNE Ghaziabad, said the digital divide has to be kept in mind before deciding on an alternative mode of assessment.“Board exams for class 12  are not an independently managed examination. It involves several factors which need due time and consideration before being subjected to any change.“Hence, devising an alternative mode of assessment will be a challenging task if it is in an online mode, as the digital divide in India is a reality. CBSE has to revamp the entire infrastructure, and come up with a plan that suits all from rural, semi-urban to urban schools,” she said.The CBSE had on April 14 announced the cancellation of Class 10 exams and postponed Class 12 exams in view of the surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The exams, which are usually conducted in February-March every year, were scheduled to be held from May 4.The CBSE had announced that a decision on the Class 12 board exams will be taken on or after June 1. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/class-12-boards-cbse-may-conduct-exams-only-for-major-subjects-256871

To intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 24. To intensify further into Very Severe Cyclonic Storm, move north-northwestwards and cross West Bengal and adjoining north Odisha and Bangladesh coasts around 26th evening,” informed IMD in a tweet.The weather agency had earlier predicted that the cyclonic storm Yaas will hit the coasts of Odisha and West Bengal on May 26 and both the states will experience heavy rainfall from May 22 to 26.In view of the cyclonic storm Yaas, an advisory has been issued for fishermen of West Bengal not to venture into the sea from May 23 evening.

23-05-2021||Chandigarh||CSIO develops system to sanitise ventilation ducts to counter airborne transmission of Covid-19||In the backdrop of increasing evidence of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols, the Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO) here has developed a disinfection system for air conditioning and ventilation ducts.The ultraviolet (UV) light-based system can be used in auditoriums, large conference rooms, classrooms, malls, and other public places, which will provide a relatively safer environment for indoor activities during the current pandemic.The UV deactivates over 99 per cent of viruses, bacteria, fungus, and other bio-aerosols using the appropriate dosages of light. The use of UV may also help in ameliorating the fungal infections being witnessed during the current wave of the pandemic.It has been developed according to the requirements for deactivation of SARS CoV-2 virus contained in an aerosol with necessary ventilation measures, necessary safety and user guidelines, and tested bio-safety standards.Airborne transmission is considered a major risk in indoor settings by international agencies as well as health authorities in several countries. Significantly, research by Council for Scientific and Industrial Research’s Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and Institute of Microbial Technology last year had demonstrated experimentally that SARS-CoV-2 viral particles could be detected in the air even two hours after the exit of infected persons from a room and at distances much greater than a few meters.Based on these studies and recognising the need for effective solutions of viral disinfection, the challenge was to develop an effective retro-fit device with high intensities to handle fast airflows that could be fitted with minimal intervention in air-ducts of existing HVAC systems used in indoor industrial and commercial environment. CSIO’s system has been tested for more than 99 per cent disinfection and could be used as a retrofit solution in air handling units of buildings and transport vehicles besides having other applications. The UV is energy efficient, improves airflow through coils, enhances indoor air quality, requires less maintenance, is easy to retrofit with any existing system having AHU ducts, and has a low initial setup cost. The system comes with commercialised standards and certifications. Prof S Anantha Ramakrishna, Director CSIO, said that this technology, developed by the Fabrionics Division lead by Dr Harry Garg, is available now for deployment throughout the country as the technology for its commercial production has been transferred to 28 companies located in different states. More UV-based sanitisation products are being developed by Dr Garg’s group for other situations. Installation of UV-based solutions may boost people’s confidence and facilitate return to workplaces, public transport, and educational institutions as and when appropriate guidelines are issued by the government, Prof Ramakrishna added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/csio-develops-system-to-sanitise-ventilation-ducts-to-counter-airborne-transmission-of-covid-19-256869

The SAR ops are continuing through the night. Underwater search for wrecks of barge P305 and tug Varapada using specialised teams and equipment is in progress,” the official said in a statement.“To augment the ongoing SAR ops for the missing crew of Barge P305 and Tug Varaprada, specialised diving teams onboard INS Makar with side-scan sonar and INS Tarasa sailed out early morning today from Mumbai,” the spokesperson tweeted.The Navy and the Coast Guard continued the search for the nine missing personnel from the barge and 11 from Varaprada even as hopes of finding more survivors of the Cyclone Tauktae fury receded, an official said.Of the 261 personnel who were on barge P305, 186 have been recovered so far, 66 are dead and nine are missing. Of the 13 persons on Varaprada, two have been rescued.While all the 440 persons on barges Gal Constructor and Support Station 3 (SS-3) and drillship Sagar Bhushan were brought ashore to safety, Naval and Coast Guard vessels and aircraft scoured the waters off the Mumbai coast as the search and rescue operations entered the sixth day on Saturday.Struggling to establish the identity of almost half the victims of the P305 barge tragedy, police have initiated the process of conducting the DNA testing of the bodies, an official said on Saturday.A Mumbai police spokesperson said the Navy has handed over the bodies recovered so far to the city police.Barge P-305, which housed personnel engaged in maintenance work of an offshore oil drilling platform of state-run oil and gas major ONGC, sank on Monday evening off the Mumbai coast during the cyclone. The barge had gone adrift in the cyclone fury before sinking.Some bodies are decomposed, some others have deep injuries and therefore they are beyond recognition, the official said.Blood samples of the deceased and their immediate relatives are being collected and sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina in Mumbai, he said.“After the samples are matched, the bodies will be handed over to the respective family members,” he said, adding that the DNA sampling process is expected to be completed in the next three days.RT-PCR tests to ascertain whether the victims had Covid-19 infection were also conducted, he said.Mumbai police have also announced they will conduct a probe as to why the ill-fated barge remained in the turbulent area despite warnings about cyclone Tauktae, an official said. The police have also registered accidental death reports in connection with the death of the personnel on the barge. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/66-dead-20-missing-navy-deploys-diving-teams-to-look-for-bodies-256868
23-05-2021||New Delhi||No consensus yet on Covid vaccine passport issue at WHO level: Centre||The WHO is yet to reach a consensus on the vaccine passport issue for allowing international travel to those fully vaccinated against the coronavirus infection, the government said on Saturday and noted that discussions are still on.So far there's no consensus at the level of WHO over this, Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said."Discussion is still being done if vaccinated people will be allowed. As of now, as per WHO guidelines and guidelines by other countries, people with negative Covid test reports are being allowed," he said."When we will be able to reach a consensus at the world and WHO level (on vaccine passport issue), then we will take necessary steps,” he said responding to a question on reports claiming that people who took Covaxin jabs may not be allowed to travel internationally as the WHO hasn't included it in its list of vaccines.The Health Ministry also dismissed similar reports on its Twitter handle as "misleading and speculative".Talking about vaccine wastage, Agarwal said Covishield vaccine wastage reduced from 8 percent on March 1 to one percent now while Covaxin wastage decreased from 17 percent to 4 percent in the same period.NITI Aayog member (Health) VK Paul clarified that lactating women can get vaccinated."There were reports that after vaccination mothers should not breastfeed their child for a couple of days but I want to clarify that breastfeeding should not be stopped and should be continued."In no situation, there is any reason in that context to halt or discontinue breastfeeding even for an hour," he said.On Covid-19 prevalence among children, Paul said seropositivity rate between 10-17 years is roughly the same as between 30-40 and children can also spread the infection "Whenever children contracted the infection then almost always symptoms are minimal, very mild disease or they are asymptomatic and because it is mild the mortality is very very less in them," he said."We have a protocol of COVID disease among children. Protecting children from infection is equally important so that they do not become part of the transmission chain," he said.On mucormycosis or black fungus, Paul said the availability of medicines is being increased.Conditions such as diabetes, weakening of the immune system due to use of steroids, prolonged hospital stay and co-morbidities in Covid-19 may increase mucormycosis infection."Steroids are life-saving. It is a wonder drug but its irrational use can lead to mucormycosis. So this outbreak does not progress and further harm is not caused, that is our responsibility," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-consensus-yet-on-covid-vaccine-passport-issue-at-who-level-centre-256865
23-05-2021||London||Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine 80 per cent effective against B1.617.2 variant: UK study||Two doses from either the Oxford/AstraZeneca or the Pfizer vaccine are over 80 per cent effective in preventing infection from the B1.617.2 variant of COVID-19, first discovered in India, a new UK government study has reportedly found.The Oxford/AstraZeneca two-dose vaccine is also being produced by the Serum Institute of India as Covishield and being administered among the adult population in India to protect against the deadly virus.The UK findings are said to be based on data from Public Health England (PHE) and have also revealed that the two doses provide 87 per cent protection from the B.117 variant, first discovered in Kent region of England and also considered highly transmissible.According to ‘The Telegraph’ newspaper, the latest study’s findings were presented to a meeting of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) this week.The latest PHE statistics released earlier this week show that case numbers of the B1.617.2 variant had risen by 2,111 over the past week to hit 3,424 cases across the country.“I think it’s clearly growing, which anyone can see from the numbers as they are reported week by week,” Dr Jeffrey Barrett, director of COVID-19 genomics at the Sanger Institute, told the BBC.“If I had to put a guess today it would be 20 or 30 per cent rather than 50 per cent (more infectious than the Kent variant). But there is still uncertainty, 50 per cent might be a reasonable worst case scenario,” he said, in reference to the rate of transmissibility of the variant of concern (VOC) first detected in India.Meanwhile, PHE officials are also closely monitoring a variant under investigation (VUI) in the Yorkshire region of England, which is showing high transmissibility.It comes as the National Health Service (NHS) further expanded its vaccination programme and announced that it will open bookings for people aged 32 and 33, adding to the over-34s cohort, from Saturday.NHS England said that the third expansion of eligibility in just one week comes as over four in 10 adults have now had both jabs.“Only days after we extended the offer of a vaccine to 34 and 35 year olds, we are now rolling out the invite to 32 and 33 year olds—an incredible step forward in the biggest and most successful vaccination programme in NHS history,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“This is truly a testament to the heroic work of our amazing NHS and care staff, volunteers and local authorities across the country who have helped deliver over 50 million jabs at lightning speed across England, keeping us on track to offer a vaccine to everyone by July,” he said.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has, meanwhile, said that it is ramping up testing and genome sequencing of sewage and waste water in the drive to track and trace all variants of COVID-19, including the B1.617.2 variant.A new laboratory in Exeter, south-west England, opened last month dedicated to analysing wastewater, making it one of the biggest wastewater processing labs in the world. Increased genomic sequencing of sewage samples are expected to provide more clues to where variants of concern may be circulating undetected in communities. It can pick up evidence of variants from infected people and continue to monitor sewage after surge testing has ended in an area.“Sequencing wastewater samples provides an additional detection system for variants of concern, enabling us to respond more effectively to outbreaks and better protect citizens,” said Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency Dr Jenny Harries.“This innovative programme supports the work of Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace to help us understand where the virus may be circulating undetected,” she said.Wastewater samples are taken from around 500 locations in England and sent to the laboratory at Exeter Science Park. Environment Agency scientists analyse the samples to quantify the amount of COVID-19 present.“As infections fall and we head out of national restrictions, analysing wastewater to detect variants early on is important to help local authorities and NHS Test and Trace act quickly to stop variants from spreading in communities,” said Programme Lead at the Joint Biosecurity Centre Dr Andrew Engeli.The experts said that without the need to rely on individuals coming forward for swab tests, this kind of monitoring in a catchment area is able to pinpoint outbreaks to smaller areas and neighbourhoods. There are also pilots analysing the wastewater from specific institutions, such as within the food supply chain and prisons. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-80-per-cent-effective-against-b1-617-2-variant-uk-study-256853
23-05-2021||Unnao (UP)||UP: 17-year-old boy dies after being 'thrashed' by police for violating corona curfew||A 17-year-old boy died Friday after he was allegedly beaten up by the police here for "violating" the ongoing ‘corona curfew' in the state, his family claimed, following which a constable was suspended and a homeguard jawan sacked.The incident took place in Bhatpuri locality in Bangarmau area when the boy was selling vegetable outside his house.The police said in a statement that an FIR will be registered against the policemen involved and the entire matter probed.His family alleged that the boy was caught by a constable for allegedly violating 'corona curfew' and thrashed with a stick.He was later taken to a police station, where he was again thrashed following which his condition deteriorated and he was rushed to the Community Health Centre, where he was declared dead, the family alleged.Agitated with the police action, the locals created a jam at Lucknow road crossing, demanding action against the guilty, a government job and compensation for the victim's family.Later, the police said in a statement, "Constable Vijay Chodhury has been suspended with immediate effect in the matter and services of homeguard Satyaprakash have been terminated. The entire matter will be probed and an FIR will be registered against the policemen."       Senior officers are reaching the spot to meet the family members.The Uttar Pradesh government has imposed ‘corona curfew' in the state till 7 am on May 24 to curb the spread of coronavirus cases.

23-05-2021||New Delhi||3rd wave possible if vaccination not ramped up, Covid norms not followed: Scientist||If the vaccination drive against coronavirus is not ramped up and Covid-19 appropriate-behaviour is not maintained, there is a possibility of a third wave of the pandemic in 6-8 months, said M Vidyasagar, a scientist involved in the Sutra Model which uses mathematics to project the trajectory of COVID-19.He, however, stressed the Sutra model has not predicted any third wave and it is working on it.The IIT-Hyderabad professor cited a paper by Italian researchers on infected people with decreasing antibodies, which give some sort of immunity, in six months."If the antibodies are lost, then there is a chance of immunity going down. In this case, vaccination has to be ramped up and COVID-19 appropriate-behaviour must be practiced. If not then there is a possibility of a third wave in 6-8 months," Vidyasagar said."We are also adding the aspects of immunity and vaccination in our model for our future forecasts," he added.    According to a study by the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, antibodies against coronavirus remained in the blood of patients with Covid-19 for at least eight months after they were infected.A recent sero-survey by the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) suggested that the neutralising antibodies declined significantly after five-six months, making people prone to reinfections.The coronavirus cases in the country peaked in September 2020 and there was a nationwide decline of new cases starting in October."Using more stringent measures (more than 30 per cent inhibition of surrogate receptor-spike protein binding), the loss of neutralisation may be even higher."We speculate that this may be related to recurrence of outbreaks in March 2021, after the peak in September 2020," the IGIB paper said on the second wave that started raging from late March and has claimed thousands of lives since then.K VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser, had said on May 5 that as the virus mutates further, a third wave of COVID infection is inevitable and it is necessary to be prepared for new waves.Two days later he said there may not be a third wave of coronavirus in the country, if strong measures are taken and effectively implemented at the state, district and city-level."If we take strong measures, the third wave may not happen in all places or indeed anywhere at all. It depends on much how effectively guidance is implemented at the local level in the states, districts and cities everywhere."The guidance about precautions, about surveillance, about containment, about treatment and about tests. This insidious asymptomatic transmission can be stopped if we follow the guidelines. This sounds difficult, it is difficult and we can and must do it," VijayRagahvan had said in a press briefing.

23-05-2021||New Delhi||Wrestler murder case: Court denies anticipatory bail to Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar||A Delhi Court on Tuesday refused to grant anticipatory bail to absconding Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar in the murder case of a wrestler, saying that he is prima facie the main conspirator and allegations against him are serious in nature.  Additional Sessions Judge Jadgish Kumar denied the relief to Sushil Kumar against whom a case of murder, abduction and criminal conspiracy has been registered.Wrestler Sagar Rana died, while two of his friends Sonu and Amit Kumar got injured, after they were allegedly assaulted by Sushil Kumar and other wrestlers on May 4 night, at the stadium premises in the national capital.While dismissing Sushil Kumar's pre-arrest bail, the judge noted that “the allegations against the accused are serious in nature. From the perusal of record of investigation so far, it reveals that prima facie the accused is the main conspirator”. Further, the judge said “The investigation is still going on and some of the accused persons have not been arrested so far. The NBWS [non-bailable warrant] has already been issued against the accused.” The Additional Sessions Judge also relied upon the statements of the eye-witnesses while dismissing the plea and said “So at this stage, the Court is not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the accused”. Fearing arrest, the international wrestler moved the Rohini court in Delhi on May 17 seeking anticipatory bail, asserting that the investigation against him is biased and that no injuries are attributable to him.In the plea, the sportsman showed his willingness to join the investigation and provide a “true and correct picture of the incident” to help the investigating agency reach a logical conclusion.“It appears that the statement of the victims has already been recorded, and alleged recoveries have already been made. No custodial investigation is required as nothing is to be recovered at the instance of the applicant,” Sushil Kumar's plea stated.He further claimed to have no connection with the alleged firing that took place during the brawl, adding that the firearm and vehicle found at the place of the incident do not belong to him. However, Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Srivastava, representing the police, told the court that there is electronic evidence where he could be seen “with a stick and hitting” the wrestler. The Prosecutor also asserted that Sushil's passport has been confiscated to alert the authorities as there is an apprehension that he may flee the country.According to Investigating Officer (IO) Inspector Dinesh Kumar, wrestler's custodial interrogation is required to unearth the chain of conspiracy and recover the weapon of offence from him. “He is the main accused in the whole incident, who has played a key role in the commission of offence. Data retrieved by FSL experts confirms his active role in commission of crime,” the Investigating Officer told the court. Senior advocate Sidharth luthra, representing the accused, told the court that Sonu, present during the brawl, is a history sheeter, member of Kala Jatheria''s gang and has various criminal cases against him.     “These people, who I am up against, are criminal-minded people and I will suffer at their hands,” Luthra told the court on behalf of Sushil Kumar.Sushil Kumar is on the run since Rana's death and the police are making efforts to trace him by conducting raids in the Delhi-NCR region and neighbouring states.The Delhi Police has filed an FIR in the case under sections 302 (murder), 308 (cupable homicide), 365 (kidnapping), 325 (causing grevious hurt), 323 (voluntarily casuing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation).It has also been registered under 188 (Disobedience to order by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and various sections under the Arms Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wrestler-murder-case-court-denies-anticipatory-bail-to-olympic-medalist-sushil-kumar-254748
