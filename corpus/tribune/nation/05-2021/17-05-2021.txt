17-05-2021||New Delhi||India drops plasma therapy from Covid-19 management guidelines||The government on Monday revised the clinical guidance for Covid-19 treatment, dropping the off-label use of convalescent plasma as it was found not beneficial in reducing the progression to severe disease or death.The development came following a meeting of the ICMR-National Task Force for Covid-19 last week wherein all members were in favour of removing the use of convalescent plasma from the guidelines citing its ineffectiveness and inappropriate use in several cases.An Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) official said the task force “revised” the Clinical Guidance for Management of Adult Covid-19 Patients and “dropped convalescent plasma (off label)”.The previous guidelines recommended off-label use of plasma therapy at the stage of early moderate disease, that is, within seven days of the onset of symptoms and if there is availability of a high titre donor plasma.The decision to remove it from the guidelines comes in the backdrop of some clinicians and scientists writing to Principal Scientific Adviser K VijayRaghavan cautioning against the “irrational and non-scientific use” of convalescent plasma for Covid-19 in the country.In the letter, which was also marked to ICMR chief Balram Bhargava and AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, public health professionals alleged that the current guidelines on plasma therapy are not based on existing evidence and pointed out some very early evidence that indicates a possible association between emergence of variants with “lower susceptibility to neutralising antibodies in immunosuppressed” people given plasma therapy.This raises the possibility of more virulent strains developing due to irrational use of plasma therapy which can fuel the pandemic, according to the letter signed by vaccinologist Gagandeep Kang, surgeon Pramesh C S and others.“We are writing to you as concerned clinicians, public health professionals and scientists from India about the irrational and non- scientific use of convalescent plasma for Covid-19 in the country.“This has stemmed from guidelines issued by government agencies, and we request your urgent intervention to address the issue which can prevent harassment of Covid-19 patients, their families, their clinicians and Covid-19 survivors,” said the letter.“The current research evidence unanimously indicates that there is no benefit offered by convalescent plasma for treatment of Covid-19. However, it continues to be prescribed rampantly in hospitals across India,” the letter said.

17-05-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear Param Bir Singh’s plea for transfer of inquiries to agency outside Maharashtra||The Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday a fresh plea of former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh seeking transfer of all inquiries against him to an independent agency outside Maharashtra like the CBI.Singh, a 1988-batch IPS officer, was removed from the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner on March 17 and was made the General Commander of Maharashtra State Home Guard after he levelled allegations of corruption and misconduct against then Home Minister and senior NCP leader Anil Deshmukh.The Bombay High Court had ordered a CBI probe into allegations of Singh against Deshmukh who had to resign as the minister.The senior police officer, in his fresh plea before the top court, has alleged that he has been made to face several inquiries by the state government and its instrumentalities and sought their transfer outside Maharashtra and a probe into them by an independent agency like the CBI.A vacation bench of justices Vineet Saran and B R Gavai would hear the plea of Singh on Tuesday, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who has been representing Singh in courts, told PTI.The former top cop of Mumbai, in his fresh plea, has made the state government, CBI and the Maharashtra Police chief as parties.Singh, in his earlier plea filed before the top court, had sought a CBI probe against Deshmukh who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Waze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants.The top court had then asked him to go the Bombay High Court which ordered CBI probe into Singh’s allegations and against that order the state government and the NCP leader subsequently failed to get any relief from the apex court.Deshmukh denied any wrongdoing and had said there was not an iota of substantive evidence to even prima facie establish that any of the allegations made by Singh had an element of truth.In its 52-page judgement, the high court had said Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh had put at stake the citizen’s faith in the state police.Such allegations, made by a serving police officer, against the state home minister could not be left unattended, and were required to be probed into, if prima facie, they made a case of a cognisable offence, the high court had said.The high court’s verdict had come on three PILs including one filed by Singh seeking several reliefs as also a CBI probe into the matter.

17-05-2021||New Delhi||O2 concentrators of less than 5 litres per minute capacity not suitable for COVID patients: Advisory||Oxygen concentrators with a flow capacity of less than five litres per minute are "not suitable" for COVID-19 patients on home care and should not be used, India's drug regulator has said in an advisory, adding that sellers should not push such devices using "misleading label" amid the coronavirus second wave.The advisory has been issued to inform people about minimum standards of oxygen concentrators for COVID-19 case management, especially for use in home settings, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) said.At present various models of oxygen concentrators, having different capacities of continuous flow (1 to 10 litres/minute) and widely varying concentration of oxygen, are being marketed, the advisory stated.The health ministry has from time to time advised that oxygen concentrators with flow capacity of five litre per minute or more and delivering oxygen with concentration of 90 per cent or more are suitable for management of COVID-19 patients at COVID Care Centres, Dedicated COVID Health Centres and in home settings.The World Health Organisation has also prescribed these norms for oxygen concentrators.Besides, continuous flow of concentrated oxygen (>90%) from room air through one oxygen outlet, minimum continuous flow of up to 5 litre/min or more, oxygen concentrators which contain oxygen monitor to verify concentration and digital or analogue metre that displays cumulative hours of device operation may be used in home settings."Many people are not aware about these minimum parameters of oxygen concentrators and therefore may be using the concentrators that are not suitable for COVID-19 case management. This advisory is issued to inform people about minimum standards of oxygen concentrators for COVID-19 case management, for use especially in home settings," the advisory stated.It further advised that oxygen concentrators must be purchased with consumables required to operate, user care instructions and protocols including guidance for replacement of accessories and consumable and safe decontamination of reusable parts, indicating if they are generic or brand-related, the advisory said."It is strongly advised that all sellers must prominently display the following information for each model of oxygen concentrator for sale---continuous flow capacity in litres per minute, the percentage of oxygen that a concentrator generates and the maximum retail price."The aim of this advisory is to provide minimum parameters that must be verified by people before using an oxygen concentrator for COVID-19 case management in home settings," the CDSCO said.India is under the grip of a devastating second wave of COVID-19, which has triggered a shortage of medical oxygen and other critical drugs. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/o2-concentrators-of-less-than-5-litres-per-minute-capacity-not-suitable-for-covid-patients-advisory-254200
17-05-2021||New Delhi||Why can’t formula to determine MRP of oxygen concentrators be fixed: HC asks Centre||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Centre why it can’t fix a formula to determine the MRP of oxygen concentrators which are in demand for Covid-19 treatment as people were being charged exorbitantly.The high court said it was not asking the government to fix a price in rupee or paisa, but to fix a principle on which oxygen concentrators will be charged and it should understand if this is not an extra ordinary circumstance where it should intervene, then what will be.Asserting that there has to be a cap on the price of the product, it said, “There has to be some limit to it. It cannot be limitless. Tomorrow some Chinese manufacturer will say he will sell it at 5X rate, it cannot be allowed.”“As a government, it is your responsibility that people are actually able to afford the product and not have to pay through their nose. They can’t be taken for a ride. Shortage of a product cannot be taken advantage of. Should you not think of the consumer,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet said.The bench asked why can’t the government fix a formula to determine the price and said it cannot say that the demand is more and supply is less and everything is in flux so it can’t do anything.“This is not an answer. You have to fix it,” it said and suggested of fixing a formula like landed price of the product plus duty charge (GST) plus 15 per cent profit margin.The bench said there cannot be only demand and supply criteria and there has to be government intervention and a ceiling on price and it cannot throw its hands in the air and say it cannot be fixed.Central government counsel Kirtiman Singh and Amit Mahajan said the landed price is ultimately determined by the exporter and said it was not possible for the government to fix the prices as there are different concentrators in the market with different prices, sizes and names.The Centre’s counsel sought some time to obtain further instructions on the issue and inform the court, which will now hear the matter on May 19.The court was hearing a plea relating to fixation of price of oxygen concentrators by Delhi resident Manisha Chauhan who has also sought appointment of special public prosecutors for dealing with such cases before the special fast track courts.Advocates Sanjeev Sagar and Nazia Parveen, appearing for Chauhan, had told the court that in the absence of a notification declaring medicines and equipment meant for COVID as essential commodities, these are being hoarded and black marketed.During the hearing, the bench was told by the Centre that they take action against the manufacturers who are overcharging and have recovered huge money.“You have to realize that India is probably the largest consumer (of oxygen concentrators). The government should understand if this is not an extra ordinary circumstance where it should intervene, then what will be,” the bench said, adding that there has to be a cap on the price of the product.The Centre’s counsel said there is confusion on the maximum retail price (MRP) and prices keep on changing by the exporter and added that if the government fixes a price today, the suppliers may not supply whatever they are supplying currently.The bench, however, asked the government to work on it and that it cannot throw its hands in the air and say it cannot be fixed.The Centre’s counsel also informed the court about a latest advisory by the government on minimum standards for oxygen concentrators to be used by patients.The court said wide publicity be given to such advisories or else how the general public will know about it and efforts be made to educate people.“What to buy, how to use, there should be information. You should come out with these ads. Why is that not happening in these times? Why should you not use audio-visual media? We had asked ICMR to make videos, short clips to educate people on these issues. Why should you not use Doordarshan an electronic media for it,” the bench said.The high court had earlier said that as early as June last year the process to fix prices of domestic and imported oxygen concentrators and other equipment was started, but was left unfinished.“It is high time that MRP of oxygen concentrators and all of the other equipment in demand (for COVID-19 treatment) be fixed so that black marketing and hoarding is immediately stopped,” it had said.

17-05-2021||New Delhi||Court sends Kalra for three days in police custody in oxygen concentration black marketing case||A Delhi Court on Monday sent businessman Navneet Kalra to police custody for three days in connection with allegedly black marketing and hoarding oxygen concentrators amid the coronavirus pandemic.The Delhi Police arrested Kalra on Sunday night. He was on the run for over a week since the seizure of more than 500 oxygen concentrators from Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nege & Ju restaurants owned by him.Metropolitan Magistrate Archana Beniwal allowed custodial interrogation of Kalra by Delhi Police which had sought five days of police custody to quiz him.Kalra will now be produced before the court on May 20.Investigating Officer (IO) Kamal Kumar asserted that his custodial interrogation is required to unearth the whole nexus and conspiracy behind the black marketing and know the trail of money transaction.During the proceedings, Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told the court that Kalra has to be confronted with the co-accused in the case and that documents are voluminous for which his custody is required.“It is a case of conspiracy. He had been evading arrest. This is a serious case. Without police custody, it will be impossible for the investigating agency to reach the conclusion,” the prosecutor said. Opposing the police custody, the counsel representing Kalra said that his bank details, mobile phone, laptop and gadgets are already available with police and that his custodial interrogation is not required.“Remand must be granted only in cases of real necessity. For what purpose do they need custody? They need to know the trail? They can get any information they want from me. Request for the police remand is absurd,” the counsel added.It was also requested that Kalra be allowed to receive treatment at Medanta for stitches in his fractured jaw.The businessman had been on the run for over a week since the seizure of more than 500 oxygen concentrators from three upscale restaurants owned by him in the national capital.The concentrators are a crucial medical equipment used for COVID-19 patients and are on high demand amid the second wave of the pandemic.On May 13, a court had rejected his anticipatory bail application, saying that allegations against him are serious and his custodial interrogation is required to “unearth the entire conspiracy”.Pursuant to this, the accused moved the Delhi High Court, which also declined to grant interim protection from arrest in the case, agreeing with the reasons given by the trial court while denying him the relief.During a recent raid, 524 oxygen concentrators were recovered from three restaurants owned by Kalra in Khan Market and Lodhi Colony in Delhi. The case was subsequently transferred to the Delhi Police Crime Branch.The police claimed that the concentrators were imported from China and were being sold at an exorbitant price of Rs 50,000 to 70,000 a piece as against its cost of Rs 16,000 to Rs 22,000.On May 5, a case was registered against Kalra under Section 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, Essential Commodities Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.

17-05-2021||New Delhi||CoWIN portal in Hindi, other languages from next week: Govt||The CoWIN portal will be made available in Hindi and 14 regional languages by next week, while 17 more laboratories will be added to the INSACOG network to monitor the variants of Covid-19, the health ministry said on Monday.According to a statement by the ministry, these decisions were announced at the 26th meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on COVID-19, chaired by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, on Monday.Vardhan informed his colleagues that 17 new laboratories are going to be added to the INSACOG network to increase the number of samples screened and allow for more spatial analysis, the ministry said.The network is presently served by 10 laboratories located at different corners of the country.Speaking on their contribution to the country’s achievements today, Vardhan said, “India’s new COVID-19 cases have dropped to less than three lakh for the first time after 26 days. Also, a net decline of 1,01,461 cases has been recorded in the active caseload in the last 24 hours.” He lauded the efforts of defence scientists and the leadership of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for launching the country’s first indigenous anti-COVID drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose or 2-DG (developed by the DRDO in collaboration with the INMAS and the Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories), the ministry said.The research efforts for the drug started in April last year and ended recently, when the DCGI gave it the emergency-use approval (EUA). The minister informed the members that the drug can become a gamechanger in the country’s response to the pandemic as it reduces the dependence of patients on oxygen administration and has the potential of getting absorbed differentially and in a selected manner. In the Covid-infected cells, it inhibits virus synthesis and energy production for the process.He noted that the Centre continues to help the states under a “whole of government” approach to tide over the pandemic. Over 4.22 crore N95 masks, 1.76 crore PPE kits, 52.64 lakh Remdesivir injections and 45,066 ventilators were distributed among the states and Union territories, according to the statement.The Union health secretary apprised the meeting that the CoWIN platform is being made available in Hindi and 14 regional languages by next week.Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director, NCDC, presented a detailed report on the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and the Variants of Concern (VoCs) being reported in India. He showed figures related to the state-wise prevalence of VoCs like the B.1.1.7 and B.1.617. The B.1.1.7 lineage (UK variant) was found predominant in the samples collected in Punjab and Chandigarh between February and March, the statement said.Dr Balaram Bhargava, Secretary, Health Research and DG, ICMR, made a presentation on the innovative changes in testing policy that would widen its scope of application and help in mass screening for COVID, particularly in peri-urban and rural settings, where the health infrastructure is relatively weak.Deployment of mobile RT-PCR testing vans and amplification of RAT tests were presented as the way forward. While the present capacity is around 25 lakh (RTPCR 13 lakh, RAT 12 lakh), this is projected to exponentially increase to 45 lakh (RTPCR 18 lakh, RAT 27 lakh) under the new testing regimen.The DG, ICMR also informed regarding the home-isolation guidelines, which have been converted into Hindi and other regional languages for a wider reach. Warning signs for hospitalisation, admission to ICU and for potential administration of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were also highlighted.S Aparna, Secretary (Pharma) informed that a dedicated cell has been created to coordinate production and allocation of the drugs in demand to treat COVID-19.Stress was laid on the procurement and allocation of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Amphotericin-B. She notified that the demand for Favipiravir too has increased, although the drug is not recommended in COVID medical guidelines. She suggested IEC campaigns for a judicious use of these drugs.The secretary (pharma) also highlighted that Remdesivir production has more than tripled in the country with government intervention from around 39 lakh to 1.18 crore vials per month.The demand for Amphotericin-B, which is used in the treatment of mucormycosis, has also increased. Five suppliers have been identified and efforts are being made for an optimal allocation of the drug. The states were given one lakh vials from May 1-14, while avenues for import are being actively explored, the statement said.The secretary (pharma) further emphasised that the states must make an equitable distribution among the government and the private hospitals and keep the public informed on availability and shop details, help prevent unnecessary stockpiling and ensure timely payments to the manufacturers.Vardhan expressed his appreciation to all COVID warriors who have remained steadfast in their duty during the pandemic, “without showing any signs of deprivation and fatigue”.He was joined by Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar, Minister of Civil Aviation Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State for Ports, Shipping and Waterways (I/C) and Chemical and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya and Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs Nityanand Rai. Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health, joined the meet digitally.Dr Vinod K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog was also present virtually.

17-05-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Telangana suspends Covid vaccination for 45+||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, May 17Telangana has announced the suspension of vaccination with Bharat Biotech developed Covaxin for an unknown period because of a vaccine shortage.Director of Public Health G Srinivasa Rao said the state had been forced to take this step on account of the non-availability of the vaccine from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This will primarily impact the second dose for persons above 45 years of age. The state has no clue as to when this will be resumed. The state has also stopped administering the first dose and postponed vaccination for 18 years of age. The state claims that it can vaccinate 10 lakh each day but was slowing down the drive on account of shortage. So far, 56.25 lakh doses have been administered, out of which 11.37 lakh got their second dose.  Meanwhile, the Telangana High Court today slammed the government for reducing the testing in the state. Chief Justice Hima Kohli noted that in the previous hearing, the state was asked to carry out around 1 lakh tests per day, but in reality, the testing had reduced to around 50,000 tests per day.  The Chief Justice observed that the constant insistence of the court to enhance the number of tests, particularly the RT-PCR test has fallen on deaf ears. The bench observed that on May 1, around 76,000 samples were tested and by May 14, the same had dwindled to about 50,000. On the other hand, the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh today extended the curfew in the state until the end of May. Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the curfew should be more than four weeks long for the state to witness the results. Earlier on May 5, the Andhra government had announced a curfew from 12 noon to 6 am every day, till May 18, to contain the spread of COVID-19. He also announced a grant of Rs 15,000 to the families who lost their members to covid to conduct the funeral. Andhra Pradesh has recorded 14,32,596 COVID-19 cases so far, of which 2,10,436 active cases. So far, 9,372 persons have died as per the official record.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-suspends-covid-vaccination-for-45-254189
17-05-2021||Vijay Mohan||Compact ventilation system to help health workers breathe easy in PPE kits||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 17Medical staff and health workers deployed on Covid-19 related duties in medical facilitates and other high risk places may soon be relieved of sweating out long hours in heavy suffocating personal protection equipment (PPE) kits.In a project supported by the Department of Science and Technology’s National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board, a compact and economical ventilation system for PPE kits has been developed by a Pune-based engineering student which prevents excessive sweating while wearing such kits.Christened ‘Cov-Tech Ventilation System’, the gadget keeps the individual well ventilated and prevents not only bodily discomforts but also possible fungal accumulation and infection in the body when it is attached with the conventional PPE kits with one simple modification.It can be fastened over the waist just like a simple belt over which the traditional PPE is worn and can provide comfort to the wearer. The design of the ventilation system ensures a complete air seal from the PPE kit and provides a breeze of fresh air to the user in a gap of just 100 seconds.The product, developed at a state-of-the-art prototyping facility, has been finalised as per the medical experts’ advice, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today.Thousands of doctors, paramedics, hospital staff as well as other employees and volunteers deployed in medical care facilities, undertaking sanitary duties or other services across the country are required to wear kits that cover the entire body so as to mitigate the risk of contracting infection.The student, Nihaal Singh Adarsh, who also has a start-up, had received the Promoting and Accelerating Young and Aspiring Technology Entrepreneurs (PRAYAS) grant of Rs 10 lakh from the Department of Science and Technology for prototype development and product innovation. His startup also received an additional Rs 5 lakh as support from different institutes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/compact-ventilation-system-to-help-health-workers-breathe-easy-in-ppe-kits-254186
17-05-2021||Mumbai||Rising covid spends, fuel prices online delivery to crowd out consumer demand, warns SBI report||The massive increase in healthcare spends, especially in the hinterland, steadily rising fuel prices and online delivery of articles will increase inflation pressure much higher on one hand and crowd out other consumer spending on the other, putting a big question mark on overall growth that’s still being driven by consumption demand, according to a report.Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the group chief economic adviser at State Bank, in a note also noted that the steep fall in retail inflation in April to 4.29 per cent from 5.52 per cent in March is deceptive, as the CSO inflation number is primarily due to easing food prices as the rural core inflation has jumped to 6.4 per cent.As the pandemic rages through the country, it is worthwhile to look beyond the headline inflation as rural core has now jumped to 6.4 per cent in April and will rise further in May. The increasing health spend due to the pandemic is having a meaningful impact in rural areas, Ghosh said.Item-wise inflation of health CPI shows persistent month-on-month increase in inflation of non-institutional medicines, and X-ray, ECG, pathological tests.Therefore, the headline inflation may not be correct to look at. A more important price concept is the relative prices which are not a monetary phenomenon but their movements convey important information about the scarcity of particular goods and services as now like health, he said.For example, overall CPI declined in April because of significant decline in food CPI, but when the relative prices of food items is compared to overall CPI the deceleration was not sharp as it was seen in actual food CPI. Similarly, for certain items like fuel and health the increase in relative prices is maximum. Interestingly, core CPI that declined 57 bps, increased in relative terms by 18 points.According to him, given this, there are three key points to assess the price pressures, such as health, fuel price and rising commodity prices.Health expenditure, which currently constitutes 5 per cent of overall inflation basket, may jump to at least 11 per cent from due to the pandemic, Ghosh said.This is likely to also result in squeeze in expenditure on other items of discretionary consumption, a recipe for a cutback in consumption spending, he said.Secondly, rising fuel prices since is having a direct impact on squeeze in consumption spending on discretionary items, other than on health which is currently unavoidable, he said. “And if we look at credit card spends since December, CPI computed inflation for the five month ending April is higher than the CSO estimate on an average by 60 basis points and the higher oil prices had forced consumers to ration out discretionary spends in December”.In fact, the share of non-discretionary spend has jumped to 59 per cent in April from 52 per cent in March and this does not augur well for the economy, he said.The only way out is to cut oil prices by tax rationalisation, otherwise non-discretionary spends will continue to get distorted and crowd out discretionary expenses, said the report and warned that this will also impart a clear upward bias in inflation. Also, there has been an increase in use of online delivery platforms which is not considered by the NSO and if the NSO considers online prices, there will be 10-15 bps impact on CPI inflation.Thirdly, the rising commodity prices may lead to rate hike by US Federal Reserve and all these three forces will make it difficult for the RBI to manage the conflicting targets of inflation, exchange rate and adequate liquidity amidst weak growth.The report attributed the massive spike in rural core increasing to 6.39 per cent in April from 5.85 per cent in March, to the increase in health inflation, the weighted contribution of which has increased to 0.50 per cent from 0.36 per cent in March. Inflation in personal care and education has also risen marginally.The report further warned that health expenditure will rise significantly because of the pandemic. It may be noted that health expenditure was around Rs 6 lakh crore or 5 per cent  of the private final consumption expenditure (PFCE). --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rising-covid-spends-fuel-prices-online-delivery-to-crowd-out-consumer-demand-warns-sbi-report-254185
17-05-2021||New Delhi||Political leaders have no business to hoard stocks of Covid-19 medicines: HC||Political leaders have no business to hoard stocks of Covid-19 medicines that are already in shortage and they are expected to surrender these drugs, said the Delhi High Court which on Monday also expressed dissatisfaction over a “vague and whitewashed enquiry” report filed by the Delhi Police over the allegations against politicians hoarding and distributing medicines, including Remdesivir, in national capital.“Just because some political figures are involved, you will not investigate, we will not allow this,” said the court adding that it would have appreciated if the police had enquired into specific allegations levelled against each person and then filed the report.However, the court, which was hearing a PIL seeking lodging of an FIR on the allegations that politicians are able to procure in huge quantity and distribute Covid-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them, said since it is projected that these medicines were procured for public charity, it hopes and expects that they are not hoarded for political gains.“Political leaders have no business to hoard stocks of these medicines. We expect them to surrender to the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) which will then distribute it to the poor and needy people at government hospitals. This is the best way to do public service,” said a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh and added that if their intention is to do public good, they should themselves go and surrender the stock.The police, in its status report, said the political leaders, including cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir, have been actually helping people in getting medical aid in the form of medicines, oxygen and others and have not charged any money and no one has been defrauded.The police, represented through standing counsel Sanjay Lau, said the enquiry in the alleged instances is being conducted on a day-to-day basis and the officials have examined Lok Sabha MP and BJP leader Gautam Gambhir, president of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee Chaudhary Anil Kumar, ex Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma, BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana, AAP MLA Dilip Pandey.The others who have been enquired are vice president Congress (Delhi) Ali Mehdi, block adhyaksh of Congress (Delhi) Ashok Baghel, ex-MP Bijnor Shahid Siddiqui and president of All India Youth Congress Srinivas BV.“The enquiry conducted so far has revealed that all the persons alleged to have been hoarding medicines etc, have been actually helping people in getting medical aid in the form of medicine, oxygen, plasma or hospital bed, the person enquired into have not charged any money for the help provided, and thus no one has been defrauded. The distribution/ help has been voluntary and without discrimination,” the report said.The police sought six weeks to examine the issue and conclude the enquiry, which was declined by the court on the ground that pandemic is going on right now and the police force shall stand up as it owes a duty to citizens.The court asked, “what is the point of this vague and whitewashed enquiry. How can you be slack about it. The pandemic is right now, you have to act now. We are making it very clear that we will not accept this. We mean business. You had enough time, this is completely unacceptable. Political parties have no business to control this pandemic…”      The Bench, which expressed dissatisfaction over the status report filed by the police, said people have to act reasonably and they have no reason to buy these medicines in bulk and distribute it to gain goodwill while others are forced to buy it in black at much higher prices.The high court said it expects the police to conduct a proper investigation in the matter and file a better status report within a week. It also asked the amicus curiae to prepare a report on the issue.It said the status report shall clearly mention how medicines, which were in huge shortage and sold at higher rates in black market, were procured by few persons in large quantities.“How many people have died because of the shortage of these medicines, do you realise. So, fix some responsibility,” the Bench told the police.It impleaded the drug controller as a party to the proceedings and issued notice to him for May 24.When the police claimed that a particular doctor has procured these medicines and through him, some of the leaders took the stock, the court said prima facie it was difficult to believe that any doctor will go to market and procure these medicines in huge quantities when the drugs are in shortage.

I am in a lot of trouble (health issues) but take the ‘gaumutra ark’ every day. After this, I am not supposed to take any other medicine for coronavirus. I am not affected by coronavirus infection.“I believe God will keep me protected as I am using this medicine of ‘gaumutra ark’,” the Bhopal MP said while addressing a function in Bairagarh area of Bhopal to dedicate oxygen concentrators on Sunday evening.She said cow urine is like a “life-saving” medicine.In April, a Madhya Pradesh Congress leader had announced a reward of Rs 10,000 for anybody who spots Thakur in public alleging that she was “missing” from the scene when the people need her help as an MP.During her speech, Thakur said she has been helping people “without publicity” in the second wave of coronavirus pandemic.Various statements of Thakur, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case, had sparked controversies in the past.

But we told them that anybody looking for a safe shelter is welcome to use our facility,” said Naor Gudker, the Chairman of Beersheba Cricket Club.“There are several Indian researchers staying with us during the past week, both boys and girls, and we have tried to make things as comfortable as possible, extending them all possible help,” he said.“Some of them are not fully aware of the safety regulations and me and my colleagues have tried to make them aware of all the precautions to be taken to keep them safe,” Naor said.The club members have been taking turns and voluntarily attending the facility in shifts to look after the local residents lacking safe houses and also foreigners, mostly Indian researchers.Viraj Bhingardive, Heena Khand, Shashank Shekhar, Rudraru Senguta and Bishnu Khand, some of the doctoral and post-doctoral fellows, taking refuge at the club during these difficult and critical times, expressed their gratitude towards the generosity of the hosts and its management.“We can sleep here knowing we are safe,” most of them said to PTI adding, “there hasn’t been a quiet night since last Monday”.“The club has not only made Indian students feel secure but, in a way, has been pampering them. They have access to snacks, tea and coffee and can use the gym and the entertainment system… it helps distract us from the ongoing misery”, said Ankit Chauhan, a doctoral student at the university.Palestinian militant group Hamas has fired more than 3,000 rockets over Israel during the past seven days, pushing more than half of Israel’s population into shelter houses and Israel has carried out hundreds of devastating retaliatory attacks in Gaza.More than 200 people have been killed in the recent escalation in the region, including a caregiver from Kerala, whose mortal remains were sent to her hometown in Idukki last week.

Since the Covid-19 vaccination drive was initiated – more than 23,000 adverse events were reported through the CO-WIN platform reported from 684 of the 753 districts of the country.“Of these, only 700 cases (@ 9.3 cases /million doses administered) were reported to be serious and severe in nature,” the statement said.“The AEFI data in India showed that there is a very miniscule but definitive risk of thromboembolic events. The reporting rate of these events in India is around 0.61/million doses, which is much lower than the 4 cases/million reported by UK’s regulator Medical and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Germany has reported 10 events per million doses,” the statement stated.Thromboembolic events keep occurring in general population as background and scientific literature suggests that this risk is almost 70 per cent less in persons of South and South East Asian descent in comparison to those from European descent.The ministry is separately issuing advisories to healthcare workers and vaccine beneficiaries to encourage people to be aware of suspected thromboembolic symptoms occurring within 20 days after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine (particularly Covishield) and report preferably to the health facility where vaccine was administered.The symptoms listed are breathlessness, pain in chest, pain in limbs/pain on pressing limbs or swelling in limbs (arm or calf), multiple, pinhead size red spots or bruising of skin in an area beyond the injection site, persistent abdominal pain with or without vomiting, seizures in the absence of previous history of seizures with or without vomiting, severe and persistent headache with or without vomiting (in the absence of previous history of migraine or chronic headache).The symptoms also include weakness or paralysis of limbs or any particular side or part of the body (including face), persistent vomiting without any obvious reason, blurred vision or pain in eyes or having double vision, change in mental status or having confusion or depressed level of consciousness or any other symptom or health condition which is of concern to the recipient or the family.The ministry said that Covishield continues to have a definite positive benefit risk profile with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths due to COVID-19 across the world and in India.Over 13.4 crore doses of Covishield vaccine have been administered as on April 27 in India.The ministry is continuously monitoring the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines and is promoting reporting of suspected adverse events.

17-05-2021||Kolkata/New Delhi||Narada scam: West Bengal Governor gives sanction to prosecute 3 TMC MLAs, one other||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar gave his assent to CBI's request seeking sanction for prosecution of four political leaders, including three from the ruling TMC, in connection with the Narada sting case on May 7, two days after Mamata Banerjee was sworn in as chief minister for the third time, officials said on Monday.They said the CBI approached the governor's office seeking permission to prosecute Trinamool Congress MLAs Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee and Madan Mitra as well as former party leader Sovan Chatterjee in view of a 2004 Supreme Court judgement in which the top court had agreed that the governor could give sanction for prosecution.The officials said that the agency approached the governor's office as the four were ministers in the previous government at time of the Narada sting case in which politicians were purportedly caught taking money on camera.They said that since the governor administers the oath of office and secrecy to the ministers, his or her office is the sanctioning authority.The officials said the CBI would also cite a judgement of the Supreme Court in a case related to former Madhya Pradesh ministers Rajender Kumar Singh and Bisahu Ram Yadav in which sanction to prosecution was given by the then governor. A complaint was made to the Lokayukta against them for having released 7.5 acres of land illegally and they had challenged their prosecution in the apex court.The top court in its judgement had said: "If, on these facts and circumstances, the governor cannot act in his own discretion, there would be a complete breakdown of the rule of law in as much as it would then be open for governments to refuse sanction in spite of overwhelming material showing that a prima facie case is made out"."If, in cases where a prima facie case is clearly made out, sanction to prosecute high functionaries is refused or withheld, democracy itself will be at stake. It would then lead to a situation where people in power may break the law with impunity safe in the knowledge that they will not be prosecuted as the requisite sanction will not be granted." Hakim is the urban development minister in the present state government and Mukherjee holds the portfolio of panchayti raj and rural affairs. Mitra is an MLA and Chatterjee is an ex-MLA, who quit the TMC in 2019 to join the BJP but left the saffron party this year after he was not given a poll ticket.The officials said that all these leaders were arrested and chargesheeted in a crime that was allegedly committed in the previous tenure, and since all of them were ministers, the sanctioning authority was with the governor's office.The sting operation was conducted by Mathew Samuel of Narada TV news channel in 2014 wherein people resembling TMC ministers, MPs and MLAs were allegedly seen receiving "illegal gratification" from representatives of a fictitious company in lieu of favours, the CBI has alleged.The agency has alleged that Hakim was purportedly seen to have agreed to accept a bribe of Rs 5 lakh from the sting operator, while Mitra and Mukherjee were caught on camera receiving Rs 5 lakh each.Chatterjee was purportedly seen receiving Rs 4 lakh from the sting operator, it added. The tapes were made public just before the 2016 assembly elections in West Bengal.The Calcutta High Court had ordered a CBI probe into the sting operation on April 16, 2017. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narada-scam-west-bengal-governor-gives-sanction-to-prosecute-3-tmc-mlas-one-other-254169

17-05-2021|| Hyderabad||Covid positive Telangana youth spends 11 days on tree||An 18-year-old engineering student from Telangana’s Nalgonda has chosen to isolate himself on a tree to prevent himself from infecting his family with Covid-19.Ramawat Shiva Naik, who studies at a college in Hyderabad, has spent 11 days on a tree. near his home in  Kothanandikonda village in Adavidevulapally Mandal.Shiva supplements his family income by working as a porter in a paddy procurement centre, and that was where he contracted the virus, he says. His symptoms were mild, a doctor at a primary health centre some 5 km away told him, and he need only isolate himself at home.His home is small, with five people sharing one washroom, and self-isolation there was out of the question. His other option, going back to his hostel accommodation in Hyderabad was equally unviable because educational institutions are currently closed.“This was my only choice,” he says from his isolation spot atop the “Ganuga” (Pongamee) tree. His isolation centre is a makeshift cot made of bamboo sticks and ropes. He uses a bucket to pull up meals and other essentials that his parents bring to him.Shiva keeps in touch with family and friends through his mobile phone, which also proved useful to kill the time. He sent a few messages calling on local authorities to set up an isolation centre in the area. Responding to his appeal and growing requests from people in his village and about a dozen other villages, the authorities set up an isolation centre late last week. They converted a hostel meant for students belonging to Scheduled Tribes into an isolation centre. They also persuaded Shiva to move to the centre. He will soon be completing his isolation period.Shiva's incident highlighted the problems faced by Covid infected in villages. Living in small houses with no or single washroom, they can't isolate themselves.In some instances, last year and also during the ongoing second wave, individuals who test positive were not allowed to enter into villages.

In the 'egg, meat and fish' basket inflation was 10.88 per cent in April.Inflation in pulses was 10.74 per cent in April, while in fruits it was 27.43 per cent.Inflation in the fuel and power basket was 20.94 per cent in April, while in manufactured products it was 9.01 per cent.Retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), eased to 4.29 per cent in April on the decline in food prices, data released last week showed.Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das had earlier this month said that manufacturing and services PMIs along with rising WPI inflation show persistence of input price pressure.Also, the build-up in input price pressures across sectors, driven in part by elevated global commodity prices, remains a concern."The inflation trajectory over the rest of the year will be shaped by the COVID-19 infections and the impact of localised containment measures on supply chains and logistics," Das had said. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wpi-inflation-hits-double-digits-in-april-at-10-49-pc-crude-prices-harden-254150

17-05-2021||New Delhi||DRDO's 1st batch of anti-Covid drug 2DG launched||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Monday released the first batch of Anti-COVID drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).The drug has been developed by DRDO's Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) in collaboration with Dr Reddy's Laboratories. DRDO Chairman Dr G Satheesh Reddy said that DRDO and Dr Reddy's lab had gone through the complete trials and conducted trials across 30 hospitals and on a large number of patients. The first batch of 10,000 doses of 2DG medicine would be launched early next week, informed DRDO officials told ANI on Friday.The drug comes in powder form in a sachet, which is taken orally by dissolving it in water. It accumulates in the virus-infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. Its selective accumulation in virally infected cells makes this drug unique.In the ongoing second COVID-19 wave, a large number of patients are facing severe oxygen dependency and need hospitalisation. The drug is expected to save precious lives due to the mechanism of operation of the drug in infected cells. This also reduces the hospital stay of COVID-19 patients.

PTI AMRMany TMC activists were seen demonstrating outside the central agency’s office here and Raj Bhavan, prompting the police to push them back.The CBI, earlier in the day, apprehended state ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, MLA Madan Mitra and former party leader Sovan Chatterjee for their alleged involvement in the case.The agitators, waving TMC flags, raised slogans outside Raj Bhavan against Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who had recently sanctioned the prosecution of the four leaders.At the CBI’s Nizam Palace office, the TMC supporters broke barriers set up before the main gate and took to sloganeering against Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Some of them hurled stones and plastic bottles at the security personnel posted outside the agency office.In several other areas, including Arambagh in Hooghly district and Kamarhati in North 24 Parganas, the protesters burnt tyres and blocked roads, demanding immediate release of party leaders.TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, who is also the party’s youth wing president, urged the demonstrators to have faith in judiciary.“I urge everyone to abide by the law & refrain from any activity that violates lockdown norms for the sake of the larger interest of Bengal and its people,” the Diamond Harbour MP, who is also CM Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, tweeted.The party’s spokesperson, Kunal Ghosh, taking a dig at the BJP, said that “the daily passengers to Bengal, who were summarily rejected by the people of the state during elections, have hatched a conspiracy for backdoor entry, amid this pandemic-induced crisis”.Ghosh, too, urged the party supporters to exercise restraint, and not get swayed by emotions.He also sought to know why no action has been taken against Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari, two leaders who have quit the TMC to join BJP, given the fact that their names had also surfaced in the case.Rejecting the allegation, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said both Roy and Adhikari had “co-operated with the CBI investigation, unlike those who have been taken into custody”.He slammed the protesters for openly flouting the lockdown norms.“Instead of demonstrating on the streets, the party should seek a legal remedy,” he added.The sting operation was purportedly conducted by Mathew Samuel of Narada TV news channel in 2014 wherein people resembling TMC ministers, MPs and MLAs were allegedly seen receiving money from representatives of a fictitious company in lieu of favours.The tapes were made public just before the 2016 assembly elections in West Bengal.The Calcutta High Court had ordered a CBI probe into the sting operation in March 2017.

According to the cyclone warning division of the IMD, by May 18 the wind speed is expected to increase to 150-160 km per hour, gusting up to 175 km per hour.An estimated 1.5 lakh persons are being shifted from low-lying coastal areas in Gujarat, while 54 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been deployed in the state.Maharashtra too was bracing for the storm as the Met Department predicted heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places in north Konkan, Mumbai, Thane and Palghar and extremely heavy rainfall in Raigad on Monday.The water level in many dams across Kerala was rising after heavy rains in the catchment areas, prompting authorities to sound an alert.Four deaths were reported from Karnataka’s Uttara Kannada, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts and two in Goa in cyclone-related incidents.The cyclone, which is the first this year, has added to the woes of the states which are already grappling with the devastating second wave of Covid.Gusty winds and heavy rains started lashing several parts of Goa since Saturday night disrupting power supply in a large part of the state.Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said the major impact of the cyclonic winds was felt in Bardez taluka in North Goa district and Mormugao in South Goa.He said there was power disruption for some time at the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment, but it did not affect the functioning.“Hundreds of houses suffered major damage due to the cyclonic winds. Some highways were blocked at several points after trees got uprooted. However, the roads were cleared by the disaster management teams,” Sawant said.The power supply was disrupted as electric poles were uprooted due to the high-speed winds, state Power Minister Nilesh Cabral said.“Many high-tension 33 kV feeders are down due to the falling of trees. Even the 220 kV lines bringing power to Goa from neighbouring Maharashtra have been damaged,” he said.The electricity department deployed its full force for the restoration work, but it was getting hampered due to the strong winds, he said.In Karnataka, 98 villages in seven districts including Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Hassan have been affected by the cyclone, the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority officials said.The highest rainfall of 385 mm was recorded at Nada Station in Kundapura taluk of Udupi. Officials said damage to over 200 houses, 491 poles and other infrastructure in coastal areas has been reported.The IMD said Tauktae would cross Gujarat’s coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district by early Tuesday morning and tidal waves are likely to inundate several coastal districts during the landfall. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tauktae-intensifies-98-villages-hit-in-karnataka-253967

No difference in neutralisation between B117 and vaccine strain D614G (the Wuhan strain) was observed”.Suchitra Ella, managing director of Bharat Biotech, the makers of Covaxin, today hailed the development, saying, “Covaxin gets international recognition yet again by scientific research data demonstrating protection against the new variants. Another feather in its cap.”The ICMR earlier showed that only two to four persons in every 10,000 inoculated with Covaxin and Covishield reported breakthrough infections.“The narrative on breakthrough infections is quite distant from reality. The incidence in India is very low. Even if Covid infection occurs after the first and the second dose of the vaccine, it does not cause severe disease,” ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said.An ICMR study on 93,56,436 people who received the first dose of Covaxin has shown that 4,208 (0.04 pc) had breakthrough infection. The proportion was the same for those who received the second dose of Covaxin (of 17,37,178 who received the second dose, 695 were infected with Covid).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-works-against-all-emerging-variants-study-253969

In nine hikes, petrol price has risen by Rs 2.19 per litre and diesel by Rs 2.49.The increase led to rates in Delhi climbing to Rs 92.58 per litre and diesel to Rs 83.22, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.The rates had already crossed Rs 100-mark in several cities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra and with the latest increase, price in Mumbai too was inching towards that level. A litre of petrol in Mumbai now comes for Rs 98.88 and diesel is priced at Rs 90.40 per litre.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan had the costliest petrol and diesel in the country at Rs 103.52 per litre and Rs 95.99 a litre, respectively. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fuel-prices-hiked-again-ninth-time-since-may-4-253971

Cairn plans to move courts in the US to Singapore for seizure of the assets in absence of Indian government’s refusal to honour an international arbitration award.“The Indian government naturally will challenge such seizure but to save the assets it may have to pawn money equivalent to the value of assets in some financial security such as bank guarantee. The court will return such a guarantee to India if it does not find merit in Cairn’s case. But the surety will be passed on to Cairn if the court finds that India had failed to honour its obligation,” a source said.Cairn has got an international arbitration award, which overturned levy of retrospective taxes and ordered New Delhi to return the value of shares it had sold, dividends seized and tax refunds withheld to recover such taxes, registered in the US, UK, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, Mauritius, Canada’s Quebec province, Japan and UAE.Now, it has started moving courts to get a declaration that state-owned entities are alter egos of India and they should be held liable for discharge of the arbitration award in absence of the government making payments.Cairn on May 14 filed a lawsuit in a New York court to get Air India recognised as the alter ego of India and that “it should be held jointly and severally responsible for India’s debts, including from any judgment resulting from recognition of the award”.Once a court recognises Air India as the alter ego of the Indian government, Cairn can seek attachment or seizure of its assets in the US such as airplanes, immovable assets and bank accounts to recover the amount it was awarded by the arbitration tribunal. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uks-cairn-energy-identifies-70-bn-indian-assets-abroad-to-recover-dues-253974

But, in view of the cyclonic storm, some patients from Mumbai and other areas have been shifted to safer places.The IMD said Tauktae would cross Gujarat's coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district by early Tuesday morning and tidal waves are likely to inundate several coastal districts during the landfall."The very severe cyclonic storm Tauktae over the east-central Arabian Sea moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 11 kmph during the past six hours," it said."It is very likely to intensify during the next 24 hours. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach the Gujarat coast in the evening hours of May 17 and cross the state coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district around May 18 early morning," the IMD said.With the cyclone intensifying, the wind speed along and off Gujarat coasts in Porbandar, Junagadh, Gir Somnath and Amreli districts will reach 150-160 kmph gusting to 175 kmph by Tuesday morning.It will reach a speed of 120-150 kmph gusting to 165 kmph over Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar districts during the same period, the IMD said."Gale winds with speed reaching 70-80 kmph gusting to 90 kmph are likely to prevail along and off Valsad, Navsari, Surat, Bharuch, southern parts of Ahmedabad, and Anand districts, as well as Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman (Union Territories) from May 17 midnight till Tuesday morning," it said.The sea conditions will become "very rough to high" along and off the south Gujarat coast from Monday morning, and "very high to phenomenal" from Monday midnight.A tidal wave of about 3 metres, 1-2.5 metres above the astronomical tide, is likely to inundate several coastal areas of the state during the time of the landfall, it said.Heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated places was likely over Saurashtra and Kutch and Diu on Monday, and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places on Tuesday, according to IMD.Fishermen have been warned not to venture into the sea, the state government said, adding that 107 out of the 149 fishing boats which were out into the waters returned to the coast by Sunday morning."With the cyclone likely to affect power supply, hospitals treating COVID-19 patients have been asked to ensure power back-up. Arrangements have also been made to ensure uninterrupted generation of medical oxygen in the eight manufacturing units and buffer stock has also been created," Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told reporters after attending a cyclone review meeting in Gandhingar. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-tauktae-intensifies-after-ploughing-through-coastal-kerala-karnataka-goa-6-dead-gujarat-braces-for-impact-253671

States with negative balance are showing more consumption (including wastage) than vaccine supplied as they have not reconciled the vaccine they have supplied to Armed Forces," the ministry said.     It said 50,95,640 vaccine doses are in the pipeline  and will be received by states and UTs within the next three days.Vaccination forms an integral component of the comprehensive strategy of Government of India of containment and management of the pandemic (including Test, Track, Treat and Covid Appropriate Behaviour).   The Centre has been supporting the nationwide vaccination drive by providing Covid vaccines free of cost to states and UTs, in addition to several efforts to ramp up its production and supply, the ministry stated.  Implementation of the Liberalized and Accelerated Phase 3 Strategy of COVID-19 Vaccination has started from May 1 as part of which the government has opened up inoculation for all aged above 18. Under the Strategy, every month 50 per cent of the total Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) cleared vaccine doses of any manufacturer would be procured by the Centre. It would continue to make these doses available to state governments free of cost as it was being done earlier. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-to-receive-nearly-51-lakh-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-next-three-days-centre-253708
17-05-2021||Shahjahanpur (UP)||Cylinder waali bitiya: Shahjahanpur's daughter who helps everyone with oxygen||Breathing hope into the lives of people in need of oxygen amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, 26-year-old Arshi has earned the sobriquet of “cylinder waali bitiya”—the daughter with the oxygen cylinder. What began as a struggle to procure the life-saving gas for her coronavirus positive father, who managed to beat the viral disease, has now turned into a mission to save as many lives as possible in this district and those around it including the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand.Perched atop her trusted companion—a scooter—the young woman, a resident of Madaar Khel locality in Shahjahanpur, has so far distributed around 20 oxygen cylinders for free and is helped by her two brothers and some other associates. Recalling the beginning of her philanthropic journey, Arshi said on the first day of Ramzan, the condition of her father Mashoor, who was not keeping well, began deteriorating, and her worst fears came true when he tested positive for COVID-19. While in home isolation, his oxygen levels started falling and the doctor asked me to arrange an oxygen cylinder. However, when I approached the authorities, I was told that patients in home isolation cannot get oxygen cylinders and was advised to get my father admitted to a hospital, according to Arshi. "Despite moving from pillar to post, I was not able to arrange a cylinder. As desperation grew, I somehow managed to get one from the office of the city magistrate,” Arshi told PTI. “I then came in contact with a social organisation based in Uttarakhand through WhatsApp which provided oxygen for my father, and he subsequently recovered from the illness," she added. After this incident, I realised what families of Covid patients needing oxygen must be going through, she said. "Ever since, anyone who sought oxygen either through phone or WhatsApp was helped. I have provided oxygen to several people in Shahbad and Hardoi (UP) and Uttarakhand," the 26-year-old said, adding that she does not charge any money. The young woman has received many laurels for her heroic actions not only from those whom she has helped but also the state's politicians. Shahjahanpur district president of Samajwadi Party Tanveer Khan said Arshi has embarked on a mission to provide oxygen cylinders to those who need it.  "Amidst the COVID-19, Arshi is doing a historic work, without caring for her own life," Khan told PTI. Showering praises on Arshi, local resident Syed Naved said the woman provided him with three oxygen cylinders for his COVID-19 positive father.  "May Allah fulfil all her wishes," he said. Meanwhile, Shahjahanpur Chief Medical Officer S P Gautam said there was no shortage of oxygen in the district and stressed that the life-saving gas was being provided to COVID-19 patients who are in home isolation. "There is no shortage of oxygen in the district, and oxygen is available in the hospitals. Apart from this, people who are COVID-19 infected and are in home isolation, oxygen cylinders are being provided to them by the city magistrate," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cylinder-waali-bitiya-shahjahanpurs-daughter-who-helps-everyone-with-oxygen-253714
17-05-2021||New Delhi||Govt issues guidelines on Covid management in rural, peri-urban areas||As rural areas see a rise in COVID-19 cases, the Centre on Sunday issued new guidelines for containment of the virus advising that peri-urban and rural areas plan a minimum 30-bedded COVID Care Centre for asymptomatic cases with comorbidities or mild cases where home isolation is not feasible.Provision of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits should be made at all public health facilities including Sub-centres or Health and Wellness Centres and Primary Health Centres, the Union Health Ministry said.Noting that besides urban areas reporting a large number of cases, a gradual ingress is now being seen in peri-urban, rural and tribal areas as well, the ministry released the 'SOP on COVID-19 Containment and Management in Peri-urban, Rural & Tribal areas'  to enable communities to strengthen primary level healthcare infrastructure at all levels to intensify COVID-19 response.It said COVID Care Centres (CCC) can admit a suspect or confirmed case but should have separate areas for suspected and confirmed cases with preferably separate entry and exit for each. "Suspect and confirmed cases should not be allowed to mix under any circumstances," the SOP said.According to the SOP, in every village, active surveillance should be done for influenza-like illness/ severe acute respiratory infections(ILI/SARI) periodically by ASHA with help of Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC).Symptomatic cases can be triaged at the village level by teleconsultation with Community Health Officer (CHO), and cases with comorbidity or low oxygen saturation should be sent to higher centres. Identified suspected COVID cases should link for testing to health facilities either through COVID-19 rapid antigen testing or by referral of samples to nearest COVID-19 testing laboratory, in accordance with ICMR guidelines.CHOs and ANMs should be trained in performing Rapid Antigen Testing. Provision of RAT kits should be made at all public health facilities including Sub-centres, Health and Wellness Centres and Primary Health Centres, the document said.Depending upon the intensity of surge and the number of cases, as far as feasible, contact tracing should be done as per Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme's (IDSP's) guidelines, it stated."Nearly 80-85 per cent COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic/ mildly symptomatic. These patients do not require hospitalisation and may be managed at home or in Covid care isolation facilities," the SOP stated.   As monitoring of oxygen saturation is important for the monitoring of COVID patients, it is desirable for each village to have an adequate number of pulse oximeters and thermometers. The SOP recommended developing a system of providing pulse oximeters and thermometers on loan to families with a confirmed case of COVID through ASHA/ Anganwadi workers and village-level volunteers. Pulse oximeters and thermometers should be sanitised after each use with cotton or cloth soaked in alcohol-based sanitiser.Follow-ups for patients undergoing isolation or quarantine could be done through household visits by a frontline worker/ volunteers/ teacher duly following required infection prevention practices including use of a medical mask and other appropriate precautions. "Home Isolation kit shall be provided to all such cases which should include required medicines such as Paracetamol 500 mg, Tab. Ivermectin, cough syrup, multivitamins (as prescribed by the treating doctor) besides a detailed pamphlet indicating precautions to be taken, medication details, monitoring proforma for the patient condition during home isolation, contact details in case of any major symptoms or deterioration of health condition and the discharge criteria," the SOP stated.The health infrastructure planned for peri-urban, rural and tribal areas shall be aligned to the already mentioned 3-tier structure -- COVID Care Centre (CCC) to manage mild or asymptomatic cases, Dedicated COVID Health Centre (DCHC) to manage moderate cases and Dedicated COVID Hospital (DCH) to manage severe cases, according to the document.   The CCCs are makeshift facilities under the supervision of the nearest PHC/CHC and may be set up in schools, community halls, marriage halls, panchayat buildings in close proximity of hospitals or healthcare facilities, or tentage facilities in panchayat land, school ground, etc. These CCCs should be mapped to one or more Dedicated COVID Health Centres and at least one Dedicated COVID Hospital for referral purposes. Such COVID care centres should also have a Basic Life Support Ambulance (BLSA) networked among such CCCs equipped with sufficient oxygen support on a 24x7 basis, for ensuring safe transport of patients to dedicated higher facilities if the symptoms progress from mild to moderate or severe. Primary Health Centres or Community Health Centres and Sub District Hospitals in these areas shall be the Dedicated COVID Health Centre for management of COVID-19. The facility may plan a minimum of 30 bedded DCHC. The district should be prepared to increase DCHC beds as per the case trajectory and expected surge of cases, the document stated.These centres shall offer care for all cases that have been clinically assigned as moderate (Patient breathless; Respiratory Rate more than 24 per minute; Saturation between 90 to <94% on room air).  District hospitals or other identified private hospitals or a block of these hospitals shall be converted as dedicated COVID Hospitals. In addition, sub-district or block level hospitals fulfilling the requirements may also be designated as dedicated COVID hospitals for the identified CCC and DHCC in their catchment area. The up-gradation in health facilities shall be undertaken based on case trajectory or the surge in cases, the SOP stated.

17-05-2021||New Delhi||AAP owns up to pasting posters critical of PM Modi and vaccination drive||The AAP on Sunday owned up to putting up posters in many parts of the city criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the shortage of Covid-19 vaccine, and said its several workers were arrested and hundreds were being “harassed” by Delhi Police.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said the police action will not deter the party and it will put up similar posters across the city and the country on a campaign mode.“The AAP is behind these posters. I am behind the posters. Arrest me and our MLAs but do not harass poor people who paste posters for a meagre payment,” Pathak said in a press conference.The Delhi Police have registered 25 FIRs and arrested as many people for allegedly pasting the posters, reading “Modiji humare bachhon ki vaccine videsh kyun bhej diya (PM why did you send vaccines meant for our children to foreign countries)”, in several parts of the city amid the coronavirus-induced lockdown.The FIRs were registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and other relevant sections, including section 3 of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, across various districts of the Delhi Police, officials had said.Pathak said the people in the whole country were asking the same question why the prime minister and the BJP government exported crores of vaccine doses to 94 countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, which could have helped save thousands of lives in India.“People are dying across the country due to COVID and there is no space in crematoriums and corpses are being seen floating in the rivers. These lives could have been saved if vaccines were not exported,” he claimed.There is a severe vaccine shortage in the country and people spend hours looking for vaccine slots on their computers. The youth and the elderly are running from pillar to post for vaccines but it is not available, he claimed further.“Delhi Police under the central government is registering FIRs and arresting people when they are questioning why vaccines meant for them and their children were given to other countries by the Prime Minister and the BJP government,” he said.Several AAP workers from Mongolpuri, Ghonda, Karawal Nagar, Rithala and other parts of the city have been arrested. Also nearly 500 volunteers are being “harassed” by making them sit for hours at various police stations in this connection, he charged.Delhi is facing vaccine shortage, with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and other AAP leaders blaming the BJP-ruled Centre for exporting the doses abroad for “image management”.“Who sold vaccines meant for our children to other countries for event management?” Sisodia tweeted on Sunday.Earlier on the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that his government has written to the central government and two manufacturers but there was no indication of vaccine supply as yet.
