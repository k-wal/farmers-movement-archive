22-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi govt likely to extend lockdown by another week||The Delhi government is likely to extend the ongoing lockdown by another week, although the Covid situation is improving in the city with less number of cases and declining positivity rate in the past few days, official sources said on Saturday.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had first imposed a lockdown on April 19 which was later extended multiple times, lastly on May 16.In the last 24 hours, around 2,200 cases were reported in the city and the positivity rate too declined to 3.5 per cent, Kejriwal said in an online briefing earlier in the day.“But this does not mean the threat of coronavirus has been averted. We have to take all the steps to safeguard against coronavirus,” he said.The chief minister had said on Friday that he would have a discussion with the Lt governor and share the decision taken in the meeting, when asked by reporters about any relaxation in lockdown in view of the improving situation.“The ongoing second wave has been very fatal and there are little chances that lockdown will be relaxed. It is highly likely that another weeklong extension will be announced by the government,” the sources said.Community platform LocalCircles conducted a survey in which 68 per cent respondents from Delhi favoured a weeklong extension of the lockdown, said founder of LocalCircles Sachin Tapadia.The percentage of respondents favouring lockdown extension was 85 per cent in the last two weeks, he said.Brijesh Goyal, the chairman of Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI), said the opinion of traders was divided over extension of the lockdown as revealed in a survey conducted by it.“Fifty per cent traders of Delhi are in favour of extending the lockdown for another one week and the remaining 50 per cent supported opening the city,” he said.Goyal said the survey also revealed that 85 per cent of factory owners were in favour of opening up all types of industrial activities shut due to the lockdown.

22-05-2021||Raipur||Chhattisgarh: BJP, Congress clash over CM's photo on Covid-19 vaccine certificates||The BJP and Congress were on Saturday engaged in a war of words in Chhattisgarh over the use of Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel's photograph in digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates being issued to people in the 18-44 age group.While the BJP criticised the move and called it cheap publicity, the Congress said there was nothing wrong in it as the cost of vaccination for this segment in the state was being borne by the Baghel government. The state government, on May 12, launched its portal 'CG Teeka' for registration of vaccine beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group, and those who have registered and have got vaccinated are being given digital certificates with a photograph of Baghel. "When the state government is bearing the cost of vaccination of people in the 18-44 years category, then it is no longer the Centre's programme. When it has become a state programme, then there should be no objection in having the photo of the state's chief minister on certificates,” state's Health Minister TS Singh Deo told reporters. "The Centre is funding vaccination of people above 45 years of age and certificates issued in this category through the CoWIN portal bears the photograph of the prime minister," he added. However, BJP MLA and former minister Brijmohan Agrawal said: “The Chhattisgarh government is focusing more on photo publicity instead of vaccinating youths. The application which they have launched has crashed”. The entire country is using the Centre's app, which is working well, but just for this photo gimmick, the Baghel government has launched its own app here, he added. "It is also to be seen whether the certificates issued by the state government will be eligible for travel abroad," the BJP leader said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chhattisgarh-bjp-congress-clash-over-cms-photo-on-covid-19-vaccine-certificates-256878

What is being attributed against him is false and nugatory," said the statement signed by Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust General Secretary Acharya Balakrishna.The controversial remarks in question came from an undated video that showed Ramdev addressing an assembly. Ramdev can be heard saying clearly: “I am going to say something huge. It’s possible I’d be criticised for this. Lakhs of people died because of allopathy. There were more deaths caused by allopathy than those caused by people not getting to hospitals or getting oxygen”.READ IMA 'shocked' over Patanjali's claim on Coronil, demands explanation from Health Minister Harsh VardhanThe remarks drew the ire of healthcare professionals across the country. The Indian Medical Association condemned the remarks as unscientific and asked the central government to take action against him.Ramdev should be prosecuted under the Epidemic Diseases Act as "untutored" statements are "a threat to the literate society of the country as well as to the poor people falling prey to him", the apex doctors' body said in a statement.IMA quoted Ramdev as saying in the video that "allopathy ek aisi stupid aur diwalilya science hai… (allopathy is such a stupid science)".He also says that "lakhs of people have died after taking allopathic medicines", the association said, adding that Ramdev claimed Remdesivir, Faviflu, and all other drugs, which were approved by the Drugs Controller General of India, have failed in treatment of COVID-19 patients."The Union health minister (Harsh Vardhan) who himself is a practicing modern medicine allopathic postgraduate and head of this (health) ministry, should either accept the challenge and accusation of this gentleman and dissolve the modern medical facility or boldly face and prosecute the person for his words of arson on the sovereignty of the country and book him under the Epidemic Act to save millions of people from such unscientific utterances," the IMA said.Yoga guru claiming Allopathy as stupid science. This pandemic brings new shock every day. pic.twitter.com/1W9ojVOIGY  It alleged that Ramdev is trying to take advantage of the situation and create a sense of fear and frustration among the people at large.He is doing this "so that he can sell his illegal and unapproved so-called medicines and make money at the cost of the public at large", the association said.The IMA said Ramdev deserves to be prosecuted for disobeying and causing danger to the life of many by making them believe in “not to take the advice of allopathy” doctors."The IMA demands and resolves if the minister (Harsh Vardhan) is not taking suo moto action we will be forced to resort to democratic means of struggle to propagate the truth to the common man and knock the doors of the judiciary to get due to justice,” it said.Taking people for ransom and winning business by defaming scientific medicine are unpardonable offences, the IMA said.Citing Ramdev's remarks, it said such "untutored and unlearned" statements are a threat to society. Ramdev’s Patanjali has been marketing its own herbal medicine called 'Coronil' against Covid-19. The medicine has been mired in controversy since the start, with IMA asking for a clarification from the Health Ministry in February this year over the company’s alleged claims that the medicine has the World Health Organization’s certification of effectiveness. WHO denied this, forcing the company to issue a clarification.  This came after a controversy last year forced the health ministry to say that the Patanjali Trust could only market the medicine 'Coronil' as one for immune-boosting and not for Covid therapy.READ Nod to Patanjali’s Coronil, not a drug for CovidRamdev himself previously courted controversy over his video mocking Covid victims dying of oxygen shortage last month.

While former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said he was surprised to know that Thackeray was making political comments during his “merely three-hour long” tour of Konkan, Leader of Opposition in Legislative Council Pravin Darekar sought to know how the CM could understand in just three hours the extent of damage caused by the cyclone.When asked about the BJP's criticism, Thackeray said on Friday, "It's okay if my tour lasted four hours. At least I am on the ground taking stock of the situation and not in a helicopter for a photo session…I am a photographer myself.”  “I have not come here to respond to opposition's criticism," he said at Malvan in Sindhudurg.Cyclone Tautkae, which made landfall in Gujarat on Monday night, also affected several other states along the west coast, including Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka.

But it only received 16 lakh doses in May and the Centre has further decreased Delhi’s quota in June to 8 lakh doses, Kejriwal said.So far 50 lakh people have been vaccinated in Delhi. Further, 2.5 crore more doses are required to vaccinate all adults in Delhi, he said.“With this speed of 8 lakh doses per month, it will take 30 months to vaccinate all the adults alone. By then, no one knows how many waves will arrive and how many deaths will occur,” Kejriwal said, urging the prime minister to raise the quota and supply to the city immediately.The chief minister extended four suggestions to the central government to enhance vaccine availability in the country.The central government should within 24 hours direct all capable companies in the country to start manufacturing Covaxin as Bharat Biotech has agreed to share its formula, he said.Vaccines manufactured abroad should be used in India and the Centre needs to procure vaccines on the behalf of states as it will be more effective in bulk procurement, Kejriwal said.Foreign companies should be allowed to manufacture vaccines in India and the Centre should try to get vaccines from such countries that have stocks of more doses than their need, he suggested.Vaccination of maximum number of people in the shortest time is the only way to save Delhi and the country from the third wave of coronavirus, Kejriwal asserted.“We are arranging beds, oxygen and medicines, but vaccine is the most effective weapon of protection against the fatal virus.”    Shortage of vaccine is not just a matter of worry for the governments, common people are also scared due to this crisis, he claimed.Shortage of vaccine has caused a very difficult situation in the country, Kejriwal said and narrated a call he had received from an elderly mother who requested vaccine for his son foregoing the jab herself saying he needed it more than her because he had a job to take care of the family.“I was deeply pained hearing this. There could be nothing more painful than this ‘dharmsankat’ (dilemma) before a father, mother, brother or sister—whether to have the vaccine or give it up for a younger member in the family,” he said.Kejriwal said it was a matter of relief that that the speed of coronavirus spread has significantly slowed down in Delhi but cautioned that it did not mean the threat was averted and emphasised on maintaining all the precautions.In the past 24 hours, around 2,200 cases were reported and the positivity rate is 3.5 per cent, he said.

22-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: Education Ministry calls crucial meet Sunday on Class 12 board exams||The Ministry of Education (MOE) has called a crucial meeting on Sunday to decide on pending Class 12 board exams that were postponed in view of the second wave of Covid-19, Union minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' said.The meeting will be chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Union Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani and Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar will be in attendance.Education ministers and secretaries of all states and union territories have been asked to attend the meeting. Pokhriyal also sought inputs from all the stakeholders—students, parents, teachers and others—through social media on Saturday."A high-level virtual meeting will be convened tomorrow (Sunday) with all states and union territories' education ministers, education secretaries and chairpersons of state examination boards and stakeholders to discuss the proposals for the conduct of exams for Class 12 and entrance examinations for professional courses," Nishank said."I recently held a meeting with the state education secretaries in this regard.  The consultative process will be further strengthened through the high-level meeting. This virtual meeting will take place at 11.30 am," he added. In a letter to the states and UTs, the education minister has said that his ministry's Department of School Education and the CBSE were exploring options regarding the conduct of the examinations, keeping in mind the safety and security of both students and teachers."The Department of Higher Education is also deliberating upon the finalization of the dates of examinations for institutions of higher learning. Covid-19 pandemic has affected various areas including the education sector, particularly the board exams and entrance exams," the letter noted.In view of the prevailing situation, almost all state education boards, the CBSE and the ICSE have postponed their Class 12 examinations. Similarly, the National Testing Agency (NTA) and other national exam conducting institutions have also postponed entrance exams for admissions to professional courses."As the conduct of Class 12 examinations impacts upon state board exams and other entrance exams across the country, and to reduce uncertainty among students, it is desirable that a considered decision based on inputs of different state governments and UT administrations is taken about Class 12 examinations in the interest of all the students across the country," the letter said.  The CBSE had on April 14 announced cancellation of Class 10 exams and postponed Class 12 exams in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases.The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The exams, which are usually conducted in February-March every year, were scheduled to be held from May 4.The CBSE had announced that a decision on the Class 12 board exams will be taken on or after June 1. A section of students and parents have been demanding that the Class 12 exams be cancelled in view of the pandemic situation.The CBSE had earlier this month announced the marking policy for Class 10 board exams.According to the policy, while 20 marks for each subject will be for internal assessment as every year, 80 marks will be calculated on the basis of the students' performance in various tests or exams throughout the year.Schools across the country were closed in March last year to contain the spread of Covid-19 ahead of a nationwide lockdown.Several states started reopening the schools partially from October last year, but physical classes were again suspended because of the rise in coronavirus cases.Last year, the board exams had to be postponed mid-way in March. They were later cancelled, and results were announced based on an alternative assessment scheme. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-education-ministry-calls-crucial-meet-sunday-on-class-12-board-exams-256818

Water bodies perform important ecological functions. Not only do they add to the aesthetics, they help in water conservation, sustaining aquatic life and maintaining microclimate. Clean environment being part of right to life and also being part of Directive Principles of State policy, the State authorities have the duty to protect the same," the NGT said.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by NGO Udankaar against failure of the public authorities in performing their obligation under public trust doctrine to protect an important water body in Delhi, known as Bhalswa lake, against pollution and encroachment.The plea alleged that pollution is being discharged in the lake in the form of solid waste as well as sewage and the boundary wall around the lake has been demolished."This has resulted in deterioration and contamination of water. Ownership of the water body is vested in the DDA. It is to be maintained by the Delhi Tourism and Transport Development Corporation. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation is to prevent dumping of waste. The DPCC and CPCB are to enforce the environmental norms," the plea said.Bhalswa is one of the largest water bodies in Delhi and is spread over an area of 150 acres.The only source of water in the water body is rainfall, and it acts as a recharge basin during rainy season. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ngt-directs-delhi-chief-secretary-to-take-measures-to-protect-bhalswa-lake-256815

A team of the Assam Police is also present there and doing the formalities to bring him back home by today evening," he added.The released ONGC staffer looks hale and hearty, a medical check-up will be done before dropping him at his home in Titabar of Jorhat district in Assam, the senior police official said.Following the release, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that he hopes an era of peace and development is firmly established in the state with the cooperation of one and all."Heartily welcome release of Ritul Saikia, ONGC employee abducted by ULFA, early today! Grateful to Honble UHM @AmitShah (Union Home Minister Amit Shah) for constant guidance. Hope an era of peace & development is firmly established in state with cooperation of one and all. Pray to Almighty for His Blessings," Sarma tweeted.Three employees of the Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) were on April 21 kidnapped by ULFA(I) militants from the Lakwa oilfield in Sivasagar district along the Assam-Nagaland border.Two employees, Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Alakesh Saikia, were rescued on April 24 after an encounter near the India- Myanmar border in the Mon district of Nagaland, while the search for Saikia was on.Hours after Sarma visited Saikia's home on May 18 and assured his wife and parents about the government's effort to bring him back, ULFA(I) chief Paresh Barua confirmed the custody of the kidnapped person.On May 20, Sarma in a press conference appealed to Barua to release the kidnapped ONGC employee and said the Assam government will pressure the oil companies to invest more for the progress of the state.While the official press conference was underway, Barua made phone calls to local TV channels and announced to release Saikia in less than seven days.In the calls, Barua praised Sarma and said Assam never had such a "dynamic" chief minister for decades.The chief minister, on the other side, welcomed the three-month unilateral ceasefire declared by the ULFA(I) and urged Barua to come to the discussion table.In the first week of April, two employees of the Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure were released by ULFA(I) after three-and-half months of their kidnap on December 21 last year.The duo was kidnapped from Kumchaikha hydrocarbon drilling site in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh with a demand for a ransom of Rs 20 crore.

The ship, since its commissioning, sailed a distance of over 7,87,194 nautical miles which is equivalent to navigating around the world 36.5 times and 3.8 times the distance from Earth to Moon," he said in a statement.Besides BrahMos, the warship was equipped with an array of weapons and sensors including anti-aircraft guns, torpedoes, and anti-submarine rocket launchers.The ship participated in several key missions in the last four decades, including operation Aman off Sri Lanka that was launched to assist the Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF) and Operation Cactus to resolve a hostage situation off the Maldives.#IndianNavy’s first Kashin-Class destroyer #INSRajput was decommissioned today after serving the nation for 41 glorious years at #Visakhapatnam in a solemn ceremony. @DefenceMinIndia @SpokespersonMoD @indiannavy pic.twitter.com/azoOTUoNfs  In addition, the ship participated in numerous bilateral and multi-national exercises. It was also the first Indian Naval Ship to be affiliated with an Army regiment—the Rajput regiment.INS Rajput was constructed in the 61 Communards shipyard in Nikolaev (now Ukraine) under her original Russian name "Nadezhny", meaning "hope". The keel of the ship was laid on September 11, 1976, and she was launched on September 17, 1977.The ship was commissioned as INS Rajput at Poti, Georgia by I K Gujral, the then Indian Ambassador to the USSR, with Captain Gulab Mohanlal Hiranandani as her first commanding officer."The ship was decommissioned in a solemn and low-key event due to the coronavirus pandemic when the national flag, naval ensign, and the decommissioning pennant were lowered at sunset time in the presence of Vice Admiral Ajendra Bahadur Singh, the flag officer commanding-in-chief eastern naval command," Commander Madhwal said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ins-rajput-decommissioned-after-41-years-of-service-256802

Yes, a man has requested Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to impose a ban on weddings in the state keeping the coronavirus situation in mind. Pankaj Kumar Gupta’s tweet on one of the Chief Minister's post left the internet laughing. Within minutes, Pankaj's story went viral. Pankaj commented on the CM's post on May 13. The state’s health situation has improved considerably. Bihar reported 6,894 new cases and a 5.73 per cent positivity rate on May 16. In his post, the CM wrote that the lockdown throughout the state could be given credit for the declining number of cases.It was on this post that Pankaj replied in Hindi. सर अगर शादी-ब्याह पे भी रोक लगा देते तो मेरी girlfriend की शादी थी 19 मई को वह भी रुक जाती"आप का हम जीवन भर आभारी रहेंगे 🙏🙏Pankaj suggested that if the CM could impose a ban on weddings, then his girlfriend's wedding—which was scheduled to be held on May 19— would halt. He added that he would forever be grateful to the CM if he helps him out. What made things funnier were the Twitter reactions.  One user asked if Pankaj would marry his girlfriend if her wedding is cancelled.

22-05-2021||Washington||Covid crisis in India a warning of possible events in other low and middle income countries: IMF||Observing that the ongoing "catastrophic" second wave of Covid-19 in India is a sign that the worst may be yet to come, the IMF has said that the situation in the country is a warning of the possible events in low and middle income nations that have seemingly escaped the pandemic till now.A report co-authored by International Monetary Fund (IMF) economist Ruchir Agarwal and its Chief Economist Gita Gopinath on Friday also said that under the business-as-usual scenario, the vaccine coverage in India is expected to remain under 35 per cent of the population by the end of 2021.“The ongoing catastrophic second wave in India, following a terrible wave in Brazil, is a sign the worst may be yet to come in the developing world,” it said.While India's health system held up fairly well in the first wave, this time its health system is so overwhelmed that many people are dying because of a lack of medical supplies like oxygen, hospital beds, and medical care, the report said."India is a warning of possible events in other low and middle income countries (LMICs) that so far have seemingly escaped the pandemic, including in Africa,” it said.For India, the report said, current bilateral purchases of vaccine plus coverage from COVAX will cover about 25 per cent of its population by the first half of 2022.To get to 60 per cent coverage, India will need to immediately place sufficient vaccine orders of about 1 billion doses through contracts that incentivise investment in additional capacity and augmentation of the supply chain.“In this context, the authorities' recently announced financing of about USD 600 million to the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech to boost production capacity in the near term is a welcome step,” the report said, adding that authorities estimate that two billion doses will be available by the end of 2021.Efforts should be made to ensure that the projected production capacity will materialise without delay, including through securing the supply chain for raw materials—supported by international efforts to eliminate export restrictions on all critical inputs, it added.In its report, the IMF said that an urgent focus should be to eliminate constraints on cross-border exports of critical raw materials and finished vaccines. Free cross-border flow of vaccine inputs and supplies is essential for the world to achieve its vaccination targets without delay.Governments are taking steps to relax such constraints on raw materials, it said, citing the recent pledge by the US to facilitate greater access of critical raw material to Indian manufacturers after severe shortages emerged.However, there is scope for greater multilateral action on this front, as significant constraints still remain, it said.The IMF report said India continues to face production bottlenecks, including due to ongoing shortages of critical raw materials, suggesting the need for further relaxation of de facto export restrictions under the US Defence Production Act.Despite such near-term constraints, as of mid-May 2021, the authorities estimate that over two billion doses will be available by the end of the year based on company-level supply projections publicly shared by officials.“Therefore, while current pre-purchases of vaccines plus coverage from the COVAX AMC remains around 25 per cent, the authorities intend to meet the residual needs through the additional production,” it said.To reach a coverage of 60 per cent of the population, India will need to order roughly one billion doses of additional vaccines."Given the authorities are expected to comfortably use domestic resources for meeting these residual needs and are not seeking external financing for these purposes, we do not allocate additional funds for India in our budgeting exercise," the IMF said.Indian authorities are currently pursuing a strategy of procuring vaccines for those above 45 years of age by the central government while enabling states to procure vaccines for those aged 18-44.Given the current vaccine pricing offered by domestic suppliers, and the estimated size of the younger population in India, the additional funding needs for the centre for covering the 18-44 population is approximately 0.25 per cent of the GDP, suggesting that there is scope for the government to handle the entire procurement centrally, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-crisis-in-india-a-warning-of-possible-events-in-other-low-and-middle-income-countries-imf-256785

22-05-2021||Ottawa||Covid-19: Canada extends flight ban from India and Pakistan until June 21||Canada has extended the ban on direct flights from India and Pakistan by one more month until June 21 in a bid to arrest the spread of new variants of the Covid-19, according to an official announcement.The ban on flights from India and Pakistan was extended as the previous 30-day ban, first imposed on April 22, was set to expire on Saturday, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) News reported.Cargo flights, however, will be permitted in order to maintain shipments of essential supplies, such as vaccines and personal protective equipment, it said on Friday."The Minister of Transport is of the opinion that it is necessary for aviation safety and the protection of the public," according to a notice to airmen.As the ban applies to direct flights from both countries, passengers can still fly to Canada from India or Pakistan by arriving via a third country. They will need to produce a negative result on a Covid-19 test taken at their last point of departure before being allowed to enter Canada, according to the report.Transport Minister Omar Alghabra, at a government pandemic briefing, said that the restriction was put in place "based on public health advice to reduce the importation risk of Covid-19 and its variants." "I can say that we've seen a significant reduction in the number of positive cases of Covid-19 arriving from international flights since this restriction was put in place," he said.Alghabra said the government would continue adapting border restrictions as conditions change.Dr Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said that travel restrictions are important given that roughly 70 per cent of new coronavirus cases in Canada are variants of concern.Last week, Canada's flag carrier Air Canada proactively extended the flight ban from India in anticipation of the government's announcement. Air Canada does not fly to Pakistan.All travellers arriving in Canada by land or air have to show a negative Covid-19 test and quarantine for two weeks; some exceptions are made for essential workers.Air passengers must quarantine for up to three days at an approved hotel while awaiting Covid-19 test results, and must test again eight days after arrival.The B.1.617 variant, first identified in India, has been found in Canada as 279 air travellers tested positive for that variant between February 22 and May 6, the Public Health Agency of Canada said.India has been severely affected by the unprecedented second wave of the coronavirus and hospitals in several states are reeling under the shortage of health workers, vaccines, oxygen, drugs and beds.The daily rise in coronavirus cases in India remained below 300,000 for the fifth consecutive day with 2,57,299 new cases recorded in a single day, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Saturday.With a total of 2,57,299 fresh cases, India's total tally of Covid-19 cases climbed to 2,62,89,290. The death toll climbed to 2,95,525 with 4,194 fatalities. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-canada-extends-flight-ban-from-india-and-pakistan-until-june-21-256782

22-05-2021||New Delhi/New York||India, Pfizer at loggerheads over demand for vaccine indemnity||Pfizer and the Indian Government are at loggerheads over a demand by the US drug manufacturer for legal protection from any claims linked to the use of its Covid vaccine in one of the world’s biggest markets, two sources said.India has not given any manufacturer of a Covid vaccine indemnity against the costs of compensation for any severe side-effects, which is a condition Pfizer has obtained in many countries where its shots have already been widely rolled out, including Britain and the US.“The whole problem with Pfizer is the indemnity bond. Why should we sign it?” said an Indian Government source with direct knowledge of the matter. “If something happens, a patient dies, we will not be able to question them (Pfizer). If somebody challenges in a court of law, the Union Government will be responsible for everything, not the company,” the source added. Pfizer declined to comment, citing ongoing discussions with the government. The Union Health Ministry did not reply to requests for comment.The second source said Pfizer had been consistent in its position on indemnity and was not planning to change its approach for a deal with India.India, which is facing a shortage of shots as Covid cases soar, pledged last month to fast-track approvals for overseas vaccine makers, including Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.However, none have since sought permission from India’s drug regulator to sell their vaccine in the country.The second source said the other issue being discussed between Pfizer and New Delhi was the Indian Government’s insistence on a local trial for any vaccine approval. The source added that Pfizer could not finalise terms of a supply agreement, including indemnity, if the vaccine was not first authorised for use in India.Pfizer withdrew its application for emergency use authorisation for the vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech in February after India insisted on such a trial.But three other shots on sale in India, developed by AstraZeneca, Russia’s Sputnik V and Bharat Biotech in collaboration with state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, have completed the small-scale safety trials.Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chief executive, said on May 4 that he was hopeful that the government would change its policy of local trials and that a path to delivering the drugmaker’s shots in India could be found. — ReutersFresh cases 2.59 lakhActive cases: 30,27,925Deaths in 24 hrs 4,209Total deaths: 2,91,331Sticking pointsDRDO’s antibody kit outDRDO has developed a Covid antibody detection kit that offers results in 75 minutes.

In a two-city trip, Jaishankar will meet UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in New York.In Washington, he will hold discussions with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as well as meet Cabinet members and senior US administration officials dealing with the bilateral relationship, said an MEA news release. The External Affairs Minister will also have interaction with business forums on economic and Covid-related cooperation between India and the US .This will be Jaishankar’s first visit since the new administration took over. He had met Blinken earlier this month on the sidelines of the G-7 ministerial meeting in London where India was a special invitee.On Thursday, without revealing Jaishankar’s travel plans, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said India remained engaged with US entities on the prospects of procuring vaccines and also perhaps manufacturing them in India subsequently.The US has announced the export of 8 crore doses out of its vaccine stockpile. The vaccines have started going to Canada and Mexico, which were quicker than India in obtaining US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) clearance for product quality.Another hiccup is the Biden administration’s inability to reverse the Trump era’s restrictions on the export of vaccine raw materials by invoking the Defence Production Act. These are among the issues expected to form the crux of Jaishankar’s two interactions with business forums.Though the MEA spokesperson did not answer a question on the Quad initiative, it is learnt that Jaishankar will also be touching on the four-nation grouping’s plan for the production of 10 crore single shot vaccine of Johnson & Johnson in a manufacturing tie up with a Hyderabad-based company.Key bottlenecks||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/s-jaishankars-us-visit-from-may-24-vaccine-supply-on-agenda-256445

The recent shortage of medical oxygen led to industrial oxygen diversion to hospitals, but questions around its clean transport loomed.Government experts have attributed black fungus epidemic to a combination of Covid, diabetes and irrational steroid use that suppresses immunity.Ramakant Panda, another expert, claimed unhygienic delivery of oxygen to patients was the root cause. He said medical oxygen as opposed to industrial oxygen was highly purified. “It undergoes a range of processes such as compression, filtration and purification. Even its cylinders undergo disinfection and cleanliness processes,” he said, pointing to a possible role of unclean delivery of industrial oxygen for Covid treatment use as a probable reason for the black fungus surge.Meanwhile, the first study by Indian researchers on the spread of mucormycosis published today in international journal Elsevier found overall 101 cases of mucormycosis in Covid patients worldwide — 82 from India and 19 from the rest of the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/black-fungus-experts-flag-role-of-industrial-oxygen-256498

He was 94.Bahuguna breathed his last at the AIIMS in Rishikesh where he was admitted after testing positive for the virus. He had been critical since last night after his oxygen level dropped drastically.Born in Tehri (Uttarakhand) on January 9, 1927, the green crusader fought for the cause of environment throughout his life and inspired many to join his movement. Referred to as the gentle warrior, Bahuguna’s Chipko movement led to the enactment of a law banning the felling of trees in eco-sensitive forest belts. He started social activism quite early in life with movements against untouchability and later for liquor ban. He undertook several fasts to protest the construction of big dams, mainly Tehri project.Leading a life inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and concepts of non-violence and satyagraha, Bahuguna saw himself as a guardian of the ecology of the Himalayas.A winner of several prestigious awards, it is said he refused to accept Padma Shri in 1981 as the felling of trees was rampant in the Himalayas. He was awarded Padma Vibhushan, India’s second-highest civilian honour, for environment conservation in 2009.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the death a “monumental loss” for the nation. President Ram Nath Kovind said the demise marked the end of a glorious chapter in the field of conservation. Former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said Bahuguna’s 4,000-km foot march from Kashmir to Kohima in 1981-82 was a historic step towards green conservation. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/green-crusader-sunderlal-bahuguna-succumbs-to-covid-at-94-256511

Banerjee will have to get elected to the Assembly within six months. There will be no better seat for her than the Bhabanipur constituency.”Banerjee, who won from the Bhabanipur constituency in 2011 and 2016, contested from Nandigram in the 2021 Assembly elections accepting a challenge thrown at her by aide-turned-foe Suvendu Adhikari. After a close contest, Mamata finally lost the contest by a margin of 1,956 votes to Adhikari fighting on a BJP ticket.Chattopadhyay, who has been inducted into the Cabinet and given the agriculture portfolio by Banerjee, left his old Rasbehari constituency and contested from Bhabanipur at the party supremo’s instance. He won by a margin of 28,719 votes over his nearest BJP rival Rudranil Ghosh.The TMC ticket for Rashbehari seat was given to Debasish Kumar. He defeated BJP’s Lt Gen Subrata Saha (retd) by 21,414 votes.Besides Bhabanipur, which has fallen vacant following Chattopadhyay’s resignation, at least five more Assembly seats in the state are vacant. These include Samserganj and Jangipur seats in Murshidabad district where polling could not take place during the recent elections because of the demise of one candidate each from the two constituencies.In three seats, byelections will have to be held to fill the vacancies. Khardaha fell vacant after the victorious TMC candidate Kajal Sinha died of Covid. Vacancies have opened up for Dinhata and Shantipur constituencies after the victorious BJP candidates Nishith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar decided to quit the Assembly and retain their Lok Sabha membership.Mamata could have contested from any of the five vacant seats rather than getting Chattopadhyay to give up Bhabanipur for her.According to sources, having suffered defeat at Nandigram, Mamata wants to stick to her “old faithful” Bhabanipur constituency.Chattopadhyay may be given the ticket from one of the remaining five vacant seats, sources added.Post-poll violence: SC to hear PIL on exodusNew Delhi: The SC on Friday agreed to hear next week a plea seeking directions to the Centre and WB govt to prevent alleged exodus of people due to “state-sponsored” violence and constituting of a SIT to fairly probe and take appropriate action against culprits.

To prejudge the toolkit content as manipulative is interference with the law enforcement process,” government sources said in the communication to Twitter which cites its policy to label and tag posts as manipulative. The Congress on its part said the law would take its course.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drop-manipulated-tag-from-toolkit-tweets-centre-to-twitter-256583

22-05-2021||Beijing||China developing Tibetan border villages near Arunachal Pradesh, Bhutan, Nepal: White paper||China is ramping up efforts to develop the infrastructure in remote villages located along Tibet's border with India, Bhutan, and Nepal, according to a white paper on Tibet issued by the Chinese government on Friday.Developing the border areas and improving people's lives in Tibet has become important as the strategic Himalayan region shares 4,000-km long external borderline, the document titled 'Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity' said.The inhabitants of the contiguous areas experience harsh living and working conditions and a high incidence of poverty. Governments at all levels have been making constant efforts to develop border areas and improve people's lives, it said.The document said that under the guidance of the ruling Communist Party, the financial allocation has been increasing year by year for border development in Tibet.The development of China's border areas by establishing new villages with added emphasis on security has been accorded a priority since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) of which 1,126 km is located in Arunachal Pradesh. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet, which India has firmly rejected.China also shares an over 477-km-long border with Bhutan which is yet to be delineated and 1,389 kms of border with Nepal.The border village development was highlighted when President Xi wrote a letter to a Tibetan herdsman family in Lhunze County close to Arunachal Pradesh in 2017 asking them to “set down roots” to safeguard the “Chinese territory” and focus on developing their hometown."Without the peace in the territory, there will be no peaceful lives for the millions of families," Xi wrote in his much-publicised letter focussing on border development.Particularly since Xi came to power, border villages, townships, and counties in Tibet have been granted more preferential state policies on infrastructure construction, covering water, electricity, roads, and housing, it said.In 2017, the Plan of Tibet Autonomous Region on the Construction of Villages of Moderate Prosperity in Border Areas (2017-2020) was released, designed to ensure better access to housing, water, electricity, roads, communications and the internet, to improve education, technology, culture, healthcare and social security in border villages, and to boost industries in border areas.By the end of 2020, first-tier and second-tier border villages had access to highways, all border townships and towns were connected to the main power grid, and all border villages had access to postal services, mobile communications, and safe drinking water, it said.The Tibet Autonomous Region also has built a comprehensive transport network composed of highways, railways, air routes and pipelines since its peaceful liberation in 1951 it said.The region has built 118,800 km of highways over the decades, said the document.“Now, 94 per cent of towns and 76 per cent of administrative villages in the region have direct access to asphalt and concrete roads,” it said.Tibet last year has announced USD 2.09 billion plan to build three new airports and the expansion of the Lhasa Gonggar Airport.The three new airports will be built in Lhunze, Tingri and Burang counties.China has already built airports at Bamda in Qamdo, Mainling in Nyingchi, Xigaze, and in Ngari. Tibet now has 140 domestic and international air routes in operation, reaching 66 cities, the white paper said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-developing-tibetan-border-villages-near-arunachal-pradesh-bhutan-nepal-white-paper-256319
