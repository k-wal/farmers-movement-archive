19-05-2021||New Delhi||B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2 has sub-lineages; B.1.617.2 more infectious: Expert||The double mutant B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2 is further mutating and one of its sub-lineages, the B.1.617.2, reported in India, is more infectious than its parent and fast increasing its footprint, Rakesh Mishra, former Director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, said on Wednesday. He also said there is nothing called the “Singapore variant”, a term that has led to a war of words between the Centre and the AAP government after Singapore objected to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s tweet that a “new” coronavirus strain in the city-state is very dangerous for children.Singapore’s health ministry on Tuesday night said the strain that is prevalent in many of the COVID-19 cases in recent weeks is the B.1.617.2 variant, which was first detected in India.Amid criticism over Kejriwal’s Singapore COVID-19 variant remark, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday claimed there was a “different strain” of coronavirus spreading in that country.However, Mishra said B.1.617.2 has already been reported in India and is in the majority of the new cases in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.Mishra is part of the INSACOG, a consortium of 10 institutes of the Centre, that is involved in the genome sequencing of coronavirus.Explaining about the sub-lineage, Mishra told PTI, “B.1.617 was the mutant which was increasing in some part of the country like Maharashtra, West Bengal, Karnataka and now gradually it has led to three sub-lineages (B.1) 617.1, 617.2 and 617.3.“Among these three, B.1.617.2 is more infectious than B.1.617. That does not indicate a greater worry except the numbers are more and symptomatically. Otherwise, we have not seen any other difference. So this is now replacing others.” He said the same thing is being observed in the UK where B.1.617 was found and the sub-lineage has started to take over. This is the same thing we are seeing in Singapore. Most of the cases in Singapore are B.1.617 and a majority is B.1.617.2.“B.1.617.2 sub-lineage is majority in the new cases in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh,” Mishra said.“Gradually it is increasing its footprint and it will be a major one replacing other variants,” he added.  Another virologist, who did not want to be quoted, said the sub-lineage was first detected in India in December.     Sujeet Singh, the Director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said in a webinar in April that in Maharashtra, the B.1.617 variant was found in over 50 per cent of samples in many cities while the UK variant was found in 28 per cent of samples in the second week of March.B.1.617, termed as a double mutant, has three new spike protein mutations.Two mutations E484Q and L452R are in the area important for antibody-based neutralisation. The third mutation P681R in B.1.617 along with the reversion of E484Q allows its sub-lineage to be more infectious. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has termed it as ‘Variant of Concern’. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of the US, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.3 sub-lineages have two receptor binding domain mutations --- L452R and E484Q. The former has seven spike mutation while the latter has 7-8. In case of B.1.617.3, it has 9-10 spike mutations and two receptor binding domain mutations --- L452R and T478K. In case of all the three sub-lineage, it has the potential to reduced antibody efficacy and potentially reduced neutralisation by vaccine sera, which, however, remains to be established.

Her health condition was good. She walked into the hospital on May 17,” the daughter said.On the same day, she was sexually assaulted by three persons inside the hospital premises. My mother had informed me about the incident. Since then, her health deteriorated. I spoke to my relatives and the women’s wing of the Jan Adhikar Party (JAP), the victim’s daughter said.“The hospital administration in the meanwhile shifted her on to a ventilator and took my signature on a form. The doctors said that her health had deteriorated and if she was not shifted on to a ventilator, it would be life threatening for her,” she said.“I suspect that the doctors in the hospital intubated her in the neck so that she would be unable to give her statement to the police. Now, they have declared her dead on Wednesday,” she said.ML Khan, duty magistrate of Patna, said: “We have received a complaint from the deceased’s daughter against the hospital administration. The names of the accused are not mentioned in her complaint. We have sent the body for post-mortem to ascertain sexual assault.”“The hospital administration declared her dead due to corona infection.

19-05-2021||United Nations||In COVID-19 pandemic, India stood by Africa by supplying medicines, vaccines: Jaishankar||India said on Wednesday that it has stood by Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak and supplied medicines, vaccines and health-related equipment to over 40 African nations during the crisis, underscoring that New Delhi will be Africa's "reliable partner" in fighting the pandemic."Like the rest of the world, Africa too is being tested by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its vulnerabilities are greater and in many respects, its capabilities are still in the making," External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said at the UN Security Council Open Debate on ‘Peace and Security in Africa: addressing root causes of conflict while promoting post-pandemic recovery in Africa'.The debate, held under the Council Presidency of China, was presided over by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi."The world must stand by Africa in this crisis. On its part, India has done so by supplying medicines, vaccines and health-related equipment to 42 African countries. We are also working in partnership with South Africa and others to address the challenges of accessibility and affordability of vaccines," Jaishankar said.He underlined India's support to peacebuilding in Africa, establishing capabilities and capacities that help meet challenges while ensuring progress."Most of all, we understand and empathize with the aspirations of Africa. That is why India will support peace and security there, help address root causes of conflict and be a reliable partner in fighting the pandemic,” he said.Jaishankar noted that like the rest of the world, Africa too faces problems of terrorism and instability. "It is a reminder to this Council why epicentres of radicalisation must not be allowed to operate with impunity." He told the Council that India's support to Africa is expressed through its peacekeeping presence in South Sudan, Somalia, Abeyi, Western Sahara and Democratic Republic of Congo. "We endorse the call of the Secretary General for a mandate under Chapter VII to support African counter-terrorism operations with sustained financing, including through assessed contributions." Beyond the pandemic, Jaishankar said Africa's recovery will be facilitated by partnerships that genuinely address its economic sustainability. India's approach was spelt out by the Kampala Principles enunciated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018."In effect, India will respond to the priorities of Africa, as defined by Africans themselves. Our support is without conditionalities and in line with African expectations,” he said, adding that India's support is visible in its 189 projects in 41 African countries being implemented under concessional loans.India's support to Africa also encompasses providing medicines, health equipment, ambulances, books, vehicles and food grains and is visible through vocational training and IT centres set up in Africa, through the 43,000 education and training slots over the last five years, or the digital education and health programmes with 17 African partners."Our trade and technology exchanges are steadily growing, in line with closer political and people-to-people ties. Whether it is debt relief or climate change, we treat Africa's challenges as our own,” he said.Jaishankar underlined the strong and deep solidarity between India and Africa, saying it reflects the bonding of the Global South.While New Delhi's close collaboration is expressed through the India-Africa Forum Summit, in the G77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, Jaishankar said the close ties are more evident in the United Nations itself than elsewhere.Jaishankar added that bilaterally, India has partnered in the establishment of defence institutions in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania and its training teams have been deployed in Botswana, Namibia, Uganda, Lesotho, Zambia, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tanzania. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-covid-19-pandemic-india-stood-by-africa-by-supplying-medicines-vaccines-jaishankar-255330

Taking a serious view, the Zilla Parishad chief executive officer has issued orders suspending the trio,” the official said.The erring teachers neglected the duty in the Covid-19 pandemic and did not follow the orders of their seniors, resulting in the vaccine mix-up, which tarnished the image of the health department, the official said quoting the suspension order.

She stated that gaumutra cures the infection of lungs and the COVID-19. Her words must be credible.”On Sunday, Thakur told a function that the cow urine extract offers protection against lung infections and coronavirus.“Now the pandemic is spread in villages. It is apprehended that statements of Thakur will leave the villagers who have faith in ‘Gau Mata’ (the cow) confused and they will start tasking this medication (cow urine) ignoring the well-established treatment of allopathy,” said Sharma, who represents the Bhopal South-West Assembly constituency.The MLA said he wrote to Harsh Vardhan and the National Health Mission commissioner, MP, to “remove this confusion and scientifically certify the ‘gaumutra’ claim made by Thakur”.Thakur had said ‘gaumutra ark’ (cow urine extract) of a desi cow can keep people away from lung infections.“I am in a lot of trouble (health issues) but take the ‘gaumutra ark’ every day. After this, I am not supposed to take any other medicine for coronavirus. I am not affected by coronavirus infection. I believe God will keep me protected as I am using this medicine (gaumutra ark),” the Bhopal MP had said.Various statements of Thakur, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case, had sparked controversies in the past.

19-05-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Telangana allows NRIs to sell or gift agricultural land remotely||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, May 19 Telangana has become a state that will now allow Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to sell their agricultural land in the state from their remote locations, using the state’s Dharani portal.Any transaction concerning their ownership, like sale, gift, issues of General Power of Attorney (GPA), etc., will be allowed from foreign lands. However, to buy land they will have to be physically present in the state.  The state government today announced that it had incorporated a new option for the benefit of Telangana NRIs in the Dharani website to enable them to deal with their agricultural land in any manner that they desired. The new provisions will also allow NRIs to apply for conversion of their agricultural lands into non-agriculture properties under the NALA (Non-Agricultural Lands Assessment) Act, without requiring them to visit the revenue offices in India.  Telangana has digitised most of its land records and issued passbooks to landowners where everyone is eligible to receive “farmer assistance” of Rs 10,000 per acre, in two half-yearly instalments, irrespective of a person’s financial status. The scheme is called Rhytu Bandhu and was introduced by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) during his 2014-2018 term in office.  The NRIs who wish to use this facility need to register themselves and upload details of their agricultural properties in their native state through the Dharani portal. This would provide legal protection to the lands of NRIs and prevent others from fraudulently registering these properties in their absence.  The government has also waived off the need to register on the portal using an Aadhar Number by replacing it with allowing NRIs to used their passport number and social security number of their existing country. They can also authorise the GPA holder by uploading the relevant documents only through their login ID/username.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-allows-nris-to-sell-or-gift-agricultural-land-remotely-255317

These workers will be called "divyang mitra" (friends of persons with disabilities).A senior official said the Rehabilitation Council of India intends to roll out the course initially on a pilot basis for two batches in seven National Institutes of the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities and 7-9 voluntary organisations that have experience in community-based rehabilitation programmes."Initially, the programme will be available in English, Hindi and seven regional languages, namely Gujarati, Marathi, Odiya, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil and Garo. The classes for the first batch of about 600 students are expected to commence by August. The mode of training for the course would be both offline and online, taking into account the prevailing Covid scenario," the official said.This CBID course has been co-designed by the Rehabilitation Council of India and the University of Melbourne as a joint initiative under a memorandum of understanding signed between India and Australia on November 22, 2018 for cooperation in the disability sector.The National Board of Examination in Rehabilitation under the Rehabilitation Council of India will conduct the examinations and award certificates to the successful candidates.Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Thaawarchand Gehlot virtually launched the six-month programme in the presence of Minister of State, Social Justice and Empowerment Pal Gurjar, Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O'Farrell, High Commissioner of India to Australia Manpreet Vohra, Secretary, DEPwD Anjali Bhawra and vice chancellor of the Melbourne University Professor Duncan Maskell. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-launches-six-month-programme-on-rehabilitation-of-persons-with-disabilities-255315
19-05-2021||New Delhi||Women's job satisfaction, mental wellbeing severely impacted by pandemic: Report||Responsibilities at work and at home have exponentially increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the burden is disproportionately impacting women, according to a report by consultancy firm Deloitte.According to the Deloitte Global report, "Women @ Work: A global outlook," released on Wednesday, heightened workloads and household responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic are having devastating effects on working women, as 51 per cent of those surveyed are less optimistic about their career prospects.The report represented views of 5,000 women across 10 countries, including 500 respondents from India, said that women's job satisfaction and mental wellbeing have been severely impacted by the pandemic."The last year has been a ‘perfect storm for many women facing increased workloads and greater responsibilities at home, a blurring of the boundaries between the two, and continued experiences of non-inclusive behaviors at work," says Emma Codd, Deloitte Global Inclusion Leader.Nearly 7 in 10 (69 per cent) women in India rated their job satisfaction as good or extremely good pre-COVID-19. However, at present, only 28 per cent of women said the same, representing a sharp decreased from before the pandemic.Nearly 6 in 10 (57 per cent) women in India said their career is not progressing as fast as they would like, much higher than the global average of 42 per cent.Further, women in India are less hopeful about their career paths now than before the COVID-19 pandemic.  More than 6 in 10 Indian women said they feel less optimistic about their career prospects now than before the pandemic, compared to 51 per cent of the global sample."Instituting policies is no longer enough to change the experience of women colleagues, the “ways of working” needs to change to support this. Executive teams have an important responsibility in addressing this. Leaders need to strongly foster an environment where flexibility in work hours is welcomed and boundaries around work hours are respected for all employees," said Mohinish Sinha, Partner, and Diversity & Inclusion Leader, Deloitte India.According to the report, more than a quarter (26 per cent) of Indian women are considering leaving the workforce altogether, compared to 23 per cent globally."These women cite an increase in workload and caregiving responsibilities as the main drivers behind considering leaving the workforce. These reasons and relative percentages mirror the global averages," the report said.A small number of Indian employers are providing enough resources to women during the pandemic. Indian employers are providing more paid maternity leave."Indian organisations are less likely to have implemented formal mentorship programmes for women (17 per cent vs 22 per cent globally), development opportunities for women (16 per cent vs 22 per cent globally), and gender targets for promotions (15 per cent vs 19 per cent) globally.Moreover, only 38 per cent have a clear process for reporting discrimination and harassment.Between November 2020 and March 2021, Deloitte Global conducted a survey of 5,000 women in 10 countries to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's personal and professional lives. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/womens-job-satisfaction-mental-wellbeing-severely-impacted-by-pandemic-report-255314
19-05-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC for making PM CARES FUND party in case on Covid-19 management||A plea has filed in the Supreme Court seeking to make Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund) a party in the pending case on Covid-19 management.An intervention application filed by activist Saket Gokhale in the suo motu case on distribution of essential supplies and services during pandemic said that PM CARES FUND be asked to clarify about the current status of the fund, its links with the Centre, details of funds allocated and progress made towards Covid-19 relief and the status of the projects sanctioned. On March 28, last year, the Centre had set up the PM CARES Fund with the primary objective to deal with any kind of emergency situation like the one currently posed by the Covid-19 outbreak and provide relief to those affected.“The Applicant contends that the PM CARES Fund is a non-governmental stakeholder that has been closely involved in decisions and projects that have been closely related to the distribution and supplies of essentials in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic albeit through the Government of India”, the application said. “For that particular reason, the applicant contends that the PM CARES Fund must be made a respondent in the present case and asked to submit details pertaining to its Covid-19 relief related projects and their present status,” it said.Gokhale said that under the present circumstances, it is important that PM CARES Fund make available all information to this Court on the various allocations it has made towards fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and how it has monitored the progress of projects to which monetary allocations were made.“The PM CARES Fund has also claimed in various different ways that it is neither related to the Government of India and nor is it controlled by it,” the plea said, adding that the PM CARES Fund is not only administered by the Prime Minister and other Ministers but has also presented itself as a Government of India entity.The plea said that the only information available in the public domain about allocations from PM CARES Fund comes from statements and press releases issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and it is unclear whether, in addition to the allocations declared publicly, there have been other allocations made towards other Covid-19 related expenditure. “On the issue of vaccines, the Union of India has submitted to this Court in the present case that no money was allocated or spent by the Government of India towards Covid-19 vaccine development, and hence, the government has no control over deciding the pricing of the vaccines.“However, PM CARES Fund itself has declared an allocation of Rs.100 crores towards vaccine development and it is unclear whether any additional funds were allocated for the same purpose for which information was not made available in the public domain,” the plea said.Gokhale further said that PM CARES Fund has not declared its accounts and has rejected RTI enquiries into the same on the grounds that it is not a public authority.The plea said that since its inception, the PM CARES Fund has collected monetary contributions from India as well as overseas which includes salary contributions by employees and members of several Government of India Ministries and PSUs. “The PM CARES Fund is managed on a day-to-day basis by the Under Secretary (Funds) in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO)”, it said, adding that on May 13, last year, the PM CARES Fund announced that it had allocated Rs. 3000 crores for Covid-19 of which Rs 2000 crore will be earmarked for the purchase of ventilators, Rs 1000 crores will be used for care of migrant labourers and Rs 100 crores will be given to support vaccine development. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-for-making-pm-cares-fund-party-in-case-on-covid-19-management-255313
19-05-2021||Mukesh Ranjan||Deadline for NGOs to open account with SBI to receive foreign fund extended till June 30||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday said it has decided to extend the deadline for non-government organisations (NGOs)to open their accounts with the State Bank of India’s (SBI) main branch here from March 31, 2021 to June 30, 2021 for receiving foreign donations for their activities.  Opening of an account in the SBI’s branch is a mandatory requirement for the NGOs under the amended provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) enacted in September 2020 to receive foreign donations.In the meantime, the MHA has also given relief to NGOs having certificates under the FCRA by extending their expiry date till September 30, 2021. This extension relief has been given to those NGOs, whose certificates were to expire between September 29, 2020 and September 30, 2021.  It is to be noted here that at least five NGOs moved the Delhi and Guwahati High Courts, arguing that even though they had applied to open FCRA accounts at the bank before March 31, administrative delays on the part of the SBI and the MHA severely restricted their activities, including providing COVID-19 related relief and paying urgent salaries to their staff.Last week, the Delhi High Court asked the MHA to consider if the deadline can be extended in view of the pandemic.The MHA issued an order dated May 18, 2021, where it said: “Keeping in view the exigencies arising out of the COVID-19 situation and to ensure smooth transition to the amended FCRA regime the Central government, under section 50 of the FCRA, 2010 was making an amendment to allow NGOs to open an account with the SBI up to June 30 or earlier.”It further said, “After that date, they shall not be eligible to receive foreign contribution in any other account other than the FCRA account opened in the NDMB of the SBI.”The MHA has also given a relief up to September 30 to the NGOs whose registration was expiring between September 29, 2020-September 30, 2021.In a separate order the MHA said, “Keeping in view the exigencies arising out of COVID-19situation and to ensure smooth transition to the amended FCRA regime, the central government in exercise of the powers conferred by section 50 of the FCRA, 2010 has further decided that the registration certificate expiring/expired during the period between September 29, 2020 and up to September 30, 2021 shall remain valid up to September 30, 2021.”The NGOs had to apply for renewal of certificates or registration by May 31, which has now been extended to September 30, 2021, the MHA order noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deadline-for-ngos-to-open-account-with-sbi-to-receive-foreign-fund-extended-till-june-30-255311

The system is economically viable and is safe to operate since it obviates high gas pressure in the pipeline or cylinders and does not require any power supply to operate. The system is capable of replication in a quick time frame.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-engineers-come-up-with-innovative-solution-for-conversion-of-liquid-oxygen-to-bedside-oxygen-covid-19-patients-255304
19-05-2021||New Delhi||648 calls for help received by NCW for pregnant women in last 20 days||From urgent requirement for a ventilator bed to need for plasma, about 648 calls for help were received by the NCW for pregnant women in the last 20 days.On April 29, the National Commission for Women (NCW) started a helpline for exclusively assisting pregnant women during emergencies under #HappyToHelp campaign.Ever since its launch, a group of 40 people are working together to manage different requests received on the helpline, including arranging oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma, and delivering medicines to the patients."Till today, the helpline has saved 648 such pregnant women and their babies," NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma said.Sharma said as the Covid-19 pandemic intensified, so increased the need for plasma. "In its initial days, the helpline received several requests for plasma after which we called for people who have recovered from Covid to come forward and donate plasma," she said."People responded very positively to the NCW's call to save two lives by donating plasma for pregnant women and currently the helpline has plasma donors from across the country who have readily agreed to help," Sharma said.In one case, a 29-year-old pregnant woman from Bengaluru urgently needed a ventilator bed as the hospital did not have an ICU or a ventilator facility. The request was sent to the NCW's helpline for expecting mothers at midnight by a volunteer group. "Every authority from the district health officer to the police commissioner was contacted for arranging the ventilator. Even the highest of our officials were involved. The team also contacted the health minister's office for help. Finally, after a night-long battle, a ventilator was arranged for the patient, and she was shifted to an ICU," Sharma said.In another case, a 30-year-old pregnant woman from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh was urgently looking for an ICU for herself. "After the request was sent to the helpline, our team coordinated with the authorities, and she was shifted to a ventilator. The family had later informed that she gave birth to a baby girl," she added.The NCW has also roped in doctors for providing tele-consultation."The NCW called for doctors to come forward and volunteer for the cause and at present there are over 20 doctors who provide tele-consultation services to women free-of-cost. These doctors hail from different parts of the country so that patients can clarify their queries in their own language," she said.Sharma said the helpline was started just with NCW team members but now several others, including social workers, doctors, influencers, celebrities, have joined in to amplify the helpline's reach. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/648-calls-for-help-received-by-ncw-for-pregnant-women-in-last-20-days-255303

19-05-2021||Mumbai||Can you start doorstep vaccination for select groups? HC to BMC||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday asked the Mumbai civic body if it was possible for it to introduce a door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination programme for senior citizens and disabled persons who are unable to visit inoculation centres.A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni said if the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) was willing to start a door-to-door vaccination programme for these groups, the HC would grant it permission even though the Union government has not given nod for such a drive.The Bench noted that it seems the Union government was not keen on starting a door-to-door vaccination programme.If the BMC says it can start a door-to-door vaccination, we will give it permission. No need to wait for the Central government’s nod.“Will you come to the help of elderly citizens? Even though the Centre is not giving green signal (for door-to-door vaccination) we are willing to give you (BMC) green signal, Chief Justice Datta said.Will the BMC be able to go to the house of those persons, who cannot step out of their houses, and vaccinate them? the court asked.The court directed BMC Commissioner Iqbal Chahal to file an affidavit on Thursday stating if it would be possible for the civic body to introduce a home-based vaccination drive with proper medical care for senior citizens, disabled persons and those who are bed-ridden or wheelchair-bound.The court said it will hear the matter further on Thursday, noting each day is precious in such times, referring to the raging Covid-19 pandemic.The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by two advocates, Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari.The PIL sought a direction to the Central government to initiate a door-to-door vaccination drive for senior citizens above the age of 75, persons with physical disabilities and those who are bed-ridden or wheelchair-bound.The HC had earlier asked the Union government to take a relook at its policy that said doorstep vaccination was not possible due to various reasons like wastage of vaccines and non-availability of observation centres for beneficiaries after they are inoculated (for any immediate side effect).On Wednesday, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the Union government, told the court that an expert committee has been set up to look into the issue.The committee had a meeting on May 18 and has submitted a few suggestions like transporting people who are unable to move out of their houses on stretchers to vaccine centres, Singh said.He added that a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) would be issued by the government on the issue.The court, however, noted that the experts in the committee maybe academicians but they seem to have zero knowledge about ground realities.The Bench said there are many places in the country where buildings are situated in narrow lanes and hence it would not be possible to bring out a person on a stretcher.Chief Justice Datta gave examples of Kolkata, where he was born and brought up, and said the buildings in that city are situated so close to each other that it would not be possible to take a stretcher there.Justice Kulkarni then pointed out there are old buildings with wooden staircases even in Mumbai.There are many households in our country that are situated in narrow by-lanes and elderly citizens and disabled persons living here may not be able to come out.“Are you (Centre) saying that these persons are not entitled to get the vaccine? How do you (Centre) cater to the needs of such people? the court asked. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/can-you-start-doorstep-vaccination-for-select-groups-hc-to-bmc-255297
19-05-2021||Vibha Sharma||Fertiliser price hike: RSS affiliate BKS asks govt to check ‘exploitation’ of farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19Pointing towards increase in prices of chemical fertilisers, including DAP, RSS affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh on Wednesday urged the Narendra Modi government to intervene immediately and check the “exploitation” of farmers during the Covid pandemic.The farmers’ organisation also asked the Centre to withdraw its May 15 order removing import duty on pulses, calling such actions “contradictory” to its stated intention on making India self-sufficient in pulses and oilseeds.According to the general secretary of the BKS Badrinarayan Choudhury, there is an increase in chemical fertilisers’ prices to the extent of 1.5 times of the existing price. “Even IFFCO raised the price of DAP from Rs 1200/50 kg to 1900/50 kg this May. Retailers are selling with this new price, though the Chemicals and Fertilisers Ministry barred them from doing so.”“There is huge confusion in the market. We demand that the Government should intervene immediately with a clear-cut order to check the exploitation of the farmers during such pandemic,” he said, addressing media.Choudhury also asked the government to rethink and withdraw its order removing all import duties on tur, moong, and urad, stating that it was sending the wrong message to farmers. “The Commerce and Industry Ministry on May 15 declared that they are removing all import duties on tur, moong, and urad. All these crops are to be grown this monsoon. This has sent a message to the farmers that they should not go for cultivation these grains that they are not going to get a better price for them. While the Modi government wants to make our country self-sufficient in pulses and oilseeds and we are about to achieve that target, such action will act contradictory,” he said.The BKS also demanded subsidy in interest for KCC cardholders. The KCC cardholders get a subsidy of a 3 per cent interest rate if they repay the loan in time. Choudhury said though the government has extended the date of repayment in relation to pandemic, banks are collecting the loans with full interests. “The Government should ensure subsidy in interest till the situation become normal,” he said, also asking it to waive off KCC loans of any farmer deceased due to coronavirus.“We are now passing through a difficult time of the second phase of Chinese corona. As the largest farmer organisations in our country, the members of BKS are spreading awareness across villages, encouraging people to vaccinate themselves as quickly as possible and empowering them to be more mentally powerful to overcome this pandemic. Our members are working actively probably in and around 35,000 to 40,000 villages during this pandemic to help people,” the BKS said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fertiliser-price-hike-rss-affiliate-bks-asks-govt-to-check-exploitation-of-farmers-255286

He drives the car of minister Tulsiram Silawat’s wife.”Agrawal also claimed he was going to give both the vials at the cost of Rs 14,000 each to a policeman named Lalit Sharma, who has asked him for the injections.He further claimed that Rajput had provided Remdesivir injections to many other people.When asked about the claim, Silawat said Agarwal’s statement should be examined impartially.“My wife’s car is driven by different drivers of this private travel agency. Our family has got nothing to do with their illegal activities,” he asserted.However, local Congress MLA Sanjay Shukla said he had alleged that Silawat’s family was selling Remdesivir injections and Agarwal’s statement has now proved it.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan should immediately remove Silawat from his Cabinet, he said.Meanwhile, Vijay Nagar police station in-charge Tehzeeb Qazi claimed Agrawal was deliberately mentioning big names to mislead people and save himself from legal tangles.“However, we are conducting a detailed probe into his statements,” the official said.The official also said they had caught Agarwal after laying a trap and the policeman (Lalit Sharma) whose name he mentioned in the video was involved in the operation.He also said Govind Rajput was not yet detained for questioning.Health officer Gadaria, whose vehicle Agrawal used to drive before his arrest, has already said that she has got nothing to do with the case of black-marketing of Remdesivir.

19-05-2021||Kolkata||Narada case arrests: Bengal Governor takes ‘serious note’ of protests outside Raj Bhavan, seeks police report||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday took “serious note” of the demonstrations in front of the Raj Bhavan on consecutive days, despite prohibitory orders in force in the area, and sought a report from the city police.The governor took to Twitter and shared video clips of both the events tagging the official handle of Kolkata Police, and asked them to send comprehensive reports regarding the incidents and the actions taken by 5 pm on Wednesday.The governor’s ire followed the agitation near the four gates of Raj Bhavan by Trinamool Congress activists on Monday after the CBI arrested three heavyweight TMC leaders, two of them state ministers, in connection with Narada case, and a demonstration by a social organisation in which a person was seen with a posse of half a dozen sheep near the North Gate the day after.Dhankhar, who has been flagging the “worsening law and order issue” repeatedly in recent times, accused the demonstrators of showing threatening posture amounting to utter disregard for law and accused the police of not taking note of that.Tagging the Twitter handle of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Kolkata Police, Dhankhar tweeted on Wednesday, “State of law and order ?@MamataOfficial? even at the main entry gate of Raj Bhawan worrisome with stance police? @KolkataPolice? leaving all to be desired.“And all this when the area is subject to 144 CrPC prohibitory orders. Constrained to seek an update on it.”         In another tweet, he shared a video of a man posing outside Raj Bhavan with a flock of sheep on Tuesday.Dhankhar tweeted “and on this stance @KolkataPolice (laughable one) is that the man was keen to have photo with Raj Bhawan background. No action whatsoever taken”.Suman Mitra, a spokesman of the organisation that carried out this unusual protest, had said the demonstration was organised to protest “lack of concern by the governor for the people who are facing the brunt due to worsening COVID-19 situation in the state, scarcity in supply of oxygen, rise in deaths. Instead, he is only preoccupied with other issues which can be dealt with later on.”“Our protest is against the dirty politics at the time of pandemic when people of Bengal are suffering,” Mitra said.Turning to the agitation by Trinamool Congress activists before all the gates of Raj Bhavan in protest against the arrests by CBI on Monday, Dhankhar tweeted “And such threatening posture at main gate of Raj Bhawan! Police @KolkataPolice virtually takes no note of it.“Look at the content of the threat! With no fear of law- understandably given inaction of police. Can all this @MamataOfficial be countenanced or overlooked!”  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narada-case-arrests-bengal-governor-takes-serious-note-of-protests-outside-raj-bhavan-seeks-police-report-255275

Jackson is urging President Joe Biden to release 60 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to India, which is experiencing one of the worst outbreaks of the pandemic in the world.Rev. Jackson will be joined by several prominent Indian leaders in the national capital on Wednesday, to make a public appeal to Biden for more humanitarian aid, according to a community statement."The pandemic poses a threat to humanity, not to any one country. Our response must be as encompassing as the threat," Rev Jackson said in a statement. He will urge Biden to give India 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, it said.Dr Bharat Barai, the chairman, US India Friendship Council, urged the President to facilitate the supply of the "much needed antiviral medications of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab to India immediately." In a statement, Dr Vijay Prabhakar, national chairman, American Association of Multiethnic Physicians, USA, called on Biden to invoke the Federal International Emergency Production Act which would enable the manufacturers of the vaccine in the US to increase their production capacity."We need to protect India first only then can America and the rest of the world be protected," Dr Prabhakar said. Thanking Biden for his international vaccination pledge by providing 80 million COVID-19 vaccines, he also pleaded to give at least 60 million of those to India.In its most recent update, the Union Health Ministry placed the total number of COVID-19 cases in India at 2,52,28,996 and the death toll at 2,78,719.

19-05-2021||London||British-Indian chemist in Millennium Tech Prize winning team for revolutionary DNA tech||Cambridge University chemists Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman were on Tuesday declared the winners of the 2020 Millennium Technology Prize, a prestigious global science and technology prize awarded for their development of revolutionary sequencing techniques, which means DNA can now be read in super-fast times.The prize, awarded by Technology Academy Finland (TAF) at two-year intervals since 2004 – when Sir Tim Berners-Lee was honoured for his discovery of the World Wide Web – to highlight the extensive impact of science and innovation on the wellbeing of society, is worth Euro 1 million.Sir Balasubramanian, an India-born British professor of medicinal chemistry, and Sir Klenerman, a British biophysical chemist, co-invented the Solexa-Illumina Next Generation DNA Sequencing (NGS), technology enabling fast, accurate, low-cost and large-scale genome sequencing – the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism's make-up, which is proving crucial in humanity's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.The duo went on to co-found the company Solexa to make the technology more broadly available to the world.“This is the first time we've received an international prize that recognises our contribution to developing the technology – but it's not just for us, it's for the whole team that played a key role in the development of the technology and for all those that have inspired us on our journey,” the winning scientists said in a joint statement.President of the Republic of Finland Sauli Niinisto, who is the Patron of the prize, presented the award to the scientists in a virtual ceremony on Tuesday.The announcement of the 2020 award was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Meanwhile, the technology is being used to track and explore the novel coronavirus viral mutations, which is a growing global concern.“The future potential of NGS is enormous and the exploitation of the technology is still in its infancy,” said Paivi Torma, Academy Professor and Chair of the Millennium Technology Prize Committee.“The technology will be a crucial element in promoting sustainable development through personalisation of medicine, understanding and fighting killer diseases, and hence improving the quality of life. Professor Balasubramanian and Professor Klenerman are worthy winners of the prize,” said Prof. Torma.The 2020 prize marks the first time that the honour has been awarded to more than one recipient for the same innovation, celebrating the significance of collaboration.Professor Marja Makarow, Chair of Technology Academy Finland said: “Collaboration is an essential part of ensuring positive change for the future. Next Generation Sequencing is the perfect example of what can be achieved through teamwork and individuals from different scientific backgrounds coming together to solve a problem.”         “The technology pioneered by Professor Balasubramanian and Professor Klenerman has also played a key role in helping discover the coronavirus's sequence, which in turn enabled the creation of the vaccines – itself a triumph for cross-border collaboration – and helped identify new variants of COVID-19,” Makarow said.The winning work has helped the creation of multiple vaccines, now being administered worldwide, and is critical to the creation of new vaccines against new dangerous viral strains. The results will also be used to prevent future pandemics.However, the International Selection Committee – the body of experts that evaluates all nominations for the prize – pointed out that it had made its decision in February 2020, before the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The technology is also allowing scientists and researchers to identify the underlying factors in individuals that contribute to their immune response to COVID-19.This information is essential to unravelling the reason behind why some people respond much worse to the virus than others. The results of these studies will be invaluable for understanding how to minimise the chances of people developing exaggerated inflammatory responses, which is now understood as being responsible for some of the symptoms of COVID-19.The winning NGS technology has had, and continues to have, a huge transformative impact in the fields of genomics, medicine and biology. One measure of the scale of change is that it has allowed a million-fold improvement in speed and cost, when compared to the first sequencing of the human genome.The prize committee points to how in 2000, sequencing of one human genome took over 10 years and cost more than a billion dollars.Today, the human genome can be sequenced in one day at a cost of US$ 1,000 and more than a million human genomes are sequenced at scale each year, thanks to the technology co-invented by Professors Balasubramanian and Klenerman. This means the world can understand diseases much better and much more quickly.The NGS method's ability to sequence billions of fragments in a parallel fashion makes the technique fast, accurate and very cost-efficient. The invention of NGS has been described as a revolutionary and novel approach to the understanding of the genetic code in all living organisms.In the field of cancer, NGS is becoming the standard analytical method for defining personalised therapeutic treatment. In addition to medical applications, NGS has also had a major impact on all of biology as it allows the clear identification of thousands of organisms in almost any kind of sample.The NGS method involves fragmenting sample DNA into many small pieces that are immobilised on the surface of a chip and locally amplified.Each fragment is then decoded on the chip, base-by-base, using fluorescently coloured nucleotides added by an enzyme. By detecting the colour-coded nucleotides incorporated at each position on the chip with a fluorescence detector – and repeating this cycle hundreds of times – it is possible to determine the DNA sequence of each fragment.The collected data is then analysed using sophisticated computer software to assemble the full DNA sequence from the sequence of all these fragments.

I became the minister earlier because of the party’s decision. I have absolute satisfaction in what I have done. I am confident that the new team can perform better than me,” she added.“Not the individual but the system is showcasing the fight against the pandemic,” the leader added.She was, however, entrusted with the position of party whip, a CPM statement said here, even as the party took the position that all members except the Chief Minister should be fresh faces in the new cabinet.Among the fresh faces is Vijayan’s son-in-law PA Mohammed Riyas. The state committee of the Marxist party nominated 11 freshers, including two women as its ministers in the new government, which would be sworn in on May 20.The state committee, which met at its headquarters AKG Centre, elected Vijayan to lead the party, the statement said.Though it was almost sure that no ministers in the previous Vijayan government would find a place in his new cabinet, Shailaja was expected to be given an exemption by the party.She had won the polls with the highest margin of 60,963 votes from Mattannur in Kannur. The media, during the election, had even projected her as the first woman chief minister of the state in future.A retired school teacher, she had done a commendable job in containing the Covid surge in the state last year and also during the Nipah virus outbreak in 2018 and 2019.Though critics alleged that Shailaja was sidelined, the CPM took the position that all ministers except the CM should be fresh faces in the new cabinet. So had been the case with TM Thomas Isaac, Finance Minister in the outgoing cabinet, among others who had not been given a chance as they were elected twice consecutively, party sources said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-cm-picks-new-team-top-performer-shailaja-dropped-254861

TNSTauktae, characterised as an extremely severe cyclonic storm on Monday, has now weakened into a “cyclonic storm” and will gradually become a “deep depression” as it moves northwards, the IMD said.Over 16,000 houses were damaged, more than 40,000 trees and over 70,000 electric poles uprooted, while 5,951 villages faced total power blackout due to the cyclonic storm in Gujarat, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Gujarat and Diu on Wednesday to personally review the situation and damage due to Cyclone Tauktae. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tauktae-weakens-kills-13-in-gujarat-254864

In many states the pandemic curve is stabilising. There is, however, a continuous concern in some states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha and Punjab. The picture is mixed, but reproduction number below 1 means the pandemic is shrinking overall,” said Member, Health, NITI Aayog.“Recovery trends are positive. The rate has risen from 81.7% on May 3 to 85.6% today,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said. The number of states with over one lakh active cases has come down from 11 to eight over the past one week and only eight states are reporting over 10,000 daily cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/record-4-329-daily-deaths-but-recoveries-go-up-4-in-2-weeks-255025
19-05-2021||New Delhi||22 bodies found in Arabian Sea, 53 still missing||Twenty-two bodies have been found in the Arabian Sea and are possibly of the persons who were on board the ill-fated barge ‘P305’ that sunk on the night intervening May 17 & May 18.Two more survivors have been found, taking the number of those rescued from the barge to 186. Still, 53 persons are missing at sea.A DNA match of the victims would reveal their identity. A DNA sample has been collected, as part of protocol, of those working on oil rigs and at the sea.The barge was working at the Heera oil rig, part of the Bombay High oil rigs, 70 km south-west of Mumbai. It was part of six separate vessels that had been adrift at sea since Monday following the Cyclone Tauktae. All were connected with oil-drilling work or new projects at Bombay High.Also, the number of persons on board the ill-fated barge ‘P305’ has been down, revised from the 273 announced earlier to 261. The Navy had initially said 273 were on board the barge and this was based on the first SOS message.The Oil and Natural Gas Commission clarified that the number on board the barge was 261. The Navy too has confirmed the figure.  A massive search operation is on for the past 48 hours.The first lot of rescued men arrived in Mumbai on board INS Kochi, the Indian Naval warship. Three other warships, planes and helicopters continue their search for those missing at sea. INS Teg, INS Betwa and INS Beas are at the location.Maritime reconnaissance plane P8I, fitted with sharp sensors, is scanning the area. Helicopters with sensors too are at the location. All the copters can land on decks of the available ships at sea.The tugs of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) are towing the drill ship Sagar Bhushan and barge ‘Support Station 3’ to harbour. Food and drinking water have been provided to crew onboard these vessels by the Indian Navy copters. Both are carrying 297 men on board.All the 137 personnel on barge GAL Constructor were rescued on Tuesday by the Navy and the Coast Guard.Also read: Below are the helpline numbers shared by the Navy:AFCONS Helpdesk and Support Team:Karandeep Singh: +919987548113, 022-71987192Prasun Goswami: 8802062853ONGC Helpline:022-2627 4019022-2627 4020022-2627 4021Multiple rescue ops||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/22-bodies-found-in-arabian-sea-53-still-missing-255021

19-05-2021||New Delhi||Never exported vaccines at cost of people in India: Serum Institute||Serum Institute of India on Tuesday said it has never exported vaccines at the cost of the people in India and remains committed to support the vaccination drive in the country.In the past few days, there has been an intense discussion on the decision of the government and Indian vaccine manufacturers, including Serum Institute of India (SII) to export vaccines, the company said in a statement.Giving the background on the decision to export vaccines, SII said, “In January 2021, we had a large stockpile of vaccine doses. Our vaccination drive had started successfully and the number of daily cases being recorded were at an all-time low.”Around the same time, many other countries in the world were facing an acute crisis and were in desperate need of help. The Indian government extended support wherever possible during this period, it added.“Today, it is this reciprocity, where India has helped other countries with the supply of HCQ and vaccine exports, that has in turn led to support from other countries,” SII said.This pandemic is not limited by geographic or political boundaries. “We will not be safe till everyone globally is able to defeat this virus at a global scale. Further, as part of our global alliances, we also had commitments to COVAX, so that they could distribute the vaccines globally to end the pandemic,” it added.Another important factor that people do not tend to realise is that India is among the two most populous countries in the world, and a vaccination drive for such a large population cannot be completed within 2-3 months, as there are several factors and challenges involved, SII said.“SII has delivered more than 200 million doses, even though we received EUA (emergency use authorisation) two months after the US pharma companies,” it added.Serum continues to scale up manufacturing and prioritise India. It also hopes to start delivering to COVAX and other countries by end of this year, the statement said.“We would like to reiterate that we have never exported vaccines at the cost of the people in India and remain committed to do everything we can in the support of the vaccination drive in the country,” it said.SII has been working with the government tirelessly to do its best for humanity and will continue in the same spirit, it added.“This is the time for all of us to unite and work together to defeat the pandemic,” SII said.On Sunday, Congress leaders led by Rahul Gandhi had put up a poster critical of the Prime Minister over COVID vaccine export as their Twitter profile picture and dared the government to arrest them.

19-05-2021||London||Vijay Mallya loses bankruptcy petition amendment High Court battle in UK||A consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday moved a step closer in their attempt to recover debt from loans paid out to Vijay Mallya's now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines after the High Court in London upheld an application to amend their bankruptcy petition, in favour of waiving their security over the embattled businessman's assets in India.Chief Insolvencies and Companies Court (ICC) Judge Michael Briggs handed down his judgment in favour of the banks to declare there is no public policy that prevents a waiver of security rights, as argued by Mallya's lawyers.At a virtual hearing, July 26 was set as the date for final arguments for and against granting a bankruptcy order against the 65-year-old Mallya after the banks accused him of trying to “kick matters into the long grass” and called for the “bankruptcy petition to be brought to its inevitable end”.“I order that permission be given to amend the petition to read as follows: ‘The Petitioners (banks) having the right to enforce any security held are willing, in the event of a bankruptcy order being made, to give up any such security for the benefit of all the bankrupt's creditors',” Justice Briggs' judgment reads.“There is nothing in the statutory provisions that prevent the Petitioners from giving up security,” he notes.Mallya's barrister, Philip Marshall, had referenced witness statements of retired Indian judges in previous hearings to reiterate that there is “public interest under Indian law” by virtue of the banks being nationalised.However, Justice Briggs found no impediment to the creditors relinquishing their security under Indian law because of the engagement of a “principle concerning public interest” and favoured the submissions made by retired Indian Supreme Court judge Gopala Gowda at a hearing in December 2020 on the matter.“In my judgment the simple stance taken by Justice Gowda that Section 47 PIA 1920 is evidence of the ability of a secured creditor to relinquish the creditor's security is to be preferred,” the ruling notes.The Indian banks, represented by the law firm TLT LLP and barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, were also granted costs in totality for the petition hearings, as the “overall successful” party in the case.“Dr Mallya should have been extradited by now. He was refused permission to go to the Supreme Court in May last year,” Shekerdemian pointed out, in reference to one of Mallya's defence planks that the cases against him are “politically motivated”.Mallya remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” legal matter, believed to be related to an asylum application, is resolved in connection with the unrelated extradition proceedings.Meanwhile, the SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Pvt Ltd as well as an additional creditor, have been pursuing a bankruptcy order in the UK in relation to a judgment debt which stands at over GBP 1 billion.Mallya's legal team contends that the debt remains disputed and that the ongoing proceedings in India inhibit a bankruptcy order being made in the UK.“The pandemic is having a much more severe impact in India than here, which has slowed things up. Dr Mallya would like things to be faster,” said his barrister Philip Marshall.The case is now scheduled for a day-long hearing on July 26 for Justice Briggs to hear arguments from both sides on whether there is any reason why it should look “behind the judgment debt” to consider all such factors and therefore not grant a bankruptcy order.Presenting a brief background to the petition, which dates back to 2018, the latest judgment describes Mallya as an “entrepreneur businessman” who had considerable financial success in India and other parts of the world as Chief Executive Officer and shareholder of Kingfisher Airways (KFA) and controlling director and main shareholder in United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL).“The cost of aviation fuel rose in 2008, and the value of the rupee declined against the dollar. Dr Mallya decided to borrow substantial sums from some of the Petitioners,” the judgment reads.“Dr Mallya provided personal guarantees for the sums borrowed from the Petitioners in 2010. UBHL also provided a guarantee,” it adds.The debt in question comprises principal and interest, plus compound interest at a rate of 11.5 per cent per annum from 25 June 2013. Mallya has made applications in India to contest the compound interest charge. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vijay-mallya-loses-bankruptcy-petition-amendment-high-court-battle-in-uk-254754
19-05-2021||New Delhi||Himachal Pradesh may see a peak in the cases by May 24, Punjab by May 22: SUTRA model||States like Tamil Nadu, Assam and Punjab may see the peak of the second wave of coronavirus cases in the next two weeks, the SUTRA model that charts the trajectory of Covid-19 suggests.However, the relief is that Delhi and states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh have well passed their peak, the model further suggests.It also says that the country reached its peak by May 4 and then the daily cases have seen downward trend. However, on May 7, the country recorded 4,14,188 cases, the single highest in any day. "Big states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Assam are yet to see their peak," said Prof. M Vidyasagar of IIT-Hyderabad, one of the three scientists working on the modelling. The models suggest Tamil Nadu may see a peak by May 29-31 while Puducherry may witness a peak on May 19-20. States in east and northeast India are yet to see their peak. Assam may see a peak by May 20-21, the model suggests. On Monday, the state detected 6,394 new cases, which is also the highest on a single day. Chief minister Himanta Biswas Sarma said the state also recorded 92 more Covid-19 deaths on Monday, its highest single-day fatality. Models predicted a dip in infection in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and the cases in these states did record a decline, but they have started increasing marginally. Meghalaya could see a peak on May 30-31, while Tripura could see a peak on May 26-27, the model suggests.In the north, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab are witnessing a surge in the cases. Himachal Pradesh may see a peak in the cases by May 24 and Punjab by May 22. Odisha was to peak by May 16-17.States like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Kerala, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Haryana besides Delhi and Goa have already seen their peak. The health ministry in its press briefing on Tuesday said Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have shown a decline in Covid-19 cases and a decline in positivity. It added that Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have shown a decline in cases and a decline in positivity, it added.Mathematical models help predict the intensity of coronavirus cases and policy decisions can be taken on its basis.  The SUTRA model came into existence last year after the Department of Science and Technology formed a group of scientists to work on mathematical models to forecast the surge of coronavirus.The modelling faced intense criticism after it could not predict the exact nature of the second wave.A statement issued by the DST and signed by Vidyasagar, IIT Kanpur Professor Manindra Agrawal and deputy chief of Integrated Defence Staff Madhuri Kanitkar, said mathematical models had predicted a second wave of coronavirus and its peak in the third week of April with daily cases of 1 lakh. But the numbers were much higher than the model predicted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/himachal-pradesh-may-see-a-peak-in-the-cases-by-may-24-punjab-by-may-22-sutra-model-254746
19-05-2021||New Delhi||Govt officers living in ivory towers, not alive to Covid-19 situation: HC||Covid-19 has not spared even a single family and still central government’s officers are living in “ivory towers” oblivious of ground realities, observed the Delhi High Court which on Tuesday was of the view that manufacturing of Sputnik V vaccine in India is giving an opportunity to the nation staring at shortage of vaccines.“God bless this country,” was another remark of a bench of Justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla which castigated the Centre for not being alive to the pandemic situation that is taking so many lives.The bench said the collaboration of Panacea Biotec with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for manufacturing of Sputnik V vaccine should be seen as an opportunity to ensure its usage here and in such matters instructions are to be taken from the highest authorities that too within 30 minutes.It said “no one is applying its mind” when there is an opportunity for the government to get millions of vaccines and it should use this as a window.“Otherwise, deaths will continue to happen. Every day you are castigated by each and every court and still you are not awake.“Which bureaucrat is giving you instructions. Is he not alive to the situation? God bless this country. That is why we are facing this situation. In such matters instructions are to be taken from the highest authorities that too within 30 minutes,” the bench said.It added, “Does your officer not see so many deaths are taking place in the country and we are short of vaccines. Your client is not alive to the situation.”The bench, which was critical of the Centre’s stand on the issue, said “You (government) are so short of vaccines and you are not taking it through. May be it is an opportunity for you. Don’t be so negative. It is like a raging fire and nobody is bothered. You people don’t understand the larger picture or what.“Tell your officers it is an opportunity for you, don’t lose it. No one is applying its mind. The virus has not spared any single family. Your officers are living in ivory towers,” the bench said.The high court’s observations came while hearing a plea of Delhi-based Panacea Biotec seeking to modify a July 2020 order, by which the firm had undertaken not to prosecute further the execution proceedings instituted by them in relation to an arbitral award, running into crores of rupees, passed in its favour and against the Centre.The company, in its fresh application, sought release of the arbitral award saying it needs funds at the earliest in the larger interest of humanity as it has already manufactured trial batches of COVID vaccine Sputnik V in collaboration with RDIF and the process of manufacturing scale-up batches is on.The bench said, “This court is of the view that in today’s time there is acute shortage of vaccines in India and the collaboration of applicant (Panacea Biotec) with RDIF gives India an opportunity to ensure that the vaccine manufactured by the applicant is used for sale in India.” The court issued notice to the Centre and asked it to examine the plea and file a reply within a week and listed it for hearing on May 31.The company, represented through senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, said, “If the awarded amount is not released…, the whole process of manufacture of vaccine at the fastest pace may get derailed and delayed which will not be in the larger interest of humanity.” Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh, representing the Centre, submitted that the manufacturing of Sputnik V will not benefit the country as it will be for global supply by RDIF.He claimed that certain misleading statements were made in the plea and there was no urgency as the vaccines are to be sold outside India.The Centre was also represented through advocates Rajesh Ranjan and B S Shukla.Sethi, however, responded that no manufactured vaccines can be exported without the government’s consent.He said these vaccines are meant only for Indian use and it will benefit the government as the firm is one of the largest manufacturers of vaccines which supplies domestic and international markets.On the Centre’s objection to the plea, the bench said the government is short of vaccines and this company says they are willing to manufacture and deposit 20 per cent of sale proceeds in the court, so it should be taken as an opportunity.The application was filed in a pending appeal of the Centre challenging a single judge’s order dismissing its petition on a limited point of limitation period.Before the single judge, the Centre had challenged the arbitral tribunal’s award which was in the favour of Panacea Biotec and Bharat Biotech International Ltd and Serum Institute of India relating to an earlier agreement for pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccines in 2010.In its plea before the division bench, Panacea Biotec mentioned that Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech are also exporting COVID-19 vaccines to various countries and now there is huge shortage of vaccines which is not readily available for citizens of the age of 18 years and above, though officially it has been declared that they are eligible for vaccination since May 1.“It is one of the greatest challenge the humanity is facing which can only be overcome by vaccination and by following other protocols. Unless timely steps for manufacture of COVID-19 vaccine are taken, the death toll can go up to astronomical figures,” it said while maintaining that 100 million doses per year of Sputnik V vaccine for the global market would be manufactured.

The sea here has been very rough due to the impact of the cyclone and the huge tidal waves on Monday dumped tonnes of garbage at chowpatties, Marine Drive and the iconic Gateway of India in Mumbai, officials said said.Videos of huge tidal waves lashing the Gateway of Mumbai area went viral on social media platforms where people also shared images of the trail of destruction left by the cyclonic storm at some of the prominent monuments here.Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar said due to the precautions taken by the city civic body, the jumbo COVID-19 facility set up at the Bandra-Kurla Complex did not suffer many major damage, except that its cover was torn at some places and some iron sheets were blown away.The cyclonic storm claimed two lives in separate boat accidents at Mahim and Madh jetties here, as per an update issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).In another incident, a tree collapsed on a 45-year-old woman at a chawl in Worli area on Monday.

19-05-2021||New Delhi||Top Indian virologist quits government panel after criticising Centre over Covid handling||A top Indian virologist has resigned from a forum of scientific advisers set up by the government to detect variants of the coronavirus, he told Reuters on Sunday, weeks after questioning the authorities' handling of the pandemic.Shahid Jameel, chair of the scientific advisory group of the forum known as INSACOG, declined to give a reason for his resignation."I am not obliged to give a reason," he said in a text message, adding that he quit on Friday.Renu Swarup, the secretary of the Department of Biotechnology that oversees INSACOG, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan also did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.Another INSACOG member said he was not aware of any direct disagreements between Jameel and the government.A top government scientist who is part of the forum said, on the condition of anonymity, that he did not think the departure of Jameel would hamper INSACOG's monitoring of virus variants.Reuters reported earlier this month that INSACOG, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genetics Consortium, warned government officials in early March of a new and more contagious variant of the coronavirus taking hold in the country. The variant, B.1.617, is one of the reasons India is currently battling the world's worst surge in COVID-19 cases.Asked why the government did not respond more forcefully to the findings, for example by restricting large gatherings, Jameel had told Reuters that he was concerned that authorities were not paying enough attention to the evidence as they set policy.
