13-05-2021||New Delhi||Demands by states for increasing vaccine quota arouse ‘narrow political passion among masses’: Vardhan||Amid demands by states for increasing vaccine quota, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said such calls arouse “narrow political passion among the masses which harm the whole-of-government approach to tackle the pandemic”.He made these remarks during his interaction with health ministers and principal secretaries or additional chief secretaries of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Delhi.On the common demand from several health ministers to increase the quota of vaccines for their states, Vardhan explained the factors that have shaped the vaccination policy, the Health Ministry said in a statement.“88 per cent of the fatalities were in the age group of 45+ which prompted us to open the vaccination to that group in a gradual manner. However, states depending on their own situation can opt for vaccination of other age groups through direct procurement now. The lack of availability of a second dose has been taken into consideration when guidelines for reserving 70 per cent of vaccines were framed,” he was quoted as saying.He also informed about the monthly production capacity of the vaccines and reassured the states that vaccines will be distributed equitably.Production capacity is being steadily ramped up and will touch 8 crore doses by May and 9 crore by June, the statement said.“He stated that this demand for more vaccines from state leadership arouses narrow political passion among the masses which harms the ‘whole-of-government’ approach to tackle the pandemic. The state health ministers requested for the formation of a common policy of procurement of vaccines from foreign manufacturers,” the statement said.Vardhan said that under the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, along with free vaccination under government channel, states can use the non-government channel to have a holistic vaccination coverage of their population.Every month, 50 per cent of the vaccine doses of every manufacturer would be available for direct procurement by the state governments and private hospitals while the Centre would continue to procure its share of 50 per cent of the vaccines and continue to make it available to the states totally free of cost as was being done earlier.He also pointed out that various measures are being taken by the Centre to enhance vaccine availability in the country. Vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed and are being manufactured in foreign countries. Emergency approval for restricted use by USFDA, EMA, UK MHRA, PMDA Japan or listed in WHO (Emergency Use Listing) may be granted emergency use approval in India.During the meeting, Vardhan also noted that the B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV-2 has contributed to the rise of cases in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi and advised all the states to regularly send samples to INSACOG labs for tracking of emerging variants of the virus.He suggested steps taken by the experts to curb the spread, adding “the strategy remains the same irrespective of the variants”.He also stressed on the continued need to follow COVID appropriate behaviour along with renewed and stringent focus on containment measures for addressing the present surge, the health ministry statement said.Vardhan advised the states to have a long-term planning to tackle COVID-19. Many states have been fighting the pandemic for more than a year which has gradually exhausted the medical workforce and the public health machinery, the statement said.The minister suggested that states take a pro-active role in ensuring the rotation of workforce and their regular counselling regarding their duty.Health ministers of Maharashtra (Rajesh Tope), Karnataka (K Sudhakar), Kerala (K Shailaja), Tamil Nadu (M Subramanian), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma) and Delhi (Satyendra Jain) virtually attended the meeting, the statement said.Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director NCDC, presented the epidemiological findings and a granular analysis of the COVID trajectory in the states. He pointed out that the apparent shift of COVID-19 towards lower age groups is driven by the fact that higher age groups have been vaccinated in considerable proportion by now.He suggested ramping up of testing and vaccination in peri-urban areas as the spread is now going to peri-urban and rural places. He cautioned against the spread of the infection to the rural areas, as the health infrastructure in the rural regions of the country is not adequately equipped to deal with the rising number of cases, the statement said.He also urged the states to send samples for genome sequencing to identify the role of variants in severity and transmission, it stated.Vardhan said “although in the last 24 hours, 3.62 lakh new cases were registered, a net decline of 6,426 cases was recorded in the active caseload. At the moment we have over 37,10,525 active cases. Unfortunately we have lost 4,120 lives in the last 24 hours.”       Detailing on the performance of states, he noted that Maharashtra continuously struggling from COVID-19 second wave since January although the decline of cases in Mumbai and Pune is significant.At the beginning, only few districts of Vidarbha region were a matter of concern in January. However, now 30 districts are affected including Kolhapur, Satara and Beed registering high transmission rate.Similarly, Ajmer, Jodhpur and Bhilwara in Rajasthan, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Mallapuram, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, Bengaluru (Urban), Mysuru, Bellary, Tumkur in Karnataka, Chennai, Coimbatore, Chengalpattu, Madurai, Thiruvallur in Tamil Nadu were also flagged as districts of concern, the statement said.While Bengaluru contributes nearly half the active cases in Karnataka, in Madurai 1.48 per cent and in Chennai 1.32 per cent case fatality rate is higher than that of the state and the country.

13-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Online fraudsters cheat people by posing as Remdesivir dealers||Maharashtra Cyber, the state police’s cyber wing, has registered a case against online fraudsters who cheated people by posing as dealers of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19, an official said on Thursday.In several of these cases, the unidentified accused sent water and fake medicines in vials labelled with the manufacturer’s name and logo, after receiving money through online transactions, the official said.The action was taken based on a complaint lodged on Wednesday by a prominent pharma company that manufactures and distributes Remdesivir and Tocilizumab across the country, he said.According to the complainant, a few mobile numbers were posted on WhatsApp groups and social media platforms, claiming that these were contact details of authorized dealers of the pharma company, the official said.When people called on these phone numbers, the accused would ask them to make 50 per cent payment for the medicines through online transactions, he said.After the payment was made, the caller would tell the customer that the medicines are on the way or will be made available within a few hours, following which mobile phone would get switched off, he said.The pharma company started receiving mails about the fraud from April 27 onwards and the number of such complaints were increasing, he said.Preliminary investigations have revealed that several needy people had paid the entire cost of the medicines in advance, the official said.An FIR under sections 420 (cheating) among other provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Information Technology Act (2000), The Trademarks Act (1999) and Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) has been registered in this regard, he said.The investigation team has also issued directives to relevant telecom service providers to seek details of the numbers used for the fraud, and have approached banks to freeze the accounts to which the online transactions were made, he said.

13-05-2021||Cooch Behar (WB)||West Bengal governor Dhankar shown black flags in Cooch Behar||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar was on Thursday shown black flags at Sitalkuchi, where four villagers died after firing by central forces during the elections, while “go back” slogans were raised at Dinhata during his visit to Cooch Behar district to meet people allegedly affected in post poll violence.Earlier in the day, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar who is on a controversial visit to assess post-poll violence in the district said he was shocked by incidents of attacks following the West Bengal assembly elections.“The country is facing a COVID crisis, and West Bengal is facing twin challenges of the pandemic and unprecedented post-poll violence only (as) some people decided to vote as per their own choice,” he said.The run up to the visit was marked by a war of words between the Governor and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee with the chief minister writing a letter on Wednesday claiming the visit violated established norms as it was being undertaken unilaterally without consultations with the state government.She also claimed the Governor was by-passing the state council of ministers and dictating directly to state officials, which was violative of the constitution.An agitated Dhankhar came out of his car at Dinhata and reprimanded police officials for allegedly not acting to prevent slogan-shouting protesters, who numbered around 15 and had assembled with posters saying “BJP’s governor go back”.“I am shocked, this is total collapse of rule of law, I could never imagine such a thing could happen,” he told reporters.Police officials chased the protesters away from the spot.“I have seen fear in the eyes of people and they are afraid to go to the police station to file complaints,” Dhankhar said about his interaction with people in post-poll hit villages.The Governor visited Mathabhanga, Sitalkuchi, Sitai and Dinhata and talked to people who claimed to have suffered attacks at the hands of ruling Trinamool Congress supporters after election results were announced on May 2.Dhankhar, who visited several households at the four places, said “homes have been looted and even ornaments kept for girl’s marriage, utensils and other items for ‘shradh’ were taken away.”The governor was also shown black flags by some persons at Golokganj when his convoy travelled from Mathabhanga to Sitalkuchi, as a posse of policemen put up human walls to prevent protesters from coming down on to the road.Posters and placards criticising the visit of the governor were also seen at Jorpatki in Sitalkuchi, the scene of firing by central armed police force personnel that killed four persons on April 10 during the fourth phase of polling in the West Bengal assembly elections.“History will judge Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister. History will also judge Jagdeep Dhankhar, the governor, and it will judge the bureaucracy and the media,” Dhankar said, interacting with the media.Claiming that he did not get any response from the state government despite efforts being made to get information about the post-poll violence, Dhankhar said the state government must provide him with required information under Article 167 of the Constitution.The Governor pointed out that “during elections, she (the chief minister) had publicly said the central armed police force will not be there always and she will see after that.“This kind of challenge and behaviour is not acceptable under the constitution,” he added.BJP MP Nisith Pramanik accompanied the governor during his visit to the areas, where the saffron party has alleged loot and attack on its workers.Some women wailed and fell to the feet of the governor claiming that all their belongings were looted and that the men of their families had fled their homes to escape attacks.Reacting to the visit, veteran TMC MP and party spokesperson Sougata Ray said “He (Dhankhar) did not listen to the state government and went to Cooch Behar. He went there in the company of a BJP leader. His conduct is unconstitutional”.“Previously we had written a letter to the president against this governor. If the CM says, we will send another letter against him to the president,” Ray said.The TMC in December last year had written to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking to remove Jagdeep Dhankhar from the post of governor, accusing him of “transgressing constitutional limits” by regularly commenting against the state administration in public.Terming the Governors conduct as unbecoming, senior TMC leader and minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay added “the governor is doing politics over stray post-poll incidents, (to contain) which the state government has taken all necessary steps. He is doing politics when the state is busy fighting the pandemic. We wish that the governor and the state government work together to fight the Covid situation.The governor said he will on Friday visit camps in Assam where BJP workers, who reportedly fled from West Bengal owing to the post-poll violence, have been staying.

13-05-2021||Vibha Sharma||Farmer leaders plan for UP, spell more trouble for Yogi Adityanath||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 13Enthused with the outcome of the West Bengal Assembly and Uttar Pradesh panchayat polls, farmer leaders are now planning to pitch their fight against the three central farm laws to take on BJP’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who faces his biggest test next year.  As Adityanath struggles against a barrage of negative perceptions amid the raging corona pandemic—lack of health facilities, oxygen shortage, and bodies floating in rivers—ahead of the 2022 polls, senior BKU leaders from UP say “it is obvious” that the ramifications of the agitation will be felt in their home state and neighbouring Uttarakhand which too has a BJP government.        Senior BKU leader Yudhvir Singh said given the situation in the state, the leadership has asked supporters to stay at home and safe. “Otherwise, it barely takes three-four hours to collect supporters, but we don’t want to do that. It is obvious that if the government does not agree to our demands over the three farm laws and the MSP and the agitation stretches further, the effect will be seen both in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand elections.“The Samyukta Kisan Morcha has not yet formally discussed the issue but UP is BKU’s home state and it is obvious the rural population will show their anger against those responsible for the three laws and the complete mishandling situation of the Covid situation,” he said.The results of the Zila Panchayat elections are being seen as a barometer of the public mood in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Assembly elections. The Samajwadi Party emerging at the top, followed by the BJP and the BSP has thrown opened exciting new possibilities of electoral combinations in the key state that goes to polls next year.In these elections, the RLD, which lost its supremo Ajit Singh to Covid recently, contested with the SP. Notably at the first ‘mahapanchayat’ in the region in January this year, BKU president Naresh Tikait admitted that it was “their mistake” to support BJP candidate, Union Minister Sanjiv Balyan, against RLD chief Ajit Singh in the last Lok Sabha elections. In the circumstances, it will be interesting to see which way rural population swings in Assembly elections, especially in the Western UP considered to be the domain of the RLD.  The RLD had been relegated to the sidelines after the Muzaffarnagar riots.Meanwhile, the AAP too managed to do well for itself in the rural bodies’ elections.                     Observers say the panchayat elections were “the precursor to political mobilisation in poll-bound UP among ticket seekers of legislative assembly and leaders at the grassroots level and an indication of the public mood. Dissatisfaction against Yogi Adityanath Government on various fronts is out in open”.While worried BJP leaders claim that due to the Corona pandemic many of their workers and leaders could not campaign effectively. setbacks in Ayodhya, Varanasi, and Mathura, the key centres of its Hindutva politics indicate that the saffron party needs a better strategy and ideas than the traditional planks in all parts — central, eastern, and western UP.The observers say results from eastern and central parts indicate “dissatisfaction against the BJP” beyond western UP, which has been among the hot spots of ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three central farm laws.Apart from the permanent protest site led by BKU’s Rakesh Tikait at Ghazipur, the region witnessed a series of ‘mahapanchayats’ supported by rural communities across the board, including Muslims, and non-farm castes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-leaders-plan-for-up-spell-more-trouble-for-yogi-adityanath-252366
13-05-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: Sweden working closely with partners in India, says envoy||Sweden on Thursday said it is working closely with partners in India to get an understanding of what is required on the ground, saying the second wave of COVID-19 has hit hard and it is a humanitarian crisis and requires to be treated that way.Team Sweden, which comprises the Swedish government, Swedish industry, businesses and agencies, has joined forces to help India fight the current devastating surge of the coronavirus, Sweden’s Ambassador to India Klas Molin said.“The second wave of Covid has hit hard and close to home, sparing no one. It is a humanitarian crisis and requires to be treated that way.“We are working closely with partners in India to get an understanding of what is required on ground. It is heartening to see so many stepping up to the challenge - from government and large companies to individuals, including the Indian diaspora community in Sweden. Each contributing to make a difference,” he said.There are approximately 220 Swedish companies in India which employ close to 2,00,000 people directly and another 22,00,000 indirectly. Like the rest of the country, almost every company has lost employees, or their family members, to COVID-19, Molin said.The Swedish Chamber of Commerce India (SCCI) has launched an initiative under Kraftsamla (which in Swedish means to join forces), to coordinate all efforts being made locally that can broadly be classified under saving lives, livelihood, prevention and building for the future, he said.Swedish companies are involved in strengthening and assisting local healthcare systems via support to local hospitals with medical equipment like ventilators, oxygen concentrators among others, setting up of COVID-care facilities, infrastructure and technical know-how, he said.Kamal Bali, managing director of Volvo India and chairperson of SCCI, said that the second wave of COVID-19 in India has been highly virulent and fast spreading, and this can truly overwhelm the best of administrations or healthcare systems anywhere.“It is indeed gratifying to see the willingness and coordinated response of the Swedish companies in supporting lives and livelihoods with an outreach to employees, families and communities.“The Swedish companies are engaged in creating Covid care centres, bringing oxygen concentrators, vaccination campaigns and will continue to do more, together with the local administration,” said Bali.The Swedish Chamber is also working with issues around livelihood for migrant workers, women and children, as well as mental health and trauma counselling.While the Chamber manages efforts in India, the Sweden India Business Council (SIBC) in Stockholm is coordinating with headquarters of Swedish businesses.According to Robin Sukhia, secretary general and president of SIBC, from Sweden, industry will fund medical supplies, distribution, medical care and support to urban and rural India.This will be done through established Indian NGOs such as Pratham, Indian Red Cross Society and Doctors without Borders, among others, via their Swedish or international organisations. So far, the total amount raised outside India is USD 5.2 million.“The rapid and substantial response from Swedish industry to the sad situation in India affecting our friends, families and colleagues was notable and encouraging. The companies and their head offices have mounted a great response to support the medical situation,” said Marcus Wallenberg, Chairman of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, a North European financial group.Sweden has also donated 200 oxygen concentrators to India.It supports the Indian Red Cross through International Federation of Red Cross (IFCR).The current Swedish support to IFCR is 70 million Swedish Krona (USD 8.2 million).Sweden is the fourth largest contributor to the international vaccine initiative COVAX and has announced an additional support of 1 million doses of the vaccine to COVAX.

Kaun lagayega vaccination (who will get vaccinated), when there is no vaccination. What is the point of the message,” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.“You should give it to everyone. Even if you are going to take money, give it. That is what even children are saying,” the Bench said and added that the government needs to be “innovative” in such things.The court said the government should prepare more such messages instead of preparing just one and running it always.“Till like a tape it stops running or starts skipping, you will run it for 10 years,” it said.The Bench said the government, state or Centre, have to react to the situation on the ground.“So please have more of them (dialler messages). When a person hears a different one every time, maybe it will help him/her,” the court said.It also suggested using TV anchors or producers to create programmes, on making people aware about use of oxygen concentrators and cylinders or on vaccination, of short durations which can be aired on all channels.It also said that celebs like Amitabh Bachchan can be asked to chip in and that all this “needs to be done soon”.The court said that a lot of “publicity and propaganda” was there last year on washing of hands regularly and wearing of masks and now there should be similar audio-visual initiatives on use of oxygen, concentrators, medications, etc.“We are losing time. There should be a sense of urgency,” the Bench said and directed the Centre and Delhi government to file their reports by May 18 on what steps they are going to take for disseminating information on COVID management via print and TV media and also dialler tunes.

His condition is stated to be stable there.In 2018, a Jodhpur court sentenced Asaram to life imprisonment for raping a minor at his ashram in Rajasthan five years earlier.

13-05-2021||London||COVID-19 levels fall in UK as health officials review variant found in India||The number of people infected with the coronavirus in England fell by almost half over the past month, marking the lowest level of COVID-19 cases since last year, according to new statistics released in London on Thursday.The Imperial College London led Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) study comes as it emerged that the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) is due to hold a review meeting on Thursday to discuss the Variant of Concern (VOC) first identified in India, which UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Parliament was of “increasing concern” as it may be "considerably more transmissible" than the dominant variant in the UK first detected in the county of Kent last year.The variant B.1.617.2 is one of three subtypes of the mutation first detected in India and was designated as a VOC by Public Health England (PHE), with over 800 cases being traced in parts of the country."The scientists on SAGE will make their assessments, they will report back to the government and we will make decisions based on the data and the evidence that they provide,” said James Cleverly, UK Foreign Office minister.It is feared that the June 21 date set in the UK government's complete lockdown easing roadmap may be impacted from the SAGE analysis. The European Medicines Agency has said that it is "pretty confident" that vaccines currently in use are effective against the variant B.1.617.2, which remains the view of scientists in the UK at this stage.Meanwhile, the REACT-1 study, based on over 127,000 home swab tests taken between April 15 and May 3, shows that 0.1 per cent of the population is currently infected, or one in 1,000.This compares with the study's previous testing round when 0.2 per cent or one in 500 had the coronavirus as of March 30. The researchers report that since January, the link between the rate of infections, hospitalisations and deaths has become decoupled, with infections associated with fewer hospitalisations and deaths which likely reflects the impact of the vaccination programme.“It is very encouraging that infections have continued to fall while rules have been relaxed in England, and it's likely that the vaccine rollout has played a key part in helping keep the virus at bay,” said Professor Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme from Imperial's School of Public Health."We need to continue to monitor trends in the coming weeks as restrictions are eased further, and in the meantime, we must continue to stick to the rules to help keep infections down and enable the vaccination programme to continue to protect people,” he said.The study also analysed the genetic code of a small number of positive swab samples to look for variants and while the majority were found to be the so-called Kent variant, the VOC from India was also found in London based on analysis of samples taken for routine testing.Professor Steven Riley, Professor of Infectious Disease Dynamics at Imperial, said: “The fact that our study detected the Indian variant among a small number of samples could because for concern.“At the moment it's unclear whether this variant is more transmissible than B.1.1.7, but this is a risk, so it will be important to closely monitor infections and hospitalisations in areas where this virus is present so that public health responses can be implemented if needed.”The REACT-1 study, carried out by Imperial College London in partnership with Ipsos MORI is tracking current coronavirus infections in the community by testing more than 125,000 randomly-selected people each month over roughly a two-week period. The study recruits new people each month to help ensure the sample represents the wider population and offers a high-resolution snapshot of the situation across a particular time period. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-levels-fall-in-uk-as-health-officials-review-variant-found-in-india-252322

13-05-2021||New Delhi||Reports of faulty ventilators supplied to Punjab hospital unfounded: Centre||The Centre on Thursday dismissed as "unfounded" media reports suggesting ventilators supplied by the Union government under the PM CARES Fund to GGS Medical College and Hospital in Punjab's Faridkot are lying unused due to technical glitches which have not been resolved. In a statement, the Union health ministry said lack of infrastructure at the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College (GGSMC) and Hospital has resulted in the malfunctioning of the life-saving machines. In order to augment the existing hospital infrastructure, the Union government has been centrally procuring and providing states/union territories/central hospitals/institutes with essential medical devices including ventilators since April 2020, the ministry said in its statement. “There have been some media reports suggesting that government of India supplied ventilators (supported by PM- CARES) to GGS Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, Punjab are lying unused as a result of technical glitches which have not been resolved due to poor after-sales support by the manufacturers,” the ministry said in the statement. "These reports seem to be unfounded, not having the full information on the matter," it said. With reference to the recent media report regarding 71 of 80 AgVa make ventilators being non-functional or faulty at the hospital, it is clarified that 88 ventilators have been supplied by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and five by AgVa.After successful installation and commissioning, these ventilators were provided with final acceptance certificate by the hospital authorities, the statement said. BEL has informed that the bulk of the ventilators are not faulty, as are being reported in a section of the media, the statement said.Their engineers have visited the medical college on different occasions to address the complaints received and carried out minor repairs required promptly. They have even conducted repeated demonstrations of the functioning of the ventilators to the staff over there, the statement stated.It was observed that there are problems with the infrastructure at the hospital including non-availability of required pressure in the central oxygen gas pipelines.  Further, consumables like flow sensors, bacteria filters and HME filters are not being changed by the hospital authorities according to the prescribed norms, or the ventilators are being used without these important consumable items, the statement said. Maintenance of correct gas pressures as difference between air pressure and oxygen pressure cannot be more than 10 PSI and use of proper consumables are essential requirements, without which performance of CV200 ventilators is not guaranteed, it said. BEL engineers visited GGSMC again on Thursday and made five ventilators functional only by replacing a few consumables and demonstrated their optimum performance to the GGSMCH authorities, thereby, making it evident that when operated properly, the ventilators will provide reliable performance, the statement said.  In addition to the instructions given in the user manual, detailed instructions and guidelines have also been issued to all the ventilator users regarding infrastructure requirements, proper usage and maintenance of the CV200 ventilators, it said. However, these are not being followed by many hospitals/medical colleges in Punjab. They have been, instead, raising the issue of ventilators being non-functional without any basis, the ministry said. It is clarified that BEL will continue to provide all the technical support required by the state in meeting the ventilator requirement during this pandemic situation, it stressed. Ventilators were available in very limited numbers in government hospitals across the country at the beginning of the pandemic last year, the statement said. Moreover, very limited manufacturing of ventilators was taking place in the country and most of the suppliers abroad were not in a position to send the machines in large quantities to India, it said.  That is when local manufacturers were encouraged to produce ‘Make in India' ventilators to address the huge projected demand and many of them were first time manufacturers, it said.  The ventilator models went through rigorous screening, technical demonstration and clinical validation process in the very limited time available for the same, through domain knowledge experts, and after their approval, these were put into supplies, the statement said. There are a few states which have received the ventilators but are yet to get these installed in their hospitals. The Union health secretary has written to seven such states on April 11 which still have more than 50 ventilators lying uninstalled with them for the last 4-5 months, it said.  They have been requested to get the installation expedited so that the ventilators can be put to optimal use, the statement said. In addition, the Union health ministry has written to states and UTs on May 9 informing them once again of the helpline numbers of ventilator manufactures, which are also available on the devices in the form of stickers.  In addition, information has again been provided of state wise WhatsApp groups created with the concerned nodal officers of states/UTs, representatives of the user hospitals and technical teams of the manufacturers in order to address any technical issues in real time, the statement said. Dedicated e-mail addresses of these manufacturers have also been shared with the states and UTs, it added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reports-of-faulty-ventilators-supplied-to-punjab-hospital-unfounded-centre-252317

When the boy was found hanging from a rope around 6.30 pm, he was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead," the official said.Although the primary probe and the boy's parents have confirmed the death-by-stunt theory, the police are also investigating the suicide angle, as his parents had recently prohibited him from using the mobile phone, he said.The victim's friends and parents have told the police that he was fond of singing, dancing and performing stunts, he said, adding that the boy had shot and uploaded numerous videos of stunts on TikTok and other platforms."It is possible that the boy died while performing some stunt with the rope.

But in 1988, he was arrested on the murder charge and I was then just a month old. Since then he attempted to escape four times from the jail and each time he was caught," she added.Following Sivaji's arrest, his wife had committed suicide after one year, and by that time their she grew up in the company of her maternal grandmother who is presently 90-year-old.As time passed by, Ajitha heard about Sivaji's name from her relatives and much later she realised it was her father and is currently lodged in a jail."The first time when I decided to meet my father was after a TV programme telecast inside the jail premise, and then I found out that my father was lodged at the central jail in the state capital. I had then started planning to meet him and got in touch with the local CPI-M leaders at Palakkad, where I live with my husband (who works in a food unit at Kozhikode) and three children," Ajitha said.Although officials did their best to help her, but the only hurdle according to Ajitha was the son of that slain Congress leader, who is now a police official."Even though the maximum sentence for a crime of this nature is 14 years and even when the extension is applied for each jail break, he ought to be free after 16 years, but what I was told is that the report against him inside the jail premise is bad and hence he continues to be there," added Ajitha.She said a glimmer of hope emerged last year, when the court decided to give parole for prisoners on account of Covid, but her father failed to get that benefit."But this time, when the apex court ruled again to give parole, my father got it and I came from Palakkad on Wednesday and met my father for the first time. We took the night train and reached home on Thursday morning. My three kids and we are all happy, that we could finally get to see my father. We are all really delighted and the parole is now for three months, after which he will have to go back. Meanwhile, we will also try to see if he can get remission," added Ajitha. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-human-dimension-series-jailed-father-meets-daughter-for-first-time-in-33-years-252311

13-05-2021||Moscow||Russia records first cases of Indian COVID variant: Kommersant||Russia has recorded its first cases of the variant of COVID-19 first found in India, Kommersant newspaper reported on Thursday, citing authorities in the Ulyanovsk region.The regional branch of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said it had recorded 16 cases of the variant among Indian students at Ulyanovsk State University, some 700 kilometres (435 miles) east of Moscow.Dilyar Khakimov, an official at the watchdog, told Kommersant that the students had been put in self-isolation and were under medical observation.Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova had previously said the country had not recorded any cases of the variant.The World Health Organization said on Monday that the coronavirus variant first identified in India last year was being classified as a variant of global concern, with some preliminary studies showing that it spreads more easily.India is in deep crisis in the current wave of COVID-19 infections with around 350,000 cases and 4,000 deaths being reported daily. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-records-first-cases-of-indian-covid-variant-kommersant-252301
13-05-2021||Washington||US regularly engages with Indian officials on human rights issues: Official||The US regularly engages with Indian officials at all levels, encouraging them to uphold human rights obligations and commitments, including the protection of minorities, in keeping with India's long tradition of democratic values and its history of tolerance, a senior State Department official in-charge of international religious freedom has said.Speaking at a briefing on the 2020 International Religious Freedom Report released by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken presented at the State Department on Wednesday, Dan Nadel, the senior official for the Office of International Religious Freedom said American officials also meet continuously with civil society organisations, local religious communities, to hear their views and understand challenges and opportunities that they see.The report took note of the message of “unity and brotherhood” by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after members of the Tablighi Jamaat last year were being targeted in the wake of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country.“Prime Minister Modi tweeted on April 19, “COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood.”,” the State Department noted. The India section of the annual report also mentioned the online address to the nation on April 26 by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in which he urged the people not to discriminate against anyone in the fight against COVID-19.At the briefing, Nadel said US officials regularly engage with Indian government officials at all levels, encouraging them to uphold human rights obligations and commitments, including the protection of minorities, in keeping with India's long tradition of democratic values and its history of tolerance. "We also meet continuously with civil society organisations, local religious communities to hear their views and understand challenges and opportunities that they see," Nadel said in response to a question on the general assessment of the US on the religious freedom situation in India.When it comes to America's overall encouragement to the Government of India, he said it is to engage these communities, these outside actors in direct discourse."Because when laws are passed, when initiatives are undertaken that are done without effective consultation with these communities, it creates a sense of disempowerment; at times, of alienation. And the best way to address that is to engage in that direct dialogue between government and civil society, including religious communities," he said."So with respect to India, I think there's genuine opportunities there for the government to address some of the concerns they hear from Indian civil society through greater dialogue and engagement," Nadel said.India has previously rejected the US religious freedom reports, saying it sees no locus standi for a foreign government to pronounce on the state of its citizens' constitutionally protected rights.Earlier, releasing the report, Secretary of State Blinken said that anti-Semitism was on the rise worldwide, including in the United States, as well as across Europe. It's a dangerous ideology that history has shown is often linked with violence. “We must vigorously oppose it wherever it occurs,” he said.“Anti-Muslim hatred is still widespread in many countries, and this, too, is a serious problem for the United States, as well as in Europe. We have work to do to ensure that people of all faiths and backgrounds are treated with equal dignity and respect. As this report notes, some countries have taken positive steps forward, and that, too, deserves comment,” Blinken said.Welcoming the report, the Federation of Indian American Christian Organizations (FIACONA) president Koshy George claimed that he is worried that the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities continues even during the coronavirus lockdown. “Prime Minister Modi's silence on these critical issues is very disheartening,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-regularly-engages-with-indian-officials-on-human-rights-issues-official-252300

Incidentally, most of the bodies were wrapped in a saffron cloth. However, there was no confirmation if these bodies were of Covid patients.Unnao District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar said, "Some people do not burn the bodies but bury them in the sand by the river. After I got information, I have sent officials to the spot. I have asked them to carry out an enquiry, and we will take action."Also read: Govt must be held accountable for 'failing' its people, says Akhilesh after bodies found floating in GangaThe bodies were mainly found buried at the Rautapur Ganga Ghat in  Hajipur area.Meanwhile, there is panic among the locals after it was found that bodies were being buried in sand on the banks of the river.Shirish Gupta, a local businessman, said: "Monsoon is barely a month away and once the Ganga river becomes flooded with water, these bodies will be washed ashore. The district administration should exhume the bodies and perform a proper cremation."Officials were tight-lipped on the suggestion."It could create a law-and-order problem if we take out the bodies. We will see what best can be done," said a senior district official.Sources said that ever since the death toll in the ongoing pandemic began rising, the prices of performing cremation have also shot up."A package for cremation according to Hindu rites, is now between Rs 15,000 to 20,000. It is obvious that poor people cannot afford it, and they are opting for riverside burials," said Gupta.It may be recalled that on Monday, scores of dead bodies had been washed up on the banks of Ganga in Ghazipur and Ballia districts. Bodies were also found in Buxar in Bihar.Hindus revere the Ganga as the holiest of rivers but consigning bodies to it is not part of any religion's traditions, including Hinduism. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dead-bodies-found-buried-on-banks-of-ganga-in-ups-unnao-panic-among-locals-252287

We collect medicines from housing societies and provide them to those who cannot afford them," Dr Marcus Ranney told ANI."The idea came when one of the family members of our staff got infected from Covid and they needed medication. As you know the medicines can be expensive. At that time there were a few people who had recovered from Covid, so we decided to take their medicines and donate them," said Dr Raina. "After that, we took the help from 7-8 people of neighbouring buildings and set up a team and started this mission with the objective of helping those who cannot go out to buy medicines or anyone who can't afford the Covid medicines," she added. The couple has collected 20 kilograms of unused Covid-19 medicines from recovered patients in just 10 days. These medicines will be donated to the primary health care centres in rural districts across India for the timely treatment of the underprivileged, who are infected Covid-19."We have now 100 buildings that are sending medicines to us.

The exact contributions of these each of these factors on increased transmission in India are not well understood,” it said.The update said that approximately 0.1% of positive samples in India have been sequenced and uploaded to GISAID to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. GISAID enables rapid and open access to epidemic and pandemic virus data.The WHO update said that "the prevalence of several VOCs including B.1.1.7 and B.1.612 sublineages increased concurrent to the surge in COVID-19 cases reported in India." "Since the identification of these variants through late April 2021, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 accounted for 21% and 7% of sequenced samples from India,” the update said, adding that preliminary analyses conducted by WHO using sequences submitted to GISAID suggests that B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 have a substantially higher growth rate than other circulating variants in India, suggesting potential increased transmissibility compared.The update said that outside of India, the UK has reported the largest number of cases sequenced as B.1.617 sub-lineages, and recently designated B.1.617.2 as a “national variant of concern.”        Giving a global overview of the COVID19 situation, the update said that the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths globally decreased slightly this week, with over 5.5 million cases and over 90,000 deaths."While India continues to account for 95% of cases and 93% of deaths in the South-East Asia Region, as well as 50% of global cases and 30% of global deaths, worrying trends have been observed in neighbouring countries,” it said.The highest numbers of new cases were reported from India (2,738,957 new cases; 5% increase), Brazil (423,438 new cases; similar to previous week), the USA (334,784 new cases; 3% decrease), Turkey (166,733 new cases; 35% decrease), and Argentina (140,771 new cases; 8% decrease).The South-East Asia Region reported over 2.8 million new cases and just under 29,000 new deaths, a 6% and a 15% increase respectively compared to the previous week.

13-05-2021||New Delhi||China, India spar over hike in prices of medical supplies||Beijing and New Delhi are now sparring over the hike in prices of medical devices as well as cargo flight rates as Indian entrepreneurs scramble to get urgently needed supplies from China.India’s envoy in Hong Kong Priyanka Chauhan has said price instability of products in China and transport disruptions had affected India’s attempt to deal with the second Covid wave.“Our expectation is that the supply chain should remain open and product prices should remain stable,” she said in an interview.Taking Beijing’s side, state-owned media house Global Times said Chinese oxygen concentrator suppliers are “upset and saddened by price-gouging of anti-virus devices such as theirs’’ in the Indian market.“Many Chinese producers have exported oxygen making items to India at below-market prices by working extra shifts for timely delivery, even during the recent May Day holiday, to ensure the much-needed goods are delivered to those who badly need them,” complained the Global Times.Government-to-government ties between India and China have been frosty. During a conversation with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last month, S Jaishankar walked around a Chinese offer to offer aid. Instead, he wanted Beijing to address the supply disruptions for commercially sourced oxygen concentrators and other medical supplies from China.Reports say the demand from India has led to the doubling of prices as well as high cargo rates. “Even if there is a little bit of supply demand pressure, there has to be some stability and predictability to product prices. And there has to be a sense of governmental level support and efforts,” said Chauhan. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-india-spar-over-hike-in-prices-of-medical-supplies-252073

The system is indigenously developed for operation in field conditions and is robust. It can be effectively used to treat Covid-19 patients.Warship arrives with O2Navy warship, INS Tarkash, carrying two liquid medical oxygen filled cryogenic containers and 230 Oxygen cylinders arrived at Mumbai port on WednesdayTwo variants of the system have been configured. The basic version consists of a 10-litre oxygen cylinder, a pressure regulator-cum-flow controller, a humidifier and a nasal cannula. The oxygen flow is regulated manually based on the O2 readings of person. In the second configuration, the oxygen cylinder is equipped with electronic controls which automatically regulate the oxygen flow through a low-pressure regulator.The device optimises the consumption of oxygen and effectively increases the endurance of portable oxygen cylinder. The value for initiating flow of oxygen from the system can be adjusted by the health staff. The system also provides suitable audio warning for various failure scenarios including low values. A mask is integrated with the systems for efficient use.These systems can be used at homes, quarantine centres, Covid care centres and hospitals. The DRDO has transferred the technology to multiple industries in India which will be producing the Oxycare systems, the Ministry of Defence said .Meanwhile, Indian Navy warship, INS Tarkash, carrying two Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) filled cryogenic containers and 230 Oxygen cylinders arrived at Mumbai port today. — TNS/PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-nod-to-purchase-1-5l-units-of-drdo-developed-oxycare-252069

The leaders said the pandemic had assumed unprecedented dimensions of a human catastrophe.“We have repeatedly in the past drawn your attention, independently and jointly, to the various measures that are absolutely imperative for the Central Government to undertake and implement. Unfortunately, your government has either ignored or refused all these suggestions. This only compounded the situation to reach such an apocalyptic human tragedy,” they said.

13-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid was preventable, WHO could’ve sounded alarm sooner: Global panel||The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR), which spent the last eight months reviewing evidence of the spread of Covid-19, concluded on Wednesday that the pandemic was preventable and the World Health Organisation could have sounded the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) alarm sooner.Also read: Onus on high-income nations: panelDocumenting what happened and why, the panel said, “Covid-19 was a preventable disaster. A combination of poor strategic choices, unwillingness to tackle inequalities, and an uncoordinated system created a toxic cocktail which allowed the pandemic to turn into a catastrophic human crisis.”Examining the time the WHO took to declare Covid-19 a PHEIC on January 30 last year, the panel said, “A PHEIC is the loudest alarm the WHO Director-General can sound. The panel’s view is that the outbreak in Wuhan is likely to have met the criteria to be declared a PHEIC by the time of the first meeting of the emergency committee on January 22, 2020.”The PHEIC was declared eight days later on January 30. The panel found weak links at every point in the chain of preparedness and response and said the preparation was inconsistent and underfunded and the alert system was too slow and too meek.‘Global political leadership was absent…The escalation of the pandemic could have been prevented but the declaration of PHEIC did not lead to an urgent, coordinated, worldwide response. It was not until the number of Covid-19 cases increased dramatically that governments took serious action to prevent transmission. February was a lost month of opportunity to contain the outbreak,” said the committee the WHO convened last May to report on the lessons learnt from Covid.For the future, the committee called upon the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and WHO to convene a meeting of major vaccine-producing countries and manufacturers to agree to voluntary licensing and technology transfer for Covid vaccines.“If actions do not occur within three months, a waiver of intellectual property rights under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights should come into force immediately,” the panel said backing patent waivers for affordable vaccine access.It also urged high income countries to provide to the 92 low and middle income countries at least one billion vaccine doses no later than September 1 and more than two billion doses by mid-2022 and called upon the G-7 to urgently commit to providing 60 per cent of the $19 billion required for global efforts in 2021 for vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, and strengthening of health systems.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-was-preventable-who-couldve-sounded-alarm-sooner-global-panel-252048

13-05-2021||Vijay Mohan||AI-based tool to detect COVID-19 from sound of cough developed||Tribune News ServiceMohali, May 12A novel online tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can detect COVID-19 infection in an individual by analysing the sound of coughing has been developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in Mohali.The tool, christened ‘Vaani Mitr’, only requires people to submit a brief recording of coughing through a mobile phone or a laptop, which would then be processed to determine their status in real time. It can be used by anyone at anytime from anywhere.A large data base is fundamental for AI tools to be effective. For the purpose, a data bank for coughing sounds of both, COVID-19 positive as well as COVID-19 negative persons is being built up by C-DAC, against which the samples are compared.“COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, which in turn causes subtle changes in the sounds produced during respiration, coughing or speaking,” Dr PK Khosla, Executive Director C-DAC, said. “The acoustic signature of COVID-positive individuals shows some particular characteristics and traits that can be identified and tracked,” he added.The indigenously developed automated AI system analyses the acoustic signatures to detect the possibility of COVID-19 infection in a human.So far, C-DAC’s data base for ‘Vaani Mitr’ comprises of over a thousand recordings from COVID-19 negative persons and over 300 recordings from COVID-19 positive persons. The data base has been built with assistance from Nation Health Mission, Haryana and the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.“We have to build up our data base further. Large the data base, more accurate the test will be.” Dr Khosla said. As of now, the tool is being looked at as a means of preliminary screening for suspected cases while sitting at home rather than a clinical diagnosis.C-DAC, which functions under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, is looking for volunteers who are either COVID-19 positive or have been cured to provide their voice and cough samples to build up its data base. This can be done online along with providing some basic medical details.Use of AI in the healthcare sector, including areas such as hospital information, drug management tele-medicine mobile healthcare and decision support, is among the niche areas C-DAC is working on. The eSanjeevani, a nationwide tele-consultation service developed by it during the lockdown period last year had won the Digital India Award - 2020 in the category of “Innovation in Pandemic”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ai-based-tool-to-detect-covid-19-from-sound-of-cough-developed-251866
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Could have saved many lives with door-to-door vaccination: Bombay High Court||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday said if the Union government had started a door-to-door vaccination programme for senior citizens a few months back, then lives of many of them, including prominent persons, could have been saved.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni asked the Union government why not pro- actively start this programme when the lives of senior citizens, who are unable to go to vaccination centres to get inoculated, are concerned.The bench was hearing a public interest litigation filed by two lawyers  Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari  seeking door-to-door vaccination facility for senior citizens above the age of 75, specially-abled persons and those who are bed-ridden or wheelchair-bound.The court reiterated its earlier order of April 22 in which it asked the Union government to relook at its decision to not initiate a door-to-door vaccination programme."It has been three weeks and the government (Union) is yet to inform us of its decision. The government should have taken a decision one way or the other," the court said.It directed the Union government to file an affidavit by May 19, when it would hear the matter further.The court noted that many foreign countries have already started door-to-door vaccination facilities."In India, we do many things late and things travel to our country very slowly," Justice Kulkarni said.Why not start this (door-to-door vaccination) pro- actively when the lives of senior citizens are concerned? the court asked."Speaking off the cuff, if we had a door-to-door vaccination programme sometime back, then so many of our senior citizens, including prominent members of society from various walks of life, who have lost their lives to COVID-19, could have been saved," Justice Kulkarni said.The court further said it had seen photographs of senior citizens and many wheelchair-bound persons waiting outside vaccination centres in long queues."This was very heart-rending and not a good sight.They must be already suffering from so many ailments and now they face the risk of being infected with COVID-19 also (while) waiting in such crowds," the bench said.The court noted that senior judges of the HC had a meeting with Birhanmumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Tuesday where he said the civic body was planning to start ward-wise vaccination camps from next week, which would have the capacity to inoculate 70,000 people per day."If such camps are starting, then maybe senior citizens and people who cannot step out of their homes can be identified and the staff can go to their homes and vaccinate them," Chief Justice Datta suggested.The bench directed the BMC to file an affidavit stating details of the same and by when it would begin and what steps the corporation plans to take for the next few days with regard to the vaccination programme.The court noted that the availability of vaccines was also a problem.To this, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh told the court that the Covishield vaccine would be made available in a few days.The court also sought to know from the civic body about what measures it plans to take for the vaccination of homeless people, beggars and those living on streets."They are also a significant population and are spreaders of the coronavirus, the HC said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/could-have-saved-many-lives-with-door-to-door-vaccination-bombay-high-court-251848
