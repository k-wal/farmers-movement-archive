There are many studies that have clearly said that lockdowns are not a solution. At present and even in the future, this is the firm opinion of the state government.” The state was conducting fever surveys, providing treatment to all suspected Covid cases, irrespective of whether they test positive or not, distributing free Covid kits to such individuals, preparing enough stock of consumables, medicines, oxygen, and creating beds with oxygen supply.

05-05-2021||Kolkata||14 BJP workers killed in Bengal post-poll violence, nearly a lakh fled home: Nadda||Claiming that at least 14 BJP workers were killed and nearly one lakh people fled their homes in post-poll violence in West Bengal, BJP president J P Nadda on Wednesday alleged that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s silence speaks of her involvement.Condemning the “brutal killings after the results”, Nadda alleged that BJP workers have been killed and women molested and raped in various parts of the state.The assembly election results were declared on May 2 and the ruling Trinamool Congress came out winning 213 of the 292 assembly seats that went to polls and secured a third straight term in office.“Mamata Banerjee’s silence (on the violence) speaks of her involvement. She has blood on her hand,” Nadda said addressing a press conference in Kolkata.Alleging that “this is a state-sponsored programme”, he claimed that 80,000 to one lakh people have left their houses in different parts of the state following the TMC’s win in the election.Alleging atrocities on BJP workers in Canning Purba constituency in South 24 Parganas district and destruction of villages, he said that the people there have faced “(cyclone) Amphan last year and Mamataphan this year”.During his two-day visit to the state from Tuesday, the BJP president visited the residences of some party workers who allegedly faced atrocities at the hands of TMC goons.He claimed that people in north Bengal districts have even fled to neighbouring Assam to save their lives.Asked whether the BJP was contemplating to seek imposition of Article 356 of the Constitution in West Bengal, he said that the procedure is that a report is generated by the governor, it is analysed by central agencies and by the Ministry of Home Affairs and then a decision is made.“So, it is for them to make the decision”, he said.Under Article 356, if a state government is unable to function according to Constitutional provisions, the Centre can take direct control of the state machinery.“As far as the BJP is concerned, even if it is a fit case (for the imposition of Article 356), we are people who fight democratically,” Nadda said.

05-05-2021||New Delhi||Labour Ministry gets mandate to seek Aadhaar from beneficiaries under Social Security Code||The Ministry of Labour & Employment has now been mandated to seek the 12-digit unique identification number Aadhaar from people like employees and unorganised sector workers seeking registration, benefits, availing services or receiving any payment under various schemes under the Social Security Code 2020.Aadhaar would not be made mandatory for delivery of services under various social security schemes under the purview of the ministry because Social Security Code 2020 has not been fully implemented so far.The rules under the Code are finalised by the ministry but those rules are yet to be notified.The main purpose of the latest mandate given to the ministry is to facilitate database creation, mainly covering people in informal sectors like migrant workers.“Now, we will start asking for Aadhaar numbers from beneficiaries under the Social Security Code. This is also required for our database for unorganised sector workers, including migrant workers. However the delivery of services under various social security schemes would not be denied due to non-submission of Aadhaar,” Labour Secretary Apurva Chandra told PTI.In this regard, a notification was issued by the ministry on May 3, which mandates the ministry and bodies working under it to seek Aadhaar number from the beneficiaries under the Social Security Code. The Code was passed last year by Parliament.“... the central government hereby appoints the 3rd day of May, 2021 as the date on which the provisions of section 142 of the said Social Security Code shall come into force,” the notification said.Section 142 provides for establishing the identity of an employee or an unorganised worker or any other person through Aadhaar number for seeking benefits and availing services under the Code.The Social Security Code 2020 will subsume nine labour laws. They include The Employee’s Compensation Act, 1923; The Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948; The Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952; The Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959 and The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961.The other laws that will be subsumed are The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972; The Cine-Workers Welfare Fund Act, 1981; The Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Cess Act, 1996 and The Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008.In a statement on Wednesday, the ministry said the notification of the section will enable it to collect Aadhaar for the database of beneficiaries under the various social security schemes.According to the statement, the National Data Base for Unorganised Workers (NDUW) is at an advanced stage of development by the National Informatics Centre. The portal is aimed at collection of data for unorganised workers, including migrant workers, for the purpose of giving benefits of the various schemes of the government.An inter-state migrant worker can register himself on the portal on the basis of submission of Aaadhar alone.Section 142 under the Social Security Code has been notified only for collection of data of workers, including migrant workers. No benefit will be denied for want of Aaadhar, the statement said.

05-05-2021||Melbourne||73-year-old Australian stuck in Bengaluru sues Morrison govt for ban on flights from India||A 73-year-old Australian, who is stranded in India since March last year, has filed a lawsuit before a Sydney court against the federal government for banning flights from India and threatening to prosecute those attempting to enter the country with the possibility of a jail term and a penalty, saying the move is “unconstitutional”.The lawyers of Gary Newman, who is stranded in Bengaluru since March last year, have argued in the federal court in Sydney that the ban was “unconstitutional”.The Australian government, for the first time in history, recently imposed a ban on its citizens returning home if they have spent time in India up to 14 days before flying back.The government threatened to prosecute them with a possibility of five years of jail term or a penalty of 66,000 Australian dollars (USD 50,899).Michael Bradley and Chris Ward lodged the application before Justice Stephen Burley on Wednesday afternoon.The application said the Commonwealth was acting outside its powers and second, Health Minister Greg Hunt's declaration was in breach of an implied freedom to return home, ABC news reported.Newman is represented by Bradley and Ward who would work as pro bono to overturn the temporary ban. Pro bono generally refers to services that are rendered by a professional for free or at a lower cost for the public good.At a brief directions hearing, Ward said Newman was in Bengaluru and "wishes" to return home, but had been "prevented" from doing so by Hunt's declaration.Burley ordered that the proceedings be expedited and a formal hearing date be determined within the next 24 to 48 hours.On Saturday, Hunt issued a statement on the travel ban for Australians returning from India.The statement said: ''the Government will implement a temporary pause on travellers from India entering Australian territory if the passenger has been in India within 14 days of the person's time of departure”.The temporary pause, announced after the National Cabinet, was based on advice about the worsening COVID-19 situation in India.The pause came into effect on Monday and will be reviewed on May 15.Hunt said the risk assessment that informed the decision was based on the proportion of overseas travellers in quarantine in Australia who have acquired a Covid infection in India.The move triggered a backlash with several lawmakers, doctors, civil societies and businessmen criticising the government for "abandoning" Australians in India and threatening the travellers with a hefty penalty and a jail term.Prime Minister Scott Morrison, while speaking to reporters, defended the decision and said that the pause “is working” which means it will enable the government to get Australian residents and their immediate families back on repatriation flights.

No poor family will suffer on account of no-availability of food-grains due to disruption in the next two months,” the statement read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-approves-free-food-grain-to-beneficiaries-for-2-more-months-248513

05-05-2021||New Delhi||MHA asks states, UTs to take action to avoid fire incidents at health care facilities||Drawing the attention of state and Union Territory (UT) governments towards the occurrence of fire incidents in hospitals and nursing homes in the recent past, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday asked them to put in place a plan of action to ensure that such fatal situations never occur.In a written communication to the states and the UTs, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla has said that in the context of recent fire incidents and particularly in view of the impending summer season “it needs to be highlighted that either because of high temperature, lack of maintenance or high load on the internal wirings within the facilities, short-circuiting takes place, leading to fire incidents and consequential loss of life and essential infrastructure”.In the letter, Bhalla insisted that the system should be sensitised and special care should be taken “to put in place a plan of action, to ensure that no fire incident occurs in any of the health facilities (particularly COVID-19 dedicated facilities) both in the government and private sector”.The state and UT governments have also been asked to conduct a detailed review with officials from the health, power and fire departments, and prepare a detailed plan of action to ensure that “fire safety measures are in place in all hospitals and health facilities,” it noted.Further, the Home Secretary impressed upon the state and the UT government to issue directions to the concerned officials at various levels so that field-level officials visit heath facilities to “examine internal wirings and availability of functional safety equipment as per fire safety guidelines”.In the letter, Bhalla said, “A large number of COVID-19 cases are under treatment in COVID-dedicated health facilities across the country. In most of the cases, oxygen supported beds, ICU beds, and ventilators are critical interventions, and therefore, it is important to ensure that there is uninterrupted power supply in all the hospitals and medical facilities.”The Home Secretary also emphasised that saving every life is a priority and it is critical to ensure that required support is provided to all health facilities managing COVID-19 by taking requisite actions in advance to avert any such incident, which could hamper effective health care delivery to patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-asks-states-uts-to-take-action-to-avoid-fire-incidents-at-health-care-facilities-248510
05-05-2021||Melbourne||Unfazed Australian PM stays firm on ban on flights from India, says ‘it is working’||A defiant Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday stood firm on his decision to halt flights from India in a bid to curb the Covid infections and a possible third wave of the deadly contagion, saying positive cases have started to come down as a result of the pause.The Australian government, for the first time in history, recently imposed a ban on its citizens returning home if they have spent time in India up to 14 days before flying back.The government threatened to prosecute them with a possibility of five years of jail term or a penalty of 66,000 Australian dollars (USD 50,899).The move triggered a backlash with several lawmakers, doctors, civil societies and businessmen criticising the government for "abandoning" Australians in India and threatening the travellers with a hefty penalty and a jail term.Morrison, while speaking to reporters, defended the decision saying the pause “is working” which means it will enable the government to get Australian residents and their immediate families back on repatriation flights.''We're already starting to see, as a result of the pause, the incidence of those cases at Howard Springs (quarantine facility) starting to come down. We've got a bit more distance to travel there,” Morrison said.“This was a necessary step to ensure that we can help more Australian citizens and residents get home, and at the same time, bring them home safely in a way that did not risk a third wave here in Australia,'' he said, adding that a "good progress" was being made towards restoring repatriation flights.Morrison said he was not worried about the travel ban, asserting that the backlash would not impact the government's relationship with India."There is a partnership effort with India to support them as they deal with this terrible crisis," he said, adding that India is a great friend of Australia.Morrison said humanitarian support which includes oxygen containers, masks and respirators had already left Sydney and was now on its way to India.On Tuesday, Morrison said that the possibility of a prosecution was "pretty much zero", indicating that it could be reviewed before it is due to be lifted on May 15."The sanctions are there, they exist but they will be exercised proportionately and responsibly," he said."I think it would be very remote circumstances that would see them imposed. I don't want to see them necessarily imposed anywhere because I don't want to see people breaching the rule."If everybody cooperates, then we can get things in a stronger position and that means we can start those repatriation flights again,” he said.The move has left over 9,000 return travellers stranded in India, and according to a peak business body, the Australia India Business Council (AIBC), it could damage the business relations.AIBC, in a statement, said that though it appreciates the gesture by the federal government providing relief material to India, it was concerned about the temporary border closure, imposition of fines and jail terms for those wanting to return from India.“Such unprecedented measures and announcements are likely to have a serious impact on the Australian-Indian community as well as bilateral business and trade.“Australian-Indians are educated, professionals and business owners who work hard and contribute seamlessly to the Australian economy,” it said.It urged the Morrison government to take a pragmatic approach considering the sensitivities involved, and balancing health and economy, and more importantly the goodwill with Indians and with India.Meanwhile, Australian Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said that the government was reviewing the India travel ban "every single day".According to ABC News, Andrews supported the ban, calling it an “appropriate measure”. She said that she understands people's concerns."These are temporary measures, we will be reviewing them," the minister said, adding the government looks at the options available to support the Indian community here in Australia and to do its best for all Australians.

This causes muscular weakness and affects breathing as well as movement of limbs.Rathod said he and his wife Jinalba managed to raise Rs 16 crore for their son Dhairyaraj's treatment within 42 days of launching the campaign in March this year, and expressed gratitude towards donors from Gujarat and other places, including foreign countries.While the cost of the gene therapy injection, manufactured by Swiss pharma giant Novartis, is Rs 16 crore in India, the Customs duty is about Rs 6.5 crore, which the Centre has already waived on humanitarian ground, said Rathod, a native of Kanesar village near Lunawada town of Gujarat's Mahisagar district.He said the gene therapy injection by Novartis, considered as one of the costliest drugs in the world, is the only treatment for spinal muscular atrophy and it has to be imported after placing the order."The injection arrived from the US a few days back. We reached Mumbai on Tuesday and admitted our son in the hospital, where he was given the Zolgensma injection on Wednesday. It is a one-time gene therapy to treat children suffering from spinal muscular atrophy," he said.Rathod works at a private company and lives with his wife and son in neighbouring Godhra town of Panchmahal district.The couple learnt about their son's health disorder a month after his birth as he could barely move his hands and legs."A doctor diagnosed my son with spinal muscular atrophy type-1, a rare genetic disorder which restricts muscular movements and breathing. We were warned that it could eventually prove fatal as the child grows," Rathod said.He said the gene therapy injection by Novartis was the only hope, but its price was too high for them."Thus, I took the help of ImpactGuru platform for crowdfunding. We launched the campaign in March and managed to raise the money in just 42 days. The Centre also helped and waived the Customs duty of Rs 6.5 crore," he said.Rathod is now hopeful that his son would be able to lead a healthy life.

While undergoing treatment, his heartbeat also increased and he was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (blockage of arteries in lungs). His blood pressure also became low and he died of COVID-19 on April 26," the physician said.Dr Penurkar said when he moved his parents here, his father was of the opinion that he should continue to serve the patients in these difficult times.At the time of his father's death, his mother and brother were also undergoing treatment in the hospital."My mother could see the situation in the hospital and told me to continue serving the COVID-19 patients as the services of MD physicians are required at this time," he said.Dr Penurkar said he performed the last rites of his father alone and resumed duty the next evening."Fortunately, my mother and brother have now recovered," he added.

05-05-2021||Washington||COVID-19: 12 Republican lawmakers urge Biden admin to not support India's proposal at WTO||Twelve Republican lawmakers have urged the Biden administration to not support a proposal by India and South Africa to the World Trade Organisation to temporary waive some Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) rules amid the coronavirus pandemic.If the US gives up intellectual property rights, it will harm innovation and production, and result in fewer people getting vaccinated, the 12 influential Congressmen said in a letter to US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Tuesday.The letter is in response to the proposal in this regard by 60 developing countries, led by India and South Africa."The United States should continue to oppose the request by India, South Africa, and other nations to waive certain portions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for all members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)," the letter said.Spearheaded by Congressmen Jim Jordan and Darrell Issa, the lawmakers said the requested waiver is extraordinarily broad and unnecessary to accomplish the goal of giving as many people as possible access to vaccines and treatment for COVID-19.They claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressed President Joe Biden to support the waiver during a phone call in early May.Among other signatories to the letter are Steve Chabot, Louie Gohmert, Matt Gaetz, Mike Johnson, Tom Tiffany, Thomas Massie, Dan Bishop, Michelle Fischbach, Scott Fitzgerald and Cliff Bentz."The justification for the waiver rests on an incorrect assumption that IP rights are a significant bottleneck to the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments,” the letter said."The waiver's sponsors have presented no convincing evidence to support this assertion. Instead, the sponsors mainly just point out that relevant IP rights exist and speculate that those rights could serve as a barrier to access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments - not that IP rights have actually blocked or significantly hindered their availability,” it added.If anything, the examples of  IP 'disputes' cited by the waiver sponsors generally demonstrate that IP rights have not prevented the involved parties from supplying vaccines and other medicines, the letter said.Respect for intellectual property rights has been a cornerstone of the US trade policy for decades and should not be set aside lightly, the Republican Congressmen said."Although some flexibility may be warranted in emergency situations, the waiver of TRIPS IP protections requested by India, South Africa, and other countries would do little to improve public health during this critical period in the COVID-19 pandemic. The scope of the requested waiver is overbroad and unjustified in light of the economic harm it would cause and the negligible benefits it would provide,” they said in the letter."Existing aspects of TRIPS and global public health initiatives, along with the existing actions of key IP rights holders and innovators, make the waiver unnecessary. While considerable work can still be done to improve access to COVID-19 medicines and other innovations, that work can be done without the drastic step of suspending IP rights, and significant progress has already been made to address the real obstacles hampering the global COVID-19 response,” they said.The lawmakers argued that relevant intellectual property rights have been successfully licensed to expand access to COVID-19 innovations while maintaining IP protections. For example, the Serum Institute of India has secured licenses to produce multiple vaccines, including Astrazeneca and Novavax vaccines.South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare has secured a license to produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Several vaccine makers have licensed direct competitors to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity.Moderna has announced that it would not seek to enforce any of its COVID-related patents against other vaccine makers for the rest of the pandemic and has pledged to license its COVID-19 vaccine patents.Gilead has licensed nine generic pharmaceutical manufacturers (including in India) to produce its COVID-19 therapeutic drug remdesivir for 127 countries, most of which are developing nations.Moreover, TRIPS already allows countries to impose compulsory licenses to access vital IP rights, and no country has availed itself of that capability to date for COVID-19 vaccines or treatments, the lawmakers noted.The proposed waiver is not limited to patents on vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 - the waiver would also gut protections for copyrights, industrial designs (e.g., textile patterns or other ornamental designs), and trade secrets. The waiver's supporters have only offered vague, unsubstantiated explanations for how waiving IP protections for copyrights or industrial designs would lead to improved vaccine or therapeutics availability, they said.It is also unclear how a waiver of TRIPS obligations would provide more access to trade secrets and proprietary technologies, which are confidential by definition and typically closely guarded, they said."Gifting away our technological leadership and competitive advantage at a time when the US economy remains vulnerable would be irresponsible and send the wrong message to millions of American taxpayers. The damage would extend beyond even the considerable value of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines, also endangering the far greater value of the jobs and economic growth promised by these IP rights and the advanced technologies they represent," the Republican Congressmen said in the letter.

05-05-2021||Washington||US trade representative yet to make recommendation on COVID-19 TRIPS waiver, says White House||US Trade Representative Katherine Tai has not yet made a recommendation to President Joe Biden on India and South Africa's proposal before the WTO to temporary waive some of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) during the COVID-19 emergency, the White House has said.The World Trade Organisation (WTO) during its general council meeting in Geneva on May 5 and 6 is scheduled to take up the proposal.After regular agenda items, TRIPS waiver proposal is on top of the list of WTO's general council.Several Democratic lawmakers have launched #FreeTheVaccine campaign in support of India and South Africa."We will have something to say about this once the WTO session gets underway. Obviously, Ambassador Tai would be making a recommendation to the president. That's not something that has happened at this point,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference. "While we're talking about the United States position, it's a WTO process, and what ultimately happens here will not be up to the United States alone,” Psaki said.In a communique to the WTO on October 2, 2020, India and South Africa had called for TRIPS waiver of certain intellectual property provisions of COVID-19 vaccines so that people in developing countries get access to the life-saving vaccines and therapeutics as soon as possible."Given this present context of global emergency, it is important for WTO members to work together to ensure that intellectual property rights such as patents, industrial designs, copyright and protection of undisclosed information do not create barriers to the timely access to affordable medical products including vaccines and medicines or to scaling-up of research, development, manufacturing and supply of medical products essential to combat COVID-19,” India and South Africa had said in a joint communication.India and South Africa are now supported by scores of countries, hundreds of non-profit organisations, advocacy groups and rights bodies.The previous Trump administration had opposed this proposal. The Republican party, which is now in the opposition, has expressed its opposition to the proposal.A group of GOP senators and Congressmen have written to Biden and Tai respectively.US industry, pharma companies and eminent philanthropists like Bill Gates too are opposed to COVID-19 IP waiver.However, more than 100 Democratic lawmakers have come out in support of the move by India and South Africa.They have written letters to Biden on this issue and have been very vocal in the public domain as well.The White House and the US trade representative for the past one month are having extensive consultations with various stakeholders over the issue.Diplomats from India and South Africa have been coordinating to reach out to US policy makers and lawmakers in this regard.On Monday, India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu had a virtual meeting with Kenyan Ambassador to the US, Lazarus O Amayo."Discussed issues relating to cooperation in  affordable COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics to ensure global public health and strengthen the fight against the pandemic," Sandhu had tweeted.

05-05-2021||Johannesburg||14 crew members of cargo ship from India test positive for Covid in South Africa||Fourteen crew members of a cargo ship that sailed to Durban from India have tested positive for Covid, South Africa's Transnet National Port Authority has said.A spokesperson from Transnet said the cause of a chief engineer's death aboard the ship was heart attack and not Covid.The 14 were among the entire crew that was tested after the ship arrived in Durban on Sunday. They are now all in isolation as authorities start a track and trace initiative for all those who might have been in contact with them."The vessel is currently on quarantine. No one is allowed to leave or enter the vessel, and the company responsible for anyone who worked on board is to track and trace all employees who interacted with the subject vessel,” Transnet said on Tuesday.A senior port official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told a news portal that at least 200 port employees had been working on the vessel since Sunday evening, manually offloading about 3,000 tonnes of rice."The rice came in 50kg bags. We are a bit concerned because a lot of people have boarded that vessel since Sunday,” the source said.Transnet said the ship with Filipino crew had sailed directly from India, where they had been tested for Covid and cleared as per requirements."Upon arrival at the Port of Durban, as a standard precautionary measure, all crew members were tested and 14 of the crew tested positive for Covid. The entire vessel is currently in quarantine at the Port of Durban, as per Covid regulations," Transnet said.All operations with the vessel have been suspended.The authority said it remained vigilant to ensure that all vessels calling at the port had been cleared."TNPA is responsible for ensuring that all vessels calling the port have been cleared by relevant state organs, namely, port health, migration, MRCC and customs before entering or leaving the port,” it said.News of the incident caused widespread concern on social media about fears that the new B.1.617 variant that was causing thousands of deaths in India daily had reached South African shores.Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has assured the public that plans are in place to test all arrivals into the country, reminding them that there were no direct flights from India.Mkhize did express concern though that those arriving from India via other countries could pose a challenge.

Are you living in ivory towers?”Army base hospital short of oxygen supply?Even as the O2 quota of the Army Base Hospital in Delhi has been reduced, the Western Command said there was “adequate supply”. Sources, however, said the hospital was short of 2.4 MT O2 daily.It ordered two senior Central government officers to remain present before it on Wednesday to respond to the contempt notice.The Bench rejected Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma’s submission that the top court had not directed supply of 700 MT of oxygen per day to Delhi.As Sharma said a compliance affidavit of the April 30 order would be filed in the Supreme Court by Wednesday morning, the Bench said, “We fail to understand what good a compliance affidavit will do when as a matter of fact 700 MT of oxygen is not delivered to Delhi? Even the earlier allocated 490 MT and revised 590 MT has not been delivered even for a single day.”The HC said, “It pains us that the aspect of supply of oxygen for treatment of Covid-19 patients in Delhi should be viewed inthe way it has been done by the Centre.”The April 30 order of the Supreme Court contained a direction to the Centre to provide 700 MT of oxygen per day to Delhi, not just 490MT, it pointed out.“We had told you contempt is the last thing in our mind but it is certainly in our mind and don’t drive us to that last point. We mean business now. Enough is enough. Be clear on this. We are not going to take a no for an answer. There is no way you won’t supply 700 MT…We would not hear anything except compliance,” the Bench told Sharma.“We see the grim reality everyday of people not being able to secure oxygen or ICU beds in hospitals,” which have reduced beds due to gas shortage, it noted.Taking note of 12 deaths at Batra Hospital in the Capital due to lack of oxygen supply, the Delhi High Court had on May 1 directed the Centre to supply 490 MT of oxygen to Delhi during the day itself by whatever means or face contempt of court action.“Water has gone over our head.

The farmer agitation is not the only reason because its impact is limited to western UP, while the party has lost throughout the state,” said agriculture expert Prof Sudhir Panwar, who is also allied with the Samajwadi Party.Of the 40 zila panchayat seats in Varanasi, PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency, the SP won 15 seats, BJP eight, BSP five, Apna Dal three, and the Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party one.

The BJP’s poor show in the constituencies of the PM and CM shows the people have rejected the saffron party.”Panwar said: “There are several reasons for the BJP not doing well. The dominant among them is the economic marginalisation of farmers and labourers over the past four years.

His administrative and political career was marked by unparalleled brilliance.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi remembered Jagmohan’s legacy noting, “Jagmohan ji’s demise is a monumental loss for our nation. He was an exemplary administrator and a renowned scholar. He always worked for the betterment of India. His ministerial tenure was marked by innovative policy making.” The Jammu and Kashmir administration announced a three-day state mourning from Tuesday to Thursday. Born on September 25, 1927, in Hafizabad in undivided India, Jagmohan went on to serve as the LG of Delhi, LG of Goa, Daman and Diu, was nominated to the Rajya Sabha (1990 to 1996) and was three-time Lok Sabha MP.Before entering politics, he was known for his proximity to the Gandhi family and cleared some Delhi slums during the Emergency — a move that was learnt to have cost then PM Indira Gandhi dearly in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections.Jagmohan’s most memorable stint was as Jammu and Kashmir Governor first from 1984 to 1989 and again in 1990.During his first tenure, he oversaw several development works in the erstwhile state, with the Centre announcing plans to extend the Indian Railways into the Valley, the long delayed 345 MW Salal hydro-power project getting commissioned and international subscriber dialing coming to JK.Jagmohan’s gubernatorial tenure coincided with the rise of militancy following the controversial 1987 elections in which the NC and the Congress won, and the Muslim United Front was defeated. Many Kashmiri families to date credit him for saving their lives. Reappointed the J&K Governor in January 1990 by VP Singh, Jagmohan was abruptly recalled in May that very year.On return, he came close to the BJP and defeated actor Rajesh Khanna from New Delhi LS seat in 1996 and later Indira Gandhi’s factotum RK Dhawan in 1998 and 1999. Jagmohan s lost the seat to Congress’ Ajay Maken in 2004. He later served as minister in the NDA government handling communications, urban development, tourism and culture. Though Jagmohan authored many books, “My Frozen Turbulence in Kashmir” ran into several editions and translated into 11 regional languages.

The apex health research body also recommended upscaling testing using RATs and stated that RAT may be allowed at all available government and private healthcare facilities and setting up dedicated RAT booths in cities, towns and villages to offer testing to people. “The RT-PCR test must not be repeated in any individual who has tested positive once either by RAT or RT-PCR.“The need for RT-PCR test in healthy individuals undertaking inter-state domestic travel may be completely removed to reduce the load on laboratories,” the advisory recommended.Non-essential travel and interstate travel of symptomatic individuals (COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms) should be essentially avoided to reduce the risk of infection and that all asymptomatic individuals undertaking essential travel must follow COVID appropriate behaviour, it stated.An unprecedented upsurge of COVID-19 cases and deaths is currently being witnessed across India. The overall nationwide test positivity rate is above 20 per cent, the ICMR said.Testing-tracking-tracing, isolation and home-based treatment of positive patients is the key measure to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.As of today, India has a total of 2,506 molecular testing laboratories, including RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT and other platforms. The total daily national testing capacity is close to 15 lakh tests considering a three-shift operationalization of the existing laboratory network.“At present, the laboratories are facing challenges to meet the expected testing target due to extraordinary case load and staff getting infected with COVID-19. In view of this situation, it is imperative to optimize the RT-PCR testing and simultaneously increase the access and availability of testing to all citizens of the country,” the apex health research body said.Further the ICMR said rapid antigen tests (RATs) were recommended in India for COVID-19 testing in June 2020. However, the use of these tests is currently limited to containment zones and healthcare settings.          RAT has a short turnaround time of 15-30 minutes and thus offers a huge advantage of quick detection of cases and opportunity to isolate and treat them early for curbing transmission.So far, the ICMR has approved 36 RATs of which 10 are on GeM portal. To meet the overwhelming testing demand, it will be prudent to upscale testing using RATs, the advisory said.Listing the measures to ramp up testing through RAT, the advisory stated, testing booths may be set up at multiple locations, including healthcare facilities, RWAs, offices, schools, colleges, community centres and other available vacant spaces.These booths should be operational on a 24X7 basis to improve access and availability of testing. Drive-through RAT testing facilities may be created at convenient locations as identified by local administration and stringent measures must be instituted to avoid overcrowding at RAT testing facilities, the ICMR stated.The ICMR also advised all states to ensure full utilisation of the available RT-PCR testing capacity, both in public and private laboratories, and added that symptomatic individuals identified positive by RAT should not be re-tested and advised to go through home-based care as per ICMR guidelines.Symptomatic individuals identified negative by RAT should be linked with R-TPCR test facility and in the meantime be urged to follow home isolation and treatment.During the current upsurge of COVID-19 cases, any individual presenting with fever with/without cough, headache, sore throat, breathlessness, bodyache, recent loss of taste or smell, fatigue and diarrhoea should be considered as suspect case of COVID-19 unless proven otherwise by confirmation of another etiology, the advisory said.The vaccination status of all individuals tested for COVID-19 must be entered into the Sample Referral Form (SRF) in the RT-PCR app, both for individuals tested by RT-PCR and RAT. This information is of critical importance, the advisory said.

05-05-2021||---||Delhi oxygen crisis: Why shouldn’t you face contempt, HC asks Centre||New Delhi, May 4Piqued over shortage of oxygen in the national capital, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to explain why contempt proceedings shouldn’t be initiated against it for failing to comply with the order to supply 700 MT oxygen daily to hospitals for treating COVID19 patients.Coming down heavily on the Centre over inadequate oxygen supply to Delhi, a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said, “You (Centre) can put your head in sand like an ostrich, we will not…Are you living in ivory towers?”It ordered two senior central government officers to remain present before it on Wednesday to respond to the contempt notice.The Bench rejected Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma’s submission that the top court had not directed supply of 700 MT of oxygen per day to Delhi.As Sharma said a compliance affidavit of April 30 order will be filed in the Supreme Court by Wednesday morning, the Bench said, “We fail to understand what good a compliance affidavit will do when as a matter of fact 700 MT of oxygen is not delivered to Delhi? Even the earlier allocated 490 MT and revised 590 MT is not delivered even for a single day.”The HC said, “It pains us that the aspect of supply of oxygen for treatment of COVID-19 patients in Delhi should be viewed in the way it has been done by the Centre.”The April 30 order of the Supreme Court contained a direction to the Centre to provide 700 MT of oxygen per day to Delhi, not just 490 MT, it pointed out.“We had told you contempt is the last thing in our mind but it is certainly in our mind and doesn’t drive us to that last point. We mean business now. Enough is enough. Be clear on this. We are not going to take a no for an answer. There is no way you won’t supply 700 MT…We would not hear anything except compliance,” the Bench told Sharma.“We see grim reality everyday of people not able to secure oxygen or ICU beds in hospitals” which have reduced beds due to gas shortage, it noted.Taking note of 12 deaths at Batra Hospital in the national capital due to lack of oxygen supply, the Delhi High Court had on May 1 directed the Centre to supply 490 MT of allocated oxygen to Delhi during the day itself by whatever means or face contempt of court action.“Water has gone over our head. Now we mean business. Enough is enough,” a visibly upset Bench had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-oxygen-crisis-why-shouldnt-you-face-contempt-hc-asks-centre-248149

He was 93.Jagmohan twice remained Jammu and Kashmir Governor from 1984 to 1989 and January to May 1990. He was born on September 25, 1927, in Hafizabad in undivided India, now in Pakistan.“Widely known and acclaimed for his work as the Governor of J&K, Jagmohan began his civil service career in Panjab in the early 1950s, some years ahead of me. Having made his mark in Panjab, he was soon picked up for a special assignment in Delhi, at that time administered by a Chief Commissioner. From then onwards, he never looked back, winning accolades for every task handled by him,” said Vohra.Vohra said that besides his gubernatorial stint in Jammu and Kashmir, Jagmohan also served as the Union Minister for Culture and did pioneering work to resurrect the archeological wealth of India.“Till he took ill in late 2019, he unfailingly spent seven to eight hours everyday in the India International Centre Library, reading and taking notes. He wrote several books. I shall remember Jagmohan as a simple, humble, soft-spoken, wise and extremely courteous person. Pray for eternal peace to the departed soul,” said IIC President Vohra in remembrance of Jagmohan, who also served as the L-G of Delhi. After J&K was hit by militancy, Jagmohan was reappointed Governor in 1990, but removed briefly afterwards following differences with the then VP Singh-led government at the Centre over the handling of militancy.A rare amalgam of bureaucratic and political skills, Jagmohan represented the BJP thrice in the Lok Sabha, defeating yesteryear superstar Rajesh Khanna from New Delhi segment in 1996 and later winning against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s factotum RK Dhawan from the same seat in 1998 and again in 1999. It was in 2004 that Jagmohan lost the constituency to Congress’ Ajay Maken.From 1990 to 1996, Jagmohan remained a Rajya Sabha MP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/simple-humble-soft-spoken-nn-vohra-pays-rich-tributes-to-former-j-k-governor-jagmohan-248093

05-05-2021||New Delhi||SC strikes down West Bengal law on regulating real estate, holds it unconstitutional||The Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down West Bengal's law on regulating the real estate sector in the state, saying it is “unconstitutional” as the statute encroached upon the Centre's Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act (HIRA), 2017, is more or less identical to the Centre's RERA and hence repugnant to Parliament's law. “The state law has encroached upon domain of Parliament,” the verdict said. It, however, said that homebuyers, who purchased properties under the state law before Tuesday’s verdict, would not have to worry as their registration and other acts would remain valid.The judgement came on a plea of ‘Forum For People's Collective Efforts', a homebuyers’ association, challenging the constitutional validity of the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017, which is more or less identical to the Centre's RERA.
