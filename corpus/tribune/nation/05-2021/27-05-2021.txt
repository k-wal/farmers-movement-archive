27-05-2021||New Delhi||Despite its own needs, India ensured supply of medicines to 123 partner countries: Vardhan||India ensured supply of medicines to 123 partner countries despite its own needs amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and has also been active in global efforts to develop “diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines” to tackle the infection, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday.He was speaking during a virtual interaction with health ministers of NAM (Non-Aligned Movement) countries.Tedros, Director-General, World Health Organisation was also present in the meeting.Reiterating that India shall always strive for the ‘health of all’, Vardhan said, “Despite its own needs, during the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured supply of medicines to 123 partner countries, including 59 NAM nations. India has also been active in global efforts to develop diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for Covid-19 because we know and understand that no one is safe until everyone is safe.”He said India has adopted transformative strategies and fast-tracked many initiatives aimed at all the core tenets of Universal Health Coverage like strengthening health systems, including primary healthcare, improving access to free drugs and diagnostics, and reducing catastrophic healthcare spending.“India is moving towards Universal Healthcare for All which means every citizen of India must get world quality treatment facilities. Full immunisation coverage is increasing at a rapid pace with a greater emphasis on village-based micro-plans as we aim to enhance coverage to 90 per cent in a year,” an official statement quoted the health minister as saying.Speaking about India’s ambitious National Health Policy, he noted, “Our flagship health initiative called Ayushman Bharat aims at providing free health assurance to over 500 million underprivileged people, making it the world’s largest health assurance scheme.“And we dream of making this scheme much bigger, ensuring it for every Indian! If a developing nation like India can dream of this level of ‘health for all’ policy, I think the rest of the world has to think even beyond this,” he said.He, however, expressed concern over the current pandemic that has demonstrated the vulnerability of humankind to exigencies and underlined the need to act with greater speed and predictability.“We need an aggressive roadmap to curtail deaths from diseases that can be eliminated. We need a fresh roadmap to address shortages of medicines and vaccines. Our motto should always be to protect the health of those without wealth…,” the minister added.

However, the words of caution turned into a heated argument and Parmeet left the clinic,” Pandey said.“After about an hour, he returned to the clinic along with a friend but this time armed with a gun. They both hurled abuses at the doctor and his staff, issued threats and went outside the clinic where they opened gunshots in the air in rage before leaving again,” the officer said.The matter was reported to the local police and an FIR lodged under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code against the duo, the police said.While Parmeet is on the run, his friend Rahul who accompanied him during the incident has been arrested and legal proceedings initiated against him, the police added.

27-05-2021||New Delhi||New social media rules: Koo says given necessary details on compliance to IT Ministry||Twitter-rival Koo on Thursday said it has provided the “necessary details” on compliance with the new social media rules, as sought by the IT Ministry.The ministry had on Wednesday asked all large social media companies to immediately report on status of compliance to new digital rules, and offer details of grievance redressal officer, chief compliance officer and nodal officer to whom users can complain when they are subjected to offensive posts.“Yes, we have provided the necessary details (to the government),” Aprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder of Koo, told PTI.He was responding to a question on whether Koo has furnished the stipulated details and compliance report, as sought by the ministry.Radhakrishna noted that a robust community guidelines framework is already in place on the platform. Koo has seen a strong surge in user base over the past few months amid clarion calls for expanding the ecosystem of homegrown digital platforms.“Our intent is to ensure every user has a safe experience on Koo. We have processes to get back on any complaints that users have and were able to identify people who were confident of delivering on the promise of safety and a great environment to the users,” Radhakrishna said.Asked about the mechanism of tracing the originators of messages flagged by authorities under the new rules, Radhakrishna said Koo is an open network and everything that is said, is visible to the world once it is on someone’s profile. “Getting information on who said what first is a pretty open and transparent exercise on Koo. Anyone can report a post they don’t like by using the report option on the Koo,” he added.On Wednesday, Koo said it has raised USD 30 million (about Rs 218 crore) in a funding round led by Tiger Global. Existing investors Accel Partners, Kalaari Capital, 3one4 Capital, Blume Ventures and Dream Incubator also took part in the latest funding round. IIFL and Mirae Assets are other new investors who have come on board the cap table with this round.Koo’s popularity had surged after union ministers and government departments endorsed the microblogging platform following a spat with Twitter.

27-05-2021||---||Covid-19: Govt expects speedy India launch of single-dose Sputnik Light||New Delhi, May 27The government is hopeful of a speedy launch of single-dose Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik Light in India and all stakeholders, including the Russian manufacturer and its Indian partners, have been directed to fast-track the application and regulatory approval procedures for the jab to boost the country’s vaccination drive, sources said on Thursday.An application seeking regulatory approval for Sputnik Light is expected to be filed in the next couple of weeks and it could become the first single-dose vaccine to be launched in India, sources said citing high-level discussions held among top government officials in the recent days to boost domestic availability of Covid-19 vaccines.At a meeting chaired by the Cabinet Secretary last week, it was suggested to immediately convene a meeting with all concerned stakeholders, including the Department of Biotechnology Secretary, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), the Ministry of External Affairs representatives, the Union Health Ministry officials, RDIF (Russian Direct Investment Fund) and domestic manufacturers to expedite the regulatory approvals for Sputnik Light.Also, with the rollout of Sputnik’s one-dose jab, the issue of the criticality of recombinant Adenovirus Type-5 (rAd-5) component, which is used in the second dose of the presently-approved double-dose Sputnik V vaccine and for production of which manufacturers are not very comfortable, will also become redundant, sources privy to the discussions said.On Sputnik Light, it was discussed in the meeting that Russia has already approved this vaccine and trials are ongoing in other countries.Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) informed other participants that the application for regulatory approval of Sputnik Light is expected to be filed in the next 2-3 weeks.It was also highlighted during the meeting that six Lakh imported double-dose of Sputnik-V will be available in May 2021, one crore imported doses in June 2021 and 2.8 crore doses (2.4 Crore imported and 40 Lakh manufactured in India) in July 2021, sources said.August 2021 onwards, locally manufactured Sputnik V vaccine will be available in the domestic market and technology-transfer arrangement for manufacturing of Sputnik-V vaccine has been firmed up with six Indian manufacturers, sources added.The Department of Biotechnology and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) are in touch with all these manufacturers to provide the necessary support to them in setting up their manufacturing facilities.It was also flagged during one recent meeting that the domestic manufacturers are not very comfortable with the production of recombinant Adenovirus Type-5 (rAd-5) component, which is used in the second dose of vaccine, due to its low yield and their inability to fully absorb its production process.Another round of meeting with the manufacturers and RDIF is likely to be held soon to resolve this issue.At the same time, it was noted that the availability of single-dose Sputnik Light in the domestic market can significantly boost the country’s vaccination drive.“Besides, the issue of the criticality of rAd-5 component will also become redundant with its launch. It was, therefore, suggested that NITI Aayog may immediately convene a meeting inviting all relevant stakeholders including the DBT Secretary, DCGI, representative of MEA, representative of Health Ministry, RDIF and domestic manufacturers to expedite the regulatory approvals for Sputnik Light,” another source said.The two-dose Sputnik V had received the Indian drug regulator’s permission for restricted emergency use with certain conditions on April 12. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is importing the vaccine for use in India.Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd had applied for the grant of permission to import and market Gam-COVID-Vac combined vector vaccine, popularly called Sputnik-V, developed by Gamaleya Institute, Russia for Emergency Use Authorization.The Gam-COVID-Vac combined vector vaccine (Component I and Component II) has been developed by the National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and is approved in 30 countries across the world.DRL has collaborated with the Russian developer for obtaining regulatory approval for import for marketing in India.The interim results of safety immunogenicity and efficacy from the Russian phase-3 clinical trial have been published in the Lancet journal.With many states reporting shortage of vaccines, the government is trying to secure imported jabs, including of Russia’s Sputnik vaccines, while talks are also underway for COVID-19 vaccines developed by US majors Pfizer and Moderna.Besides, the government is also looking to ramp up domestic manufacturing of vaccines, including those made by Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, among other Indian manufacturers currently in various stages of their vaccine production.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-govt-expects-speedy-india-launch-of-single-dose-sputnik-light-259353
27-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi HC issues notices to Centre, Delhi govt on plea to keep families informed||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked the Centre and Delhi government to spell out their respective stand on a PIL demanding that family members or attendants of Covid-19 patients be kept informed about their health condition and the treatment being offered to them.A Bench headed by Chief Justice DN Patel asked the Union Ministry of Health and Delhi government to respond to a PIL by NGO Manav Awaaj Trust which complained that families only received news about the death of a patient or demand for money towards treatment charges.“The community at large is losing confidence, trust and faith in the working of the government and private hospitals in the absence of a system or machinery where the attendant is briefed or updated about treatment administered to the patient and actual status or condition of the patient thereof regularly on daily basis by the hospital authorities,” it submitted.“Only news reaching them is either the death of the patient or demand for the deposit of more fee. That the family members/attendants are time and again neglected by the hospitals, but for the clearance of bills,” it submitted.Providing the daily updates about patients’ condition would “develop confidence and trust in the system of governance”, the NGO contended.It urged the court to direct the Delhi government “to frame a policy or guidelines for communication of status report” every 24 hours to family or attendants of patients about their condition, treatment provided and details of the attending doctors.The status reports can be communicated via WhatsApp, SMS, email or any other mode or an option can be given to family members or attendants to collect the report from the hospital daily at a specified time, it contended.There were no guidelines and/or directions to ensure that the attendant of a Covid-19 patient is updated about the condition or status of the patient regularly on a daily basis, the NGO complained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-delhi-hc-issues-notices-to-centre-delhi-govt-on-plea-to-keep-families-informed-259348
27-05-2021||New Delhi||India keeping close eye on Chinese ‘city’ in Sri Lanka||Despite a slowed outreach due to its preoccupation with the Covid crises within the country, South Block is nevertheless keeping a close eye on the Sri Lankan law passed on Thursday that allows a Chinese company ownership rights on reclaimed land, which is less than 300 km from India.The new law passed allows a Chinese company to develop a “port city” on 269 hectares of land reclaimed from the Indian Ocean as a Special Economic Zone which the Sri Lankan opposition say would lead to the creation of a Chinese colony.More ominously for India, the project could be a key cog in China’s ‘Maritime Silk Road’ project.Sources here said the project had been going on for over eight years. Though India had not formally raised its concerns, it would like to know whether it follows the recognised norms relating to financial responsibility and respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations.  “There are discussions in Sri Lanka. Will it become a Chinese enclave? Will the SEZ impact the Lankan domestic industry? There are also discussions in Sri Lanka on whether it creates a separate country. The final text is not yet public. Let us see what the Sri Lankans think,” said the sources.“If it’s just a commercial venture, it is their choice. If there are other elements, we will look into,” they added while hoping that Sri Lanka’s “robust institutions” will be able to chart a way forward.“Any development if it is so near, we will keep a close eye especially if it impacts security etc,” said the sources.Piloting the Bill in Sri Lankan Parliament, the government said the project would bring in investment and boost the island-nation’s economy.The 225-member Parliament approved the Bill 148-59 with Opposition speakers alleging the law undermined the sovereignty of the country and the Constitution as it required referenda on nine instances and a two-thirds majority 17 times to pass it.The government countered by saying the amendments is as per the Supreme Court’s directives, obviating the need for a referendum or two-thirds majority in Parliament.India is on the back-foot in Nepal as well with critics questioning India’s public statement that the political developments were Kathmandu’s internal issue.India has been unable to meet Nepal’s request for vaccines and China has stepped in to supply 5 lakh doses. Sources said India will be unable to meet the requirements of neighbouring countries including Bangladesh and Bhutan as it itself is facing a vaccine crunch.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-keeping-close-eye-on-chinese-city-in-sri-lanka-259346

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Good samaritan compiles list of breast milk donors for infants who lost mothers to Covid-19||In a novel initiative, an activist is compiling a list of women willing to donate their breast milk for infants who have lost their mothers to coronavirus.The move comes after many such requests for breast milk were received on social media.Activist Anvy Shrivastava with the help of the Delhi government's health department is compiling such a list of breast milk donors."We got few requests of breast milk for infants who lost their mothers to the infection. Milk banks usually provide 30 ml of breast milk for Rs 300, but it cannot be afforded by underprivileged families."We are getting donors and we specifically ask them if they have stored colostrum. We are maintaining a database of such donors. Most of these donors are from privileged backgrounds. They store the milk as per their doctors' advice," Shrivastava told PTI.She said her team gets breast milk requests from attendants of infants admitted in neonatal ICUs. Some of these infants are breastfed by women who had recently given birth at the same hospital, she said."The Delhi government's health department is backing us. At present, we have around 20 donors. We have asked them to store the breast milk datewise. We collect the milk from them and send it to a milk bank where it is screened. The criteria for a donor is that she should not be suffering from any ailment or be Covid-19 positive," the activist said.The initiative caught everyone's attention after various mother community groups talked about it on Telegram along with being noticed on Instagram and Twitter."We require colostrum which is produced by a mother in the initial days after she gives birth. Some mothers produce colostrum even before the birth of the child. We have few donors for colostrum," Srivastava said.Freshly expressed or pumped milk can be stored in the refrigerator for up to four days and in the freezer for about six months."We are preparing for the days ahead. Anticipating that underprivileged families might need it (breast milk) and there can be a similar crisis in the future, we are preparing a database of donors," she said.The Delhi Commission For Protection of Child Rights also said that it received many requests for breast milk amid the pandemic. Raghuram Mallaiah, director, Neonatology Fortis La Femme and Founder, Amaara human milk bank, Delhi and Bengaluru said, "During the pandemic, we got requests from two to three hospitals where babies were born premature and their Covid-19 positive mothers were on ventilator. We also provided breast milk to such babies at our hospital.”However, he said there has been a dip in the number of donors amid the pandemic outbreak."During pre-Covid times, we had 40-45 litres and even 50 litres of breast milk in our bank, but due to the fear of Covid-19, donor mothers now do not want to step out and also do not want anyone to come and visit them. Till February-March, we were doing fine, but after that we have had few donations and hardly get 15-20 litres a month. We even had to say no to a couple of hospitals with such requests,” he said.The hospital used to donate 40 bottles of breast milk to Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), but the Covid situation has led us to discontinue it, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/good-samaritan-compiles-list-of-breast-milk-donors-for-infants-who-lost-mothers-to-covid-19-259341
27-05-2021||---||Political effort to tarnish govt’s image: Jaishankar||New Delhi, May 27External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has alleged “a political effort” to tarnish the government and said there is a difference between the political imagery that has been “concocted” and the actual governance record.“I would be very open about it. I mean these are people [in the government at the Centre] who perhaps are less from the English-speaking world, less connected to other global centres. So there is a difference. And I think sometimes that difference is judged politically harshly and it is often used to create a certain narrative,” he said during a conversation in New York with one of Trump’s US National Security Advisors Gen. HR McMaster.Jaishankar is in the US to hold talks on bilateral issues, but the top three in the State Department, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, are on overseas tours. He will be packing most of the important interactions, including with Blinken, Secretary for Defence Lloyd Austin and NSA Jake Sullivan, during the fag end of his visit.“I would certainly see that very much as part of a political effort to depict our current government in a certain way and obviously I have a very profound difference with that. We Indians are extremely confident about our democracy… India is a deeply pluralistic society,” he said in response to McMaster asking if Hindutva policies could undermine the secular nature of Indian democracy and whether India’s friends are right to be concerned about recent trends.“So I think when you come down to real governance judgments, you find that there is a difference between the political imagery that has been concocted and actually the governance record out there. So I think you should take it for what it is, which is really politics at play,” he added.The Minister claimed that in the past there was a great reliance on vote bank politics but the current regime has departed from it.“I think what you are seeing in India, in many ways, is the deepening of democracy, if you would call it, a much broader representation in politics and in leadership positions and in civil society of people. Of people who are much more confident about their culture, about their language, about their beliefs,” he asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/political-effort-to-tarnish-govts-image-jaishankar-259340

27-05-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||ED charge-sheets Cong MP Revanth Reddy in 'money-laundering' case||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, May 27Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet against Telangana Congress working president and Member Parliament from Malkajgiri constituency A Revanth Reddy, a Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) MLA Venkata Veeraiah and others in connection with a money-laundering probe that came to be known as “cash-for-vote scam” in 2015. The ED confirmed that it had filed a prosecution complaint (charge sheet) before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Hyderabad's Nampally. Those named in the complaint apart from Reddy and Veeraiah (MLA Sathupally constituency) were Bishop Harry Sebastian, Rudra Sivakumar Uday Simha, Mathaiah Jerusalem, and Vem Krishna Keerthan.The ED, in a statement said its probe had established that the accused “committed the scheduled offence as well as the offense of money laundering by dealing with the bribe money which is nothing but proceeds of crime as per the PMLA”.“Thus, the ED has filed a prosecution complaint against the above named accused persons with a prayer to hold a trial for the offence of money laundering,” it said. Reddy was a member of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) then but joined Congress later.In 2015 the state's anti-corruption bureau had registered a complaint on charges that Elvis Stephenson (a nominated MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community in the Telangana Assembly) was lured with a bribe of Rs 50 lakh in cash by the TDP that wanted him to either abstain from voting or cast his franchise in favour of TDP candidate Vem Narendra Reddy in the MLC election, which was to be held on June 1, 2015. The ED stated that "The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had arrested the accused during their trap proceedings and filed a charge sheet after investigation…… In pursuance of their conspiracy, the accused had contacted Elvis Stephenson and offered him a bribe of Rs 5 crore. Elvis Stephenson made a complaint to the ACB police and, a trap was laid and his encounters with the accused were secretly audio-video recorded".  The agency claimed its probe has established that the accused "committed the scheduled offence as well as the offense of money laundering by dealing with the bribe money which is nothing but proceeds of crime as per the PMLA".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-charge-sheets-cong-mp-revanth-reddy-in-money-laundering-case-259324

It will remain peaceful.Now also in the islands it is very peaceful," Ali told a press conference here.Justifying the decision to introduce the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA) in the islands, the official said this is to check the incidents like drug abuse and increasing cases of sexual abuse of children."So when we plan to develop this island holistically we cannot compromise on the Law and Order fronts. Lakshadweep is very peaceful.But now few cases are emerging", he said, responding to queries on various regulations of the new administration.The press meet was held amid mounting protest from opposition parties against "anti-people" policies of administrator Praful Patel in the islands.The collector said the administration wanted to develop islands like the Maldives in the next 10 or 20 years.The islands are very critical from a security point of view."So we are planning for a holistic development for these islands. From a security point of view Lakshadweep islands are very critical. So we cannot take a chance."Basically, we wanted to prepare ourselves for the requirements of the future considering the past experience and present emerging situations," Ali said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakshadweep-admin-justifies-reform-push-says-it-wants-to-develop-islands-like-maldives-259317

In fact, there is a narrative that is going on that taking doses of two different vaccines can lead to stronger immunity... but for a firm opinion, more scrutiny and understanding will be required,” he said at a presser.Commenting on the UP incident, he said, "Even if it has happened, it should not be a cause of concern for the individual, but I urge all health workers to give a second dose of the same vaccine.”The incident was reported from the primary health centre in Barhni where people from Audahi Kala and another village received Covaxin shots on May 14. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-adverse-effect-if-second-dose-of-different-covid-19-vaccine-taken-but-it-needs-scrutiny-govt-259313

Earlier, there was an issue about contractors, then the coronavirus-induced lockdown and then the restrictions delayed this four-laning work," the official said.Due to the pandemic, the number of labourers has gone down by nearly 30 per cent, he said.Talking to PTI, Superintendent Engineer of PWD (national highway) Prashant Auti said, "We have completed the work of 110-km long stretch of the road so far and the work of 20 km long road would be carried out without any hurdle." "We are facing some problems with 20-km long road as there are some land-related issues. The revenue officials are deployed for the coronavirus duty, which is why it is a little pending," he added.The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation should help us in removing encroachments in the project area, he said."We can complete the road widening work by November this year," he said, adding that the time needed to cover the distance of 150-km road would take at least 180 minutes, which will now be curtailed by nearly 130 minutes once the project is complete. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aurangabad-jalgaon-road-widening-work-may-get-over-by-year-end-259310

Perhaps that is how they did this. We do not accept this. This is baseless and outrageous,” Paul said.The NYT report presents three scenarios on Indian Covid deaths assuming in the best case that real infections are 15 times higher than reported infections which would mean 40 crore cases as against 2.7 crore officially reported. The publication assumes infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.15 pc (instead of India’s official IFR of 0.05 pc) which leads to 6 lakh deaths instead of 3 lakh reported in the country.The second scenario assumes actual cases at 20 times the reported cases which means over 53 crore cases. This scenario assumes IFR of 0.30 pc which would mean 16 lakh deaths.The worst case picture NYT projects puts Indian actual infections at 26 times (70 crore) the reported cases and 0.6 pc IFR which throws up 42 lakh deaths -- 13.3 times higher than official Covid toll of 315235 as of today.“We reject the NYT report on Covid deaths in India: it is not backed by facts,” Health ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said.Paul said question does not arise of Covid deaths being concealed in India.“NYT report is based on assumption of some people. This should not have been published. We have a strong mortality tracking system which has stood the test of time. Indian sample registration system is respected the world over. Let that data come. Adjustments of late reporting can happen in a large country like ours. It is possible to have missed some deaths but NYT’s projections are outrageous,” Paul said.He argued that actual infections could be higher than detected cases in any country.“Possibly a larger universe has been infected. It can be argued that actual infections were higher but on what basis has NYT exaggerated India’s IFR from 0.05 pc to 0.3 pc, even 0.6 pc. NYT estimates are adhoc and without basis. Detected cases can be smaller than actual cases anywhere in the world. Take New York -- Officially reported cases last May were two lakh in New York but sero prevalence surveys showed 17 lakh infections. Likewise in India the December 2020 sero survey by ICMR showed 26 pc people had developed antibodies. Indian official case data could be smaller than that universe but did NYT use that same logic to calculate Covid deaths in New York City? No. New York City reported 16,000 deaths last May but IFR was not exaggerated to calculate Covid deaths there. So on what basis have distorted IFRs been used to calculate deaths in India,” Paul asked.He said India’s IFR (deaths against total cases) is 0.05 pc but NYT has assumed this to be six times higher (0.3 pc), even 12 times higher (0.6 pc).“This is where the flaw is. Our deaths are being reported through sample registration system. Late reporting is possible. On what basis has NYT pulled out new IFRs for India? If the same standards of exaggerated IFRs based on higher actual infections shown by sero surveys were applied to New York their IFR in May last was 0.97 pc and reported deaths were 16000. If I make this three times deaths rise to 50,000 and if I make them 12 times deaths are 1,75,000 but they don’t use these assumptions for themselves. Distorted estimates have been made for India,” said Paul.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/outrageous-baseless-centre-rejects-nyt-report-on-indian-covid-deaths-259302

That the family members/attendants are time and again neglected by the hospitals, but for the clearance of bills," it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-for-daily-update-of-covid-19-patient-condition-to-family-hc-seeks-centre-delhi-govts-reply-259285

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Instead of tweeting, Rahul Gandhi should speak to Cong CMs: BJP on Covid tally charge||The BJP on Thursday took a swipe at Rahul Gandhi for his allegation that the government was "lying" about the Covid death toll, saying he "knows nothing and speaks everything" and referred to the high number of casualties in opposition-ruled states like Maharashtra to target the Congress leader.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra noted that Maharashtra, where the Congress is in the ruling alliance, has reported the highest number of deaths and that there is a "huge discrepancy" between actual deaths and what has been projected by the Rajasthan government, a Congress-ruled state."Rather than existing in the republic of Twitter and playing this tweet game" Gandhi should pick up the phone and speak to chief ministers of states where his party is in power, he said, alleging that the Congress leader's priority had always been to spread lies and misinformation."He will never get down to the ground and do any act of service. He will post one tweet daily. One tweet a day will not drive the corona away," Patra said at a virtual press conference.Rahul should speak to his chief ministers and ask them to take proper measures, he added.The Congress leader had on Wednesday posted a New York Times figure, which had said that the Covid tally in India might be grossly under-reported."Numbers don't lie... GOI (Government of India) does," he had said on Twitter.Hitting back at the Congress over its leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's recent critical statement, Patra said they are the ones responsible for vaccine hesitancy and noted that chief ministers from the opposition party had even expressed their disapproval of Covaxin, an indigenously developed vaccine against Covid.He also sought to know if Rahul and Priyanka had been vaccinated.Patra also spoke at length about "myths and facts" on the vaccination process and accused leaders like Rahul and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of  doing politics over the matter.Referring to as "myths" allegations like the Centre was not doing enough to buy vaccines from abroad, not approving vaccines available globally, not doing enough to ramp up domestic production of vaccines, abdicating its responsibility to states and not taking any step to vaccinate children, he gave a point-by-point rebuttal.The NITI Aayog, a public policy think-tank of the government, had also earlier issued a statement on similar lines in which it had given a detailed reply about the measures being taken by the Centre since last year to boost its vaccination programme.

We have clear transparency reports, when we comply with government requests, we highlight that in our transparency reports," Pichai said in a virtual conference with select reporters from Asia Pacific.He added that a free and open internet is "foundational", and that India has long traditions of that.As a company, we are very clear about the values of a free and open internet and the benefits it brings and we advocate for it, and we engage constructively with regulators around the world, and we participate in these processes, I think it's a part of how we learn..."          He added that the company respects the legislative processes, and in cases where it needs to push back, it does so. "It's a balance we have struck around the world," he said.Pichai noted that technology is touching society in deeper and broader ways and the landscape is evolving at a fast pace."So, we fully expect governments rightfully to both scrutinise and adopt regulatory frameworks. Be it Europe with copyright directive or India with information regulation, etc, we see it as a natural part of societies figuring out how to govern and adapt themselves in this technology-intensive world," he said, adding that Google engages constructively with regulators around the world, and participates in these processes. The new IT rules for social media companies, which came into effect from Wednesday, are aimed at making digital platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram and Google - which have seen a phenomenal surge in usage over the past few years in India - more accountable and responsible for the content hosted on their platform.The new rules, which were announced on February 25, require large social media players to follow additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer.“Significant social media intermediaries” - defined as those with over 50 lakh registered users - were given three months' time to comply with the additional requirements. Non-compliance with rules, will result in these social media companies losing their intermediary status that provides them exemptions and certain immunity from liabilities for any third-party information and data hosted by them. In other words, they could be liable for action.Google has previously stated that it has consistently invested in significant product changes, resources, and personnel to ensure that it is combating illegal content in an effective and fair way, and complies with local laws in the jurisdictions it operates in.The new rules also require these platforms to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours, and take down posts depicting nudity or morphed photos within 24 hours of receiving a complaint.The new guidelines mandate setting up a robust complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country, and significant social media companies will have to publish a monthly compliance report disclosing details of complaints received and action taken, as well as details of contents removed proactively.They will also be required to have a physical contact address in India published on its website or mobile app, or both.Interestingly, WhatsApp has moved Delhi High Court challenging the new digital rules on grounds that the requirement for the company to provide access to encrypted messages will break privacy protections.The government, however, has staunchly defended the new guidelines, saying the requirement of messaging platforms like WhatsApp to disclose origin of flagged messages does not violate privacy and that these rules will not impact normal functioning of the popular free-messaging platform.

However, no FIR was lodged.The plea has also claimed that representations were sent to the CBI, the Chief Justice of India, the National Commission for Women and the National Human Rights Commission requesting for proper inquiry to be conducted against the accused persons, but nothing happened.Besides an independent court-monitored probe by SIT, the petition has also sought the preservation of the video footage of the incident as the protest site was covered by police cameras.

27-05-2021||New Delhi||New rules designed to prevent misuse of social media; WhatsApp users have nothing to fear: Prasad||IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said WhatsApp users had nothing to fear about new social media rules, that are designed to prevent abuse and misuse of platforms, and offered users a robust forum for grievance redressal.Also read:Twitter breaks silence after police raid, alleges intimidation over 'manipulated media' tagsDeadline over, Twitter, Facebook yet to comply with ethics codeNew digital rules: IT Ministry demands compliance report from social media companiesPrasad said the government welcomed criticism, including the right to ask questions."The rules only empower the ordinary users of social media when they become victims of abuse and misuse," Prasad posted on micro-blogging platform Koo, and also tweeted.The government fully recognises and respects the right of privacy, he asserted."Ordinary users of WhatsApp have nothing to fear about the new Rules. Its entire objective is to find out who started the message that led to commissioning of specific crimes mentioned in the Rules," Prasad added.The new IT rules require the social media companies to set up an India-based grievance redressal officer, compliance officer and nodal officer "so that millions of users of social media who have a grievance get a forum for its redressal", he said.The government on Wednesday had staunchly defended its new digital rules, saying the requirement of messaging platforms like WhatsApp to disclose origin of flagged messages does not violate privacy, and went on to seek a compliance report from large social media firms.The new rules, announced on February 25, require large social media platforms - defined as those with over 50 lakh users in the country - to follow additional due diligence, including appointment of chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer.Non-compliance with rules would result in these platforms losing their intermediary status that provides them immunity from liabilities over any third-party data hosted by them. In other words, they could be liable for criminal action in case of complaints.

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Delhi hospital reports 'first-ever' white fungus case causing severe damage to entire intestine||Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) has come across a first-of-its-kind case of white fungus which causes multiple perforations “throughout the intestine” in a Covid-19 patient, doctors said on Thursday.“White fungus (Candida) causing multifocal perforations in the food pipe, small bowel and large bowel in Covid-19 infection has not been reported in literature to the best of our knowledge,” Dr Anil Arora, Chairman of the Institute of Liver, Gastroenterology and Pancreaticobiliary Sciences at the hospital, said.A 49-year-old woman was admitted to the SGRH on May 13 with complaints of severe abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation. She had undergone a mastectomy for breast cancer in December last year and had received chemotherapy till four weeks ago, he said. “A CT scan of the abdomen revealed free air and moderate amount of free fluid in the abdominal cavity suggestive of an intestinal perforation,” the hospital said in a statement.The doctors immediately placed a tube inside the abdomen and drained about one litre of bile-stained pus.A team of surgeons led by Dr Samiran Nundy of the Department of Surgical Gastroenterology and Liver Transplantation conducted an emergency surgery on the patient the next day.The surgery revealed perforation in the lower end of the food pipe. A part of the small intestine had developed gangrene and sloughed off, and the patient had multiple thinned out patches in the wall of the colon with one small leak, Dr Nundy said. “The perforations were closed and the gangrenous segment was resected in a difficult surgery lasting four hours after which a piece of intestine was sent for biopsy,” he said.The biopsy revealed severe ulceration of the intestinal wall with resultant perforation and necrosis caused by invasive white fungus, Dr Arora said.The woman's Covid antibody levels were markedly elevated. Her blood and peritoneal fluid culture showed exuberant growth of the fungus. She was immediately started on anti-fungals and showed remarkable improvement, he said.However, five days later, she had to undergo a second surgery for a small leak from the anastomotic site. She is currently recovering from it, said Dr Aurobindo of the Department of Liver Transplantation and G I Surgery.There have been cases of fungal infection (black fungus) secondary to Covid infection with underlying diabetes, but “white fungus causing severe ulceration and gangrene of the intestine with multifocal perforations in the food pipe, small bowel and large bowel in the setting of Covid infection has not been reported in literature to the best of our knowledge”, Dr Arora said.Malignancy, recent chemotherapy, and a superimposed Covid-19 infection together drought down the immune system of the patient to dismally low levels, he said.Normally, the intestine remains in perfect harmony with the fungus called candida. In immunosuppressed states such as diabetes, injudicious use of steroids, overzealous broad-spectrum antibiotics and chemotherapy for an underlying malignancy, there is inward migration of this candida - the white fungus - from the intestinal lumen into the body tissues by disrupting the normal gut barriers.This is followed by intestinal complications like ulcers, bleeding, gangrene and perforation, followed by transmigration of the candida across the beleaguered gut barrier into blood, culminating in sepsis and multiorgan failure, Dr Arora said.

Now, the infection will be controlled by administering anti-fungal injections, which are being provided by the government," he said.Prof Aftab said their symptoms included unilateral nasal obstruction, facial pain, swelling, numbness, blurring of vision and watery eyes.The patients, both locals, were earlier treated for Covid-19 at a private hospital."Mohal Lal and Vivek underwent endoscopic procedures without any incisions, which resulted in easier recovery time and less pain and discomfort. The patients are, however, under close observation as the black fungus is a very aggressive disease," said Prof Aftab.According to Prof Aftab, they have been receiving more such patients, who are being operated upon, depending on the urgency of their cases.JNMC principal Prof Shahid A. Siddiqui, however, said, "Covid patients can contract black fungus two or three weeks after their recovery. These cases have increased all over the country and people with symptoms specific of the fungus such as nasal congestion, nasal block, dry and black crust in the nasal cavity, black spots around the nose and or eyes, redness and congestion in eyes, reduced eyeball movements, sudden diminished vision and black spots in the oral cavity, especially on the palate, should avoid self-medication and keep their blood sugar level under control.AMU vice-chancellor Prof Tariq Mansoor said, "JNMC health workers are doing their best to check the possibility of fungal infections by making sure that Covid patients - those who are undergoing treatment as well as those who have recovered - are administered right dose of steroids."IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jnmc-treats-2-black-fungus-patients-with-non-evasive-surgery-259240

UN agencies and our partners in India stand ready to support the response efforts if state authorities request it,” he said.UN humanitarian colleagues in Nepal say the country could also experience heavy rain with floods and landslides over the coming hours, Dujarric said, adding that in Bangladesh, "our colleagues say the cyclone has not impacted Cox's Bazar, but they are closely monitoring the situation due to the possibility of storm surges and embankment collapse in border areas." Cox's Bazar is home to the world's largest refugee camp, with nearly a million Rohingya migrants residing at the enclosures in Ukhiya and Teknaf Upazilas.“As you know, India, Bangladesh and Nepal are all grappling with the Covid pandemic. We are concerned that the lack of social distancing in emergency shelters and the temporary suspension of vaccination campaigns could complicate already complicated efforts,” he said.Cyclone Yaas, packing winds gusting to 145 kmph, whiplashed parts of India's eastern coast on Wednesday, killing at least four people and leaving behind a trail of damaged homes and flooded farmland, forcing more than 21 lakh people to be evacuated to safe shelters in the states of West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand.The cyclone, which made landfall around 9 am near Dhamra port in Odisha, is the second cyclonic storm to hit India within a week after Tauktae tore into its western coast, causing death and destruction.Odisha shifted 6.5 lakh people to safer places, and West Bengal 15 lakh people, ahead of the cyclone, amid concerns over spread of Covid infection at the temporary shelters, given the fact that the country is battling the raging second wave of the pandemic.Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik ordered health screening of all 6.5 lakh people taken to the cyclone shelters, including Covid tests, if required.Officials said similar health screenings were also planned for the shelters in Bengal. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said relief materials worth Rs 10 crore had been sent to the affected areas.

The update gave a break-up of the prevalence of the three sub-lineages of the B.1.617 variant in countries, territories and areas as of May 25.According to it, B.1.617.1 is found in 41 countries, B.1.617.2 in 54 countries and B.1.617.3 in six. In addition, information for the B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 sub-lineages was received by WHO from unofficial sources in 11 countries, including China, and will be reviewed as more information becomes available.WHO has declared B.1.617 as a “variant of concern” and the update noted that this variant has “increased transmissibility”, disease severity is “under investigation”, risk of reinfection is “under investigation, possible modest reduction in neutralization activity (B.1.617.1)”.It said that the highest numbers of new COVID cases in the last seven days were reported from India (1,846,055 new cases; 23 per cent decrease), Brazil (451,424 new cases; 3 per cent increase), Argentina (213,046 new cases; 41 per cent increase), the United States of America (188,410 new cases; 20 per cent decrease), and Colombia (107,590 new cases; 7 per cent decrease).“Despite a declining global trend over the past four weeks, incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths remain high, and substantial increases have been observed in many countries throughout the world,” it said.The update further said that the South-East Asia Region reported over 2 million new cases and over 32,000 new deaths, a 21 per cent decrease and a 4 per cent increase respectively compared to the previous week."While the overall incidence of cases continues to decrease (driven primarily by trends in India), death incidence continued to increase for a tenth consecutive week, and sizable increases have been observed in other countries in the region,” it said.In the region, the highest numbers of new deaths were reported from India (28,982 new deaths; 2.1 new deaths per 100,000; a 4 per cent increase), Nepal (1,297 new deaths; 4.5 new deaths per 100,000; a 6 per cent increase), and Indonesia (1,238 new deaths; 0.5 new deaths per 100,000; a 10 per cent increase).

27-05-2021||Hyderabad||Bharat Biotech submits new request to Brazilian regulator on GMP issues for Covaxin||Bharat Biotech which faced a red flag from Brazil's health regulator for supply of Covid vaccine Covaxin to that country over the issues of Good Manufacturing Practices in its plant has filed a new request to the Brazilian authorities for certification.According to the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil Anvisa, Bharat Biotech made the request on May 25 and a day before the Ministry of Health of the South American country filed a new application for authorisation to import 20 million doses of the Covaxin.Earlier, Anvisa denied permission to import Covaxin after its authorities found that the plant in which the vaccine is being made did not meet the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements."Regarding the fulfilment of Good Manufacturing Practices by the manufacturer Bharat Biotech, one of the main aspects that motivated the previous decision, the company filed a new certification request at Anvisa, referring to the production line of the finished product...Complementing the previous information, a new request for certification of Good Manufacturing Practices for the biological input produced by Bharat Biotech was filed on Tuesday," Anvisa said in a roughly translated Portuguese.BharatBiotechInternational Limited on February 26 said it had signed an agreement with the Brazilian government for supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin during the second and third quarters of the current year.However, the Brazilian health regulator refused to import the vaccine into the country citing GMP issues.The vaccine maker had earlier told PTI that the requirements pointed out during inspection would be fulfilled, the timeline for fulfilment "is under discussion with theBrazilNRA and will be resolved soon".GMP certification of all stages of vaccine production is a prerequisite for the registration of the immuniser in Brazil.For the exceptional import order, only the minimum data of Good Production Practices are analysed, but without the need for the certificate in question, Anvisa said.Anvisa recently authorised the conduct of clinical trials of Covaxin in Brazil.Approval for tests on the immuniser developed in India would serve to assess the efficacy, safety and consistency between vaccine batches, it said.The study which was requested by Precis Farmacutica, representative in Brazil for Bharat Biotech, involves the application of two doses, 28 days apart, in 4,500 volunteers, in the states of So Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and Mato Grosso in Brazil.

27-05-2021||New York||India cannot accept terrorism or it in any way legitimate as diplomacy: Jaishankar||India cannot accept terrorism or it cannot accept that in any way legitimate as diplomacy or as any other aspect of statecraft, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday as he underlined that the recent agreement between the militaries of India and Pakistan on ceasefire is a "good step" but there are "obviously bigger issues”.Jaishankar made the comments during a conversation with former US National Security Advisor General HR McMaster in ‘Battlegrounds' session on 'India: Opportunities And Challenges For A Strategic Partnership' presented by the Hoover Institution."Look what I can tell you at this point of time, is that we had an agreement some weeks ago between our Director General of Military Operations that we would not fire across at each other, across the Line of Control, which has seen a lot of that. And it's seen a lot of that, mainly because there's been infiltration from their side,” Jaishankar said while responding to a question on Pakistan."So, the basis for not firing is very clear because the reason for firing is infiltration so if there is no infiltration there's obviously no reason to fire. That's a good step. But I think there are obviously bigger issues," the minister, currently on an official visit to the United States, added.The militaries of India and Pakistan, in a surprise announcement on February 25, said that they had agreed to strictly observe all agreements on a ceasefire along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors. "At the end of the day, the two neighbours have to find ways. It's not a question of do we live with each other. You won't live with each other if you're agnostic about how you live with each other,” Jaishankar said."And you also pointed out that since 1947, part of the problem has been cross-border terrorism... So, there also has to be perhaps appreciation of what the costs have been to themselves. What it has done to their own society and how that has impacted them. I mean, they need to reflect on it because they are doing it to themselves,” he added."But I think it's important right now if there is thinking along the lines that there needs to be a better relationship with India. On our side, there has been clarity of thinking, and the clarity of thinking is that we cannot accept terrorism, or we cannot accept that it is in any way legitimate as diplomacy or as any other aspect of statecraft. So let us see, you know where this progresses. Obviously everybody hopes for the best," the minister added. Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on the Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India's warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019, in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed in the same month.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories in August 2019.In March, Pakistan's powerful Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa said that it was time for India and Pakistan to "bury the past and move forward” as he asserted that the peace between the two neighbours would help to "unlock" the potential of South and Central Asia.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 72 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.Gen Bajwa's remarks came a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan made a similar statement. On a question on Afghanistan, Jaishankar said the country, as any other society, has to decide its future."If things are what they are today in Afghanistan, it didn't happen overnight. It happened because in the last 20 years, a series of decisions and conclusions and policy judgments were made and they all took us in a certain direction," he said. "I do believe that for all its limitations and mistakes and there were many, the gains of the last 20 years in Afghanistan…. an entire generation has grown up in Afghanistan with a much better life than they had in the 20 years before that. I think that's something worth protecting, defending, nurturing. "It's important that we understand that Afghanistan too is a pluralistic society with a diversity of ethnicities, viewpoints, faiths, that minorities are given their due, that women and children their rights are protected. All that was built up by the entire world, the United States, most of all, I do think that they are of great value and that they should not be likely sacrificed at the expediency of politics of the day," he said.At the end of the day, Afghanistan, like every other society has to be allowed its right to decide its future, he said. "The current system may have its shortcomings, I mean I think even they accept it. But the question is how do you find an acceptable basis for who will govern Afghanistan. Some kind of acceptable basis has to be found. It cannot, it should not just be handed over without addressing that push to anybody," he added.The Taliban and the Afghan government are holding direct talks to end 19 years of war that has killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged various parts of the country.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested USD two billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.

It also demanded removal of “misleading Coronil advertisements that claim to address the side-effects of Covid vaccines”.The IMA also questioned the Haryana Government’s move to distribute Coronil among Covid patients, saying the product was scientifically not proven.In a letter to the PM, the IMA questioned Ramdev’s recent contentions that “10,000 doctors died” after taking both doses of Covid vaccine. It said he should be booked for sedition as the statements tantamount to misinforming the public about inoculations.Noting that 753 doctors had died in the first Covid wave and 513 in the second, the IMA said it was painful to see services rendered by nearly 10 lakh modern medicine practitioners being ridiculed as a “stupid system”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ima-slaps-rs-1-000-crore-defamation-notice-on-ramdev-259125

They have been mandated to use automated processes to take down pornography.Facebook and Google have maintained they were working towards complying with the new guidelines announced on February 25.“Requiring messages to trace chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent on WhatsApp. This would break end-to-end encryption and fundamentally undermines people’s right to privacy,” WhatsApp said in a statement, adding that tracing messages would be “ineffective and highly susceptible to abuse”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whatsapp-moves-high-court-against-new-digital-rules-259105
27-05-2021||---||From Amritsar to Tikri, black flags hoisted to mark six months of farmers’ agitation||New Delhi/Chandigarh, May 26Farmers in Punjab and Haryana on Wednesday hoisted black flags atop their houses and vehicles and burnt effigies of the Union Government to mark the completion of six months of their agitation against the three contentious agri laws. Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders, spearheading the protest, said they were prepared to stretch the stir till 2024 when the next General Election is to be held.Speaking at an event in Delhi, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said the SKM was prepared for a long haul.“There is no going back,” he stressed. Protesters at Singhu and Tikri, the epicentres of the farm movement, hoisted flags at the main stage, atop tents, bamboo huts and vehicles. They gathered at the ‘Kisan Andolan’ office at Kundli and held a march amid sloganeering.At Tikri, male protesters wore black badges and the women black salwar-suits and dupattas. They held a bike rally that culminated at the Dhansa border while passing through Jhajjar. “Contrary to the government claims that the stir would end in the course of time, it has spread across the country,” a buoyant Gurnam Singh, BKU (Charuni) chief, said.Rallies were held across Punjab with farmers sporting black bands on turbans.

In other words, they could be liable for criminal action in case of complaints.Sources with knowledge of the matter said the ministry asked the social media companies to immediately provide details and contact information of the chief compliance officer and resident grievance officer.The Centre's deadline for compliance with the new rules ended on Tuesday.Whatsapp takes Centre to court over new digital rulesAfter the deadline ended, Whatsapp took the central government to court over the new rules over privacy concerns. The petition in Delhi High Court that challenges the new rules asks the court to declare that one of the new IT rules is a violation of privacy rights in India's constitution since it requires social media companies to identify the "first originator of information" when authorities demand it, Reuters reported. A statement from the central government issued later in the evening denied any such allegation saying that new rules would have no impact on the normal functioning of Whatsapp.Deadline over, Twitter, Facebook yet to comply with ethics codeThe lawsuit comes in the middle of an already raging debate about the shrinking democratic space in India. Critics of the current establishment see the controversial new rules as an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s central government to tighten its noose over the digital space.Toolkit controversy: Delhi Police descends on Twitter's officesThis also comes in the middle of another controversy over Twitter’s tagging a toolkit shared by Prime Minister Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and some others over the Covid-19 pandemic as manipulated media.

These include Covishield manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad.The Russian Sputnik V is the third vaccine to get approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for Emergency Use Authorisation and has been used in a few private hospitals so far. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmr-to-examine-effectiveness-of-astrazenecas-covishield-and-bharat-biotechs-covaxin-258790

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Sputnik V-makers have agreed to supply vaccine to Delhi: Kejriwal||As Delhi grapples with a shortage of coronavirus vaccines, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the makers of Sputnik V will supply anti-Covid jabs to the city but the quantity is yet to be decided.He also said there were around 620 cases of black fungus or mucormycosis in Delhi, but Amphotericin-B injections used in its treatment are in short supply."Talks with the makers of Sputnik V are on. They will give us vaccines, but the quantity is yet to be decided. Our officials and the representatives of the manufacturers met on Tuesday, too," the CM told reporters at the launch of Delhi's first drive-through vaccination centre at Vegas Mall in Dwarka.The Centre has asked states to procure vaccines from the international market, but no state government has been able to purchase even "one additional vaccine" so far, he said."All state governments have tried everything, they have (floated) global tenders and talked to all vaccine-manufacturers. All firms have declined to talk to us," he said. The Centre needs to demonstrate a sense of urgency and run the vaccination drive on a war-footing, he added.He said it is the Central government's responsibility to procure vaccines. "Today, we are at war against COVID-19, wherein the Centre and states have their share of responsibilities. The Centre cannot shirk its responsibility and ask states to fend for themselves. It is wrong," he said."It is something like Pakistan declaring a war on India and then they ask if Delhi has manufactured a nuclear bomb and Uttar Pradesh bought a tank...It is the Central government's responsibility to procure and supply vaccines. Delhi can be held accountable if they (the Centre) give us vaccines and we do not open up centres," a visibly angry Kejriwal said.Asked if the Delhi government is going to lift the lockdown, he said, "A lockdown cannot be extended indefinitely. It has hit economic activity and businesses…we will decide how to go about reopening." While extending the ongoing lockdown till May 31, Kejriwal had on Saturday said his government will start the unlock process from next week if Covid cases keep declining.The CM also said that anti-Covid shots manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer are both suitable for children and the Central government should procure these vaccines in a large number to vaccinate them.  The CM also said that a government-run drive-through vaccination centre is likely to be launched at Chhatrasal on Saturday."Many more drive-through vaccination centres will be opened up soon, but the shortage of vaccines is a major issue. The inoculation drive has slowed down. Many vaccination centres have been shut not just in Delhi, but the entire country," he said.India was among the first countries to manufacture a vaccine for COVID-19, but "we are six months behind others because we did not make a plan in time for mass vaccination, distribution and to ramp up production", he said. "Forget what has happened, but there is no sense of urgency even now. All vaccines available in the international market can still be given approval for use in India within 24 hours," the chief minister added.The drive-through vaccination centre at Vegas Mall is an initiative by the Delhi government and Southwest Delhi District Magistrate, a hospital spokesperson said. Akash Healthcare Super Specialty Hospital has procured 30,000 Covishield doses for inoculation of the 18-44 age group at the centre, an official said. "We will go slow at the starting to avoid rush on the road and administer 40 to 50 doses for the initial few days," DM Naveen Aggarwal said.The number of doses administered per day will be increased gradually to around 300 per day, he said.Kejriwal had earlier said his government has written to Dr Reddy's Laboratories for the supply of around 67 lakh doses of Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V.Dr Reddy's Laboratories launched Sputnik V in India on May 14.Delhi had recorded 156 Covid fatalities on Tuesday, the lowest since April 16, while 1,568 new cases were reported as the positive rate dipped to nearly a two-month low of 2.14 per cent, according to the daily health bulletin.It was the third day in a row that the daily cases in the national capital remained below 2,000.

He was accused of sexually assaulting his then colleague in a lift of a five-star hotel in Goa in 2013 when they were attending an event.“It is extremely revealing that the prosecutrix’s (complainant) account neither demonstrates any kind of normative behaviour on her own part that a victim of sexual assault might plausibly show,” the judgment said.CCTV footage and photographs clearly proved that the woman was “absolutely in a good mood, happy, normal and smiling and did not look distressed or traumatized” even though these footage or photographs captured her after the alleged sexual assault had taken place, the court said.The CCTV footage submitted by the prosecution showing the woman walking out of the lift after the alleged incident did not support her claim that she was in “shock or trauma and blinking in tears”, it said.“It cannot be lost sight (of) that rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to the victim but at the same time a false allegation of rape can cause an equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused as well,” the court said.It was also “unnatural” on the part of the victim to send a message to the accused subsequently about her location in the hotel, the court said. If she had been recently sexually assaulted by him and terrified of him and was not in a proper state of mind, then why should she report to the accused and disclose to him her location, the court asked.The victim sending messages to the accused “proactively” without any attempt by him to ask her where she was clearly established that she was not traumatised or terrified of being found by him, the court said.Further, there was no medical evidence to prove sexual assault as the FIR was filed after a delay and the woman refused to undergo medical examination, the judge noted.If, as per the victim’s claim, she had struggled with the accused (during the alleged sexual assault),  she would have suffered some injuries, but she admitted she did not receive any physical injury, the court said.On the victim’s deposition of the alleged incident, the court said, “This is a narrative of extreme implausibility and it is not possible to believe that the prosecutrix, a woman who is aware of laws, (who is) intelligent, alert and physically fit, would not push or ward off the accused if she got pushed up against the wall.” The victim, as a journalist, reported on issues related to sexual crimes against women and gender issues and was hence aware of the latest laws on rape and sexual harassment, the court said.Further, she made completely inconsistent statements which created doubts about the truthfulness of her claims, the judge noted. “The scrutiny of the prosecutrix’s evidence reveals several discrepancies/changes in her versions” but the police and prosecution turned a blind eye to them, the court observed.The woman’s memory of the events was “highly convenient which fails to function at crucial times, whenever evidence to the contrary is produced” and ‘there are material contradictions and omissions and inconsistent statements in the deposition of the victim which make her testimony not of sterling quality to base the conviction only on her testimony,” the court said.Referring to an apology email sent by Tejpal to the woman on November 19, 2013, the court said it might not have been sent voluntarily. He might have written it due to “explicit pressure and intimidation by the victim” on the Managing Editor of Tehelka to act swiftly and also the inducement and promise by the victim that the matter would be closed at the institutional level if Tejpal were to tender an apology, said the court.It could not accept this email as admissible evidence against Tejpal, the court held.The judge also noted that before lodging the FIR, the woman reached out to prominent lawyers, a member of the National Commission for Women and also a few journalists.“With the help of experts, there may be a possibility of doctoring of events or adding of incidents. Advocate for the accused has thus rightly submitted that the deposition of the prosecutrix has to be scrutinized in that angle,” the order said.The court also took note of a claim made by a defence witness that the victim had told him during the event (when the alleged incident took place) that she had been flirting with Tejpal.The victim in her deposition also stated that she did not believe that there was anything “immoral about consensual sex, consuming alcohol or smoking,” the court noted.The court also took note of the content of hundreds of messages sent by the victim from her mobile phone, submitted as part of the prosecution evidence.“The (victim’s) messaging record shows that it was entirely the norm for the prosecutrix to have such flirtatious and sexual conversations with friends and acquaintances,” the court said, noting that Tejpal and the victim had had a flirtatious conversation on the night of the alleged incident.While rejecting all charges against Tejpal, the court only accepted the argument that he was in a position of trust or authority towards the victim, and was in a position of control or dominance over her.

On Tuesday, India recorded 1,96,427 cases -- the lowest since April 14.According to the Health Ministry, a total of 2,95,955 people have been discharged in the last 24 hours, with 2,43,50,816 being cured from Covid till date.The Health Ministry said that a total of 20,06,62,456 people have been vaccinated so far in the country, including 20,39,087 who were administered vaccines in the last 24 hours.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 33,48,11,496 samples have been tested up to May 25 for Covid-19.

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Privacy: WhatsApp takes Centre to court over new digital rules; GoI denies allegation||Facebook-owned WhatsApp on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the Indian government in the Delhi High Court saying that user privacy is in its DNA and requiring messaging apps to "trace" chats undermines people's right to privacy—an allegation that the central government under the Bharatiya Janata Party denied later in the evening.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had asked social media platforms to abide by the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 by May 25, or face strict action.New digital rules: IT Ministry demands compliance report from social media companiesA WhatsApp spokesperson said that requiring messaging apps to "trace" chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent on WhatsApp."It would break end-to-end encryption and fundamentally undermines people's right to privacy. We have consistently joined civil society and experts around the world in opposing requirements that would violate the privacy of our users," the spokesperson stressed.The company said that in the meantime, "we will also continue to engage with the Government of India on practical solutions aimed at keeping people safe, including responding to valid legal requests for the information available to us".In his response issued on Wednesday evening, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the new digital rules that require Whatsapp to provide them that origin of flagged messages wouldn’t impact what it said was the “normal functioning of Whatsapp”. He cited countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada to say that their rules require social media firms to allow for legal interception“WhatsApp’s challenge to intermediary guidelines is an unfortunate attempt to prevent norms from coming into effect,” the statement said.The requirement of tracing origin of messages under new IT rules is for prevention and investigation of "very serious offences" related to sovereignty and integrity of India and security of the state, a statement from his ministry said. The tussle between Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook and the Union government has reached its nadir, with cops raiding Twitter offices in the pandemic earlier this week over the ToolKit controversy.WhatsApp has gone to the court as the deadline to comply with the new IT (intermediary) rules meant for big social media platforms in India ended on Tuesday.WhatsApp said that new rules infringe on users' privacy.WhatsApp has also gone ahead with implementing its controversial user privacy policy from May 15, clearing stating that "we will maintain this approach until at least the forthcoming PDP (personal data protection) law comes into effect".When the concept of "traceability" was first proposed in early 2019, dozens of organisations wrote to the Indian government about how such a provision would violate the privacy of Indian users.The IT rules published earlier this year, in addition to calling for "traceability" risk criminal penalties for non-compliance.WhatsApp has consistently opposed legal action that would break end-to-end encryption. The company is currently fighting the same before the Supreme Court of Brazil on a similar matter."We also do not believe traceability can be imposed in a way that cannot be spoofed or modified, leading to new ways for people to be framed for things they did not say or do. Such massive data collection also makes messaging platforms inherently less secure by opening up more avenues for hacking," WhatsApp had said earlier.The MeitY had announced its draft new IT (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules for social media platforms on February 25.As per the new rules, the social media platforms will have to remove offending content within 36 hours after a government directive or a legal order.The new rules mandate that the intermediaries, including social media intermediaries, must establish a grievance redressal mechanism for receiving/resolving complaints from the users or victims.On the user privacy policy, the Facebook-owned platform with over 400 million users in the country has defended its position, saying that it continues to engage with the government to resolve the issue.WhatsApp said it has sent a reply to the notice by MeitY after the ministry directed the Facebook-owned platform to withdraw its controversial user privacy policy.— Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/privacy-whatsapp-takes-centre-to-court-over-new-digital-rules-goi-denies-allegation-258734

In certain areas, the waves even went past the top of coconut trees that line these popular beaches.The Army has deployed 17 columns in West Bengal to assist the state administration, the defence official said.Rescue operation by the Army was also on at Orphuli in the Howrah district, he said.In South 24 Parganas, many places, including Kakdwip, Fraserganj, Gosaba and Maipith in the Sunderbans region were flooded, displacing lakhs of villagers as thousands of kutcha houses were extensively damaged in the surging water and gale wind, officials said.Several rivers in the riverine delta region were in spate owing to the phenomenal rise in water level caused by the dual effect of storm surge from the cyclone and the astronomical tide due to the full moon, they said.Flooding was also reported from Sagar island at the confluence of Hooghly and Bay of Bengal. The water level rose to nearly five feet in front of the famed Kapil Muni temple near the beach on the island, officials said.Some fishing boats and equipment were also destroyed at harbours in Kakdwip, leaving the fishermen devoid of their livelihood.“We will starve unless the government provides us with assistance,” said a hapless villager at Kakdwip as his boat lay broken into pieces.The Kolkata Port was on tenterhook for a while as Hooghly swelled to eight meters, surpassing the heights of the external lock gate of the Haldia Dock System, an official said.Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and state police and civil defence volunteers were working round-the-clock to move people to safety, officials said.Waterlogging was also reported from certain low-lying areas of Kolkata with the authorities facing a tough time in pumping out due to the high tide in Hooghly, they said.The weather office has forecast extremely heavy rainfall in East and West Midnapore districts and heavy to very heavy rainfall in Jhargram, Bankura, South 24 Parganas districts over the next 24 hours.Heavy rain will occur at isolated places in Purulia, Nadia, Murshidabad, Purba Bardhaman, Howrah, Hooghly, Kolkata, North 24 Parganas, Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts owing to the effect of ‘Yaas’, the weather office said.In Odisha, a red warning of heavy to very heavy rainfall was issued for nine districts.“Heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places with isolated extremely heavy fall very likely to occur over the districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Dhenkanal,” the weather office said.The system lay centred at about 15 kilometre west of Balasore at 1.30 pm with intensity of 100-110 kmph, gusting to 120 kmph. It would move north-northwestwards and weaken gradually into a cyclonic storm during the next six hours, the weather office said.Jharkhand, which was already on high alert, continued evacuating low-lying areas amid the forecast that the cyclone would be hitting the state by midnight, officials in Ranchi said.Operations are being executed on war-footing in the vulnerable areas in East and West Singhbhum, besides some other districts, in view of Yaas, Disaster Management Secretary Amitabh Kaushal told PTI.A damaged beach area due to rough sea during landfall of cyclone Yaas at Digha in East Midnapore district on Wednesday.

Facebook today said it was working to implement operational processes and aimed to comply with the provisions of the IT rules that will come into effect from May 26.The deadline ended in the backdrop of a scheduled meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who is on a five-day visit to New York and Washington, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Most of the social media platforms are owned by US-based entities.The social media platforms were required to abide by the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, notified on February 25. The rules suggest that significant social media companies (with more than 50 lakh users) like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube will have to comply with the ethics code.The government wants to have “additional due diligence” to appoint a chief compliance officer for ensuring that the new rules are adhered to. It also wants a nodal contact person who will coordinate round-the-clock with law enforcement agencies weeding out any inflammatory content and a resident grievance officer to acknowledge grievances of users within 24 hours and respond to them within 15 days.Till now, social media companies were not liable for content posted on their platforms. Once the rules kick in, the company and the three-member panel appointed by it can be held criminally liable if any objectionable content is shared over their platforms.The social media platforms had sought an extension of the deadline. Indian social media company Koo, meanwhile, has complied with the new norms.Fresh guidelines notified in FebruarySocial media firms need to appoint three types of officials1 Chief Compliance Officer: Will ensure new rules are followed2 Nodal Officer: Will be in touch with law enforcing agencies 24x7 to remove or block any illegal or inflammatory content3 Resident Grievance Officer: Will acknowledge grievances within 24 hours and respond to complainant in 15 daysCompanies need to identify the first originator of any contentious messageThree-official panel to be liable if any illegal content is shared over their platforms||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deadline-over-twitter-facebook-yet-to-comply-with-ethics-code-258453
