08-05-2021||New Delhi||Modi’s actions in attempting to stifle criticism during crisis inexcusable: Lancet||At times, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has seemed more intent on removing criticism on Twitter than trying to control the Covid-19 pandemic, medical journal The Lancet has said in an editorial.“Modi’s actions in attempting to stifle criticism and open discussion during the crisis are inexcusable,” Lancet said.The editorial published in the world’s most renowned medical journal said the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that India will see a staggering 1 million deaths from Covid-19 by August 1.“If that outcome was to happen, Modi’s government would be responsible for presiding over a self-inflicted national catastrophe,” Lancet said in a scathing criticism of the government.Lancet said India squandered its early successes in controlling Covid-19. Until April, the government’s Covid-19 taskforce had not met in months, it said.“The consequences of that decision are clear before us, and India must now restructure its response while the crisis rages. The success of that effort will depend on the government owning up to its mistakes, providing responsible leadership and transparency, and implementing a public health response that has science at its heart,” Lancet said.In the suggested course of action, Lancet said India must reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission as much as possible while the vaccine is rolled out.“As cases continue to mount, the government must publish accurate data in a timely manner, and forthrightly explain to the public what is happening and what is needed to bend the epidemic curve, including the possibility of a new federal lockdown,” it said.Genome sequencing needs to be expanded to better track, understand and control emerging and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, it said.“Local governments have begun taking disease containment measures, but the federal government has an essential role in explaining to the public the necessity of masking, social distancing, halting mass gatherings, voluntary quarantine, and testing,” it added. Lancet said the botched vaccination campaign must be rationalised and implemented with all due speed. There are two immediate bottlenecks to overcome: increasing vaccine supply (some of which should come from abroad) and setting up a distribution campaign that can cover not just urban but also rural and poorer citizens, who constitute more than 65 per cent of the population (over 800 million people) but face a desperate scarcity of public health and primary care facilities, the editorial said.The government must work with local and primary healthcare centres that know their communities and create an equitable distribution system for the vaccine, it added.Lancet said the scenes of suffering in India are hard to comprehend. As of May 4, more than 20.2 million cases of Covid-19 had been reported, with a rolling average of 3,78,000 cases a day, together with more than 2,22,000 deaths, which experts believe are likely to be substantial underestimated, Lancet said.Hospitals are overwhelmed, and health workers are exhausted and becoming infected. Social media is full of desperate people (doctors and the public) seeking medical oxygen, hospital beds, and other necessities, it said.Lancet said that yet before the second wave of cases of Covid-19 began to mount in early March, Minister of Health Harsh Vardhan declared that India was in the “endgame” of the epidemic.The impression from the government was that India had beaten Covid-19 after several months of low case counts, despite repeated warnings of the dangers of a second wave and the emergence of a new strain, it added.“Despite warnings about the risks of superspreader events, the government allowed religious festivals to go ahead, drawing millions of people from around the country, along with huge political rallies — conspicuous for their lack of Covid-19 mitigation measures,” the editorial said.The message that Covid-19 was essentially over also slowed the start of India’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign, which has vaccinated less than 2 per cent of the population, it said.“At the federal level, India’s vaccination plan soon fell apart. The government abruptly shifted course without discussing the change in policy with states, expanding vaccination to everyone older than 18 years, draining supplies, and creating mass confusion and a market for vaccine doses in which states and hospital systems competed,” it added.The crisis has not been equally distributed, with states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra unprepared for the sudden spike in cases, quickly running out of medical oxygen, hospital space, and overwhelming the capacity of cremation sites, and with some state governments threatening those asking for oxygen or a hospital bed with national security laws, Lancet said.Others, such as Kerala and Odisha, were better prepared, and have been able to produce enough medical oxygen in this second wave to export it to other states, it said.

In a sense disgusted with such stance,” Dhankhar tweeted after the officers met him.Maintaining that the home secretary has failed to apprise him on the law and order situation vis-a-vis the post-poll violence, Dhankhar had asked the chief secretary to see him.Dhankhar had tweeted earlier in the day that the home secretary did not forward reports of the DGP and commissioner of Kolkata Police in this regard.“Chief Secretary @MamataOfficial has been called upon to see me today before 7 PM as ACS Home @HomeBengal failed to impart status report on law and order regarding post-poll violence,” the governor tweeted.“Such drifting of governance @MamataOfficial from constitutional prescriptions is unfortunate and cannot be overlooked. While the State passes through most severe post poll violence, there is just NO input to the constitutional head. This is least expected,” Dhankhar wrote.The West Bengal has been rocked by large-scale violence after the bitterly fought state elections.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said that 16 persons of different political parties have lost their lives in clashes after the end of the polls.A four-member team of the union home ministry, tasked with looking into reasons for the post-poll violence in Bengal, had met Dhankhar at Raj Bhawan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-governor-expresses-displeasure-at-not-being-updated-on-law-and-order-situation-250028

08-05-2021||Dhaka/Colombo||COVID-19 Indian variant spreads to neighbouring countries; detected in Lanka, Bangladesh||India’s neighbours Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have reported the first cases of the Indian variant of coronavirus, also known as B.1.617, prompting authorities to exercise caution to contain its spread.Bangladesh overnight detected six people who had recently visited India infected with the Indian variant of the COVID-19, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) spokesman Professor Dr Nazmul Islam Munna said on Saturday.Out of the six people, two were detected in the national capital Dhaka. All of them are currently kept under quarantine.“Six people have been found to be carrying the Indian variant so far and we expect more people to be detected with identical types of virus in the coming days,” Munna told PTI.“This development means we in Bangladesh need extreme caution, perfect compliance of health guidelines . . . If we maintain the guidelines, no variant—deadly or not—can cause major problems,” Munna said.Following the detection of the Indian variant, Bangladesh on Saturday extended the closure of land borders with India for 14 more days.Last month, Bangladesh sealed its borders with India due to the raging number of coronavirus cases in the neighbouring country. But officials and reports said many people came to Bangladesh from India under special arrangements and some of them fled a mandatory quarantine, heightening risks of spreading the pandemic.Meanwhile, Sri Lanka on Saturday detected its first case of the Indian variant of coronavirus in a person who recently returned from India.The Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine of the University of Sri Jayewardenapura in a report said the infected person was found at a quarantine center for returnees in Colombo.The sample was among several other samples obtained for testing until April 30.Both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are experiencing a surge in the coronavirus cases.Sri Lanka on Friday recorded 19 deaths, the highest number of fatalities in a single day. The total number of deaths in the country due to COVID-19 stands at 764. The country has over 121,000 coronavirus infections.Bangladesh reported 45 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 11,878. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country stands at 772,127 with 1,285 fresh infections reported on Saturday.The B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2 or the ‘Indian strain’, feared to be contributing to a surge in coronavirus cases in India, has been designated as the Variants of Interest (VOI) by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the UN health agency said in its weekly epidemiological update last month.In its report, the WHO had said that the Indian strain of the coronavirus has been found in at least 17 countries.The B.1.617 variant has three new spike protein mutations. Two mutations—E484Q and L452R—are in the area important for antibody-based neutralisation.The third mutation—P681R—allows the virus to enter cells a little better.  These are defining characteristics of the variant.The B.1.617 variant has been found prevalent largely in Maharashtra and Delhi that have been severely hit by a devastating second wave of the pandemic.Experts have said that the Indian strain of the coronavirus carries higher transmissibility similar to the UK variant, but there is little evidence so far of it being more lethal than the original virus.Anurag Agrawal, the Director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), told PTI, “As far as we know, neither the UK variant nor this one (B.1.617) is associated with increased severity of illness or death. The UK strain is proven to have higher transmissibility and B.1.617 may have increased transmissibility”. “But this (that the B.1.617 variant has more transmissibility) has not been proven and there are several characterises to prove it and the studies have not been completed,” he said.The original India variant – officially known as B.1.617 – was first detected in October. Last month, UK’s Public Health England (PHE) had categorised two further subtypes to that – B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3.Experts believe that of the three, the variant B.1.617.2 is at least as transmissible as the so-called Kent variant, which had been detected in England at the end of last year and led to the UK’s second wave surge in coronavirus infections earlier this year.Meanwhile, health authorities in England on Friday elevated one subtype of the so-called Indian variant from under investigation to a Variant of Concern (VOC) following a rise in the number of cases in the UK and evidence of community transmission.The B.1.617.2, classified as a Variant Under Investigation (VUI) on April 28, is now known as VOC-21APR-02 after it was found to be at least as transmissible as the so-called Kent variant, detected in England last year and the dominant variant in the UK so far. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-indian-variant-spreads-to-neighbouring-countries-detected-in-lanka-bangladesh-250025
08-05-2021||---||Why are we hiding actual deaths: IMA to Centre||New Delhi, May 8The Indian Medical Association on Saturday wrote to the Health Ministry asking for an urgent national lockdown to give a breather to the health systems and doctors and asked why the Centre was hiding deaths.The letter came as daily deaths hit a record 4,187 COVID-19 and daily cases were 4,01,078.“In the last 20 days IMA has been insisting on the need for a national lockdown rather than a few states declaring lockdowns for 10 to 15 days so as to get breathing time for health infrastructure to replenish materials and manpower. Lockdown will break the chain of this devastating spread. Yet the Centre has refused to head to lockdown resulting in 4 lakh new patients every day,” the IMA said.Questioning the differential vaccine pricing policy the IMA also flagged the deepening oxygen crisis apart from shortage of steroids at many places.The IMA also questioned underreporting of Covid data saying “we have lost 756 doctors in the first wave and 146 rapidly in the second. Hundreds of deaths in bug hospitals are being shown as non Covid and crematoriums are full. RTPCR negative but CT scan positive cases are not being counted. Why are we trying to hide actual deaths? If people know about actual deaths, seriousness about Covid behaviour will rise,” said the IMA asking the Centre to wake up from its slumber.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-are-we-hiding-actual-deaths-ima-to-centre-250020

Concerted efforts should be made by all the key stakeholders to ensure the care and protection of children during the second wave of COVID,” he said.He suggested developing a mechanism to address interim care and needs of orphan, separated, or unaccompanied children, including clear guidance on steps to be taken in the event such a child has been exposed or has symptoms of the virus and requires a period of isolation and treatment.He further emphasised that caregivers and employees of care institutions---both government managed and private---should be vaccinated, as frontline professionals and also that the services of these institutions should be declared as essential services.Some key priorities outlined by Justice Bhat were---screening and medical care for the children in the institutional care, provision of emergency medicine, supplies, emergency access to hospitals, and a roster of doctors available for tele-consultation for reach CCIs and on priority, vaccination of all staff working in the Child Care Institutions and other frontline Child Protection workers.Nomination of state and district level nodal officers empowered to take decisions and constitute a task force for rapid emergency response for children during COVID-19 was also highlighted.On the needs of orphaned children, he reiterated that a coordinated response, in each district, by a committee to ensure temporary foster homes as well as gather and secure all information relating to the deceased parent or parent, for future use should be set up.Each district CWC should compile all the details of such children, and their needs, it was emphasised.Justice Bhat also stated that “prevention of and response to the second wave of COVID surge requires close coordination and collaboration between child protection system and health system, a multi-sectoral response ensures that children and caregivers’ needs are addressed holistically and it leads to a better outcome for children”.In the review meeting, judges of all high courts and officials of various states and union territories presented the measures which are being undertaken for care, protection, and well-being of the children during the second wave of COVID.Some of the measures by the state and union territories were setting up a state-level nodal officers and district task force for rapid response for care and protection children during the current pandemic, sponsorship for the children lost parents or the bread earners lost income or facing economic hardship.High Court juvenile justice committees represented by judges, as well as state and union territories also highlighted the measures they are taking to stop the spread of COVID-19 in child care institutions and the medical treatment and care of the children who contracted the disease.Aastha Khatwani, joint secretary in the Ministry of Women and Child Development, said: “Considering the emergency need, the ministry has issued the advisory to stop illegal adoption and care and protection of the children who have lost one either or both the parents to COVID”.She further added that the ministry has developed clear, coordinated, easy to understand, community messaging on children’s unique risks, vulnerabilities and need of care and protection during COVID-19, and these messages are disseminated and broadcast through social media and other channels.Vandhana Kandhari, child protection specialist of UNICEF India highlighted that “efforts to pre-emptively scale up the capacity of family-based care and social protection systems are critical to enhance family resilience and prevent unnecessary recourse to residential care”.Kandhari added that in order to provide interim care to the children, extended family members, trusted friends, good neighbours and or community members can be declared ‘fit person’.The review meeting was held with the chairpersons and members of juvenile justice committees of various high courts and was also attended by officials of Departments of Women and Child Development, Social Welfare and Health from various states and union territories. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-step-up-measures-for-well-being-protection-of-children-during-covid-19-second-wave-sc-judge-250019

Active cases now stood at 4.17 lakh, the state government said.Only essential services are exempted and people have been strictly warned against coming out in public places or travelling unnecessarily, with police intensifying patrolling.Major temples are closed. All borders are under the strict surveillance of the police and only freight vehicles and those having permission from the authorities concerned are permitted through check-posts, state police added.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin said that a total lockdown had to be clamped in the backdrop of a sharp increase in daily new infections of about 25,000 which was likely to go up.“The total lockdown will be enforced from 4 AM on May 10 to 4 AM on May 24 to further intensify the efforts to curb the spread of the disease,” he said.Puducherry is already under lockdown till May 10.Andhra Pradesh had announced a partial lockdown with curfew from 12 noon to 6 AM from May 6 for two weeks. The state had earlier imposed a night curfew. Telangana has extended night curfew till May 15.Twelve states accounted for 80.68 per cent of India’s over 37.23 lakh active coronavirus cases, according to official data.Maharashtra has the maximum number of active cases at 6.57 lakh, followed by Karnataka 5,36,661, Kerala 4,02,997, Uttar Pradesh 2,54,118, and Rajasthan 1,99,147 cases.The other states having large active cases are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Haryana and Bihar.Ten states accounted for 70.77 per cent of the new cases in the last 24 hours, out of which Maharashtra has reported the highest daily new cases at 54,022, followed by Karnataka 48,781 and Kerala 38,460 new cases.Among the remaining seven states and union territories with high daily new cases are Uttar Pradesh (27,763), Tamil Nadu (26,465) and Delhi (19,832).A record 4,187 COVID-19 fatalities in a day took India’s death toll to 2,38,270, while 4,01,078 new infections were reported during the period, pushing the tally of cases to 2,18,92,676, according to Union Health Ministry data on Saturday morning.The 4,187 new fatalities include 898 from Maharashtra, 592 from Karnataka, 372 from Uttar Pradesh, 341 from Delhi, 208 from Chhattisgarh and 197 from Tamil Nadu.Many of the states have already announced lockdown or similar curbs like corona curfew.In the Northeast, Mizoram government has announced seven-day complete lockdown from May 10 and Sikkim has imposed lockdown-like restrictions till May 16.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-in-kerala-tamil-nadu-amid-a-southern-surge-in-covid-wave-250018
08-05-2021||New Delhi||Experimental drone flights allowed for vaccine delivery||The government is providing conditional exemption for experimental drone flights for vaccine delivery as part of its endeavour to enhance the scope of drone usage in the country and assist the nation to fight Covid-19 pandemic.Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) & Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have granted conditional exemption to the government of Telangana for conducting experimental Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone flights for delivery of vaccines.Exemption has been granted from Unmanned Aircraft System {UAS) Rules, 2021.This exemption is subject to complete adherence to the conditions and the directions/ exemptions issued (or to be issued in future) by MoCA. It will be This valid for a period of one year from the date of approval of the SOP or until further orders, whichever is earlier.Last month, the Telangana government was granted conditional exemption for conducting experimental delivery of Covid-19 vaccines within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) Range using drones.To accelerate the drone deployment process to formulate application-based models, the grant has been extended to Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). The trials may commence by end of May 2021.Earlier, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was granted conditional exemption last month for conducting feasibility study of Covid-19 vaccine delivery using drones in collaboration with IIT Kanpur.The grant of these permissions is intended to achieve the dual objectives of faster vaccine delivery and improved healthcare access by ensuring primary healthcare delivery at the citizen's doorstep, limiting human exposure to Covid congested or Covid prone areas through aerial delivery, ensuring access to health care to the last mile, especially in remote areas, possible integration into the middle mile of medical logistics for long range drones and improving medical supply chain, with millions of doses to be transported across India.One of the conditions for conducting experimental BVLOS drone flights for delivery of vaccines by government of Telangana is that the maximum permitted height for drone operations is 400 feet Above Ground Level (AGL).It further said that Energy reserve of 15 per cent of flight time should be provisioned for.Another condition states that the Telangana government shall post a Single Point Coordinator (SPC) at Shamshabad ATC for the entire duration of the trial flights to ensure smooth coordination with ATC.The conditions further mention that Drone operations shall be limited between local sunrise and local sunset. It is stated that Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) should prevail at take-off and landing sites. Further, the condition is that weather limitations stipulated by the drone manufacturer shall be complied with.The conditions specify some requirements to be satisfied for drones used for BVLOS trial flights. It is further stated in the conditions that upon completion of the trials, the Government of Telangana shall submit a detailed Proof of Concept to MoCA and DGCA.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experimental-drone-flights-allowed-for-vaccine-delivery-250014

Hatchlings emerge out of the eggshells after 45-50 days of the incubation period, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-48-crore-olive-ridley-turtles-born-in-odishas-gahirmatha-beach-250012

In this regard, the top cop called for intensifying checking at pickets and conducting patrolling in dense population areas, likely spreaders spots and containment zones, it stated."Watch be kept on shops opening other than the grocery or essential store shops and action be taken against such shop owners who are willfully violating the restrictions and endangering public health," Shrivastava said.He said, although district police are taking legal action against lockdown violators, stricter implementation of the lockdown should be done by making announcements through public address systems.Fruits and vegetables markets should be shifted to open areas, wherever possible, and the hawkers should maintain social distancing. Vegetable markets should be sanitised after closure. Commercial vehicles should not carry more passengers than prescribed, the statement quoted Shrivastava as saying.The Delhi Police commissioner also directed the field officers to take note of forthcoming Eid-ul-Fitr and follow DDMA orders in this regard by liaising with community elders and religious leaders. He reiterated that DCPs should continue to pay attention to treatment and admission of infected police personnel and their family members in hospitals. He also called for exploring the possibilities of creating vaccination facilities at wellness centres so that the frontline warriors do not face inconvenience in getting their second dose in due time, the statement said.The DCPs were also asked by the top cop to tie up with private ambulance providers for the transportation of infected police personnel to hospitals. He asked the DCPs to motivate COVID warriors to donate plasma to save lives, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-chief-calls-for-strict-action-against-hoarders-of-covid-19-medicines-oxygen-cylinders-250009

The tenure of the Task Force shall be six months initially, it said.The court made 12-point terms of reference which included assessing and making recommendations for the entire country based on the need for, availability and distribution of medical oxygen and to facilitate auditing by sub-groups within each state/UT.According to an order passed by a Bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice MR Shah, the Union Cabinet Secretary will be the NTF convener and the Union Health Secretary its ex-officio member. The Cabinet Secretary may nominate an officer not below the rank of Additional Secretary to deputise for him, when necessary, it added. Read also: Covid positive report no longer mandatory for hospital admissionDGCI okays DRDO-drug for Covid cureOther members of the NTF included Bhabatosh Biswas, former Vice Chancellor, West Bengal University of Health Sciences, Kolkata; Devender Singh Rana, Chairperson, Board of Management, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi; Devi Prasad Shetty, Chairperson and Executive Director, Narayana Healthcare, Bengaluru; Gagandeep Kang, Professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu; and JV Peter, Director, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The rest five members were Naresh Trehan, Chairperson and Managing Director, Medanta Hospital and Heart Institute, Gurugram; Rahul Pandit, Director, Critical Care Medicine and ICU, Fortis Hospital, Mulund (Mumbai, Maharashtra) and Kalyan (Maharashtra); and Dr Saumitra Rawat, Chairman & Head, Department of Surgical Gastroenterology and Liver Transplant, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi; Shiv Kumar Sarin of Institute of Liver and Biliary Science (ILBS), Delhi; and Zarir F Udwadia of Hinduja Hospital, Breach Candy Hospital Mumbai.It also set up a sub-group for carrying out the audit exercise for Delhi’s health infrastructure and allocation of oxygen. The sub-group consisted of Randeep Guleria (AIIMS), Sandeep Budhiraja (Max Healthcare) and two IAS officers not below the rank of Joint Secretary—one each from the Centre and Delhi government.The court, however, said, the Centre shall continue with the present practice of making allocations of oxygen until the Task Force has submitted its recommendations in regard to proposed modalities. On receipt of the recommendations of NTF, the Centre shall take an appropriate decision in regard to the allocation of oxygen and on all other recommendations, it said.The order comes after days of public spat between the Centre and Delhi Government over allocation of medical oxygen and death of several COVID19 patients due to shortage of the life-saving gas.“We expect that the leading experts in the country shall associate with the work of the Task Force both as members and resource persons” as this will facilitate a meeting of minds and the formulation of scientific strategies to deal with an unprecedented human crisis,” the Bench said in its order published on Saturday.It said the STF will enable the decision makers to have inputs which go beyond finding ad-hoc solutions to the present problems, adding this will ensure that projected future requirements can be scientifically mapped in the present and may be modulated in the light of experiences gained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-forms-national-task-force-to-streamline-oxygen-allocation-249996

08-05-2021||Mumbai||Allow states to have own apps for COVID-19 vaccination: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav   Thackeray has urged the central government to allow states to develop their ownapplications for COVID-19 vaccination programme.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Thackeray said the vaccination drive in Maharashtra has been the “fastest and the most efficient in the country”.At present, people have to register their names on CoWIN platform introduced by the central government for the vaccination.“As we plan to open up vaccination for the 18 to 45 age group through the state’s procurement, the CoWIN app is seeing a sudden surge in the number of citizens wanting to register nationally. There is fear about the app malfunctioning and crashing as it did on the first day of registration of the age group,” he said.“We propose either a separate app developed by states, where the data can be shared with the Union government’s ministry of health or a CoWIN app for each state, developed and assigned by the government of India,” he said.This would ensure better interface and experience for citizens who are really keen to take the vaccine shot, the chief minister added.Thackeray wrote that the vaccine supply was also a major challenge.“If possible, the state is willing to procure the requisite stock of vaccines in a single procurement. However, the producers do not have enough stocks. If the states are allowed to procure vaccines from other manufacturers as well, a large population would be covered in a shorter time and help reduce the impact of a possible third wave,” the CM said.He also requested that the ICMR may set the medical framework for the FDAs of each state, within which various vaccines available to the world may be procured to fight COVID-19.

They all came to our hospital in the last three weeks. All the patients who are suffering from mucormycosis had recovered from COVID-19 recently," said Savani.According to Savani, seven such patients have lost their eyesight so far.Meanwhile, considering the growing number of patients with mucormycosis, Surat's civil hospital has set up a separate facility for their treatment, said in-charge Resident Medical Officer (RMO) Dr Ketan Naik.He said a separate facility with the dedicated medical staff has been created which will soon start treating patients with mucormycosis.In Ahmedabad, at least five patients with mucormycosis are being operated upon every day at the civil hospital at Asarva, a senior doctor said."In Ahmedabad, we are receiving 5 to 10 such cases at the civil hospital, especially since the second wave of COVID-19 started. These patients are being examined on priority and operated on as early as possible," said Dr Devang Gupta, ENT doctor at the city civil hospital.He said various resources, including manpower, equipment and injection required for the treatment of mucormycosis patients, have been provided by the government."At least one out of the five such cases is related to eyes. Several of them (patients) are suffering from blindness," he said.Niti Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul on Friday said mucormycosis is being found in patients with COVID-19 disease."It is caused by a fungus named mucor, which is found on wet surfaces. It, to a large extent, is happening to people who have diabetes. It is very uncommon in those who are not diabetic. There is no big outbreak and we are monitoring it," he had said.According to Dr Paul, mucor attacks people with uncontrolled sugar.He had also said when the same COVID-19 patient is put on oxygen support, which has a humidifier containing water, the chances of him or her getting the fungal infection increase.As of May 7, Gujarat's COVID-19 tally stood at 6,58,036 while the overall toll is 8,154. The total count of recoveries stood at 5,03,497. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/black-fungus-claims-eyesight-of-some-covid-19-survivors-in-gujarat-249962

The total number of deaths in the country due to COVID-19 stands at 764.The country on Saturday began rolling out the Chinese Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine after the WHO approved it for emergency use.The island had received 600,000 doses of Sinpoharm last month.As the local health medicine regulators failed to endorse it in the absence of WHO approval for emergency use, only the Chinese nationals employed in the country were administered the vaccine.Early this week, the Russian Sputnik V was first administered in a populous Colombo suburb as cases surged throughout the island.Sri Lanka had to opt for other vaccines due to the delay in AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine from Serum Institute of India. The roll out of AstraZeneca's second dose began last month even with the shortfall of the required number.Sri Lanka has over 121,000 coronavirus infections with over 101,000 recoveries since the onset of the pandemic in March last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-case-of-indian-variant-of-covid-19-detected-in-sri-lanka-249961

And today, we are determined to help India in its hour of need,” Harris said on Friday in her opening remarks at the State Department's Diaspora outreach event on US COVID Relief for India."We do this as friends of India, as members of the Asian Quad, and as part of the global community. I believe that if we continue to work together - across nations and sectors - we will all get through this,” she said.The Biden-Harris Administration has announced USD 100 million assistance to India to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.In about a week's time, as many as six plane loads of COVID-19 assistance have landed in India. The entire administration has been galvanised to help India in this hour of crisis. The White House and the State Department is coordinating with the corporate sector, which has mounted an unprecedented private sector relief for any country ever.Indian-Americans have been raising millions of dollars and have been sending life-saving health care equipment and medicines to India. Sewa International USA has raised more than USD 10 million, American Association of Physicians of Indian-Origin or AAPI have raised USD 3.5 million and Indiaspora more than USD2 million, to name some of them.In her remarks, Harris recognised the contribution of Indian-Americans on the issue. Harris, 56, is the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to be elected US Vice President."For years, diaspora groups like Indiaspora and the American India Foundation have built bridges between the United States and India. And this past year, you have provided vital contributions to COVID-19 relief efforts. Thank you for your work,” said the vice president."As many of you know, generations of my family come from India. My mother was born and raised in India. And I have family members who live in India today. The welfare of India is critically important to the United States,” Harris said."The surge of COVID-19 infections and deaths in India is nothing short of heartbreaking. To those of you who have lost loved ones, I send my deepest condolences. As soon as the dire nature of the situation became apparent, our Administration took action,” she said, referring to the steps that the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to help India in this hour of crisis.On April 26, President Joe Biden spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to offer America's support. By April 30, US military members and civilians were delivering relief on the ground, she said, referring to the whole-of-government approach that the administration has taken to help India."Already, we have delivered refillable oxygen cylinders, with more to come. We have delivered oxygen concentrators, with more to come. We have delivered N95 masks, and have more ready to send. We have delivered doses of Remdesivir to treat COVID patients," Harris said.According to USAID, among the emergency supplies to India include 20,000 courses of remdesivir (125,000 vials) to help treat critically ill patients; nearly 1,500 oxygen cylinders to address critical oxygen shortage, which can be repeatedly refilled at local supply centers and one million rapid diagnostic tests to quickly identify COVID-19 cases and prevent community spread.The six planes, that have landed in just six days, also included nearly 550 mobile oxygen concentrators that obtain oxygen from ambient air. These units have a lifespan of more than five years and can serve multiple patients at once, depending on their oxygen needs. The US has also sent nearly 2.5 million N95 masks to protect health care professionals and other frontline workers.A large-scale deployable Oxygen Concentration System that can provide oxygen to treat 20 or more patients at a time and 210 pulse oximeters to measure oxygen levels in a patient's blood to determine whether a higher level of care is needed has also been sent to India, USAID said.In her remarks, Harris also referred to the decision taken by her administration to support a proposal by India and South Africa for a TRIPS waiver for vaccines at the WTO."We have announced our full support for suspending patents on COVID-19 vaccines - to help India and other nations vaccinate their people more quickly. India and the United States have the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world,” Harris said.Senior Advisor Ervin Massinga at the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said that the US was doing everything we can to help India."We are bringing to bear the strength, innovation, and unique capabilities of the American people to assist those suffering in India. And we recognise that the pandemic will not be over for anyone until it is over for everyone," Massinga said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kamala-harris-vows-more-help-to-fight-covid-19-says-welfare-of-india-critically-important-to-us-249953

A suspect case shall be admitted to the suspect ward of Covid Care centre, Dedicated Covid Health Centre or Dedicated Covid hospital as the case may be.”The new policy says no patient will be refused services on any count.

08-05-2021||Kolkata||COVID crisis result of Centre doing no work in last 6 months: Mamata||Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee   said on Saturday that the COVID crisis in the country was the result of the Centre "not doing any work" in the last six months as Union ministers and leaders were visiting Bengal daily to "capture" it.Banerjee was speaking in the assembly after TMC MLA Biman Bandyopadhyay was elected the Speaker for the third time. Warning of stern action against communal incitements, the chief minister claimed the BJP was provoking violence after failing to win the elections."I can challenge that had the Election Commission not helped them directly, they (BJP) could not have won even 30 seats. In this election, rigging took place in some places under the watch of the poll panel," Banerjee alleged, stressing the need to reform the EC."Now, they (BJP) cannot accept the mandate of the people and are trying to incite violence by posting fake videos," she claimed. She directed the administration to take stern action against those trying to provoke violence and communal tensions. Banerjee said that personnel of the central forces were in the state during the elections without undergoing RT- PCR COVID tests, resulting in the spread of the infection.The Chief Minister claimed that the Centre did not work in the last six months. "To set up a double-engine government in Bengal, they have pushed India to the brink of destruction. Last six months, the central government did no work and they were all here daily to capture Bengal," she said. A host of Union ministers and chief ministers of BJP- ruled states, besides the party's top leadership were canvassing West Bengal in run-up to the just-concluded assembly elections.Banerjee reiterated the demand for universal vaccination, stating that it should have been the priority of the Centre, instead the government is spending Rs 50,000 crore on the new Parliament building, PM's residence and statues, among others. The opposition BJP legislators boycotted the House proceedings. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-crisis-result-of-centre-doing-no-work-in-last-6-months-mamata-249934
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Cradling a baby, comforting patient, monitoring Covid: all in a day’s work for Mumbai doc||The mask digs deep furrows into his face, the shield fogs up his glasses and the PPE suit weighs him down in the humidity. The hours run into one another, uncomfortable and difficult at various levels, but it’s all in a day’s work for Dr Amol Pawar.As the second wave of the pandemic ravages large parts of India, it’s about sweat and tears - quite literally - for millions of healthcare workers at the frontline of the war against COVID-19. They have walked the tightrope between looking after patients and trying to dodge infection for more than a year. And it isn’t ending anytime soon.Pawar, obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital in Mumbai’s Parel locality, is but one face of India’s gravest health crisis yet.Sometimes gently cradling a newborn baby and comforting a patient and other times conferring with colleagues on a particularly difficult case or counselling relatives, the 44-year-old is a familiar figure for regulars at the 450-bed hospital. There are 35 beds in the Covid ward and 15 in the isolation ward.Hundreds of Covid patients have passed through the maternity hospital, which had to include a Covid ward last year in May when cases began rising.“The first case came in mid-April but we transferred the case to the Nair hospital nearby as there were no facilities in our hospital. On May 10, we started a COVID-19 ward.  Since then, we’ve seen around 513 cases in this hospital,” Pawar told PTI.Working at least eight hours a day, six days a week and on-call 24X7, he wears his discomfort and his responsibilities lightly.“The eight hours are really packed at the hospital… new admissions, discharges, rounds and monitoring medicines for patients, and now even the vaccination drive. We have to do all this while ensuring we don’t contract the virus,” he said.In September last year, he did. He was admitted to the Seven Hills hospital in Andheri and was there for three weeks. He was on oxygen support for four days and after that got back to work through calls and guidance to his assistant.Pawar, like many of his colleagues, has now been vaccinated. But doctors don’t have the luxury of work-from-home and have to come to work every day. With reports of mutant strains, the tension of the infection is ever-present, even for those like Pawar who have had the infection and been inoculated.The day begins with rounds, checking up on patients, visiting the vaccination centre and recording the doses used and stocks left. Sometimes, he lectures students over Zoom as well.In what would a year ago be a scene from some imagined reality or a futuristic sci-fi film and is now par for the course, he and his colleague’s don PPE suits, masks and shields for much of the workday.Pawar, like the others, wears the PPE kit over his scrubs for more than three-four hours at a time. “We can’t eat, drink or use the restroom as long as we are wearing it. Add to that the irritation caused by sweat and glasses fogging up,” he said.Watching the coronavirus infection extract its toll on the country, the city and his patients has been emotionally and physically exhausting and challenging. But also rewarding when patients get well and return home.“Even if we still have a long way to go in the battle against COVID-19, the gratitude on the faces of those leaving the hospital keeps us going,” said Pawar.“It’s depressing for us doctors to still see that some people are still not following safety precautions. We don’t want to see a rise in the number of patients anymore,” he said.Before the second wave, Wadia Hospital saw only about four to five COVID-19 cases a day. But the numbers spiked this March.“Suddenly in March, there were as many as 52 cases. In April, we had 78 cases. Therefore, we were forced to cancel the study leaves of our resident medical officers (RMOs), some whom have to study in the restroom because their exams are in June,” he said.In addition to his regular duties, Pawar is also the nodal officer of the Covid Vaccination Centre at Wadia. He is involved with procuring, implementing and monitoring of the vaccination programme for COVID-19.Sometimes, in between his various responsibilities of dealing with deliveries, obstetric complications, Covid complexities and updating his case sheets, Pawar takes a short break. And then, when the workday ends he heads home to Thane, 26 km away.There have been days he has to drive back to the hospital in case of an emergency. Otherwise, it’s an evening spent at home before duty beckons again the next morning.Though Mumbai’s cases have dipped in the last few days, Covid cases continue their relentless rise. On Saturday, India recorded 4,187 fatalities and 4.01 lakh cases.Clearly, for Pawar and other healthcare workers across the country, there is no getting off the Covid treadmill yet.

08-05-2021||Bhopal||Bypoll defeat: MP BJP suspends 6, gives notice to ex-minister||After facing defeat in Damoh Assembly bypoll in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP's state unit has issued a show-cause notice to former minister Jayant Malaiya for indulging in "anti-party activities" and suspended the primary membership of his son and five mandal presidents, a party functionary said on Saturday.The Congress on Sunday retained the Damoh Assembly seat with the party candidate Ajay Tandon defeating his former colleague and nearest BJP rival Rahul Singh Lodhi by a margin of 17,097 votes.Lodhi had later alleged that "massive internal sabotage" by Malaiya (74) and others had led to his defeat.Talking about the action taken against them, state BJP media in-charge Lokendra Parashar said, "As per the directives of MP BJP president V D Sharma, the party's state unit on Friday served a show-cause notice to former minister Jayant Malaiya, seeking clarification for the anti-party activities during Damoh bypoll."The party also suspended the primary membership of its five mandal presidents and convenor of the party's district Prashikshan Prakosht (training cell) Siddharth Malaiya (son of Jayant Malaiya), he said.According to Parashar, the action was taken for their alleged involvement in anti-party activities during the bypoll, for which polling was held on April 17 and the votes were counted on May 2.The bypoll was necessitated after Lodhi left the Congress and joined the BJP late last year.For his bypoll defeat, Lodhi had held Jayant Malaiya and his family responsible.Union minister Prahlad Patel, who represents Damoh Lok Sabha seat, had also blamed "conspiracies" of insiders for the party's defeat in the Damoh bypoll.Jayant Malaiya, who was a BJP MLA for several terms from the area earlier, had stayed away from the bypoll campaign, sources said, adding that there were several local leaders in the party who were upset over Lodhi joining it.In the 2018 assembly polls, Lodhi had defeated Malaiya. At that time, Lodhi was with the Congress.State Home minister Narottam Mishra had also said that the BJP lost the Damoh seat "due to our own Jaichands".It is a common reference for an insider who betrays, the term coming from the role played by Jaichand who back- stabbed Prithviraj Chauhan in the latter's fight against invader Muhammad Ghori in the 12th century.

The number of centres will be increased to 250-300 by the Delhi government, he said in an online briefing.In order to vaccinate all people in Delhi, over three crore doses will be required, out of which around 40 lakh have already been received, he said.The chief minister urged the Centre to provide it 85 lakh doses per month so that all the Delhiites could be vaccinated in the next three months.He said that due to good arrangements in Delhi, people from NCR towns like Noida, Ghaziabad were also reaching here to get the vaccines. So, Delhi will require a little more than three crore doses, he said.He said that Delhi currently has vaccine doses to vaccinate people for next 5-6 days and urged the Centre to provide adequate doses.He said Delhi is currently administering one lakh vaccine doses per day and it could increase this number to three lakh.Citing warnings of a third wave of COVID 19, he said that vaccination is the only safeguard against the deadly virus.

08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Army asks industry to design, develop portable helipads for its operational requirements||The Indian Army is asking the private industry to design and develop a portable helipad that can meet its field requirements across a vast spectrum of operations in diverse geographical and climatic conditions.A portable helipad is a makeshift structure comprising sub-units that can be easily transported, assembled and disassembled to provide a temporary place for helicopters to land and take-off. They are cost-effective and can be used in places that do not require the construction of a permanent helipad or when time is a critical factor. Besides military operations, portable helicopters have immense scope for deployment during disaster relief operations and also for internal security duties.In the Army’s scheme of things, heliborne operations is a critical dimension for success by ensuring surprise, rapid troop deployment, offensive air support, airborne surveillance, tactical flexibility and logistic support. The construction of helipads in an operationally constrained time frame in the desert, semi-desert, mountainous and coastal areas, therefore, becomes an important task for the Army’s combat engineers.The Army wants portable helicopters that can accommodate all types of helicopters in the Indian inventory, including the Chinook and Apache, An initial requirement of 50 portable helipads measuring 25x25 meters has been projected and larger sizes that could range up to 100x100 meters would be considered at a later stage.The parameters also call for at least 50 per cent of the helipad’s components, by value, to be sourced indigenously.The technical requirements laid down by the Army for such helipads include a rugged design with modular components and sub-units that are corrosion resistant, have the high tensile strength to withstand rotor downwash and allow increase or reduction in size by adding or removing panels.A team of 10 personnel should be able to construct one portable helipad after surface preparation within 90 minutes and the entire equipment, including sub-units and assembly tools, should be transportable in one truck.Portable helipads are not new and have been in use in several parts of the world for a long time for the military as well as civilian purposes. These have also been marketed by some Indian firms.For many years, the Army has been improvising helipads in remote areas by using sandbags, perforated metal sheets, plywood sheets, jerry cans and other field equipment used by the engineers for constructing tracks.Several such helipads had come up in the northern as well as north-eastern sectors, including the Siachen, in the late 1980s to facilitate air maintenance of forward posts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-asks-industry-to-design-develop-portable-helipads-for-its-operational-requirements-249927

08-05-2021||New Delhi||Assam BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma meets party chief J P Nadda, Amit Shah in Delhi||Amid speculation over the next chief minister of Assam, senior BJP leader from the state Himanta Biswa Sarma met party president J P Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah here on Saturday.Both Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Health Minister Himanta Sarma were on Friday called to New Delhi by the BJP central leadership, apparently to discuss the leadership issue of the next government.Though both leaders from Assam reached Delhi on Saturday morning it was Sarma who reached Nadda's residence to meet him and BJP general secretary (Organisation) B L Santhosh, sources said.They were later joined by Amit Shah.It is expected that Sonawal would also reach Nadda's residence to meet the BJP's top brass, where a decision on the next chief minister of Assam could be taken.It is immediately not known whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be present in the meeting, they added.Sonowal, who belongs to Assam's indigenous Sonowal-Kachari tribals, and Sarma, the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance, both are contenders for the top post of the Assam government.The BJP had not announced a chief ministerial candidate before the Assembly polls in Assam.In the 2016 Assembly polls, the BJP had projected Sonowal as its chief ministerial candidate and won, forming the first saffron party government in the northeast.This time, the party has been maintaining that it would decide who would be the next chief minister of Assam after the elections.In the results announced for the 126-member Assam assembly last Sunday, the BJP won 60 seats while its alliance partners AGP got nine seats and UPPL six.

08-05-2021||London||Britain labels coronavirus ‘variant of concern’ linked to travel from India||British health officials on Friday labelled a coronavirus variant first found in India a "variant of concern" due to evidence it spreads more easily, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying the situation needed careful handling.Public Health England designated variant B.1.617.2, one of three variants identified in India that has spread to Britain, a variant of concern. Surge testing was being carried out in areas where evidence indicates community spread.Cases of the B.1.617.2 variant increased to 520 from 202 over the last week, PHE said, mainly in London and the northwest town of Bolton, with almost half the cases related to contact with a traveller."I think we've got to be very careful about that," Johnson told reporters, in reference to the variant."We're doing a huge amount, obviously, to make sure that when we do find outbreaks of the Indian variant that we do surge testing, that we do door-to-door testing." PHE cited evidence that it spreads more quickly than the original version of the virus and could spread as quickly as the so-called "Kent" variant, which fuelled England's second wave of infections.The public health body said other characteristics of the B.1.617.2 variant were still being investigated."There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate that any of the variants recently detected in India cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed any less effective," PHE said in a statement.The original India variant, B.1.617, was first detected in October, but PHE has categorised three different subtypes, all with slightly different mutations.Other variants of concern include variants first identified in Kent, southeast England, as well as South Africa and Brazil.Two weeks ago, India, which is experiencing a deadly surge in cases, was added to Britain's travel "red list", meaning travellers have to quarantine in special hotels.But the move, which came in on April 23, was announced on April 19, giving travellers notice if they wanted to change plans and beat the hotel quarantine.Britain has recorded 4,428,553 coronavirus cases and 127,583 deaths since the pandemic hit its shores, making it one of the worst hit countries in the world. About 66% of the adult population has now been vaccinated and lockdown restrictions are being eased.India is reporting record daily death tolls. In total it has recorded 21.49 million cases and 234,083 deaths. Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/britain-labels-coronavirus-variant-of-concern-linked-to-travel-from-india-249916

Goa CM's presser gaffe goes viral||Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Friday ordered a state-level curfew in Goa from May 9 to May 23.However, a video clip of a slip on a live mic by Chief Minister Pramod Sawant after addressing the press conference has now gone viral.In the video clip, Sawant is heard and seen signing off the press conference, but a moment later says "(I) did not say 'total lockdown'," to agreement from his Chief Minister's Office staff, before switching off the mic.The video clip has gone viral, with his political detractors accusing the Chief Minister of not being serious about nipping the Covid spike in the state, which has resulted in 1,557 deaths and 31,718 active cases over the last two months."He spoke for 27 minutes, but showed his true colours in the last 10 seconds," says city lawyer Atish Manderkar on Facebook, reacting to the clip."Dr. Pramod Sawant is playing with people's lives ...people are struggling for oxygen and bed, instead of doing total lockdown... CMO Goa does a curfew.People of Goa will never forget this,You and your party @BJP4Goa will pay for this," the president of the Goa unit of the National Students Union of India Naushad Chowdhuri said."This video makes it clear. Businessman Dr. Pramod Sawant wants to keep gates open for truck transportation of metal quarry from Maharashtra and hence stops short of announcing 'lockdown'. Chief Minister you stand exposed," Goa Congress spokesperson Amarnath Panjikar said.In response to a question on why the word lockdown was absent from his media briefing despite the stringent restrictions which are expected to be put in place during the "state-level curfew", Sawant said that the words curfew and lockdown meant the same.But minutes after the video clip of the gaffe went viral, the Chief Minister's Office issued a statement saying "the 'state-level curfew' shall be more stricter than lockdown".State Bharatiya Janata Party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade also came to the Chief Minister's rescue."I do not know the technicalities of the word curfew. We had the lockdown for four days (from April 29 to May 3). The state curfew will be stronger than that... Don't go by the nomenclature. People can interpret the words (curfew or lockdown) the way they want. Finally, a curfew is stronger than a lockdown," Tanavade said.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-or-curfew-goa-cms-presser-gaffe-goes-viral-249914

BJP still has the old offices in Ashoka Road Govt bungalows which can be used for Party. Noble gesture!!  Swamy tweeted saying that "In view of the situation arising from Coronavirus Pandemic, I suggest that top 6 of the 8 floors[6+ 2 in basement] Party Office building in Delhi be converted into a hospital. BJP still has the old offices in Ashoka Road Govt bungalows which can be used for Party. Noble gesture!!"On Wednesday he suggested that the Prime Minister should make Gadkari in charge of the COVID-19 management of the country. Warning that the third COVID-19 wave could target children more, he urged the government to ‘delegate the conduct of this war to Gadkari.’”India will survive Coronavirus Pandemic as it did Islamic invaders and British Imperialists. We could face one more wave that targets children unless strict precautions now are taken. Modi should therefore delegate the conduct of this war to Gadkari. Relying on PMO is useless,” Swamy tweeted.Notably, both Gadkari and Swamy are believed to be close to the powerful RSS, BJP's ideological fountainhead.Nagpur is the headquarters of Sangh and also the Parliamentary constituency of Gadkari.Though RSS functionaries don't agree officially, sources agree that there is no way the Sangh will not be "upset" and "uncomfortable" over the grim situation in the country"Naturally everyone is worried but now is not the time (to criticise)It will not help anyone, things should come under control first.

08-05-2021||United Nations||Jaishankar boycotts high-level, ministerial Security Council meeting China convened||India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has boycotted a high-level Security Council meeting at the ministerial level that was convened by China, which is the body's President for this month.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla represented India at Friday's high-level meeting on multilateralism that was presided over by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Coming amid tensions between India and China, Jaishankar's absence stood out as the other 14 members of the Security Council sent minister-level officials to the meeting held virtually.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves participated in the meeting.Seven other countries sent their foreign ministers to the meeting that had the formal title of "Maintenance Of International Peace and Security: Upholding Multilateralism and the UN-Centered International System." The remaining three were represented at the sub-cabinet ministerial level by Ministers of State Tariq Ahmad of Britain and Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne of France and Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs Raychelle Omamo, who functions as the de facto Foreign Minister.The country that holds the Council presidency for the month holds what are called signature events Â– high-level meetings usually at the ministerial-level Â– on topics of special interest to it.China is planning two more signature meetings, on Africa and Covid-19 recovery, and on improving the safety of peacekeepers.Because of the Covid-19 pandemic many meetings of the Council are held virtually facilitating the greater participation of ministers who don't have to make the trip to New York. That makes absences noticeable.Since India joined the Security Council as a non-permanent member in January, Jaishankar has participated in the ministerial-level Security Council meetings convened by the presidents for the month, Vietnam in April, Britain in February and Tunisia in January.Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar also spoke at the high-level meeting on climate change called by Britain in February and presided over by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.When the US was in the chair in March, its signature meeting, Conflict and Food Security, was presided over by Permanent Representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who has cabinet status, rather than Blinken.Some countries including China, France and Russia did not send ministerial-level representatives and only their permanent representatives participated.That was the case with India: Permanent Representative T.S. Tirumurti participated in the meeting.India will get a chance to hold its own signature events when it presides over the Council in August.Shringla in his speech on Friday at the Council asserted that global vulnerabilities and fault lines have been exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic."It is the lack of a coordinated global response that has exposed the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the multilateral system as it stands today, providing a timely reminder for the pressing need for comprehensive reform," he said."While the pandemic exposed the fault lines from unreliable global supply chains to inequitable vaccine distribution, it has also underlined the need for global solidarity and strengthened multilateralism," he added.He pointed out that India provided Covid-19 vaccines, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to more than 150 countries and said, "In that same spirit of friendship and solidarity, we extend deep appreciation to those that have come forward to provide us with some priority requirements to battle the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic that we are currently facing." Shringla also reiterated the demand for Council reforms, saying, "Today, the UN has 193 Member States, nearly a fourfold increase from 1945. The narrow representation and privileges of a few in the primary decision-making organ of the UN poses a serious challenge to its credibility and effectiveness. How can we explain the contradiction of Africa not being represented in the Security Council in the permanent category, even though African issues dominate its agenda?" In an indirect dig at China, he said India's aid "fostered global socio-economic development through transparent, viable, sustainable and demand-driven partnership programmes." China's aid programmes have been criticised for lack of transparency and driving the recipients to unrepayable debts that lead to loss of assets.

08-05-2021||New Delhi||Government allows cash payment of over Rs 2 lakh for COVID-19 treatment at hospitals||The Income Tax Department has issued a notification allowing hospitals and nursing homes to accept cash payments of Rs 2 lakh and more for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which frames policy for the department, issued the notification on Friday. It said hospitals, dispensaries, nursing homes, COVID care centres or similar other medical facilities providing COVID-19 treatment to patients are being "specified for the purpose of section 269ST of the Income Tax Act".This section restricts any person from receiving an amount of Rs 2 lakh or more in cash, from a person in a day, in respect of a single transaction or in respect of transactions relating to one event or occasion from a person. It was introduced by the Union government in 2017 as a measure to curb black money.The notification said the latest provision is being made for a period between April 1-May 31 "on obtaining the PAN or Aadhaar of the patient and the payee and the relationship between the patient and the payee" by such hospitals or COVID care centres.Officials said the move was aimed to remove the hardship being faced by relatives and caregivers of COVID-19 patients who visit hospitals for treatment. The country is grappling with the onslaught of a massive COVID-19 wave with a record 4,187 deaths and 4,01,078 new infections being reported in a span of 24 hours, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Saturday.

If you go through my tweets, I had suggested that we go in for a stringent lockdown about more than 15 days back. Fifteen days back was also too late because we needed this lockdown for more than a month back," Rane said in the interview."Sometimes, administratively, economically you need to take decisions which have a balance. And many times we as administrators holding positions sometimes make some errors in judgement and this is one of those cases, where we have made some errors in judgement and the cases have spread..." Rane also said.Rane has been part of a running feud with Sawant over Covid management issues and the differences between the two has spilled out in the open several times over the last few months.Rane also said that the decision of the state administration to allow full fledged tourism activity, in absence of restrictions, had led to the surge in Covid cases."Opening up of tourism without any restrictions in December has led to the situation in the state of Goa..." Rane said."Thousands of people (were) coming in. (There were) less restrictions at that point of time. We had the whole of India coming into the state of Goa in the months of December, January, February and I had already alerted out health authorities that we need to be prepared, because we are already going to face (a) situation at some point of time," Rane also said.Goa currently has a positivity rate of more than 51 per cent, the highest in the country.On Friday alone, out of the 8,170 persons tested, 4,195 persons tested positive for Covid-19.The state currently has 31,716 active cases, while 1,557 persons have died due to Covid-19 related complications.

Yet the celebrated music composer Vanrjaj Bhatia, who gave us this lilting composition and many more falls silent, nothing can ever silence his distinctive music. Echoes of his individualistic and experimental style will forever reverberate through corridors of time. If a lesser musician had said, ‘my music is unique’, it would have been an empty boast. But not him who studied and mastered western classical music and blended it with Indian to create music that is as soulful as searing, as penetrating as melodious; unconventional and rooted in knowledge.Rare is a composer whose musical scores have touched not just films, television shows but documentaries, theatre, jingles and even advertisements.

The differential pricing mechanism for vaccines should be set aside and vaccines price should be capped at a uniform price of Rs 150 per dose, it said in an application, highlighting that to reach herd immunity, at least 70 per cent of the adult population would have to be vaccinated which would require approximately 1.4 billion doses. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-govt-moves-sc-for-uniform-vax-policy-249744

Set up in 2003, the ECHS was to provide quality medical care to veterans and their families because of the limited capacity of the military hospitals. During the Covid surge, most veterans were denied admissions under the ECHS and empanelled hospitals, which had increased their dependence on the already-stressed military hospitals, said the MoD. — TNSWarships to bring 250 MT oxygen in 4 days||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mod-questions-efficacy-of-echs-for-retired-personnel-249746

Don’t wait for your test results and isolate yourself,” VK Paul, Member, Health, NITI Aayog, and government’s key adviser on Covid clinical management said as testing capacities came under strain in the wake of rapid surge in daily cases.The government, in a detailed advisory, asked home-isolated people experiencing Covid-like symptoms to start on hydration, lie in a prone position to improve oxygen levels, take paracetamol for fever, any cough syrup for cough and multivitamins. Home-isolated people have also been advised to wear surgical N95 masks. Paul said people must seek immediate medical help if they felt breathless, dizzy or if their oxygen saturation fell below 94. “These are danger signs,” he said.In the section “what not to do during home isolation”, the advisory asked people not to use remdesivir, nebulisers for administering medicines (can lead to viral transmission) or oxygen at home without medical review.“If cough persists for five days, you can use budesonide inhaler on doctor’s advice and similarly you can use medicines ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine if the doctor advises,” said Paul.After some hospitals flagged it, Paul said mucormycosis, a kind of dangerous fungal infection, was being seen in some diabetic patients down or recovered from Covid.“We have not seen a major outbreak, but we have seen it in diabetics who are already on immunosuppressant drugs. When such people get Covid and need to take more immune-suppressant medication to fight the infection, chances of the fungus rise.“So if diabetics with Covid have ulcers, they must report immediately. The use of steroids and tocilizumab in such patients must be very rational because these drugs further suppress immunity,” said Paul, adding treatments for mucormycosis were available.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quarantine-if-symptoms-appear-advises-govt-amid-report-delays-249706

The inequitable policy will exclude millions of poor. — Sonia Gandhi, Congress PresidentAddressing party MPs virtually, Sonia said the Congress believed in Covid response being not a “government versus us” battle but an “us versus virus” battle.“This battle transcends political differences. In that spirit as a first step, I believe that the Modi government must urgently call an all-party meeting on Covid. The Congress also demands that standing committees must be convened to ensure collective action and accountability to combat the pandemic better,” she said.Sonia said, “The government has allowed differential pricing for vaccines. The inequitable policy will exclude millions of poor and marginalised.”She questioned crores being spent on non-essential projects (read Central Vista) and attacked BJP governments for “arresting people merely for crying out for help”. Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote to the PM, saying the Centre’s “failures” had made another devastating national lockdown almost inevitable.“To prevent a repeat of the immense sufferings caused by last year’s lockdown, the government must act with compassion and provide critical financial and food support to the most vulnerable people,” he said, demanding a transportation strategy for those who will require it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-for-all-party-meet-says-govt-failed-people-249726

Each of the three oxygen generation units – the size of 40 foot freight containers – produces 500 litres of oxygen per minute, enough for 50 people to use at a time.“The UK is sending surplus oxygen generators from Northern Ireland to India. This life-saving equipment will support the country's hospitals as they care for vulnerable COVID patients,” said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.Good to see the 🇬🇧 sending three shipping container-sized oxygen generators from Belfast to India.

The assistance package has been sourced by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the offer by Northern Ireland's health service is in addition to 1,000 ventilators offered by the DHSC.“The situation in India is heart-breaking and we stand side by side with our friends as they face this immense challenge,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The world’s largest cargo plane will leave Belfast this morning with three 18-tonne oxygen generators and 1,000 ventilators as part of the UK’s latest response to India’s #COVID19 crisis. ➡️https://t.co/XhwUpHIpUM@DHSCgovuk | @FCDOGovUK pic.twitter.com/CsDQ37IG0r  “As we battle this global pandemic together, the vital equipment we are providing, including ventilators and oxygen generators, will help save lives and support India's healthcare system.

08-05-2021||New Delhi||Third wave of coronavirus may not happen if strong measures are taken: PSA||There may not be a third wave of coronavirus in the country if strong measures are taken and effectively implemented at the state, district and city-level, the country’s top scientific officer said on Friday, two days after he warned that this wave was inevitable.K VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser, said the “insidious asymptomatic transmission” can be stopped if the guidance about precautions, surveillance, containment, treatment and testing is followed.“If we take strong measures, the third wave may not happen in all places or indeed anywhere at all. It depends on much how effectively guidance is implemented at the local level in the states, districts and cities everywhere.“The guidance about precautions, about surveillance, about containment, about treatment and about tests. This insidious asymptomatic transmission can be stopped if we follow the guidelines. This sounds difficult, it is difficult and we can and must do it,” he said in a press briefing. On May 5, VijayRaghavan said as the virus mutates further, a third wave of COVID infection is inevitable and it is necessary to be prepared for new waves.He said it was not expected that the second wave would hit the country with such ferocity.“Phase three is inevitable given the higher levels of circulating virus, but it is not clear on what time-scale this phase three will occur,” he had said.Responding to a question on when the second wave which has already infected lakhs and killed thousands, will ebb, VijayRaghavan said it has already started declining in some places.The number of cases and the positivity will decline and there will be a lag in hospitalisation and mortality, he added.“There are other places of great concern all over the country. We must watch out and make sure that we take all steps to reduce and go up to the levels which are difficult to manage,” he cautioned.In the briefing, Additional Secretary in the Health Ministry Arti Ahuja said the COVID-19 case positivity is more than 15 per cent in more than 24 states and Union territories including Goa, West Bengal, Karnataka, Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, while it is between 5 to 15 per cent in nine states. The case positivity is less than five per cent in three states.In Goa, case positivity is 48.5 per cent, Haryana (36.1), West Bengal (33.1), Karnataka, Delhi and Rajasthan (29.9 pc each), Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh (27.9 per cent) and Maharashtra 23.5 per cent.Twelve states—Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Haryana and Bihar—have over one lakh active COVID-19 cases each at present, while the count is between 50,000 and one lakh in seven.Ahuja said Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand are among states and union territories showing continued platelayer or decrease in daily new COVID-19 cases.However, Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Bihar, Punjab, Assam and Odisha are among those showing an upward trend in daily new cases of the infection remains a cause of concern, she added.Bengaluru Urban and Mysuru; Chennai; Kozhikode, Kottayam, Alappuzha Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala; Gurgaon; Patna; North 24 Parganas and Kolkata; Chittoor, Guntur and Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh are some of the districts showing continued increase in cases since last two weeks, Ahuja said.“There have been peaks and falls in different places in India and all over the world at different times and it is useful to understand how and why the rises of infections take place, why the strength varies and how they fall and what can happen subsequently,” VijayRaghavan said.Infections rise when the virus has the opportunity to infect humans. When the virus runs out of opportunities, the infection falls, he explained.As the vaccination rolls out and the coverage is maximal, each and every measure that is taken can prevent or reduce rises and fall in current locations.The Health Ministry has urged states and Union territories to prioritise beneficiaries awaiting their second dose of COVID-19 vaccine and utilise supplies of vaccines through ‘Government of India channel’ in 70:30 ratio for second dose and first dose respectively.The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has reached 16.50 crore, it added.

08-05-2021||United Nations||India extends ‘deep appreciation’ to nations providing priority requirements to battle COVID-19||India, which provided COVID-19 vaccines and medical equipment to more than 150 countries last year, extends “deep appreciation” in that same spirit of friendship and solidarity to those providing priority requirements to help the country battle the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Friday.Addressing the UN Security Council high-level meeting on ‘Maintenance of international peace and security: upholding multilateralism and the United Nations-centred international system’, held under the Council Presidency of permanent and veto-wielding member China, Shringla said the COVID-19 pandemic has “sharpened our awareness” of the depth of global interdependence, and on the fact that “the world is only as resilient as the least resilient country”.“The events of the past year have clearly demonstrated how imperative it is for all countries to coordinate responses to the various challenges that the pandemic has brought to the fore,” he said.“Over the past year alone, we have provided COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to more than 150 countries across the world. In that same spirit of friendship and solidarity, we extend deep appreciation to those that have come forward to provide us with some priority requirements to battle the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that we are currently facing,” Shringla said.India provided COVID-19 vaccines to nations across the world—from India’s immediate neighbours to countries in Latin America and Africa—and is a significant source of supply to the COVAX facility.According to the Ministry of External Affairs data as of May 7, a total of 66.37 million Made-in-India COVID-19 vaccine supplies have been sent through grants, commercial arrangements and COVAX initiative to 95 nations around the world.India has also worked with South Africa and other partners in the World Trade Organisation to seek a relaxation in the norms of the TRIPS agreement to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries during the COVID pandemic.“This waiver will be an important step for enabling the rapid scaling up of manufacture and timely availability of affordable COVID-19 vaccines and essential medical products on a global basis,” Shringla said.In a highly-significant development this week, the Biden administration backed an initiative by India and South Africa at the WTO to temporarily waive patent rules on COVID-19 vaccines, seen as a breakthrough in the global fight against the deadly pandemic by potentially expanding the supply of the vaccines and more affordable doses for less wealthy nations. Announcing the major policy decision after intense internal debate and strong pushback from American drug makers, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Wednesday said this is a global health crisis and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures.“The (Biden) administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines,” Tai had said.

The code will also be present in the confirmation SMS sent to the beneficiary after successful booking of an appointment.The appointment acknowledgement slip can also be saved and shown from the mobile.This will ensure that for those citizens who have booked an online appointment, the data entries regarding vaccination status of a citizen are recorded correctly, the ministry said in a statement.This will also reduce the opportunities of impersonation and wrongful use of flexibilities provided in CoWIN for facilitating vaccination coverage.The ministry advised the citizens must carry a digital or physical copy of their appointment slip and the registered mobile phone with appointment confirmation SMS, so that the security code can be furnished for easy completion of vaccination recording process.Citizens must provide the security code to the vaccinator as the digital certificate will be generated only after the vaccination record has been updated with the security code. Citizen should get a confirmation SMS after the process has been successfully completed.The confirmation SMS indicates that the vaccination process has been completed successfully and the digital certificate has been generated. If one does not get the confirmation SMS, one should get in touch with the vaccinator or the vaccination centre in-charge, the ministry said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-digit-security-code-in-cowin-from-may-8-to-minimise-data-entry-error-about-vaccination-status-249532

The state has imposed a dawn to dusk curfew-like restrictions, but said there would be no complete lockdown. At present, Telangana has 9,500 beds with oxygen that would be increased by another 5,000 beds within a week.The chief minister has asked Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar to import 12 cryogenic tankers each costing Rs 1 crore from China and instructed him to complete the process immediately. He said as many as 5,980 Covid outpatient centres were established at primary health centres and community and health hospitals in the state and asked people to utilise services at these centres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-to-import-cryogenic-tankers-from-china-249528
08-05-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp scraps May 15 deadline for accepting privacy policy terms||WhatsApp has scrapped its May 15 deadline for users to accept its controversial privacy policy update and said not accepting the terms will not lead to deletion of accounts.WhatsApp had faced severe backlash over user concerns that data was being shared with parent company Facebook.A WhatsApp spokesperson told PTI that no accounts will be deleted on May 15 for not accepting the policy update."No accounts will be deleted on May 15 because of this update and no one in India will lose functionality of WhatsApp either. We will follow up with reminders to people over the next several weeks," the spokesperson said in an emailed response to a query on Friday.The spokesperson added that while a "majority of users who have received the new terms of service have accepted them", some people have not had the chance to do so yet.However, the company did not clarify the reason behind the decision and did not divulge the number of users who have accepted the terms so far.In January this year, WhatsApp had informed users about the changes in its terms of service and public policy through an in-app notification. Users were initially given time till February 8 to agree to the new terms in order to continue using the platform. According to WhatsApp, the key updates include more information about its service and how it processes user data; how businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats; and how WhatsApp partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the company products. WhatsApp has insisted that the acceptance of the privacy policy update does not expand its ability to share user data with Facebook. However, user backlash over WhatsApp's alleged sharing of user information with Facebook forced the company to postpone the February deadline to May 15. The WhatsApp spokesperson said the company has spent the last few months working to "clear up confusion and misinformation".  "As a reminder, this update does not impact the privacy of personal messages for anyone. Our goal is to provide information about new options we are building that people will have, to message a business on WhatsApp, in the future," the spokesperson said. The company further stated that it will take every opportunity to explain how it protects people's personal messages and private information.  The softening of stance on the deadline comes at a time when digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp have become lifelines for people looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors and ventilators as the country reels under the deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. India is the biggest market for WhatsApp, and the platform—as per government data—has 53 crore users in the country.  India remains a critical market for Internet companies like Facebook with its large population base and burgeoning Internet adoption. The country is the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data.  Following the backlash faced by WhatsApp earlier this year, the popularity of rivals like Telegram and Signal surged as users thronged these platforms.  WhatsApp, in the past, has said it is open to answering any questions from the government on the privacy issue and that it will continue to explain to users that their messages are end-to-end encrypted. It had also sought to assuage user concerns through blog posts and tweets by its Global Head Will Cathcart and even full-page ads in leading dailies in India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whatsapp-scraps-may-15-deadline-for-accepting-privacy-policy-terms-249517

08-05-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination only way forward as COVID infections surge in rural areas: Report||As COVID-19 infections surge across the country with nearly half of the fresh cases now being in rural areas, accelerated vaccination is the only solution to contain the raging pandemic, according to a report by SBI Research.So far, with a record 4,14,188 new infections reported in a day, total cases climbed to 2.15 crore while death toll crossed 2.34 lakh with 3,915 new fatalities in the past 24 hours.The second wave of the pandemic has led the country begging for global aid in terms of money, medical oxygen and life-saving drugs as it has been contributing almost 44 per cent of the global caseload for the past many days.The report noted that the share of the top 15 districts in total new cases has significantly plunged to 26.3 per cent in May from 55 per cent in March, indicating that the spread of infections is now dispersed across the country.What is more worrying is the increase in rural penetration as the share of rural districts in new cases has increased to 48.5 per cent in May from 36.8 per cent in March,  Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at SBI, said in a note on Friday.“Vaccination can be the only driver as of now to contain the pandemic…because recovery will actually depend on the public psyche to come out and this will not happen till the larger population is vaccinated. We thus again reemphasize the power of vaccination as a primary tool to reduce the severity of infections,” he said.He went to the extent of saying that vaccination must be carried out on a mission mode, even if it means suspending economic activity for a while after the second wave subsides so that all get vaccinated.When looked district-wise, there is a clear shift visible. In March, Maharashtra had maximum 11 of 15 worst-affected rural districts. Now, the state has six. Other states that round up the 15 worst -affected districts are Andhra (5 ), Kerala (2), Karnataka (one), Rajasthan (one).The only state that has shown improvement is Chhattisgarh which had three rural districts in top 15 during March and has no district now in the top 15 worst-affected rural districts.However, Ghosh quickly pointed out there is nothing salutary on the vaccination front so far,  as “we have given only 160.5 million doses with around 131 million taken the first dose and 31.5 million the two doses.“The percentage of people who have taken two doses to total vaccination doses is a low 19.5 per cent. However, the daily vaccination is going down now with an average of 17 lakh compared to an average of 28 lakh in April."Given this trend, we believe we can only be able to vaccinate 15 per cent of the population by October which is required for herd immunity but only if we are able to vaccinate around 55 lakh daily in September and October," Ghosh said.On the economic impact of the second wave, given that as many as 20 states are in various levels of lockdowns/restrictions he said, the economic disruption is now clearly visible.The number of rating downgrades is 3.7 times higher than upgrades in April. Also, SBI's  business activity index which has been declining steeply since April, has dipped to a new low of 71.7, the level attained in mid-Aug 2020 with all indicators deep in the red, except for weekly food arrival and power intake What is more worrying is the decline in labour participation as it indicates that the disruption has percolated to the labour market, too.Given these conditions, real GDP growth of 10.4 per cent looks a bit ambitious, he said without proffering a new forecast.

08-05-2021||New Delhi||Supply 700 MT oxygen daily to Delhi till further orders: SC tells Centre||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre to supply 700 MT medical oxygen per day to Delhi for allocation to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients till further orders.“We want 700 MT to be supplied to Delhi and we mean business. it has to be supplied… Please don’t drive us to a situation where we have to pass coercive action against the government,” a Bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice MR Shah told the Centre.On behalf of the Delhi government, senior counsel Rahul Mehra mentioned the oxygen supply issue before the Bench and said the national capital had received 86 MT oxygen on Friday till 9 am and 16 MT of oxygen was in transit.The Bench had on May 5 stayed a Delhi High Court order issuing notice for contempt of court to two Central government officers for their failure to supply 700 MT oxygen to the national capital.Maintaining that it will not leave people of Karnataka in lurch, the top court refused to interfere with the state high court’s order to the Centre to increase the daily oxygen allocation for the state from 965 MT to 1200 MT for treating COVID-19 patients.“It’s a well calibrated, deliberated and judicious exercise of power after taking into account the number of COVID-19 positive cases. We will not interfere with it,” the Bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.It turned down the Centre’s contention that if every high court started passing orders, it would make the oxygen supply network “unworkable”.The Bench clarified that the HC order does not preclude the Centre from considering the representation of the state government and work out a mutual resolution mechanism of supplying 1200 MT of liquid medical oxygen (LMO).Mehta said every state needs oxygen but his concern is that if all high courts start directing oxygen allocation of the said amount, then it will be a big problem.Noting that it was looking at the wider issue, it said “We will not keep citizens of Karnataka in lurch”.“The high court has furnished adequate reasons for passing the ad-interim order having regard to the fact that the projection of demand made by the state was a minimum of 1165 MT of LMO. The direction of the high court is only ad-interim and it does not preclude a mutual resolution mechanism between the Centre and the state,” it said.The high court had said the required quantity of medical oxygen was not allotted to the state and directed the Centre to increase the allocation to 1200 MT of oxygen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supply-700-mt-oxygen-daily-to-delhi-till-further-orders-sc-tells-centre-249465
08-05-2021||New Delhi||Central vista is criminal wastage: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday attacked the Union government over the central vista project, terming it a "criminal wastage" and asked the dispensation to focus on people's lives.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista -- the power corridor of the country -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.Central Vista is criminal wastage. Put people’s lives at the centre- not your blind arrogance to get a new house!The CPWD, which is executing the project, had revised its estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore."Central Vista is criminal wastage.

08-05-2021||Aditi Tandon||Second Covid  wave expected to peak in maximum 15 days||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 6India’s top mathematical expert in charge of Covid trend predictions says the current second wave could peak maximum within 15 days and even by the end of the current week. Prof M Vidyasagar of IIT-Hyderabad, who leads Covid-19 India National Supermodel Committee, today said the cumulative cases could peak by May 7 and at most within 15 days.“We expect a decline in cases by May 7. Different states will peak at different times because some states are witnessing larger surges. But if you take the cumulative cases, these appear close to the peak now and a decline should start soon,” Prof Vidyasagar explained. The chief of the national modelling panel acknowledged that they completely missed the peak of the second wave.The committee had projected the second Covid spell to peak at 1.2 lakh cases whereas daily cases today soared to 4.12 lakh. This implies that the experts underestimated the second wave peak by 3.43 times, as acknowledged by PM’s Principal Scientific Adviser K Vijay Raghavan yesterday. The national super modelling committee had on October 18 last year (when daily cases began declining after mid-September peak of 97,000 cases) said India could curb the pandemic by early 2021, if everyone followed the safety protocol.The committee, however, correctly predicted the cumulative case burden in the first wave at 106 lakh cases. The actual national caseload was 1,10,96,731 on February 28, 2021, after which third wave commenced from Maharashtra and daily cases began to rise. Leading vaccinologist Gagandeep Kang told The Tribune that India may see one or two more peaks but these will not be as bad as the current one. “That is because very little fuel (human hosts) would be left by then for the virus to go through. If we ramp up vaccinations fast, we will be in a very good place,” Kang said.In view of the vaccine shortages, Kang said the Centre should delay doses for those who have already been infected with Covid-19 because 80 per cent of the infected are known to get protection for seven months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/second-covid-wave-expected-to-peak-in-maximum-15-days-249236
