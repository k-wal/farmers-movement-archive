I hereby make it clear that no officer of any authority shall humiliate any of the advocates on production of the Bar identity card or other proof, failing which strict action shall be taken against the erring officer as per law,” a single-judge Bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said on Tuesday.The HC said strict action would be taken against authorities which restrict movement of advocates during the ongoing curfew for want of e-pass.The order came on a petition filed by advocate Dharmender Singh who alleged harassment by Delhi Police officers on account of failing to show an e-pass for travel during the curfew.According to the Delhi government order issued earlier this month, advocates/legal counsels are exempted from restriction on movement if they show a valid ID proof, Singh had contended demanding appropriate legal and departmental actions be taken against the erring officers for violating the order.The court was told that Delhi Disaster Management Authority had issued an instruction that movement of advocates was allowed during the curfew on production of valid ID card and, therefore, no advocate will be stopped by any police official and or any state government officer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-stop-advocates-during-lockdown-if-they-produce-bar-i-card-delhi-hc-258823

The charges levelled by him were not found to be true in the probe,” Sajwan said.The SSP said an FIR was registered against Ranjit, a resident of Jogi Navada, on May 24 for misbehaving with a police constable who had asked him not to wander without a mask in public.The FIR was registered under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intention to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 188 (disobedience to order duty promulgated by public servant) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life).“The accused was absconding after the incident and police were searching for him,” the SSP said.The police went to Ranjit’s house on Tuesday night, but he was not there, Sajwan said.In 2019, Ranjit was arrested by the police for entering a temple in an inebriated state and damaging the idols there.

26-05-2021||New Delhi||Subodh Kumar Jaiswal takes charge as Director CBI||Senior IPS officer of Maharashtra cadre Subodh Kumar Jaiswal on Wednesday took charge of the office of the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The government had issued an order of his appointment as the CBI Director yesterday. He will remain in the office for the next two years, as the post has a fixed-term of the same period. Jaiswal, who is 1985-batch IPS officer, has previously served as DGP Maharashtra, as he also served in Research & Analysis Wing (RAW), the country’s external intelligence agency, for a period of eight years.Before being appointed as Director CBI, he was the Director General (DG) of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).A few months back he had requested the Maharashtra government, his home cadre, to relieve him so that he may go on a central deputation, as he was believed to be not happy with the functioning of the state Home Ministry, particularly in the matter of transfers and postings.Earlier, he began his career as additional superintendent of Amravati and later went on to serve in Osmanabad, Gadchiroli, Amravati and Aurangabad districts. He had also served as additional commissioner of Mumbai Police.Jaiswal was head of the special investigation team (SIT), appointed by the Bombay High Court, to probe the stamp paper scam perpetrated by Abdul Karim Telgi. Telgi, who was nabbed in 2001, orchestrated a scam valued at around Rs 3,000 crore using fake stamp papers. He was convicted in 2007. Telgi died in 2017.Jaiswal also headed the probe by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) into the serial train blasts in Mumbai’s suburban network that killed over 180 people and left 800 injured.Twelve Islamic militants affiliated to SIMI were arrested and convicted in 2015 for the attacks, with five receiving death sentences. He also led the probe into the Malegaon blast case in 2006.Jaiswal returned to Maharashtra in July 2018 to take over as Mumbai Police commissioner. At that time, then Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was reported to have placed before Prime Minister Narendra Modi the matter of Jaiswal being repatriated to his cadre state.In February 2019, Jaiswal was appointed DGP of Maharashtra. It was under his supervision that the Maharashtra Police investigated the Bhima-Koregaon violence case, which was subsequently transferred to the CBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/subodh-kumar-jaiswal-takes-charge-as-director-cbi-258808

26-05-2021||New Delhi||BJP reiterates government ‘always ready’ for talks with farmers on three laws||The BJP on Wednesday reiterated that the Narendra Modi government is “always ready” for talks with farmers on the three farm laws.Party leaders also said that farmers should “not be misled by political parties or union leaders having political aspirations and that the “agitation will be over after assembly elections in Punjab”.Claiming that several of the “so-called farmer union leaders are big ‘arthiyas’ themselves”, BJP leader RP Singh said, “Farmers should not be misled by politicians or those with personal interests or gains and think about their own interests.”Singh said the success of the Direct Benefit Transfer of the MSP in the ongoing Rabi marketing season in Punjab and Haryana is “proof of the Centre’s intent and commitment towards farmers. Most of the so-called union leaders are big ‘arthiyas’ themselves, who are not liking the concept of direct transfer of MSP into farmers’ accounts”.“The government is always open for a dialogue with farmers, let the corona pandemic settle. Unions too should give in writing the amendments they want in the laws. The three farm laws will remain, let there be no ambiguity on that, they can suggest amendments, which they should give in written first,” he also said.Meanwhile, claiming that SKM’s “Black Day” has “failed to create impact beyond Punjab, Haryana and some parts of western Uttar Pradesh”, government and party sources say the agitation is continuing because the “Centre does not want to turn it into a ‘Sikhs versus the government issue”.“The government is treading carefully. It will not do anything that will disturb the balance. These are such difficult times, a pandemic is on in the country, around 21,000 deaths have taken place in Punjab and Haryana. Union leaders may claim that the agitation is not a reason for the spread of Covid-19 but reports, including of Punjab government, says it is,” said a BJP leader who did not wish to be named.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-reiterates-government-always-ready-for-talks-with-farmers-on-three-laws-258793

26-05-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand High Court slams state government over living conditions of Van Gujjars||The Uttarakhand High Court has reprimanded the state government for stopping some Van Gujjar families on the way to Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Uttarkashi district and said their right to life is being violated by the authorities.Hearing a PIL filed by an NGO to seek the court’s intervention in addressing the plight of the forest-dwelling nomadic families on Tuesday, a division bench of the Uttarakhand High Court comprising Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma ordered immediate steps to address the problems of the families.“Prima facie, the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India is being violated by the respondents,” the court observed.It directed steps should be taken to allow their entry into the park to eke out a living if they test negative for COVID-19 and have the required legal documents with them.On Advocate General SN Babulkar’s contention that the entry of these families may endanger the wildlife at the park as the coronavirus may spread from human beings to animals, the court said they should immediately be tested for COVID-19.“In case they are found to be negative and if they are valid permit holders arrangements shall be made to permit them to enter the park for the duration allowed by law,” it said.Referring to the photographs submitted by the petitioner along with the supplementary affidavit, the high court said they “clearly reveal that the families are forced to live in open tents, in open field, under the open sky. The photographs also show small children and new born babies being wrapped in blankets and sleeping on the ground. The photographs also reveal that some cattle are tied next to the tent and some cattle have died”.“It seems the callous attitude of the Deputy Director of the Park and the Civil Administration has forced these families to survive in conditions which are below animal conditions,” the court added.It directed the Uttarkashi district magistrate and the deputy director of the park to accommodate the families in “pucca houses” and provide them with food, water and medicines besides fodder to their cattle.Van Gujjars are the forest-dwelling nomadic community inhabiting the foothills of Himalayan states like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. They usually migrate to grasslands in the upper Himalayas during summers to feed their cattle, their primary source of livelihood and subsistence. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-high-court-slams-state-government-over-living-conditions-of-van-gujjars-258778

We are not doubting his intentions. He has been a national player of our country. Our question is whether it is a responsible behaviour when you know the medicine is in short supply," the court observed."We are not doubting his intentions but the way he has gone about it, he has actually done a disservice, unintentionally may be. This was not the way that you buy from the market so many strips, certainly not," the court said.Gambhir said he will do everything needed to save the lives of people and stressed that humanity is the greatest 'dharma' for him.The  PIL filed by one Deepak Singh, sought lodging of FIR on the allegations that politicians were able to procure in huge quantity and distribute COVID-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them.

26-05-2021||Dharamsala||Come together in fight against Covid: Dalai Lama||People must come together to overcome global threats, including Covid-19, Tibetan religious leader Dalai Lama has said.In his message for Buddhists on Buddha Purnima, the Nobel Peace Laureate said that by developing a sense of respect for others and a concern for their welfare, one could reduce their self-centredness, which is the source of many problems.“I started my Buddhist education as a child and although I am now nearly 86 years old, I am still learning. Even though our world has changed substantially since the time of Buddha, the essence of his teaching remains as relevant today as it was 2,600 years ago,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.“…Let us all join together in doing whatever we can to overcome the global threats we face, including the Covid pandemic that has brought such pain and hardship across the world,” he added.He said Buddha's teaching was essentially practical not just for one group of people or one country but for all sentient beings.  “People can follow this path according to their ability and inclination,” the spiritual leader said. He further encouraged Buddhists everywhere to discover what the teaching really means to be able to apply it in their life.“This entails listening and reading, thinking about what you have heard and read and making yourself deeply familiar with it." He stressed that Buddha's advice was to avoid harming others and to help them always in whatever way possible.“We can begin to do this by recognising that everyone else is just like us in that...they want happiness and dislike suffering. Seeking joy and freedom from suffering is the birth-right of all beings. But personal happiness very much depends on how we relate to others,” the Dalai Lama said.

The HC challenged the order on the ground that the direction will “create a situation of lawlessness” and that it ignored the settled principle of law that Chief Justice is the “Master of Roster” of the HC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fear-of-death-from-covid-no-ground-for-pre-arrest-bail-sc-258584

For most part of the last week, the government’s digital vaccine platform CoWIN did not enable booking of appointments at leading government hospitals in New Delhi with several users exceeding the dose interval of 28 days.Edit: Walk in for the jabMany CoWIN users also say that even after they managed to book their second dose appointment at a hospital other than the one where they took the first shot, their appointments continue to be randomly delayed.To open walk-in registration for adults at a time when the pending second dose of several citizens remains delayed has caused confusion with vaccination schedules and systems continuing to falter amid vaccine shortage.The government allowed onsite registration to “prevent vaccine wastage”.Several experts have questioned the hasty opening of the vaccine drive for all adults from May 1, with vaccinologist Gagandeep Kang noting, “I think we rushed into opening the vaccination for adults. Even the UK, which has covered more vulnerable people than we have, is to open vaccination for adults from June.

We are on constant touch with the states,” an official source said at a time of illegal adoption messages flooding social media platforms in recent days.The government also said there was no shortage of funds for children and Rs 10 lakh per district was the budget available."We are in touch with states and districts about the children. Funds are not an issue. We also wish to point out as unfortunate and painful the fact that when the Women and Child Development Ministry approached a section of leading activists talking about COVID orphans, they shared no details,” a source said.WCD Secretary Ram Mohan Mishra added that India was about to open 10 one stop centres across ten missions in nine countries to address violence against women.  One centre each will come up at the missions in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Australia, Canada and Singapore, while two in Saudi Arabia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-mulls-support-for-577-orphans-identified-in-covid-2nd-wave-258287

26-05-2021||New Delhi||Punjab seeks slashing duty on Covid related items||Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal on Tuesday called upon the Centre to have “GST with a heart” as he sought a much lower tax regime on goods required to battle Covid ahead of the meeting of the GST Council on Friday.The stage is set for a vigorous discussion on the issue as the call to provide relief on Covid related items has also been endorsed by the finance ministers of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.The Fitment Committee of the GST Council has recommended against granting full exemption as that would result in increased cost of production of these goods. In this scenario, the opposition finance ministers may press for a token GST of 0.1 % on such items.In a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Badal also complained about leaving the decision making to bureaucrats during the period when the GST Council did not meet.Pointing out that 50 pages of the meeting’s agenda contains decisions taken by officials – the GST Implementation Committee (GIC) – Badal complained that these have only been placed for information of state finance ministers and not for review.Badal warned that if these decisions were not placed before the GST Council for its approval, Punjab would not be a party to the “dangerous precedent of subverting the process of law making to officers”.The Punjab finance minister also pointed out that though the GST Council is being convened after eight months, the agenda is mundane and does not touch on issues of a structural nature such as appointing a vice-chair of the GST Council from the states and operationalising the Dispute Redressal Mechanism.There is also no mechanism to place the suggestions of states as a part of the agenda of the GST Council meetings or even to formally acknowledge them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-seeks-slashing-duty-on-covid-related-items-258244
26-05-2021||New Delhi||FB, Google working on complying with social media rules as deadline looms||With just hours to go before the new IT rules for social media companies take effect, large digital platforms Facebook and Google on Tuesday asserted they are working towards meeting the compliance requirements.The new rules, announced on February 25, require large social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to follow additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer. 'Significant social media intermediaries' -- defined as those with over 50 lakh registered users -- were given three months to comply with the additional requirements. Non-compliance with rules would result in these social media companies losing their intermediary status that provides them exemptions and specified immunity from liabilities for any third-party information and data hosted by them. In other words, they could be liable for action. A Google spokesperson said the company has consistently invested in significant product changes, resources and personnel to ensure that it is combating illegal content in an effective and fair way, and to comply with local laws in the jurisdictions it operates in. "We realise that our work in keeping our platforms secure is never done and we will continue to refine our existing approaches, and evolve our policies and be as transparent as possible about how we make decisions,” the spokesperson said.A Facebook spokesperson noted that the company is working to implement operational processes and aims to comply with the provisions of the IT rules. The social media giant -- which also owns photo-sharing platform Instagram -- said it continues to discuss a "few of the issues which need more engagement" with the government.Facebook and Google, however, did not clarify on the new level of compliance being met as of Tuesday.However, according to sources close to the development, Facebook has put in place provisions around voluntary verification, 24-hour timeline to remove content flagged for nudity etc and setting up a process and time-bound grievance redressal mechanism.Process is underway for compliance with requirements like generation of monthly compliance reports and appointment of chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer.Notably, Twitter has not commented on its compliance status. The microblogging platform had drawn flak from the government recently after it put 'manipulated media' tag on tweets by BJP leaders on an alleged toolkit used by the Opposition to target Centre over its COVID-19 handling.Confronting Twitter on the issue, the government had, last week asked the microblogging platform to remove the tag, saying the social media platform cannot pass a judgment on a matter under investigation.There were no immediate comments from WhatsApp on the IT rules compliance.Last week, Koo -- the Indian rival of Twitter -- had said it has complied with the requirements of the new rules and its Privacy Policy, Terms of Use and Community Guidelines now reflect the changes. Koo has close to 6 million (60 lakh) users, making it a major social media intermediary under the new guidelines.  Recently, various industry bodies, including the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the US-India Business Council (USIBC), had written to the government seeking up to a one-year extension for compliance, particularly in the view of the pandemic.However, so far there is no word on any extension.IT Ministry sources said that appointment of a grievance officer would be a key requirement from day one of the rules coming into effect, given the importance of public interface for complaints, and need for an acknowledgement system for requests.On February 25, the government had announced tighter regulations for social media firms, requiring them to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and setting up a robust complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country. Significant social media companies will have to publish a monthly compliance report disclosing details of complaints received and action taken, as also details of contents removed proactively.They will also be required to have a physical contact address in India published on its website or mobile app, or both.As per data cited by the government, India has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 44.8 crore YouTube users, 41 crore Facebook subscribers, 21 crore Instagram users, while 1.75 crore account holders are on microblogging platform Twitter.The new rules were introduced to make social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram -- which have seen a phenomenal surge in usage over the past few years in India -- more accountable and responsible for the content hosted on their platform.Social media companies will have to take down posts depicting nudity or morphed photos within 24 hours of receiving a complaint.Notably, the rules require significant social media intermediaries -- providing services primarily in the nature of messaging -- to enable identification of the "first originator" of the information that undermines sovereignty of India, security of the state, or public order.This could have major ramifications for players like Twitter and WhatsApp.The rules also state that users who voluntarily want to verify their accounts should be given an appropriate mechanism to do so, and be accorded a visible mark of verification.
