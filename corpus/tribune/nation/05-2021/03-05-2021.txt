Shahjahan Shah (38) and Bibhash Bag (30) were declared dead when taken to the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.Kakali Khsetrapal (47) was declared dead when taken to the Jamalpur Hospital, local sources said.The TMC claimed Shahjahan and Bibhash were their supporters.TMC block president Mehmood Khan said, “BJP workers carried out the attack in a planned manner. They are taking to violence in different places.”The BJP said Kakali was a supporter of the party who was allegedly killed in the attack.“TMC activists came to the area shouting ‘Joy Bangla’ and ‘Khela Hobe’ slogans around 11 am. They came to attack us but we built a counter-resistance and then they fled,” said Ashish Kshetrapal, the BJP’s chief of the Nabgram area.“A while later they returned through another route and came to my house. They attacked my family members and my mother died in the attack. TMC supporters also vandalised and looted 17-18 houses in the area. My father and uncle were also injured in the attack,” he alleged.Police said 23 people have been detained in connection with the incident and a huge contingent of central forces have been deployed in the area. An officer of Jamalpur police station said the situation was under control.In another incident in Samaspur in the Raina police station area, a 55-year-old man was killed in TMC-BJP clashes on Sunday night.According to local sources, clashes broke out in the village between the two sides after the election results were announced. Ganesh Mallick, known in the area as TMC supporter, was injured after being hit by bamboo sticks.He was admitted to the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital where he died, sources said.“My father was discussing the results of the election with a few others when BJP workers attacked them. My father was thrashed with a bamboo stick,” his son Manoj said.“I demand stringent punishment for those involved,” he added.BJP’s district general secretary Shyamal Roy said this incident is not at all political but a family dispute.“BJP was being linked to it unnecessarily,” he said.TMC’s district spokesperson Prosenjit Das said the BJP was resorting to violence in various areas after losing the election.TMC supporters were also accused of vandalising the homes and shops of BJP workers in various parts of Galshi after the results were announced.Several shops belonging to BJP supporters were vandalized in and around Ramgopalpur, Shirrai and Karakdal.Several people were also beaten up.Locals alleged that no action was taken even after the police were informed.

03-05-2021||New Delhi||SC asks 36,000 private schools of Rajasthan to charge 15% less fees from students||The Supreme Court on Monday directed 36,000 private unaided schools of Rajasthan to charge 15 per cent less annual fees from students in academic session 2020-21 and made clear that no students be barred from attending virtual or physical classes and their results be not held up due to non-payment of fees.The top court upheld the Rajasthan High Court’s judgment in rejecting the challenge to the validity of the Rajasthan Schools (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2016 and the Rules framed under the law governing fixation of school fees by the government-mandated procedures.A Bench comprising justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari, in its 128-page judgment, made clear that the truncated fees for academic year 2020-21 would be payable in six equal instalments by students or guardians.“Undeniably, an unprecedented situation has had evolved on account of complete lockdown due to pandemic. It had serious effect on the individuals, entrepreneurs, industries and the nation as a whole including in the matter of economy and purchasing capacity of one and all.              “A large number of people have lost their jobs and livelihood as aftermath of such economic upheaval. The parents who were under severe stress and even unable to manage their day-to-day affairs and the basic need of their family made fervent representation to the school management(s) across the state,” Justice Khanwilkar noted in the verdict.“The appellants (schools) shall collect annual school fees from their students as fixed under the Act of 2016 for the academic year 2019-20, but by providing deduction of 15 per cent on that amount in lieu of unutilised facilities by the students during the relevant period of academic year 2020­21,” the verdict said.The amount so payable by the concerned students be paid in six equal monthly instalments before August 05, 2021, it said, adding “it will be open to the schools to give further concession to their students…”.“The school management shall not debar any student from attending either online classes or physical classes on account of non-payment of fees, arrears/outstanding fees including the instalments, referred to above, and shall not withhold the results of the examinations of any student on that account,” it said.The top court also said if any individual request is made for waiver of fees, then the school management should consider such a representation on “case­to­case basis sympathetically”.The Bench said its judgment, however, will not affect collection of fees for academic year 2021-22 by schools.

03-05-2021||Aligarh||COVID-19 patient dies in Aligarh, family alleges medical negligence||The body of a COVID-19 patient kept lying on a bed at a government hospital here for more than 14 hours after he died, his family alleged, adding that he was subjected to wrong treatment.After a complaint in the matter against Deendayal Upadhyay Hospital to the district authorities, Sub-Divisional Magistrate Kol Ranjit Singh on Sunday ordered a probe. He said those found guilty would be duly punished.According to the complaint, Brajesh Sharma (69) died on Friday night and his family was “kept in the dark” about the incident.He was admitted at the hospital on Thursday and was treated on the basis of the medical tests of the previous occupant of the bed—Hariom Sharma, the complaint said.Brajesh’s family was unable to find him as the hospital didn’t have an entry with his name, it said, adding the error was detected by the time his treatment started in the previous patient’s name.Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus deaths recorded in the district on Sunday was 19 and the crematorium of exhibition ground conducted 17 cremations according to the COVID-19 protocol.“Sixteen of those cremated yesterday (Sunday) arrived from hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. The 17th cremation was of a person who was being treated at home and had COVID-like symptoms,” said Vishnu Kumar Bunty, whose NGO is helping people in making arrangements for cremations.“Even when there is a slight chance for it to be the body of a COVID victim, we strictly follow the COVID protocol. It is very difficult to decide whether it is or not in the present circumstances,” he added.

03-05-2021||Washington||US lawmaker urges Biden admin to immediately release AstraZeneca vaccine stockpile to India||Underlining that the US has “special obligations” towards India, an influential American lawmaker on Monday urged the Biden administration to immediately share the unused stockpile of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines with the country, which is facing an unprecedented surge in the coronavirus cases.Congressman Tom Malinowski also urged the government to activate all possible resources in the US, including in the Defence Department, to rush the necessary oxygen generation and storage tools and ventilators to India.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.“I call on the administration to ensure that all of the WHO-approved AstraZeneca vaccines in our stockpiles (which the US will not use) are shared with India and other nations the moment that can safely be done,” Malinowski said.He also urged the government to accelerate plans for sharing globally some share of the large surplus of vaccines that the US has produced or reserved for its population.“This process,” the Congressman from New Jersey said, “should begin now, and not wait until we have achieved herd immunity in the US.”    Last week, US had said it will distribute the 60 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses that is with it. However, it has not taken a call on when these jabs would be distributed and when countries like India would receive them.Urging strong US financial support for global institutions, like COVAX, that are making vaccines available to developing countries, Malinowski said from a public health standpoint, this is the most fair and objective way to ensure that vaccines get to those who need them most.“But there is nothing wrong with engaging in ‘vaccine diplomacy’ on top of our generous support for COVAX,” he said.“President Biden rightly decided that he had a special responsibility to secure enough supply to vaccinate Americans before others; by the same token, the US can and should make a special effort to deliver surplus vaccine doses to friends and allies, including India, to whom we also have special obligations, and to facilitate the export of raw materials needed for vaccine production in these countries,” Malinowski said.“We have a public health interest in getting as many vaccines out as quickly as possible, and a historic opportunity to be the country that leads the world away from COVID. There is not a moment to be lost,” he said.Praising the Biden administration’s actions to begin rushing medical supplies to “our friends in India”, the Congressman hoped that the administration will announce new steps in the coming days to accelerate the production and distribution of COVID vaccines around the world.“The Indian people are facing a particularly painful surge of COVID-19 cases, and many are dying simply due to a lack oxygen, ventilators, and hospital capacity. It is clear that we have not only a moral obligation to come to the assistance of our Indian friends, but a national security interest in helping the world’s largest democracy recover from the pandemic before it becomes an incubator of new vaccine-resistant variants of the disease,” he said.According to Indian health ministry data, single day rise of 3,68,147 COVID-19 infections and 3,417 fatalities pushed the country’s tally of cases to 1,99,25,604 and death toll to 2,18,959 on Monday.

03-05-2021||Noida (UP)||UP: Man briefly arrested for Bulandshahr violence that led to cop’s killing wins panchayat poll||Yogesh Raj, a former Bajrang Dal worker who was briefly arrested in connection with a mob violence that led to the killing of police inspector Subodh Kumar Singh in 2018 in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr, has won a panchayat poll in the district, an official said on Monday.“He had contested from ward number 5 for the panchayat polls and emerged as the winner among six candidates. His name on official records is mentioned as Yogesh Kumar,” a Bulandshahr administration official told PTI.The counting for the panchayat polls that were held last month is over but the distribution of certificates to the winners is pending, the official added.Yogesh Raj was the Bulandshahr unit convenor of the Bajrang Dal in 2018 when the mob violence took place in Siyana area of the district on December 3 over alleged cow slaughter and he was arrested on January 3, 2019, according to the police.He was among the 80 people -- 27 named and rest unidentified—who were booked by the police over the case but his name was dropped in the charge sheet filed in the court by a special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the matter.“He is no longer an office-bearer or member of our group,” Bajrang Dal’s western Uttar Pradesh unit co-convenor Praveen Bhati told PTI.Bhati said no member of the Bajrang Dal or its parent body Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) can contest such elections.Inspector Singh, who was the in-charge of the local Siyana police station, and a 20-year-old civilian Sumit Singh were killed in the December 3 violence, which was allegedly instigated by Yogesh Raj.An FIR was later lodged at the Siyana police station against around 80 people for murder, murder attempt, rioting, sedition, damaging public property, among other charges.The sedition charge was eventually dropped in the case, according to people privy to the matter.Besides Yogesh Raj, those booked were Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha’s Siyana unit head Shikhar Agarwal, Army jawan Jeetender Malik, and Kalua, who had first attacked the inspector, surrounded by five to six men.

03-05-2021||Mumbai||Air India pilots seek restoration of pre-COVID pay; says harshest hit in domestic market||Seeking the restoration of their pre-COVID-19 monthly pay, Air India’s pilot body ICPA has said its members continue to be “punished with the harshest and longest-standing pay cuts in the domestic market”.In yet another letter to Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri, the Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association (ICPA) said the assurances given by the minister in the past acted like a bulwark against the alleged apathetic behaviour of the Air India management towards the pilots during these trying times.“However, more than 12 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, we find it quite demoralising that even your office has not addressed any of our grievances,” the ICPA said in the letter on Monday.Last April, disinvestment-bound Air India had cut its pilots salaries by a massive 55 per cent to deal with the liquidity crunch in the wake of the pandemic.It, however, restored 5 per cent wages from the total reduction last December, still leaving their salaries 50 per cent lower compared to the pre-pandemic times.“The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the country without mercy.“We have painstakingly apprised you of our plight under the vicious and illegal pay cut instituted by the Air India management (more than a year old now) through numerous representations and meetings,” the pilots’ union said.It said the pay cut continues despite its members undertaking the longest, most challenging and most diverse missions under the Vande Bharat scheme.“Now, to compound our woes, this deadlier second wave has gripped the country requiring travel restrictions on Indians worldwide due to the elevated risks of infection.”             “The number of passengers and crew testing positive for COVID-19 has increased fourfold, and consequently, the rate of infections has shot up drastically for the Air India pilots and also for our family members.“It was already an uphill task to arrange timely medical support like hospital beds and oxygen cylinders for our increasing numbers and now, the situation is becoming chaotic,” it said.Stating that the pilots have not even been categorised as frontline workers despite having been at the frontline from day 1, the letter said: “Ironically, we were the first to get a pay cut but are the last to be considered for vaccination.”       In the letter, the pilots also voiced their concern over the increasing frequency of the Vande Bharat Mission flights, which has, in turn, increased their workload and the consequent risk of getting “infected/disabled”.“If we cannot get the support from management and the ministry that we deserve, the least that can be done is to restore our rightful wages so that if the worst comes to pass, we can provide for our family’s immediate medical needs and future well-being,” the ICPA said.

But, it did happen! My mother and husband, both, died without any treatment. We failed to have access to all top notch Delhi hospitals we used to visit! Yes, after death they declared COVID positive.“Many people like me perhaps thought that it couldn’t happen to them! But it did happen! My mother and husband, both, died without any treatment. We failed to have access to all top-notch Delhi hospitals we used to visit! Yes, after death they declared COVID positive,” Datta, who was Rashtrapati Bhawan spokesperson when Pratibha Patil was president, said.While her husband AR Dutta, who retired as director of the Defence Ministry’s training institute, was 68, her mother Bani Mukherjee was 88, the family’s story underscoring the crisis of oxygen and hospital beds in the national capital.“My son rushed both the patients to various private hospitals in south Delhi but were not admitted. Finally, a government hospital in Malviya Nagar admitted them…,” she told PTI.Her son Abhishek, who ferried his father and grandmother from hospital to hospital when their oxygen levels plummeted, is yet to come out of the shock.“I lost both of them within a span of an hour. My father was declared dead on arrival while they tried to revive my grandmother but gave up after an hour long try,” he said.One week later, the rest of the family, except Abhishek, has also tested positive, Datta said. And the fear is that tragedy might revisit as the oxygen situation shows little signs of improving.“I have not been able to grieve for my mother and husband. My niece is low on oxygen and my son has to run around for oxygen cylinders. We do not want to risk her life as we know that every hospital will turn us down,” she said.Datta is an Indian Information Services officer who retired in 2014 as director general, news, of Doordarshan.Their’s is one of the many tragedies unfolding in India’s national capital where the infrastructure is unable to cope with the daily number of cases and fatalities, and where hospitals everyday send out SOS messages about the acute shortage of oxygen.

Speculation is rife over Sarma being shifted to the Centre and Sonowal being anointed the CM, or even vice-versa.Sources say a central minister is visiting Assam to talk to MLAs and that it is also possible that the Parliamentary Board meeting may not be convened.Observers say much can be deciphered from the party’s hesitancy in naming its Chief Minister’s face in the run-up to 2021 Assembly elections. Not naming Sonowal the CM was indicative of its predicament. It was also contrary to the party’s stated stance—that it always contests under the incumbent CM in the state it is in power.Senior leaders say the decision over the next CM will be taken soon. The Parliamentary Board will nominate central observers for a legislative party meeting of the new MLAs, who will elect the new CM. While Sonowal and Sarma have both dismissed speculations of any “issues” between them and declared themselves a “team”, the toss can be a tricky task for the leadership. Called ‘Jatiya Nayak’, Sonowal has emerged as a popular chief minister with a clean image. He is also credited with containing anger against the Centre after the CAA. Meanwhile, Sarma, who is also the convenor of the all-important North East Democratic Front (NEDA), is a popular mass leader who led the party from the front in these elections.  Those close to him say he “may not agree to be a minister in the state government now”.Though Sarma was a Cabinet minister with important portfolios in the Sonowal government, he had been dropping hints regarding the arrangement. At one point he is also believed to have told leaders that he was not interested in contesting Assembly elections and that he should either be given charge of the state or brought to the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-tricky-challenge-in-assam-striking-right-balance-of-power-between-its-two-strongmen-247734
03-05-2021||New Delhi||IYC right to respond but mission should have used right channels: New Zealand PM||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Monday confirmed that there was indeed a patient in the New Zealand High Commission who required emergency treatment but conceded that an open public appeal for oxygen cylinders was not the right way for its New Delhi mission to go about it.The New Zealand High Commission and the Philippines Embassy had put out tweets seeking emergency supplies of oxygen and had tagged Indian Youth Congress president BV Srinivas who had rushed volunteers with cylinders to both the missions.This led to a Twitter spat between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh after the latter retweeted visuals of oxygen cylinders being given by Youth Congress volunteers to both missions and asked “is the MEA sleeping”.The New Zealand High Commission had deleted the tweet after the Twitter storm and later put out a fresh one apologising for the flap it had caused in New Delhi.“There was a message put out and the High Commission has apologised for asking on Twitter for oxygen cylinders. There are channels they can and should be going. But I should recognise that we do have a local staff member in the compound who had been very unwell. This was the basis on which the call was made,” said Ardern in an interview to a local TV channel.Ardern said it was a decision by the Indian Youth Congress to supply oxygen cylinders to the New Zealand High Commission who directly put out the tweet.“The High Commission themselves have acknowledged that there should have been a process that should have been used. But again there is an acknowledgment of reason why they had done this in the first place,” she said while stating that the mission has been “very well supported by the Indian government”.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Sunday advised all diplomatic missions not to hoard essential supplies following a Twitter spat between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh over Youth Congress leaders responding to emergency appeals for help from two diplomatic missions.As a result the MEA called upon the diplomatic missions here not to hoard essential supplies, including oxygen.Jaishankar had claimed that the supply of cylinders to the Philippines Embassy was an unsolicited offer done “clearly for cheap publicity by you know who”. But he had not commented on the New Zealand High Commission’s call for help.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iyc-right-to-respond-but-mission-should-have-used-right-channels-new-zealand-pm-247731

03-05-2021||New Delhi||No room for vaccine nationalism, developed countries need to share technology: FM||Cautioning the global community against vaccine nationalism at this hour of the COVID pandemic, India on Monday asked the developed nations to share technology and allow free movement of critical components and raw material needed for production of vaccines.Speaking at the annual meet of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also underlined the need for a re-look at the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.“Countries will have to be open about sharing vaccine-based technologies. The TRIPS agreement will have to be looked at in the context of the pandemic. There cannot be any more vaccine nationalism, countries will have to be flexible about it,” she said.The TRIPS agreement is a legal pact between all the member nations of the World Trade OrganiSation (WTO). It establishes minimum standards for regulation by national governments of different forms of intellectual property as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations. The agreement has been in force from January 1995.Participating in a virtual Governors’ seminar, Sitharaman said there is a need to have a global multilateral approach to deal with the COVID pandemic.One critical point in ramping up the production (of COVID vaccine) capacity is access to critical raw materials, she said.“Although we speak about global value chain and the need for countries to open up trade and also facilitate free movement of raw materials, critical components, critical APIs and so on, we find that the movement of critical raw materials for production of vaccines is finding certain hiccups. We would love that to be sorted out at the earliest so that India can produce,” she said.It is important that critical raw materials are available and made to flow freely, she said, adding, two more vaccines, including a nasal spray are in the offing to treat COVID.Indian vaccine manufacturers, including Serum Institute of India (SII), faced problems in production last month as Europe and the US banned export of critical raw materials.Tagging the Twitter handle of the President of the United States, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla had tweeted, “Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details.” Ban was lifted post Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the US President Joe Biden discussions on issues related to COVID crisis in India last week.Modi had also discussed India’s initiative at the WTO for a relaxation in the norms of the agreement on TRIPS to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries.Noting that India being a pharmaceutical hub, Sitharaman on Monday said, “We have readily and generously extended help for the global community earlier this year and we can see that gesture being returned as a favour now.”She thanked the global community for expressing solidarity with India at this time, when the country is in the grip of the second COVID wave.Praising the efforts of two vaccine manufacturers including Bharat Biotech, she said they have definitely worked together with the government and kept their profit considerations aside.They have given vaccines at an affordable price for the government to distribute it freely for all citizens, she added.Post pandemic, she said, “the future as I said, will have to be based on principles of openness, transparency, fairness, sustainability and inclusiveness”. If you’re actually aiming at resilient and sustainable growth particularly coming out of the pandemic, she said, “I think, regional cooperation we have to focus on and multilateral institutions working towards building digital assets, creation of digital assets, and above all, giving education and health digitisation for all.”As regards global climate action, she said, India is committed to all the Paris agreement-based commitments and it is well on a course to fulfil all those commitments.About efforts of the government to keep the wheels of economy running during the pandemic, Sitharaman said the government extended financial assistance to various sectors.Observing that MSMEs are the backbone of the economy, she said the government has extended financial assistance in terms of Rs 3 lakh crore loan guarantee to help them amid the pandemic.

03-05-2021||London||India-UK close to signing migration and mobility partnership: Report||India and the UK are close to signing a “migration and mobility partnership”, which could see thousands more Indian students enrol at UK universities in exchange for illegal Indian migrants being sent back, according to a UK media report on Monday.The partnership forms part of a wider set of agreements in the pipeline during the visit of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, invited by his UK counterpart Dominic Raab as a guest at the multilateral G7 Foreign and Development Ministers meeting this week.A bilateral meeting between Raab and Jaishankar is scheduled for Thursday at Chevening in Kent, south-east England.“London and New Delhi are on the cusp of signing a ‘migration and mobility partnership’, which is part of a wider move towards bolstering relations that aims at securing a mini trade deal later this year,” a report in ‘The Daily Telegraph’ claims.“Government insiders say the talks are still live and final details are yet to be ironed out, but the deal represents an important step on two key sticking points that have hampered bilateral relations in recent years. There are hopes that the agreement could be clinched as early as this week, when Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, is in London for multilateral talks with the G7, hosted by Dominic Raab,” it notes.The issue of illegal Indian migrants in the UK has long been on the agenda of bilateral negotiations, with both sides failing to agree on the numbers in question.While the UK maintains around 100,000 Indians are illegally living in the country, India has questioned the veracity of those numbers in the past because that figure is believed to also cover nationals from other parts of the Indian subcontinent.The two sides were close to signing an agreement on the issue in 2018 before it fell through over this ambiguity.Under the current Boris Johnson led administration, a post-Brexit Indo-Pacific tilt of the UK has been linked with potential agreements across several previously sticky areas – including easing the route for student visas for Indians wanting to study at UK universities and easier access to legal services in India for British companies.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold a virtual summit with his British counterpart Boris Johnson on Tuesday, when both leaders are to sign off on Roadmap 2030, a blueprint expected to pave the way for a free trade agreement (FTA) in the future.“A comprehensive Roadmap 2030 will be launched during the Summit, which will pave the way for further expanding and deepening India-UK cooperation over the next decade across five key areas, namely people-to-people relationship, trade and prosperity, defence and security, climate action and healthcare,” the Indian High Commission in London said in a statement.“India and UK enjoy a Strategic Partnership since 2004. It has been marked by regular high-level exchanges and growing convergences in diverse areas. The summit will be an important opportunity to elevate our multi-faceted strategic ties and enhance cooperation on regional and global issues of mutual interest. Both leaders will also discuss COVID-19 cooperation and the global efforts to fight the pandemic,” the statement added.

03-05-2021||New Delhi||Harassing people seeking COVID-related help to result in coercive action, SC warns Centre, states||The Supreme Court has directed the Centre and states to inform their chief secretaries and police chiefs that any clampdown on information on social media or harassment to individuals seeking help on any platform in relation to COVID-19 would result in coercive action.In these “trying times”, those desperately seeking help for their loved ones on these platforms should not have their misery compounded through the actions of the State and its instrumentalities, the apex court said.It said it was “deeply distressed” to note that individuals seeking help on such platforms have been targeted, by alleging that the information posted by them was false and posted on social media to create panic, defame the administration or damage the “national image”.A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud said such targeting of individuals should not be condoned, and the Centre and state governments should ensure that they immediately cease direct or indirect threats of prosecution and arrest to citizens who air grievances or those that are attempting to help fellow citizens receive medical aid.The apex court, in a 64-page order uploaded on the its site on late Sunday night, said that if this keeps happening even after the current order, it would be constrained to use the powers available to it under it contempt jurisdiction.“The Central Government and State Governments shall notify all Chief Secretaries/Directors General of Police/Commissioners of Police that any clampdown on information on social media or harassment caused to individuals seeking/delivering help on any platform will attract a coercive exercise of jurisdiction by this Court. “The Registrar (Judicial) is also directed to place a copy of this order before all District Magistrates in the country,” said the bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat.The top court said the clampdown on information sharing must be absolutely stopped immediately because sharing information widely is in itself an important tool in combating public tragedies and it will help in the creation of a “collective public memory” of this pandemic.“As such, preventing clampdowns on sharing of information on online platforms is not just in the interest of individuals sharing the information, but the larger democratic structures of our nation. Without the ready availability of such information, it is entirely possible that the COVID-19 pandemic may turn into a a tragedy worse than what it already is,” the bench said.The bench also referred to its Right to Privacy judgement and said, “Academic literature documenting the widespread availability of information and the resultant acknowledgement of the problem is what prevented the drought in Maharashtra in 1973 from becoming as bad as the Bengal Famine of 1943, where the British tried to deny the problem even existed.The apex court said that widespread sharing of information by individuals living through the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial and the role of Courts in creating and preserving this collective public memory cannot be understated.“Hence, in the present proceedings, we hope to not only initiate a dialogue so as to better tackle the current COVID-19 pandemic but also to preserve its memory in our public records, so that future generations may evaluate our efforts and learn from them,” it said.The directions were passed in a suo motu case for ensuring essential supplies and services during the COVID-19 pandemic.The bench has taken up issues such as the projected demand for oxygen in the country at present and in the near future, how the government intends to allocate it to “critically affected” states and its monitoring mechanism to ensure supply.The Supreme Court had earlier made clear that any attempt to clamp down on the free flow of information on social media, including a call for help from people, would be treated as contempt of the court.“There should be free flow of information; we should hear voices of citizens. This is a national crisis. There should not be any presumption that the grievances raised on the Internet are always false. Let a strong message be sent to all the DGPs that there should not be any kind of clampdown,” the bench had said while reserving its order on April 30.

03-05-2021||New Delhi||Humanitarian work is primary, could have done more if we were in govt: IYC chief Srinivas||As the second COVID-19 wave stretches the healthcare infrastructure to breaking point, Indian Youth Congress president B V Srinivas and his team have emerged the go-to people, quickly responding to SOS messages and arranging for oxygen, medicines and even plasma.The word has spread. And people desperate for help as the pandemic spreads, particularly in the national capital and its suburbs, have been directly calling IYC members or tagging them and Srinivas on social media platforms.IYC officials said that he has a team of 1,000 members dedicated to responding to calls of help for COVID-19 patients. They are doing everything, from arranging plasma, oxygen, medicines and equipment to beds, the officials said.Humanitarian work is primary, said Srinivas, whose team has been praised for taking up a number of COVID-19 relief works.If the Congress was in power, it could have done much more for those in need, added the 40-year-old.Though appointed IYC president last year, Srinivas, sources said, quickly gained the attention of the party leadership as he and his organisation worked relentlessly to help migrants reach their native places during the lockdown and took up campaigns against the Centre’s new farm laws.Raised in a middle-class family in Karnataka’s Shivamogga district, Srinivas, before coming into politics, was a cricketer and even played in the state Under-16 team.However, cricket did not work out for him and he joined the National College in Basavanagudi. It was from here, as a National Students’ Union of India member, Srinivas begun his political journey, and over the years, started growing in rank, making his way into state-level politics.Known to be a grassroot-level worker, Srinivas was appointed secretary in the IYC in 2014 and within a few years was made general secretary. In 2018, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi appointed him vice president and after Keshav Chand Yadav resigned as president following the party’ 2019 Lok Sabha poll debacle, Srinivas took up the responsibility.“For me it was always about social and humanitarian work. But some people seem to be using the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to achieve their vested interest and treating it like an event,” said Srinivas, who has also led the IYC into protesting the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act.The Congress and the IYC are trying their best to help COVID-19 patients and their families, he said.“But we have very limited resources. If we had more, we would have done more,” Srinivas said.“Because we (Congress) are not in government, we are not being able to do more for the people of the country. Even if we wish, we are not able to do it,” he said.The IYC president demanded that strict action be taken against those who are using the pandemic for their vested interests. “This will also help improve the situation,” Srinivas said.Sources said Srinivas has been praised in crucial meetings by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and senior leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Srinivas said that during a meeting in March in the presence of Rahul Gandhi a six-month roadmap was prepared and it stressed on providing all help to those affected by COVID-19.IYC volunteers reportedly also supplied medical oxygen to two foreign embassies for COVID-19 patients recently.Srinivas had posted a video on Twitter that showed a mini-pickup van entering the embassy of the Philippines carrying oxygen cylinders. He had also shared a video of supplying oxygen cylinders by his team to the New Zealand high commission and thanked the IYC team for the quick relief.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that his ministry had checked with the Philippines embassy and they had no COVID case.The Ministry of External Affairs had said it is in continuous touch with all foreign embassies in India and responding to their medical demands, especially those related to COVID-19.MEA Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said the response to medical demands of the embassies included facilitating treatment in a hospital even as he urged all not to hoard essential supplies including oxygen.India for the last couple of days has been recording over 3.50 lakh daily coronavirus cases and the fatalities have also increased.

03-05-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19 management not our prerogative, EC tells SC||The Election Commission, rattled over the strong high court observations related to conducting of just concluded assembly elections, told the Supreme Court on Monday that COVID-19 management was not its prerogative and it does not run the governance of the state.A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah was told by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the EC, that remarks of murder charges made by the Madras High Court against the constitutional body were unwarranted and such conclusive remarks should not have been made without hearing the poll panel.“Election Commission is not running the governance of the state. We only issue guidelines and directives. We don’t have CRPF or any other force with us to check the people in rally. State Disaster Management Authority has to issue orders for limiting the people. There is a presumption that EC has responsibility for all this. We have nothing to do with COVID management,” he said.The high court had on April 26 castigated the EC for the surge in COVID-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic, holding it “singularly” responsible for the spread of the viral disease, called it the “the most irresponsible institution” and even said its officials may be booked under murder charges.The Bench told Dwivedi that the poll panel should take the observations of the high court in the right spirit and said, “Nobody is criticising anybody. You have done a good job. Election Commission is a seasoned constitutional body, entrusted with the responsibility to ensure free and fair election in the country. It should not be rattled by the observations made”.It assured the poll panel that the high court’s remarks were not meant to “run down” a constitutional body but may have been made “momentarily” in the flow of discussions and that’s why it was not in the judicial order.Dwivedi said the EC was not objecting to the discussions and observations made by the high courts but they have to be in the context of matter at hand and there should not be any off-the-cuff remarks.He said that polling in Tamil Nadu was held on April 6, the PIL was filed on April 19 and the order was passed by the high court on April 26.The Bench said: “Some observations are made in larger public interest. Sometimes it is anguish and sometimes they are made to make a person do the work, he is required to do...some judges are reticent and some judges are verbose”.The top court said that it’s reasoned order would take into account Election Commission’s submission that “wanton charges” levelled against it by the Madras High Court were unwarranted and would try to strike a balance between two constitutional bodies.The Bench made it clear that it would neither restrain the media from reporting oral observations made during proceedings in public interest, nor demoralise high courts — “vital pillars of democracy” — by asking them to refrain from raising questions.It termed as “too far-fetched” the poll panel’s plea of restraining media from reporting remarks made in court proceedings.The top court reserved its verdict and said that it will give a reasoned order as the appeal of the poll panel against Madras High Court order raises larger issue.

03-05-2021||New Delhi||Fossils of Dickinsonia, one of Earth’s oldest animals, found in India||Researchers have discovered fossils of one of the Earth’s earliest known multicellular animals—the 550-million-year-old Dickinsonia—on the roof of the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh.Dickinsonia is an extinct genus of basal animal that lived during the late Ediacaran period in a geographical area now divided into Australia, China, India, Russia and Ukraine.The individual Dickinsonia typically resembles a bilaterally symmetrical ribbed oval. Its fossils are known only in the form of imprints and casts in sandstone beds.The specimens found in Bhimbetka are around 17 inches long, where as the ones that have been found in other parts of the world exceeded four feet in length, the researchers from Geological Society of India (GSI), Nagpur, Maharashtra, noted.The finding, published in the journal Gondwana Research, confirms close proximity of Australia and India, according to the researchers.“Dickinsonia fossil was first discovered in 1947 in Flinders Ranges of South Australia. Its fossils have also been discovered in Ukraine, Russia and China,” Ranjit Khangar Director & Coordinator, GSI, told PTI.“Bhimbetka Rock Shelters, a UNESCO World Heritage Site for Paleolithic and Mesolithic cave art, near Bhopal, is once again highlighted worldwide due to the first discovery of oldest animal fossil, Dickinsonia from India,” Khangar said.The new fossils were discovered on the last day of 36th International Geological Congress 2020 field trip conducted by GSI in March last year.However, it took the team almost a year to publish the findings.Other teammates involved in the study were from the University of Oregon in the US, National Operations Center, Bureau of Land Management, Geospatial Section, US, and the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.“Dickinsonia is the earliest Ediacaran multicellular animal life yet found—predating explosion of life in Cambrian Period (around 541 million years) in geological time scale,” Merajuddin Khan, senior geologist and member of GSI, Nagpur, noted.“Palaeobiologists believe that these earliest living creatures were used to live in shallow warm seas, as early as 570 million years ago, and are representative of earliest complex life form in animal kingdom,” Khan told PTI.As the fossil is out of reach, multiple digital images of the site were processed using three- dimensional (3D) modelling, the researchers said.The geological condition and occurrences of Dickinsonia were compared with fossils reported from South Australia before arriving at the final conclusion, they said.

03-05-2021||New Delhi||Govt waives IGST on import of COVID-relief material received as donation for free distribution||The government on Monday waived Integrated GST (IGST) till June 30 on the import of COVID-related relief material donated or received free of cost from outside India for free distribution.The Finance Ministry in a statement said the government had received a number of representations from charitable organisations, corporate entities, and other associations/entities outside India seeking exemption from IGST on the import of COVID-19 relief material, donated/received free of cost from outside India for free distribution.“Accordingly, the Central Government has ... granted exemption from IGST on import of such goods received free of cost for free distribution for Covid relief,” it said, adding the exemption would be applicable till June 30.This exemption would also cover goods already imported but waiting to be cleared at the Customs ports.The government has already exempted from customs duty import of a host of COVID-related relief materials, including Remdesivir injection and its APIs, Inflammatory diagnostic (markers) kits, medical grade oxygen, oxygen therapy related equipment such as oxygen concentrators, cryogenic transport tanks, etc, and Covid vaccines.The IGST exemption given on Monday would be subject to nodal authorities, appointed by the state governments, authorising any entity, relief agency or statutory body, for free distribution of such relief material.The said goods can be imported free of cost by a state government or, any entity/ relief agency/ statutory body, authorized in this regard for free distribution anywhere in India.The importer shall before clearance of goods from Customs produce a certificate from the said nodal authorities that goods are meant for free distribution for Covid relief.After imports, the importer shall produce, to the Deputy or Assistant Commissioner of Customs at the port within a period of six months from the date of importation or within such extended period not exceeding nine months, a statement containing details of goods imported and distributed free of cost.This statement shall be certified by the said nodal authority of the state government.“This exemption shall thus enable import of the Covid relief supply imported free of cost for free distribution without payment of IGST (up to the 30th June, 2021). As customs duty is already exempt, these imports will not attract any customs duty or IGST,” the ministry added.India’s single day COVID infections had crossed a record 4 lakh mark last week. On Monday, 3.68 lakh new infections and 3,417 deaths were reported.Last week, the government slashed IGST rate on import of oxygen concentrators for personal use to 12 per cent, from 28 per cent, for two months till June 30.Under Goods and Services Tax (GST), the tax levied on consumption of goods or rendering of service is split 50:50 between the Centre and the state. Such tax is known as Central-GST or CGST and State-GST or SGST.On inter-state movement of goods as well as imports, an Integrated-GST or IGST is levied, which accrues to the Centre. The amount paid as IGST can be utilised by businesses for claiming credit while making CGST or SGST payments at the time of actual sale.AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said, “Government has rightly come up with full IGST relief on import of Covid related relief material including oxygen concentrators, generators, cylinders and Covid medicines by state government and its authorised agencies.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-waives-igst-on-import-of-covid-relief-material-received-as-donation-for-free-distribution-247697

It may be noted that the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 provides for the procedure to be followed for children who have lost their family support and have become child in need of care and protection," it said.The procedure under the JJ Act, 2015 ensures that children are provided all the minimum standards of care and their rights are upheld and protected, Kanoongo said."Therefore, it is of utmost importance that these children who have lost their family support must be produced before the child protection authorities of the district, and information about these children must be shared with the authorities," he wrote.These children who have lost family support due to COVID-19 or have been abandoned due to the loss of parents to the disease are in need of care and protection as per the JJ Act, 2015, and such children must be produced before the Child Welfare Committee as per section 31 of the Act, the commission said.It also pointed out that it was necessary for every individual, entity, organisation or NGO to ensure that any information received about orphaned and abandoned children during these COVID times is shared on the helpine 1098."Similarly, it is further requested that if any such information for an abandoned or orphaned children is received by any entity, organisation, NGO then the same can be also be informed to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights either through email (cp.ncpcr@nic.in) or through telephone (011-23478250) for assistance and help to the children. This information can also be shared with the respective state commissions of the said state/UT for the same," the letter read.

03-05-2021||New Delhi||Op CO-JEET launched by armed forces to fight COVID-19 in India: Lt Gen Kanitkar||Treating the current coronavirus wave like a war, the armed forces have launched operation "CO-JEET" to aid anti-COVID-19 efforts, like strengthening medical infrastructure and oxygen supply chains, as well as take measures to ensure the mental wellbeing of people.Besides medical therapy, patients need the reassurance that they will be fine and "in times of stress if you have someone to talk to, it makes a huge difference," said Deputy Chief of Integrated Defence Staff (Medical) Lieutenant General Dr Madhuri Kanitkar.Lt Gen Kanitkar, who is the third woman to become a three-star general in the armed forces, is working round the clock to strategise and monitor steps to provide relief to COVID-19 patients.Often seen on the move and mingling with her staff, especially at the COVID-19 centre set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation near the Delhi airport, Lt Gen Kanitkar told PTI that COVID-19 patients need reassurance that all will be fine and "I believe more in conviction therapy and making them smile".The second COVID-19 wave has put huge pressure on the country's health system, with health facilities in several states reeling under a shortage of oxygen, medicines and equipment needed to treat coronavirus patients and also beds."Under the "CO-JEET" plan, personnel of the three wings of the armed forces – the Army, the Indian Air Force and the Navy – have been pressed into service to help restore oxygen supply chains, set up COVID beds and provide help to the civilian administration in its fight to control the pandemic," said the Lt General, whose post of deputy chief integrated defence staff (medical) comes under the Chief of Defence Staff.Like every healthcare worker in the country, teams of personnel of the armed forces are also working round the clock, the senior officer said. "In addition to the ongoing COVID situation, most ex-servicemen are also coming to military hospitals. In cities like Delhi and Pune, we have made 400-500 bed hospitals purely for defence and ex-servicemen," she said.Efforts are also underway to provide additional beds across the country for mixed COVID-19 management, Kanitkar said.Giving details about operation "CO-JEET", Lt Gen Kanitkar, whose husband also retired as a lieutenant general from the Army making them the only couple to have reached the position, said that "undoubtedly this is a war-like situation and every wing of the nation is doing its best as common citizens are affected by this pandemic."She said the Department of Defence has created a COVID-19 Crisis Management Committee and "we are working on it on a war footing together". "CO-JEET stands for co-workers of all the three services who will finally achieve 'Jeet' (victory) over COVID. The whole team is working in a very energised way because a soldier is trained to fight under adverse situations and he doesn't give up, we are not just doctors, we are soldiers," the Lt General said. "We are totally charged up and working like that to provide care to defence personnel and relief to the civil administration," she said.On the shortage of oxygen, she said that "some of the military hospitals have their own oxygen generation plants. However, the present crises have shown that we need to further ramp up this facility and already around 46 oxygen generation plants are being installed at various places"."Besides this, we have a capacity of holding jumbo cylinders and of oxygen concentration from fields," the officer said and thanked the Indian Oil Corporation for extending support for transportation of oxygen.She highlighted the concerted efforts of all the three wings of the armed forces and their support. "The IAF carried out a number of sorties to bring (oxygen cryogenic) containers from abroad besides putting on track the supply chain for oxygen," Lt Gen Kanitkar said.The Indian Navy transported liquid oxygen to places like Andaman and Nicobar Island, Lakshadweep and the Indian Army gave its military coaches for carrying oxygen supplies to various parts of the country, she said, adding that around 200 drivers were pressed into service for ensuring smooth supply of the oxygen.Lt Gen Kanitkar, who is a recipient of the Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM) and other awards, was recently at the Sardar Patel COVID Centre."When I came to know that some of my own staff members have fallen sick due to the virus, I wasted no time in reaching out to them so that they understand that we are with them," she said.Spending nearly 16 hours at work, she, while thanking her husband for moral support, reasoned out her visits to COVID care centres, saying "I am trying to get to the ground not to look at the machines only but the man behind the machines and as always taught in the Army, I want to lead them from the front."At the centre, she told members of her team who tested positive for the virus: "You see I am a paediatrician and a paediatrician does not grow beyond 15 years. You have everything -- bread and butter -- and I have only come to add some jam to your sandwiches and remind you that this too shall pass.""I am inspired by the quote of late President A P J Abdul Kalam who wrote 'difficulties in your life do not come to destroy you, but to help you realise your hidden potential and power. Let difficulties know that you too are difficult," the Lt General said.Commissioned in the Army in 1982, Kanitkar was appointed as the dean of Armed Forces Medical College where she earned the nickname of 'Rajmaata'. When asked about it she burst into laughter and said "this is a fact that my team did nickname me this and that was because I always believed in finding solutions to the problem"."The same principle is followed today because being a woman and a mother, you have eyes at the back to get out of the box ideas and it does help you," she said.

03-05-2021||Melbourne||Australian PM defends ban on citizens returning from India; says it's in ‘best interests'||Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday defended his government's decision to ban and impose a jail term and a penalty for Australians trying to return from India, saying it is in the country's “best interests” and to prevent a third wave of infections.The Australian government, for the first time in history, recently imposed a ban on its citizens from returning home, if they have spent time in India up to 14 days before flying back.The government threatened to prosecute them with a possibility of five years of jail term or a penalty of 66,000 Australian dollars (USD 50,899).Morrison said this is a temporary arrangement and a very difficult decision.“It has been put in place to ensure that we do not get a third wave here in Australia and that our quarantine system can remain strong,” he said, adding that it is in the country's “best interests”.He said that he feels terribly for the Indian community.''We've seen a seven-fold increase in the rate of infection of those in our Howard Springs facility coming back from India.“It's important that we ensure that we have a temporary pause here to strengthen those arrangements in those quarantine facilities, get stronger testing arrangements, both when leaving India but also on people coming from third countries,” Morrison said.He said that he wants to get those repatriation flights running safely again.“These are the things we have to do to ensure I can do that, so I can. We've already brought home some 20,000 people from India through supported flights and facilitated flights, and they were just those who are registered. And so that has been a big effort to get people home,'' the Prime Minister told 2GB radio channel.“We've had the Biosecurity Act in place now for over a year and no one's gone to jail… there hasn't been any irresponsible use of those powers,” he said.Morrison said that there was clear advice from the chief medical officer that it was a decision that was supported and should be taken.The Prime Minister was criticised by Opposition leader Anthony Albanese for abandoning Australians in India and threatening the travellers with a penalty and a jail term.“Australia has obligations to our citizens, to people who are Australians – not just to abandon them overseas but then to threaten them is quite an extraordinary action,” Albanese was quoted by media reports here on Sunday.Deputy Nationals leader Matt Canavan tweeted on Monday about the government's decision stating, “We should be helping Aussies in India return, not jailing them.''               Morrison said that the ban was under a continual review and “this only needs to be there in place for as long as it needs to be there to keep Australians safe.''              Meanwhile, Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly has said the expert health advice group, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, told the government the risk coming from India had reached a “benchmark of concern”.On Monday, the daily COVID-19 cases in India showed a slight dip with 3,68,147 new coronavirus infections, taking the total tally of cases to 1,99,25,604, according to the Union Health Ministry.The death toll increased to 2,18,959 with 3,417 daily new fatalities.While the country recorded 4,01,993 new cases on May 1, it had registered 3,92,488 fresh cases on May 2.

The HC had rapped the poll panel for failing to ensure compliance of Covid protocol during the recent Assembly polls."We have to make sure high court judges and chief justices are independent to take views. We have to make sure that media reports everything that happens in court," said the Bench, which also included Justice MR Shah while reserving its order on the EC's plea."If something is said in the High Court, we should take it in the right spirit," the Bench told senior counsel Rakesh Dwivedi, representing the Commission.The EC had also requested the top court to direct the media to confine their reports to written orders and to refrain from reporting on oral observations made during hearing on Covid protocol.Dwivedi pointed out that there had been discussions that the EC should be charged with murder."What forms the part of the judicial order is what the judges actually said. Whatever is said in courts is momentary," the Bench said.Dwivedi contested the Bench, saying, “It wasn't momentary. They (Madras HC) went on and on and on...”"We know why you've come here because the high court has said that the EC should be charged with murder. Mr Dwivedi, we know the importance of free and fair elections. We want to assure you that we would write a balanced order."However, it said, "We can't order our judges in high courts to confine themselves to pleadings only...The judges are overwhelmed in the Covid times...they are seeing what's happening around."It said media should be able to report everything as it created accountability."The discussions that take place are of importance, in fact of the same order and are in public interest. It’s not a monologue that one person will speak and then judges will speak," said the Bench."We have to protect the sanctity of the judicial process. We have to make sure that high court judges and chief justices are independent to make views. we have to make sure that media reports everything that happens in court so that we judges conduct proceedings with dignity," the top court said, adding, "We are looking at this from a long term and impact on functioning of high courts."Terming the impugned comments as "uncalled for, blatantly disparaging and derogatory”, the EC said the Madras High Court made "serious allegations of murder on another independent constitutional authority (EC) without any basis, which has ultimately dented both the institutions."The poll panel said “a dangerous trend appears to have started and a criminal complaint has been made against a Deputy Election Commissioner in relation to the aforesaid allegation as observed".Pointing out that the said comments didn’t find any place in the order passed by the high court, the EC submitted that being a constitutional court of record, the high court ought not to have made the said oral observations levelling serious allegations against the Election Commission without any proof.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-dont-want-to-demoralise-high-courts-says-supreme-court-247653
03-05-2021||New Delhi||SC directs Centre to revisit current vaccine policy, says it may create disparity||The Supreme Court has directed the Centre to revisit its Covid vaccine pricing policy, saying it would prima facie result in a detriment to the right to public health.A bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said as of date, the manufacturers had suggested two different prices, a lower price which is applicable to the Centre and a higher price which is applicable to the quantities purchased by state governments.The apex court said that compelling state governments to negotiate with manufacturers on grounds of promoting competition and making it attractive for new vaccine manufacturers would result in a serious detriment to those in the age group of 18 to 44, who would be vaccinated by state governments.The social strata of this age group also comprise persons who belong to underprivileged and marginalised groups, like many in the other population age groups. They may not have the ability to pay."Whether or not essential vaccines will be made available to them will depend upon the decision of each state government, based on its own finances, on whether or not the vaccine should be made available free or should be subsidised and if so, to what extent. This will create disparity across the nation. The vaccinations being provided to citizens constitute a valuable public good," the bench said.The bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Ravindra Bhat, said discrimination cannot be made between different classes of citizens who are similarly circumstanced on the ground that while the Central government will carry the burden of providing free vaccines for the 45 years and above population, state governments will discharge the responsibility of the 18 to 44 age group on such commercial terms as they may negotiate."Prima facie, the rational method of proceeding in a manner consistent with the right to life (which includes the right to health) under Article 21 would be for the Central Government to procure all vaccines and to negotiate the price with vaccine manufacturers," the court said.The apex court said that once quantities are allocated by it to each state government, the latter would lift the allocated quantities and carry out the distribution."While we are not passing a conclusive determination on the constitutionality of the current policy, the manner in which the current policy has been framed would prima facie result in a detriment to the right to public health which is an integral element of Article 21 of the Constitution.

He was a member of the Students Federation before joining the Congress.He was a member of the AICC from 1958 to 1964.Having been elected to the Assembly in 1960 from the Pathanapuram seat at the age of 25, Pillai quit the Congress in 1964 and formed the Kerala Congress (B) along with senior leader KM George.Pillai was the founder general secretary of the Kerala Congress (B).He won the election from his home constituency Kottarakara in 1965, but was defeated in the next two polls in 1967 and 1970.Pillai was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1971 from the Mavelikara constituency.He was a minister for several years in various ministries headed by C Achutha Menon, K Karunakaran, EK Nayanar, and AK Antony.Pillai's over six-decade-long political career saw many ups and downs.He had to resign from the ministry for his speech in the 1980s in which he had called for an agitation on the lines of the militancy in Punjab against the central government for ignoring Kerala's development needs.He was the first minister in Kerala who was sentenced to jail for corruption.The Supreme Court had in February 2011 sentenced Pillai and two others to one-year imprisonment for allegedly abusing their positions in the award of a contract for the Idamalayar hydroelectric power project during his tenure as power minister from 1982-1985 in the K Karunakaran ministry.From 2017 onwards, he had been serving as the chairman of the Kerala State Welfare Corporation for Forward Communities, with cabinet rank.Pillai is survived by three children.His son Ganesh Kumar, who is also a former minister, was re-elected to the Kerala Assembly as an LDF candidate from his family bastion Pathanapuram.

The mammoth mismatch has given credence to claims of massive under-reporting of fatalities.	Managers of two crematoriums and a cemetery in Bhopal said the last rites of 3,811 people, including 2,557 Covid patients from Bhopal district, were performed in the city last month. Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra has rubbished allegations of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government under-reporting the deaths in the state.	"Altogether, 2,052 people were cremated at our facility last month. As many as 1,654 of them had died of Covid," crematorium secretary Mamtesh Sharma said. "These 1,654 bodies came from Covid-19 designated centres in air-tight plastic bags as per the protocol to prevent the spread of the disease," he  said. The Bhadbhada crematorium and the Zada cemetery in Bhopal were initially authorised to perform the last rites of Covid patients in the district, an official said. However, due to the rise in the fatalities, another crematorium, Subhash Nagar Vishram Ghat, was also allowed to conduct the last rites, he said.	"The last rites of 1,386 persons were performed at our crematorium last month. As many as 727 of them had died due to the virus," Subhash Nagar Vishram Ghat manager Sobhraj Sukhwani said. Rehan Golden, president of the Zada cemetery committee in Jahangirabad area said 373 burials, including those of 176 Covid victims, took place in the burial ground last month.	The official death toll in Bhopal district last month, collated using the daily bulletins issued by the Madhya Pradesh Government in April, comes to 104. As per the government records, the virus has so far claimed 742 lives in Bhopal since the first case last year.

03-05-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Consolidating Muslim, secular votes worked for TMC||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, May 2The consolidation of Muslim and anti-BJP secular votes in her favour seems to have played the trick for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, whose party Trinamool Congress is all set for third consecutive term in West Bengal after registering an emphatic victory in the Assembly elections.Makes big gains in cong strongholds“The districts with strong Muslim population such as Murshidabad and Malda were traditionally Congress strongholds. But this time, they voted for the TMC,” said Biswanath Chakraborty, political analyst. In Murshidabad, the TMC won 17 of the 20 seats compared to one in the 2016 elections. In Malda, it won six of the 12 seats compared to none last time. The TMC has always had strong following among Muslims in south Bengal, including Kolkata. The consolidation of Muslim votes behind Mamata Banerjee ought to have set off a counter-reaction among Hindu voters, thus benefitting the BJP, but that didn’t happen.“A large section of the Hindu voters who simply wanted to keep the BJP at bay voted for the TMC because they thought their votes would be wasted if cast for any other secular outfit. Campaigns such as ‘No vote to the BJP’, launched by civil society groups and Left-wing student groups, seem to have helped Mamata,” said Suhit Sen, historian and alumnus of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed 16 election rallies in West Bengal after the poll dates were announced. Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, who participated in 62 events across 28 days, earned the sobriquet of “daily passengers” because of their frequent trips from Delhi to Bengal.BJP chief JP Nadda, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Textile Minister Smriti Irani too campaigned extensively.“The injury sustained by Mamata at Nandigram may have aroused sympathy among voters…. or may be her poll strategy of branding the BJP as a party of outsiders worked,” opined BJP general secretary and the party’s West Bengal in-charge, Kailash Vijayvargiya, when asked about the results.Praise pours in Popularity factorThe TMC won because of Mamata Banerjee.

It was backed by a video of oxygen cylinder-laden trucks entering the Philippines embassy on Saturday night.“The MEA checked with the Philippines Embassy. This was an unsolicited supply as they had no Covid cases. Clearly for cheap publicity by you know who. Giving away cylinders like this when there are people in desperate need of oxygen is simply appalling,” shot back Jaishankar to Ramesh’s query whether the “MEA is sleeping?” Jaishankar told Ramesh, “Jairamji, MEA never sleeps; our people know across the world. MEA also never fakes; we know who does.’’ In the second case, the New Zealand High Commission deleted its tweet seeking emergency help for oxygen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prevent-hoarding-mea-to-missions-247390

In the endgame it is not the might of the resources but the might of people’s support that wins elections,” noted Kishor adding that the grand old party has its own way of working and is not very open to suggestions.Of the 316 assembly seats the Congress contested in the five states, it was leading in only 69 at 7 PM as per Election Commission trends.That’s a strike rate of barely 21.8 pc and means nearly 8 of the 10 Congress nominees who contested lost.With Mamata Banerjee successfully thwarting the BJP juggernaut in Bengal, and all opposition leaders, including NCP’s Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal, NC’s Omar Abdullah, PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti and RJD’s Tejaswi Yadav, congratulating her, she signalled her emergence as the core of the new opposition unity.Congress veteran and former law minister Ashwani Kumar said that in the context of West Bengal, his party needs to introspect whether given the extraordinary circumstances, it was prudent to join the anti- TMC alliance.Although Surjewala congratulated Mamata for defeating a divisive BJP, the fact remains the Congress was part of the anti-Mamata alliance led by Left, which was routed in Bengal.  The Congress lost its minority base in Murshidabad and Malda despite allying with the radical Indian Secular Front (an alliance several Congress leaders had questioned).Knives will now be out in the party for Rahul Gandhi, an MP from Wayanad in Kerala, where the LDF scored a record win becoming the first government in 40 years to return to power. In Assam where Rahul and sister Priyanka Vadra campaigned principally, results were no better as incumbents BJP won despite an anti Citizenship Amendment Act narrative.“Today’s election results have several important take aways for us. The first: It is possible to beat anti- incumbency and that people’s judgment at the relevant time is the litmus test. Mamata Banerjee has been catapulted on the national scene as a dominant agent of political change who is destined to play a major role in the unity of Opposition forces in the country. Her grit and determination to put up an indefatigable fight against the full might of the BJP have won her the  people’s admiration,” Ashwani Kumar said.He also said that the election results have reinforced the relevance of regional parties and the absolute necessity of cooperative federalism.The Congress for its part would need to gear up for the G 23 backlash, with internal dissent set to gain prominence in the coming days specially with Surjewala today saying the party is committed to concluding the organisational election process by June 30, as decided by the working committee this January.The process will include the election of Congress president with Rahul Gandhi not looking like a very good candidate right now and demands for Sonia’s continuance already rebuilding.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/worst-show-ever-cong-shocked-by-election-results-247393

The vaccine prices for state government procurement and private hospitals are exorbitant and affect the vaccination drive. Unreasonable profit for medicines and vaccines are unjustifiable, especially during a pandemic,” said national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan.Suggesting that introduction of competition was the best way to lower prices, Mahajan said patent protection was the major barrier to the generic production of these medicines and asked the BJP government to “facilitate technology transfer of vaccines, including trade secrets, to all potential manufacturers to scale up the production of Covaxin and Covishield”. “The country needs nearly 195 crore doses to cover at least 70 per cent of the population. This cannot be fulfilled by two companies alone. There is an urgent need to bring more manufactures to start production,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-wants-vax-prices-slashed-247402
03-05-2021||Vibha Sharma||Weak state leadership hurt BJP poll prospects in Bengal, Kerala||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 2The BJP may have lost the prestige battle in West Bengal to Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee, the saffron party’s convincing victory in Assam and its making inroads into an uncharted Puducherry have given its cadres some reasons to cheer.What lessons party needs to learnThe BJP can also take solace from the fact that the NDA, led by ally AIADMK, gave rival DMK-led coalition a reasonable fight in Tamil Nadu which, many felt, was completely headed one-way. It has also done remarkably well in Bengal compared to 2016 when it won a mere three seats.The larger message for it from West Bengal and Kerala is that mere propaganda may not be the right recipe to defeat strong regional satraps. The lack of strong regional leadership seems to have hurt the party.“The BJP’s lack of regional leadership in West Bengal is visible as its sitting MPs have also lost. The fact is people vote differently in central and state elections. No doubt, it made an impact and emerged as an alternative to the TMC, but that has been at the cost of the Left and the Congress. Polarisation also has its limits. It’s not as if all Hindu votes will be consolidated in its favour. The BJP should understand this and rework its strategy,” say political observers.“We will do a thorough analysis. The aim should be to give a good fight, which we did in Bengal and Kerala,” the leaders say, dismissing the observation that results may be a reflection on either the Centre’s Covid management or the farmers’ agitation against agricultural laws.The spectacular victory of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata against the mighty poll machinery of the BJP has given its rivals a new hope to take on PM Modi, considered invincible when it comes to elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/weak-state-leadership-hurt-bjp-poll-prospects-in-bengal-kerala-247404

The DMK wrested Tamil Nadu after 10 years and the BJP-led alliance retained Assam while expanding southward to Puducherry.The Congress and the Left stood wiped out in Bengal with the TMC walking away with the cream and the BJP posting massive gains with 76 leads (a gain of 73 seats over 2016), dislodging Congress as the principal opposition in the outgoing Assembly.Read also: The woman in whiteThough the voters re-elected the sitting governments in three states, including Assam and Kerala, Mamata’s Bengal win stood out for its scale considering she not only firmly staved off the BJP challenge but also appeared set to better her 2016 tally of 209 seats.Mamata, however, lost her seat Nandigram to former aide Suvendu Adhikari, declared elected by a slim margin of 1,622 votes — a result for which the TMC demanded a recount.“Bengal saved India. This is the victory of Bengal, of India and of democracy,” a beaming Mamata said to cheering crowds even as she urged them to follow the Covid protocol. Positioning herself as the new pole of opposition unity and a harbinger of a federal front minus the Congress, Mamata went on to demand electoral reforms.“I will go to the Constitution Bench, demanding reforms. Three people in the Election Commission cannot run the Indian democracy. I hope other parties will join me,” said Mamata, signalling her national ambitions moments after top non-BJP leaders – Congress’ Rahul Gandhi, NCP’s Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav, RJD’s Tejaswi Yadav and AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal —— congratulated her for “defeating divisive forces”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated Mamata and other winners, having fought an aggressive battle in Bengal, where his “Didi-o-Didi” phrase raised several eyebrows.In Kerala, CM Pinarayi Vijayan led the LDF to the best-ever electoral performance since Independence and in the history of the state Assembly. Not only did the LDF become the first sitting government to return to power since 1977, it also logged the maximum seats. The EC gave the LDF 97 leads (a gain of seven seats from the last election) – much above the halfway mark of 71 in the Assembly.The UDF lagged behind at 41 leads, despite an aggressive campaign by former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, an MP from Wayanad. The Congress, which had hoped to consolidate its 2019 Lok Sabha gains in Kerala, failed to make any mark, with insiders already questioning Rahul’s poll strategy.In Assam too, a weak Congress-led alliance with the AIUDF was no match to CM Sarbananda Sonowal-led BJP, which became the first non-Congress government to retain power in the state history.In Assam, the BJP-led alliance had posted strong leads on 75 seats by 9 pm while the Congress alliance was trailing behind at 49, losing two seats from the last election results.The sole ray of hope for the Congress came from Tamil Nadu, where it ended up a small player behind the winning regional party DMK, with MK Stalin all set to be the next CM. The Congress was leading in only 16 of the 25 seats it fought in Tamil Nadu while the DMK was much ahead with 133 leads in the 234-member Assembly where the half way mark is 118.The incumbent AIADMK led by E Palaniswami also posted a significant performance after exit polls had written off the party with the outgoing CM consolidating his position within the AIADMK as the successor of the late J. Jayalalithaa.Addressing mediapersons at her Kalighat home in Kolkata in the evening, Mamata said her oath-taking would be a small affair.The NDA alliance consisting of the All India NR Congress and the BJP along with supporting Independents went past the majority mark of 16 seats in the 30-member Puducherry Assembly as per EC trends on Sunday night.PM congratulates DidiPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday congratulated West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on her party’s win in the Assembly polls and assured the Centre’s all possible support to the state government to fulfil people’s aspirations and also to fight the pandemic.

The Centre has identified more than two dozen nitrogen generation plants for production of medical oxygen.“In order to ramp up oxygen supplies, the government is working on converting nitrogen plants into oxygen plants. Potential industries where current nitrogen plants could be spared, are being identified and converted,” the Prime Minister tweeted after the review meeting. Government officials said the process of converting the existing Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) nitrogen plants for production of oxygen was discussed in the meeting. The government, in an official statement, said, “Many industries like steel plants, refineries with petrochemical units, industries using rich combustion process and power plants have oxygen plants which produce gaseous oxygen. This oxygen can be tapped for medical use.”It further said the strategy being used “is to identify industrial units which produce gaseous oxygen of requisite purity, shortlist those, which are closer to cities/dense areas/demand centres and establish temporary Covid care centres with oxygenated beds near that source”.Around 10,000 oxygenated beds are expected to be made available shortly by making temporary hospitals near such plants, the government said.“A pilot project for five such facilities has already been started and the progress is good. This is being accomplished through PSUs and private industries operating the plant,” the government said.The PM was told that around 1,500 PSA plants are in the process of being set up with the help of PM CARES, PSUs and others.

However, Election Commission could not confirm the result.The TMC has written to the CEO requesting an immediate recounting of votes, party sources said, alleging “tampering and mismanagement of numbers from the EVM and said the counting process was stalled from time to time and was not reported by the poll panel”.The party in its letter to the CEO also alleged that valid votes in favour of Banerjee were rejected while invalid votes for the BJP were counted.The TMC also described the refusal of the Returning Officer to conduct recounting of the votes as “bad in law and coloured”.“We are looking into the matter. A decision will be taken soon,” an official said.Meanwhile, Suvendu Adhikari took to Twitter to thank the people for voting in his favour and choosing him as their representative.“My sincere thanks to the great People of Nandigram for their love, trust, blessings, and support, and for choosing me as their representative and the MLA from #Nandigram. It is my never-ending commitment to be of service to them and working for their welfare. I am truly grateful!,” Adhikari tweeted.

BJP is a formidable force and will be,” he said.“..., in reality BJP will struggle to cross double digits in #WestBengal,” he had tweeted as early as December last year and his words proved prophetic.“If BJP does any better, I must quit this space!”, he had said.

03-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid crisis: Govt to set up 10,000 beds in temporary hospitals near oxygen plants||The government expects to make 10,000 oxygenated beds available in a short period of time by making temporary hospitals near industrial units which produce oxygen of requisite purity to boost the supply of the life-saving gas to fight COVID-19.Following multiple meetings held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday to review the COVID-19 situation, a statement said the government HAS also explored the feasibility of conversion of existing nitrogen plants to produce oxygen, and various such potential industries where the existing nitrogen plants may be spared for production of oxygen were identified.After a meeting on the usage of gaseous oxygen, the government noted that many industries like steel plants, refineries with petrochemical units, industries using rich combustion processes and power plants among others have oxygen plants that produce gaseous oxygen.“This oxygen can be tapped for medical use,” it said.The strategy being used is to identify industrial units which produce gaseous oxygen of requisite purity, shortlist those which are closer to cities, dense areas and demand centres and establish temporary COVID care establishments with oxygenated beds near that source.A pilot for five such facilities had already been initiated, and there is good progress on this, the government said, adding that this is being accomplished through PSUs or private industries operating the plant and with the coordination of the central and state dispensations.“It is expected that around 10,000 oxygenated beds can be made available in a short period of time by making temporary hospitals near such plants. State governments are being encouraged to set up more such facilities with oxygenated beds to deal with the pandemic,” it added.Modi also reviewed progress on the setting up of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants and was informed that around 1,500 PSA plants are in the process of being established through the contribution of PM Cares Fund, PSUs and others. He directed officials to ensure speedy completion of these plants, the government said.Exploring the feasibility of conversion of existing nitrogen plants to produce oxygen, another meeting chaired by Modi discussed the process of converting the existing PSA nitrogen plants for the production of oxygen.In the nitrogen plants, carbon molecular sieve (CMS) is used whereas zeolite molecular sieve (ZMS) is required for producing oxygen, the government noted, adding that by replacing CMS with ZMS and carrying out a few other changes such as oxygen analyzer, control panel system and flow valves among others, existing nitrogen plants can be modified to produce oxygen.“On deliberation with industries, so far 14 such industries have been identified where conversion of plants is under progress. Further 37 nitrogen plants have been also identified with the help of industry associations,” it said.A nitrogen plant modified for the production of oxygen can be either shifted to a nearby hospital or, in case it is not feasible to shift the plant, it can be used for on-site production of oxygen, which can be transported to the hospital through specialized vessels or cylinders, it asserted.Several senior bureaucrats, including Principal Secretary to PM, Cabinet Secretary, Home Secretary, Road Transport & Highways Secretary and & other senior officials, participated in the meetings.

The other provisions of IPC added in the FIR include Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life),” the police official said.Addressing the ‘maha panchayat’, Tikait, who is the national spokesperson of BKU, reiterated that the agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws will continue till the time these legislations are repealed.He asked the farmers to prepare themselves for a long battle.The BKU leader also hit out at the government over its handling of the COVID crisis, saying various hospitals across the country are grappling with a severe shortage of medical oxygen.Talking to the media later, Tikait said during the event, farmers were told that they should take all the steps to protect themselves from the disease.

It also has 15 newborns, he said."There are 50 people, including four newborns, on oxygen support," he said.The hospital does not have a liquid oxygen storage tank and depends on oxygen cylinders from a private vendor. "It has become a daily fire-fight exercise in the absence of a continuous supply. We require around 125 oxygen cylinders a day," the official said.On Saturday, 12 Covid-19 patients, including a senior doctor, had died at south Delhi's Batra Hospital after the facility ran out of medical oxygen for around 80 minutes in the afternoon.Several hospitals in Delhi continue to grapple with a shortage of oxygen, as coronavirus cases continue to spike every passing day.

This was an unsolicited supply as they had no Covid cases. Clearly for cheap publicity by you know who. Giving away cylinders like this when there are people in desperate need of oxygen is simply appalling. @Jairam_Ramesh https://t.co/G3jPE3c0nRMEA had checked with the Philippines embassy, said Jaishankar, and "this was an unsolicited supply as they had no Covid cases. Clearly for cheap publicity by you know who.

It was deleted soon as soon as the Jaishankar-Jairam Ramesh Twitter spat over the Philippines embassy asking for oxygen gained ground.Not wishing to wade into a political fight in India, the New Zealand High Commission deleted the tweet and put out another stating that it was trying all sources to arrange for oxygen cylinders urgently. "Our appeal has unfortunately been misinterpreted for which we are sorry," it clarified.Reports have spoken of hectic activity inside one of the largest embassies here with ambulances and PPE kits, there was no visual back up unlike in the case of the Philippines Embassy or the deleted screenshot of the New Zealand High Commission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-jairam-spat-over-oxygen-shortage-in-embassies-247247

03-05-2021||New Delhi||Adar Poonawalla says will return to India in a few days||Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla, who has been in the UK on extended stay to evade alleged threats in India over ever-increasing demand for COVID-19 vaccines, has said he will return in a few days.In an interview to 'The Times', Poonawalla had alleged that he had been receiving threats in India and that he and his family had left the country for London after unprecedented "pressure and aggression" over the demand of COVID-19 vaccines.In a late night tweet on Saturday, he said the production of Covishield -- the Oxford/AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine that is being produced by Serum Institute in India -- was in full swing at SII's facility in Pune. "Pleased to state that COVISHIELD's production is in full swing in Pune. I look forward to reviewing operations upon my return in a few days," Poonawalla said.He, however, did not give a timeline for his return to India.On his stay in the UK, the Serum Institute of India (SII) head said that he "had an excellent meeting" with all partners and stakeholders in that country.Indian authorities are scrambling for vaccines, medicines and oxygen as the nation faces its worst health crisis. The number of daily coronavirus cases in India slipped slightly, a day after becoming the first in the world to cross the 4 lakh mark.India's new coronavirus cases rose by 3,92,488, while deaths from the infection jumped by 3,689 over the past 24 hours, according to health ministry data released on Sunday. Total case load now stands at 1.95 crore with 2,15,542 deaths."I'm staying here for an extended period because I don't want to go back to that situation," The Times cited Poonawalla as saying in an interview published on Saturday."I don't want to be in a situation where you are trying to do your job and just because you can't supply the needs of X, Y or Z, you really don't want to guess what they are going to do," he had said, adding, "Everything falls on my shoulders, but I can't do it alone." In the interview, when asked about the impact of the 'Kumbh Mela' and the Assembly elections on the second wave in India, Poonawalla had said his "head would be chopped off" if he answered on such a "sensitive" matter.His comments triggered a range of comments, with some expressing disappointment at his move. Some even criticised him for stating in the interview that SII was planning to begin production outside India.India rolled out the third phase of its COVID-19 vaccination drive for those in the age group of 18-45 years on Saturday though the inoculation process failed to take off in some states due to shortage of vaccines.While Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir among other states and union territories launched the vaccination drive, Karnataka and Odisha made only a symbolic start to it.The interview to 'The Times' was his first comments since he was provided with 'Y' category security by the government last week. Poonawalla told 'The Times' about receiving aggressive calls from some of the most powerful people in India, demanding supplies of Covishield.That pressure is largely behind his decision to fly into London to be with his wife and children, the 40-year-old entrepreneur had said.The businessman indicated in the interview that his move to London is also linked to business plans to expand vaccine manufacturing to countries outside India, which may include the likes of the UK.Last week, SII announced a cut in the price of the jab it plans to sell to states to Rs 300 per dose after his earlier pricing of Rs 400 was severely criticised. That price compares to Rs 150 per dose rate SII charged for selling vaccines to the central government.Covishield is the most used COVID-19 vaccine in India. It along with Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is being used by the government for vaccination in the country.
