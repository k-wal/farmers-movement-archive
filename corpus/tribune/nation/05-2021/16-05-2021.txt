But with the increased gap, I simply cannot do without my medication for so long,” Phyllis told PTI.Earlier, the date for her second jab was on June 23, now she has to wait till August.Delhi-based lawyer Mishika Singh was also in for a surprise when she logged in to the CoWIN portal to find slots for vaccination.“My Covishield vaccination booking date has been revised (automatically) on the site itself. From 5th June to 27th July,” Singh said.Some also took to Twitter to vent their anger over the revised timeline.Kumud Ranjan Choubey wondered if there were new guidelines, then why had the CoWIN portal allowed people to book slots.The ministry had said “requisite changes are being carried out in the Co-WIN platform and would be separately communicated to the states/UTs”.The platform started showing rescheduled dates from Saturday night.Another Twitter user, Sahil Arora, said: “I got 1 dose of covishield on 8 May. My masters start in US in July-21 (sic). Now that the gap is 12-16 weeks, I will not be able to get a second dose.”Tagging the official handle of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Arora asked: “Can you please suggest the workaround for students in the same situation as me?”A government official said those people whose vaccination was due this month would not be administered the vaccine and only be given the dose according to the new guidelines.

16-05-2021||Vijay Mohan||Army to procure 50,000 bulletproof jackets for its frontline troops||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 16The Indian Army has projected a requirement of 50,000 new bulletproof jackets (BPJs) for its frontline troops, the procurement process for which is expected to commence in the next couple of months.The Ministry of Defence is expected to issue a request for proposal to vendors in June and the procurement would be done in phases over a 12 to 24 month period after all the modalities have been finalised and user trials concluded.The specifications listed by the Army state that the BPJs should be able to protect a soldier against 7.62 mm armour piercing rifle ammunition as well as hard steel core bullets fired from a distance of 10 metre.The BPJs required for protection against armour piercing ammunition, whose velocity is higher than that of other bullets, should weigh less than 10 kg, while the weight of those meant for use against steel core rounds should not exceed 8 kg.The jacket’s outer tactical vest should have the capacity to carry three magazines of the newly inducted SIG 716 rifle and the proposed AK-203 assault rifle along with other items like hand grenades, hand-held radio sets, tools, or attach additional pouches.Shortage of bulletproof jackets has been dodging the army for many years and in the past, the procurement process as well as trials have generated controversy pertaining to the source as well as the quality.In 2009, there was a shortage of 3,53,755 BPJs and procurement was not done for a long time. A contract for procurement of 1,86,138 BPJs, through the capital route, was concluded with a private firm in April, 2018. In February 2021, Minister of State for Defence, Shripad Naik, informed Parliament that out of the aforementioned order, 1,00,000 BPJs have been received so far. Some Indian firms are also producing BPJs for the armed forces as well as the police. Last month, the Defence Research and Development Organisation claimed to have developed a lightweight BPJ, weighing about 9 kg that met the qualitative requirements of the Indian Army.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-to-procure-50-000-bulletproof-jackets-for-its-frontline-troops-253773

Further, the beneficiaries are advised to reschedule their appointments for a later date beyond the 84th day from the date of first dose of vaccination,” the ministry added.The Union government has reiterated to the states/UTs that online appointments booked for second dose of Covishield prior to this change of the interval between the two doses of Covishield, must be honoured.It advised the states/UTs that the field staff may be instructed that, if such beneficiaries do come for vaccination, “the second Covishield dose must be administered and they must not be turned away”.They have also been asked to undertake awareness activities to inform the beneficiaries about this change.

Inspite of that pirated sites are streaming Radhe illegally which is a serious crime," he wrote.In a note issued to the media, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd said a complaint has been filed at the Cyber Cell, pertaining to the pirated version of “Radhe” being circulated across messaging platforms, including WhatsApp and Telegram."The officials are tracking down the phone numbers involved in the act of piracy, taking the required legal actions," the note read. The production company also appealed to the public to support the film industry in the fight against piracy."Films create livelihood, employment and a source of income for millions of people working for the industry." The note further said piracy is the biggest threat to the entertainment industry, which contributes towards the economy of the country in form of taxes paid to the government.“People engaged in spreading the illegal version of the film, are not just embracing piracy, but are also negatively impacting the growth of the industry and the livelihoods of the people working for it round the clock.".Prior to the film's release, Khan had appealed to his fans to shun piracy and watch "Radhe" on the right platform.The actor had said it takes the hard work of several people to make a movie and it "hurts a lot when some take the route of piracy to watch the final product".Directed by Prabhudeva, "Radhe" also features actors Disha Patani, Randeep Hooda, Jackie Shroff, and Gautam Gulati. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/salman-khan-warns-of-action-after-radhe-leaks-online-zee-entertainment-files-complaint-at-cyber-cell-253763

From May 16, all 10 weekly flights between Frankfurt in Germany and Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore in India will transit in Bahrain, it said.Instead of operating non-stop flights between India and Germany, Lufthansa had been operating its 10 India flights via Dubai so that the flight crew need not do a layover in India. Currently, the cockpit crew change happens in the Gulf country instead of India.Lufthansa Group runs Lufthansa airline as well as SWISS airline connecting India with Germany.The group's decision has come at a time when India and its aviation sector has been badly hit by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.During the last few weeks, the number of domestic air passengers per day has come down from more than 2.2 lakh to around 75,000, according to the Civil Aviation Ministry's data.Similarly, international air traffic has also been affected by the second wave of the pandemic.Lufthansa Group said on Sunday its flights to India continue supporting urgent relief efforts for the country."They have been delivering tons of medical goods containing vaccines, respirators and oxygen concentrators with more to come," the airline's statement noted.With 3.11 lakh fresh coronavirus infections, India saw the lowest rise in daily cases after a gap of 25 days, while the death toll rose to 2,70,284 with 4,077 new fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday.A total of 3,11,170 new cases were reported in a day, taking India's total tally of COVID-19 cases to 2,46,84,077. Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 last year.

16-05-2021||---||India Vision Institute wins prestigious IABCA Award for vision health||Naveen S Garewal  Tribune News Service  Hyderabad, May 16India Vision Institute (IVI) has won the India-Australia Business and Community Awards (IABCA), Community Services Excellence Award (Organisation) for working in the field of vision correction and providing free spectacles to the needy. The Indian NGO has helped the underprivileged in remote areas and villages, benefiting over 400,000 children and adults in 20 states in India. The Award was announced at the IABCA Gala in Sydney on Saturday with a citation for IVI appreciating its “achievements that have enhanced community spirit through initiatives empowering rural and remote underprivileged communities in India”. IVI’s CEO Vinod Daniel, said, “IVI is delighted to receive the award that is a recognition of our contribution to work in the primary eye care and public health sector in India. We are delighted to receive an award from a platform such as IABCA that is working to help promote the India-Australia relationship and people-to-people links.” In an interview with The Tribune, Daniel said IVI worked closely with governments in North India, including Uttar Pradesh and the Southern States of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Refractive errors among school children and cataracts among the elderly have emerged as a major cause for concern. Studies have shown that poor vision impact incomes and those earning Rs 40,000 to 45,000 could easily earn between Rs 1 to 1.5 lakh if they had normal vision. As part of a campaign supported by the Fred Hollows Foundation, some 35,000 students were tested in Uttar Pradesh, and about 7 to 8 per cent were found to be needing glasses.Similarly, a whopping 43 per cent of truck drivers in Tamil Nadu needed glasses, out of which 14 per cent for distance (myopia). The testing also found that 40 out of the 4000 tested truck drivers had a poor vision of over two diopters, which means they should not be driving. Nearly 15,000 drivers could not see road signals, and this he said had a direct correlation with the 1.35 million deaths on the roads. Giving out details about India, Daniel said the country accounted for about 62 million visually impaired people, and 8 million of them were blind. Around 41 per cent of children in the country (203 million) had an uncorrected vision, around 42 per cent workers (205 million),  Forty-five per cent (38 million) elderly and 42 per cent (7 million) drivers in the country suffered from uncorrected vision. Vision problems, he said, not only reduce the employee’s performance by 20 per cent but also adversely affect opportunities, job satisfaction, and job security. In a study of working men and women in India, wearing reading glasses were found to increase productivity by 34 per cent and workers income by 20 per cent. Further, poor vision multiplies the risk of falls and hip fractures by seven times in the elderly. Drivers in India with unacceptable vision were found to have an 81 per cent road crash involvement. 1,51,417 lakh people died, and 4,67,944 million were injured in road traffic accidents in India. Daniel said, “The Award will encourage us to work even more with our vision to Augment the Primary Eye Care Capacity of India and help children do well in their studies and adults work better and be more productive,”  Established in 2014, IABCA has accomplished significant growth on an annual basis and now stands as a flagship event in the Australian events calendar.  The IABCA platform attracts over 300 nominations from organisations, social enterprises, and business leaders from across the globe who are advancing the India-Australia relationship.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-vision-institute-wins-prestigious-iabca-award-for-vision-health-253752

The fungal infection mainly affects people who are on medication that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens.Dr Ajay Swaroop, chairman of the ENT department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here, said the use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 coupled with the fact that many coronavirus patients have diabetes could be one of the reasons for the rise in the number of black fungus cases again.He said the infection is commonly seen in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 but have comorbidities such as diabetes, kidney or heart failure, or cancer.

"We have rescued two; some bodies have been recovered, and rescue operations are on by NDRF with the help of the SDRF," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-to-strengthen-disaster-management-to-spend-rs-15-crore-253742

The first set of oxygen tankers have been dispatched to the beneficiaries.The Sterlite copper smelter plant was accorded approval by the then AIADMK government on April 26 at an all-party meeting to produce medical oxygen at its facility for a period of four months at the facility in Tuticorin.The unit was sealed by the state government in May 2018, days after 13 agitators who were part of a protest against the company over environmental concerns, were killed in police firing during a violent anti-Sterlite stir in the southern district. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-team-at-sterlite-copper-plant-to-help-fix-snag-affecting-oxygen-production-253737

16-05-2021||New Delhi||All hands on deck: Armed forces use veterinary corps personnel at Covid facilities||To augment medical care services to fight the brutal second COVID-19 wave, doctors and other staff from the Remount Veterinary Corps have been roped in by the armed forces, essentially to help run patient facilitation centres, officials said on Sunday.Around 18 officers, over 120 junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and other ranks have been deployed in specially created COVID-19 facilities in the national capital, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Varanasi and Patna under operation 'CO-JEET', which was started by the combined armed forces in view of the pandemic.'CO-JEET' stands for co-workers of all three services who will finally have 'Jeet' (victory) over Covid-19.Operation 'Co-JEET' has engaged personnel of the three wings of the armed forces – the Army, the Air Force and the Navy – into services like helping restore oxygen supply chains, setting up Covid beds and providing help to the civilian administration in their fight to prevent the spread of the infection.The Department of Defence has also created a Covid Crisis Management Committee.The staff of the Remount Veterinary Corps (RVC) will be used to help facilitation centres to provide information to the kins of patients admitted to the make-shift (Covid) hospitals, the officials said.Officers, JCOs and other ranks would be deployed at the COVID-19 care centres to help the over-stretched medical staff and provide timely information to anxious relatives and attendants of patients.Relatives and attendants have been making a beeline outside these makeshift facilities to get information about their patients, and have often engaged with the staff deployed there for providing medical care to the infected.The fresh deployment will lessen the burden on medical personnel, the officials said.COVID-19 is zoonotic, and the pharmacology and biochemistry of veterinary sciences and the human body is totally the same, they said.The Remount Veterinary Corps, which has a history of more than two centuries, among other things and besides veterinary services also takes care of disease diagnosis and investigation, and research in emerging diseases.The RVC also works round-the clock for prevention of zoonotic diseases.Zoonotic diseases or zoonoses are caused by germs that can spread between animals and people. They are caused in viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi.Coronaviruses are from a family of RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses and its infection is common in animals and humans, according to the Federation of European Veterinarians (FEV).The FEV in a paper had said that some, but not all strains of coronavirus diseases, can be transmitted between animals and humans.A wide range of animals is known to be the source of coronaviruses which include the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-COVID) that originated from camels and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that originated from civet cats.The fresh COVID-19 wave is being treated like war by the armed forces, and they have launched  operation 'CO-JEET' which encompasses psychological measures to allay fears and panic among patients, and augmentation of medical facilities to combat the disease.Engaging veterinarians to provide help to health care workers has been done in other parts of the world, including in Britain and other countries of Europe last year.In the United States, some states had kept veterinarians on standby to assist if needed, either by offering their medical expertise in hospitals or in mortuary management. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-hands-on-deck-armed-forces-use-veterinary-corps-personnel-at-covid-facilities-253728
16-05-2021||London||UK defends delay in adding India to red list travel ban as Covid-19's B1.617.2 variant spreads rapidly||The UK government came under strong criticism on Sunday for not adding India to the “red list” travel ban at the same time as Pakistan and Bangladesh in early April, which is feared as a major factor behind a rapid spike in cases of COVID-19's B1.617.2 variant first identified in India.Downing Street said it had taken a “precautionary action” to ban travel from India on April 23, six days before the B1.617 variant was put under investigation and two weeks before its highly transmissible subtype, B1.617.2, was labelled a Variant of Concern (VOC).According to the latest Public Health England (PHE) data, around 20,000 people travelled between India and the UK before the red list ban and around 122 of them arriving from Delhi and Mumbai between late March and April 26 were detected with the VOC.“Prior to India being placed on the red list in April, anyone coming to the UK had to test negative and quarantine for 10 days," a UK government spokesperson said.However, the Opposition Labour Party attacked the government for a delay in acting when the variant first emerged at the end of March.“This was not inevitable. They should have put India on the red list. We've had this three-week period in which thousands of people have returned from India, including probably hundreds of cases of the variant,” said Yvette Cooper, senior Labour MP and Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee.“When they did finally add India to the red list – two weeks after they'd added Pakistan on April 9 – they gave travellers four days' notice to rush back. Why didn't they introduce additional testing for those travellers before they were able to get on public transport home,” she questioned.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's planned visit to Delhi at the end of April, which was cancelled as the second wave of the pandemic surged in the country, is being cited by many as among the reasons for the delay in adding India on the “red list” despite higher infection rates per million than its neighbouring countries.It comes as PHE revealed that cases of the B1.617.2 variant being tracked and traced in the community had more than doubled in a week to hit 1,313 cases this week.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted the VOC identified in India spread much more rapidly and may soon become the dominant variant in the country but also highlighted that based on the cases in the hotspot region of Bolton in north-west England, the indications are that those who are unvaccinated are more susceptible to hospitalisation.He revealed that 18 people currently in hospital due to the B1.617.2 VOC have not had any dose of the COVID-19 vaccine even though they are eligible and urged all eligible over-38s to come forward for their jabs.“Because of the speed of transmission of this one, it can really spread like wildfire amongst the unvaccinated groups – hence we need to get as many people vaccinated as possible, particularly among those who are most vulnerable to ending up in hospital," he said.The minister reiterated that the government feels it is the right thing for the lockdown easing roadmap to go ahead as planned for now, with Monday's further easing of rules set to go ahead.However, a decision on the June 21 complete lockdown easing timeline will be taken on June 14, based on data over the coming weeks to see if the B1.617.2 variant “knocks us off course”."We need to be cautious, we need to be careful, we need to be vigilant and we've said – at each step – we will look at the four tests that we have," Hancock told ‘Sky News'."We've always said we want this to be cautious, we really want it to be irreversible. New variants are one of the biggest risks to this opening,” he said.The government, meanwhile, is deploying thousands of extra tests as part of a surge testing programme in parts of England to try to get a hold on the spread of the new variant. The vaccination programme is also being accelerated, with second doses for all vulnerable groups and over-50s brought forward from a 12 week to an eight-week gap.The British Medical Association (BMA) has expressed serious concerns about the decision to continue with the easing of lockdown restrictions as the B1.617.2 VOC could target the younger unvaccinated group much faster."It is a real worry that when further measures lift on May 17, the majority of younger people, who are often highly socially mobile and could therefore be most at risk of a more infectious strain, are not yet vaccinated," said BMA's Dr Richard Jarvis.Under Monday's easing, legally-binding lockdown restrictions are to be lifted to allow a greater degree of indoor mixing and more hospitality venues to reopen. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-defends-delay-in-adding-india-to-red-list-travel-ban-as-covid-19s-b1-617-2-variant-spreads-rapidly-253725

16-05-2021||London||WHO asks rich countries to delay child vax, donate jabs||Rich nations must delay their plans to vaccinate their children and teenagers against Covid-19 and instead donate the jabs to low-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) said."In a handful of rich countries, which bought up the majority of the vaccine supply, lower-risk groups are now being vaccinated," WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at a virtual conference in Geneva on Friday."I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to Covax," Ghebreyesus said.The statement comes as, last week, the US, Canada and Switzerland laid out plans to begin coronavirus vaccine shots for adolescents.The global distribution of Covid vaccines remains vastly uneven. Four of the world's high-income countries, with a population of 1.2 billion (16 per cent of the global population), account for 4.6 billion doses (53 per cent of all purchased doses). On the other hand, the low-income countries hold just 770 million doses, according to a study from the Duke Global Health Innovation Centre. The US is expected to have 300 million or more coronavirus vaccine excess doses by the end of July, the study found.The US, followed by China and India have administered the highest number of vaccine doses overall. But, a few countries in Africa are yet to get started on vaccination campaigns."The fact that so many are still not protected is a sad reflection on the gross distortion in access to vaccines across the globe," Ghebreyesus said. At present, only 0.3 per cent of vaccine supply is going to low-income countries. Thus, many low and lower-middle-income countries do not have vaccine supply to even immunise health and care workers, he lamented."Trickle down vaccination is not an effective strategy for fighting a deadly respiratory virus," he said.The global fair-access schemeACovax is co-led by the WHO, the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), with the UN children's fund, Unicef, as a key implementation partner, has been signed by 92 of the world's poor countries.The scheme aimed to first inoculate 20 per cent of the population in these countries starting with health workers."Saving lives and livelihoods with a combination of public health measures and vaccination -- not one or the other -- is the only way out of the pandemic," Ghebreyesus said."Covid-19 has already cost more than 3.3 million lives and we're on track for the second year of this pandemic to be far more deadly than the first," he stated.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-asks-rich-countries-to-delay-child-vax-donate-jabs-253720

Bachchan wrote on his blog.The screen icon has a personal connection with Poland: last year the City Council of Wroclaw named a square after his late father and celebrated poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan.The actor, who also shared that he had received the second and final dose of the coronavirus vaccine, said the consignment will be cleared by the Gurdwara Committee."These shall be cleared by the Gurudwara Committee where I have donated where I have donated in the building of the 400 bed facility and which was inaugurated the other day .. 300 functional immediately and the balance 100 in due time .. and the O2 concentrators shall also be donated to this facility for their discretionary use," he added.Last week, the veteran actor donated Rs 2 crore to Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur COVID Care Centre at Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib to combat the ongoing health crisis in the national capital. "These are the 10 litre concentrators, but research from my office informs me that the 5 litre ones are also acceptable and in greater demand .. so I have bought another 50 oxygen concentrators today of the 5 litre capacity, and hopefully they should be despatched to us in a few days .. these shall be distributed to the needy facilities in Mumbai," Bachchan shared in the new post.The 25-bedded care centre that he had donated for to be put up in a school in the suburban Juhu was ready, he said."The facilities are all in place .. and just today the relevant OC's have been obtained from the BMC and the Fire Brigade .. just one more permission is due to come tomorrow and with that the facility shall be ready to operate by Tuesday or Wednesday .. this is for the really needy and those that cannot afford the expenses required for their treatment." The actor shared that he was able to deliver the first lot of 10 ventilators to the desired locations -- six to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), three hospitals and one clinic in the city. "There is always a sense of satisfaction on seeing your efforts at giving to the needy and to those in distress," Bachchan said. "I give wherever I can .. my means are extremely limited .. it may not seem so, but they are .. somehow by the grace of the Almighty they come to me .. I have not made any effort to collect them through campaigns or donations to a cause that I may have instituted." He said he was not seeking praise for his philanthropical efforts, but has been forthcoming about giving description of the work done during this time "to assure all of the delivery and the visuals of where the funds have been used and to what avail .. that they are not just blank promises". Bachchan also wrote about Cyclone Tauktae, which is likely to pass close to the city."Cyclone Tauktae in the Arabian Sea intensifies along the Western Coasts of India .. from the South moving up .. the effects of its arrival have begun here in Mumbai with rain as I write .." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amitabh-bachchan-says-first-consignment-of-oxygen-concentrators-to-arrive-on-monday-orders-50-more-253719

16-05-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC for CBI or NIA probe into alleged killing of jail inmates in Chitrakoot jail of UP||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking direction for a CBI or NIA probe, supervised by the top court, into the alleged killing of three under-trial prisoners in Uttar Pradesh's Chitrakoot district jail.The plea filed by Supreme Court lawyer Anoop Prakash Awasthi has also sought fixing accountability and taking appropriate action against those found responsible.Direction for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into all extrajudicial killings that took place since March 18, 2017, in Uttar Pradesh after Yogi Adityanath took over charge of the state as chief minister was also sought by the petition.On May 14, three under trial prisoners, including a member of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari's group, were shot dead inside the Chitrakoot district jail after which the Uttar Pradesh government suspended two jail officials, police had said.The three inmates gunned down in the district jail at Ragauli were identified by police as Anshu Dixit, Merazuddin alias Meraj Ali and Mukeem Kala, belonging to Sitapur, Ghazipur and Shamli districts, respectively, in Uttar Pradesh.The plea alleged that in a mature, civilised, democratic and rule of the law based country like India, history of violence should be remembered and not repeated, but in Uttar Pradesh, a battle is being fought in its jails where the police, under the direct orders of the top of the administration is summarily executing the prisoners on frivolous excuses.“…this culture of violence promoted in the state of UP (Uttar Pradesh) militates against the basic notion of the rule of law where violence has become a collective enterprise to portray the authority of the government and obscure its failures,” it said.The plea said that the biggest worry qua the extra-judicial killings if gone unchecked is that the life of any citizen can be taken anytime by state agencies.“Any enmity or private dispute or quest of settling private score may lead to filing of few criminal cases in some police station against the undesired person, branding him a dreaded criminal within days, to be taken into custody as under trial, and fellow may be eliminated by being shot anytime anywhere by the police/law enforcement authorities on any false pretext like attempt of snatching a rifle or pistol of a fellow police personnel during transportation or even inside the jail”, it said.Awasthi in his plea said that this PIL is being moved for seeking an independent inquiry under the aegis of this court through the agency of the best serving officer of CBI or NIA into the latest killings that happened in the Chitrakoot district Jail of Uttar Pradesh.“The police version of the three killing happened on May 14, in the Chitrakoot Jail of Uttar Pradesh shows that one under trial Anshu Dixit from Sitapur lodged in Chihakoot Jail opened fire and killed two others in the jail and was shot by police in retaliatory fire," the plea state."It is interesting to note that in a video circulating in the media said Anshu Dixit is seen saying about the plans of jail authorities to kill him by some means through STF,” Awasthi's plea said.The plea added that it is further astonishing to find that the two other killed inmates namely Merajuddin and Mukim Kala were transferred to the Chitrakoot jail only recently on March 20, and May 7 respectively purportedly as “part of larger design behind the shootout”.The PIL alleged “the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has openly promoted the culture of encounters/extrajudicial killings and …completely forgotten the enshrined ideals of separation of power intertwined in the basic structure of our constitution and fundamental right to life under Article 21, and thus encroached upon the domain of punishment and sanctioning the taking of life in encounters without following the due process of law”.It said that a life can be taken only through the "procedure established by law' by following due processes through our judicial machinery prescribed in our constitution.“It is submitted that the incident of killing in jail or encounters is not the only stray incident. Few years ago, one Munna Bajrangi was shot dead in an almost similar dramatic manner inside the Bagpat jail of Uttar Pradesh. Vikas Dubey encounter happened last year is another example where this court intervened and matter is still pending”, the plea said.It said that there have been several hundred encounters with hundreds of killings in Uttar Pradesh since 2017 till date which is not only alarming but equally disturbing.

16-05-2021||New Delhi||SSB jawan alleges being ‘whipped’ by commanders; probe ordered||The Sashastra Seema Bal has ordered an inquiry into a jawan’s allegation made in a video clip posted on social media that he was “whipped” and jailed by his senior officers at a camp in Bihar recently, official sources said on Saturday.Top officers in the paramilitary force told PTI that while a court of inquiry (CoI) has been ordered into the incident by the Patna-based Inspector General (IG) of the force, the role of the jawan is already under the scanner in a case of “illegal” transport of wooden logs from the Valmiki Tiger reserve of the state to the residence of an SSB officer in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.Constable Arvind Kumar Jaswara, in a 2:21-minute-long video uploaded on YouTube on Friday, said he is posted with the 21st battalion of the SSB in Bagaha town of West Champaran district.The jawan, wearing a camouflage T-Shirt, alleges that he was “abused” and “whipped with a leash” by the commanding officer, his deputy and an inspector of the unit near the tennis court inside the SSB camp on May 7.In the video, the jawan is seen pulling up his T-Shirt to show injuries on his back and shoulders which he claims were the result of the assault carried out by the three officers.While the jawan does not state as to why he was hit by his seniors, he alleged that he was kept in a “unit jail for 2 days” and claimed he was made to sign on a blank paper.“I request senior SSB officers to save my life. I fear for my life...they will get me killed. If anything happens to me then the Inspector, Deputy Commandant and Commandant (of my battalion) will be responsible,” the jawan claims.SSB authorities said action has been initiated and the “present incident may not be exactly as it was made out to be”.They said the role of the constable is being probed in a case that took place in January this year where a Deputy Commandant-rank officer of the 21st battalion is alleged to have sent wooden logs that were purportedly cut from the Valmiki reserve to his residence in Lucknow on an SSB vehicle “without any movement order or authority when the Commandant (commanding officer) was on leave”.This jawan, they claimed, accompanied the vehicle with the driver and two other jawans and one of them even carried “his weapon and ammunition”, which is a serious breach of rules, they said.Later, when the commandant got to know about the incident he ordered an enquiry on May 7 into this incident of unauthorised use of vehicle and manpower and mishandling of weapon and ammunition, they said.The state forest department is understood to have indicated that there are alleged links between the jungle mafia and some SSB officials and that charge is also being probed, officials said.SSB officers said that the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) rank officer of Patna range who is probing the wooden log case and the social media video of the jawan has “found many loopholes in the story of the constable regarding him being beaten by the Commandant”.   “The jawan (Jaswara) has accepted that he has done all this (ferrying of wooden logs) at the instance of the Deputy Commandant who at present is temporarily posted to Jammu and Kashmir,” a senior officer said.The jawan, they said, is “now trying to cover his tracks”.Both the enquiries are now being conducted simultaneously and a “final report” will soon be submitted to the SSB headquarters for further action, they said.The SSB is primarily tasked with guarding Indian borders with Nepal and Bhutan and it functions under the command of the Union home ministry. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ssb-jawan-alleges-being-whipped-by-commanders-probe-ordered-253692

It will, however, cause gusty winds and heavy rain in a few places in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar.The IMD had also informed the BMC that Mumbai is not in the direct line of the threat of the cyclone. However, as it will pass through the sea near the Mumbai coast, its effect is likely to be accompanied by rain and strong winds.The BMC has asked ward officers to ensure hoardings do not fall on the road and to remove them if they fall. The 24 ward officers have been told to be ready with manpower and equipment and prepare shelter homes in case people living near low-lying areas need to be relocated, the official said.The cyclone is likely to move north-northwestwards and cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18 with wind speed gusting up to 175 kmph, the IMD said.On Saturday night, the storm was around 220 km south-southwest of Panaji and 590 km south-southwest of Mumbai, resulting in heavy rainfall, gusty winds and thunderstorms in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts.

While Cairn said it was “taking necessary legal steps to protect shareholders’ interest in the absence of a resolution to the arbitral award”, sources in the government said India would take all necessary steps to defend against any such “illegal enforcement action”.

The co-sponsors of the proposal have already requested the TRIPS Council chair Dagfinn Sorli to consider holding a meeting open to all members in the second half of May. The proposal can then be placed formally before the TRIPS Council meeting in early June.The waiver will ensure patent, design and copyrights related issues do not restrict the rapid scaling-up of manufacturing and also do not hinder the equitable and affordable access to vaccines and treatments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-steps-up-efforts-for-ipr-waiver-on-vaccines-253386

Lambasting the ruling Congress in Punjab, he said the creation of Malerkotla as a district at this juncture was “testimony to Congress’ policy of divisive politics”.Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab CMUP CM promoting communal discordWhat does he (Yogi) understand of the Indian Constitution, which is being brazenly trampled upon every day by his own government in UP? Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh slammed his UP counterpart over his “inflammatory” tweet on the declaration of Malerkotla as the 23rd district of the state, terming it an attempt to incite communal hatred in the peaceful state as part of the BJP’s divisive agenda in the run-up to the Assembly elections.The Assembly elections in Punjab and UP along with Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa are simultaneously due in February-March next year.Contrasting the communal harmony in Punjab with the alleged divisiveness being promoted by the Yogi Adiyanath regime in Uttar Pradesh, Capt Amarinder said the state of affairs in Punjab were in much better shape than those in UP.“What does he (Yogi) know of Punjab’s ethos or the history of Malerkotla, whose relationship with Sikhism and its Gurus is known to every Punjabi? And what does he understand of the Indian Constitution, which is being brazenly trampled every day by his own government in UP?” asked the Chief Minister, in a strong reaction to his UP counterpart’s tweet.The creation of Malerkotla was an electoral promise of the Congress, made during the last Assembly elections in Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/making-malerkotla-separate-district-shows-congs-divisive-politics-yogi-adityanath-253501

16-05-2021||Mukesh Ranjan||Mass shallow graves on banks of Ganga in Uttar Pradesh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 15Exposing the vulnerability of rural population to Covid-19, rain earlier this week in central and eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh led to horror among masses as it uncovered mass shallow graves along the Ganga in different districts of the state.Taking a serious note of the development, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has advised Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (the two most populous states) to immediately check the trend of burying bodies along the banks of the river as it could lead to further spread of infection.Hastily buriedEarlier, Bihar’s Buxar authorities had fished out 71 bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims from the Ganga, claiming these had come from the neighbouring eastern UP. Days later, several media reports suggested that thousands of bodies were found in the shallow graves in various UP districts. The reports claimed that the corpses were hastily buried along the banks of the Ganga in several districts, including Kanpur, Unnao, Ghazipur, Kannauj, Ballia and Ghazipur.Noting that the visuals of the spots were “disturbing”, a senior official of the UP Government said the state administration had taken a number of steps to arrest the trend.“These include giving Rs 5,000 to the next of the kin of the deceased persons, enhancing patrolling along the river by teams of the SDRF and PAC’s water police and sensitising panchayat leaders to ensure that people do not abandon the bodies,” he said.Brijmohan Mishra, a social worker and activist, told The Tribune that the main reason for relatives abandoning bodies of Covid victims was largely due to the highly contagious nature of the virus. “People fear getting infected so they don’t touch the bodies. Since the number of deaths is so high, the state support system appears to have collapsed completely,” he said.Mishra said when he talked to family members of some of the victims, they told him that they either didn’t have enough financial resources or felt stigmatised to offer respectful cremation to the dead.Sources in the MHA said the trend of dumping bodies was being noticed largely in four UP districts — Kanpur, Ghazipur, Unnao and Balia. Bodies were also going further downstream to Bihar from these districts. Both states have been asked to take immediate corrective steps, they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mass-shallow-graves-on-banks-of-ganga-in-uttar-pradesh-253433

They claimed that these bodies were hastily buried along the banks of Ganga in several districts, including Kanpur, Unnao, Ghazipur, Kannauj, Ballia and Ghazipur.Noting that the visuals of the banks of Ganga are “certainly quite disturbing, a senior official of the UP government said, the state administration is seized of the matter and took a number of steps to arrest the trend. “These include giving Rs 5,000 to the next of kin of the deceased persons, enhancing patrolling along the river course by teams of SDRF and PAC’s water police and sensitising village Panchayat leaders to ensure that people do not abandon their dead relatives,” he said.Brijmohan Mishra, a social worker and activist, told The Tribune that the root cause of such a trend of abandoning bodies is largely the highly contagious nature of coronavirus. “People fear to get infected with the virus and so they don’t touch bodies. Even the local authorities belong to the same social background and then since the number of deaths in a given time period is so high, the state support system appeared to have collapsed completely,” he said.      Mishra said when he talked to family members of some of the victims, they told him that they either didn’t have enough financial resources or felt stigmatised to offer respectful cremations to the dead.Both UP and Bihar share a long river bank of the Ganga of more than 1,400 km. Sources in the MHA said the trend of dumping bodies was being noticed largely in four districts of UP -- Kanpur, Ghazipur, Unnao and Balia -- from where bodies were also going further downstream to Bihar.

It also said the fungal infection mainly affects people who are on medication that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens.
