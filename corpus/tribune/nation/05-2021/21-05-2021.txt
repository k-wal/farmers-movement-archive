But before we reached the target, the government opened vaccination for all above 45 years followed by those aged 18 and above despite “knowing well that so much vaccine is not available”, Jadhav said.“That is the greatest lesson we learnt. We must take into account the availability of the product and then use it judiciously,” added Jadhav.Jadhav stressed that vaccination is essential but even after getting jabbed, people are susceptible to the infection.“Therefore, be cautious and follow Covid preventive guidelines. Although the double mutant of Indian variants is neutralised, yet variants can create problems in vaccination,” he said.“As far as the selection of vaccine is concerned, as per CDC and NIH data, whatever vaccine is available can be taken provided it is licensed by the regulatory body. And it is too early to say which vaccine is efficacious and which is not,” he added.

Political compulsions forcing P Chidambaram to raise such questions. By order of toolkit party I am sure. Certainly he’s privy to general knowledge that time duration between contracting COVID19 and recovery/mortality mostly exceeds a few weeks!” Vardhan said afterChidambaram asked why there were deaths over 4,000 a day if cases were indeed declining.“Is it because of lack of proper medical care because of shortage of oxygen, medicines, ventilators, hospital beds, etc? The Medical experts who are giving numerous interviews should answer the following questions: When the number of daily fresh infections has come down from 4 lakh+ to 2.5 lakh+, why is the number of deaths still above 4000 per day?” Chidambaram asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whys-covid-mortality-so-high-asks-chidambaram-harsh-vardhan-accuses-of-having-political-compulsions-256363
21-05-2021||New Delhi||Samyukta Kisan Morcha writes to PM Modi to resume talks over farm laws||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 protesting farmer unions, on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging resumption of talks over the three farm laws they have been agitating against at Delhi borders since November last year.Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over the three Central legislations.  The farmers’ body said in a statement on Friday it has again asked the government to reinitiate a dialogue with the protesting farmers.A government panel had met farmer leaders on January 22. There have been no talks between the two sides since January 26 when the farmers’ tractor rally in the national capital turned violent.“Today, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha has written a letter to the prime minister, asking for the resumption of talks with farmers. This letter touches upon several aspects of the farmers’ movement, and the ignorant attitude of the government,” the SKM said in the statement.It said that while the protesting farmers do not wish to expose anyone to the health hazards of the pandemic, it “cannot also give up on the struggle, as it is a matter of life and death, and also of future generations”.“Any democratic government would have repealed the three laws that have been rejected by the farmers in whose name these were enacted, and seized the opportunity to provide legal guarantee of MSP to all farmers...as the Head of the government of the largest democracy in the world, the onus of resuming a serious and sincere dialogue with the farmers lies with you,” the letter reads.The farmers’ body had recently announced to observe May 26 as ‘black day’ to mark six months of their protest at Delhi borders.Farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal had appealed to people to raise black flags at their houses, vehicles and shops on May 26 to protest against the contentious farm legislations.Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November 2020 demanding that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.However, the government has maintained the laws are pro-farmer.

The same benefits will also be extended to two Thai caregivers who died in rocket attacks.Although the Israelis took “her to their heart as one of their own”, she will not receive honorary citizenship, clarified Yedidia.The Israeli deputy envoy sought to settle the social media controversy over Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu PM not including India among the 25 countries he thanked for their support. She pointed out that these nations had “come out with full-hearted statements supporting Israel’s right to defend its citizens and condemned the firing of rockets by Hamas”.’India apparently failed to make the cut because its statement in UN organs had supported the Palestinian cause and a two-state solution besides condemning the rocket fire from Hamas.“We are always in conversation with Indian friends. It’s been getting stronger over the years,” she said while mentioning that Tel Aviv had remained in touch with Indian officials through the 10-day crises.The Israeli Deputy Envoy spoke on all three immediate aspects that had fuelled the violence in Gaza and said a small group of extremists were on “both sides” were responsible for the trouble.On the protests against the eviction of tenants, she regretted that private legal dispute was used to inflame passions and attack Israel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/israel-to-compensate-killed-indian-look-after-her-son-256343
21-05-2021||Kolkata||Bangladesh surpasses India on per capita income||Once described as a “bottomless basket” by US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Bangladesh is fast emerging as a bull economy, outpacing giant neighbour India in many indices of economic or human development.Bangladesh Planning Minister M.A. Mannan informed the country’s cabinet this week that the per capita income of Bangladesh has now increased from $2,064 to $2,227.Bangladesh’s per capita income is now $280 higher than India’s $1,947.“Our per capita income stands at $2,227 in the fiscal year 2020-21 against the previous fiscal year’s per capita income was $2,064. So, the growth rate is 9 per cent,” Bangladesh’s Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam told IANS.In 2007, the per capita income of Bangladesh was half of that of India but it will overtake the giant neighbour in per capita GDP once again in 2025 if IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook is to be believed.But what pleases Bangladeshis more is that they have left Pakistan far behind—a sort of sweet revenge for the genocide of 1971 in which three million Bengalis died and quarter of a million women were dishonored by the brutal Pakistan army trying to suppress the Bengali liberation struggle.“My father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took the right decision to break away from Pakistan in 1971. See where they are and where we are today,” PM Sheikh Hasina told journalists recently.Former Bangladesh Information and Telecom Minister Tarana Halim said: “Pakistan is a sinking ship because it developed a military-driven defence budget focused economy with substantial terror financing burden. Once the Awami League took charge in 2009, our leader Hasina focussed on human and economic development with strong trickle-down impacts. We have a stable civilian government and has benefited from good relations with India”.She rubbished some Western analysts who give micro-credit NGOs all credit for the country’s entire development success.“Micro-credit NGOs don’t invest in health and education, infrastructure and connectivity which are the real drivers of growth. Our government invested heavily in these areas and the country is now reaping the benefits,” Halim told IANS.Halim also said foreign remittances have grown into a strong pillar of Bangladesh with inflow of nearly $3500 million expected in 2021.“That is possible because our government has streamlined labour exports. We crack down hard on illegal migration because those who illicitly go abroad don’t send back remittance,” said Halim, rubbishing charges by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah that Bangladeshis come to India because they don’t have enough food at home.“We have achieved food security and a few hundred thousand Indians work in Bangladesh,” she said. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bangladesh-surpasses-india-on-per-capita-income-256341
21-05-2021||London||Mumbai-born Reuben brothers second-richest in UK, Hindujas third in 2021 Rich List||Mumbai-born brothers David and Simon Reuben held on to their rank as the second-richest in the UK with an estimated net worth of GBP 21.465 billion in the annual ‘Sunday Times Rich List', topped by Russian-origin UK-US dual national Sir Leonard Blavatnik with an estimated fortune of GBP 23 billion.In a preview to the rankings in ‘The Times' on Friday, the Hinduja brothers - who had shared the second spot with the Reubens last year - slipped to third place with an estimated net worth of GBP 17 billion. They are followed by British inventor-entrepreneur Sir James Dyson and family, who dropped from the top spot in 2020 to number four with a fortune estimated at GBP 16.3 billion. In fifth place is steel tycoon Lakshmi N Mittal, who added GBP 7.899 billion to his fortunes over the past year to climb several spots from his 19th rank in 2020.“He is spending nearly GBP 290 million on a pilot project to slash its [ArcelorMittal Group] carbon footprint, no small endeavour for a company that mined 58 million tonnes of iron ore and made 71.5 million tonnes of crude steel during 2020,” noted the listing for Rajasthan-born Mittal.“The Mittals' stake in the business is worth GBP 10.5 billion, up more than GBP 7.5 billion in a year. ‘The first quarter of this year has been our strongest in a decade,' Aditya Mittal said this month. Aditya, 45, Lakshmi's son, became chief executive of ArcelorMittal in February,” it adds.The second-richest Reubens have been found to have embarked on a buying spree during the pandemic, snapping up undervalued hotels and other properties. “The Reubens have been buying US buildings to upmarket brands that are unlikely to be damaged by the pandemic, such as Tiffany, Armani and Alexander McQueen. There have also been significant investments in Mallorca and Spain, where the brothers plan to build hundreds of luxury retreats,” notes the Rich List.The other Indian-origin entries in this year's top five, Sri and Gopichand Hinduja, of the Hinduja Group of companies, are listed together in the ranking but a family rift has also been flagged in the wake of a legal battle that emerged last year.“Cracks have appeared in the Hindujas' business empire, which has interests ranging from van manufacturing and luxury hotels to banking and healthcare,” notes the report.“London-based Sri Hinduja, 85, has become embroiled in a legal skirmish with his three brothers, Gopi (GP), 81, Geneva-based Prakash (PP), 75, and Ashok (AP), 70, who is based in Mumbai… Sri is claiming personal ownership of the Switzerland-based Hinduja Bank, which is overseen by his eldest daughter, Shanu, and her son Karam,” it notes.In June last year, GP, PP and AP Hinduja had issued a joint statement to say that it is "very unfortunate" that the proceedings are taking place.“They go against our Founder's and family's values and principles that have stood for many decades, especially, ‘everything belongs to everyone and nothing belongs to anyone". We intend to defend the claim to uphold these dearly held family values,” they said at the time.The annual listing identifies 171 billionaires in all, 24 more than in 2020. Their combined fortunes have risen to GBP 597.269 billion, up 22 per cent in 12 months despite the wider economic impact of the coronavirus.The other Indian-origin billionaires within the top 100 in the UK include metals tycoon Anil Agarwal at No. 15 with GBP 9 billion; Sri Prakash Lohia at 36th with GBP 4.783 billion; Lord Swraj Paul and family at 82nd with GBP 2 billion; and Navin and Varsha Engineer at 96th with GBP 1.7 billion.The Rich List's authors say changes in lifestyle brought about by the pandemic also helped create big wealth gains for internet entrepreneurs and online fashion companies."The global pandemic created lucrative opportunities for many online retailers, social networking apps and computer games tycoons," said Robert Watts, who compiled the Rich List."The fact many of the super-rich grew so much wealthier at a time when thousands of us have buried loved ones and millions of us worried for our livelihoods makes this a very unsettling boom." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-born-reuben-brothers-second-richest-in-uk-hindujas-third-in-2021-rich-list-256338

These outfits are the frontal organisations and were floated in pursuance of the Tactical United Front strategy of CPI (Maoist), the charge sheet claims.“The five accused leaders of these frontal organisations used to meet Akkiraju Harigopal, Advisor and In-charge, Andhra-Orissa Border, Special Zonal Committee, CPI (Maoist) and other leaders in the forest along with Pangi Naganna, who in the guise of a working journalist, was organising meetings and appointments with senior leaders of CPI (Maoist),” the NIA said in the charge sheet.During the meetings, the leaders of frontal organisations used to discuss their strategy for organising agitations, dharnas, rasta roko, and other activities against the government in order to spread Maoist ideology and to garner support from various sections of society for the cause of CPI (Maoist), the NIA said in the charge sheet.The case was originally registered on November 23, 2020, at Munchigput police station in Visakhapatnam, in which an accused Pangi Naganna was intercepted by Munchingput police while carrying Maoist literature and other incriminating materials.On his disclosure, a large cache of explosives and arms were recovered which were to be further handed to the members of CPI (Maoist) by Pangi Naganna.The NIA took over the case for further investigation on March 7, 2021, by re-registering its own FIR, the officials said, adding that further investigation into it has been continuing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-charge-sheets-7-cpi-maoist-operatives-in-for-conspiring-aiding-activities-of-banned-outfit-256332

21-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid: Delhi tech students develop Telegram bot to notify available slots to get vaccine||Two engineering students here have developed an application that sends a notification to the user about slots available on the CoWIN portal for coronavirus vaccination. The Telegram bot—"CoWIN alerts"—developed by students of Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) in Delhi was launched in May and has amassed more than 40,000 users since.Paras Mehan, a third year student of Computer Science Engineering (CSE), who is one of the developers, claimed that the bot has a user-friendly interface and is quite simple to operate. "The person who wants to book a slot has to provide their district name or pincode and their age group -- 18-44 years or 45 years and above. The bot currently provides information for 5,002 pincodes and 594 districts," he said. "The bot then updates the person via notification once the slot is made available on the CoWIN portal. The message has information on which centre has the available slots, the number of slots available, and the date of availability," he added. India opened registrations for its vaccination program for adults between 18 and 44 years of age on April 28. Unlike for adults above the age of 45 years, walk-in vaccination was not allowed. "The people who wanted to get vaccinated needed to book their slot on the CoWIN portal in advance. However, the portal ran into several technical difficulties. The slots often opened without intimation and people had to keep refreshing the website for updates, which was quite bothersome," said Rohan Rajpal, a fourth year CSE student. "As soon as the registrations for all adults opened up, authorities also opened up the CoWIN Application Programming Interface (API) to all developers. This is by far the most impactful project we have ever worked on. We are taking user feedback into consideration and improving it every single day. It would encourage more people to get vaccinated and hopefully help us tighten the leash on the spread of coronavirus," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-delhi-tech-students-develop-telegram-bot-to-notify-available-slots-to-get-vaccine-256328

21-05-2021||Mumbai||46% of businesses in India saw rise in fraud amid pandemic: Report||More than 45 per cent of businesses in India have seen an increase in fraud amid the pandemic, said a report on Friday.According to data analytics company Experian, despite the growing risk of fraud, 40 per cent of Indian businesses indicate that they are placing more emphasis on revenue generation rather than fraud detection, which can lead to an increase in losses and a decline in customer confidence.Considering that 56 per cent of consumers in India cite online privacy as a significant concern, businesses must take robust actions to safeguard themselves and their customers against potential digital risks, it said."India has now become one of the largest and fastest-growing technology markets in this world," Steve Griffiths, Managing Director, Decision Analytics, Experian Asia Pacific, said in a statement."Businesses need to build a digital infrastructure that is agile and adaptive to these changing dynamics," Griffiths added.While 90 per cent of businesses in India say they have implemented strategies related to recognising their customers across their various platforms—the highest among all regions surveyed in the global report, only 18 per cent of organisations surveyed in India are confident in preventing new types of fraud.To counter the rising threat of fraud, Experian has upgraded and enhanced one of its flagship products, CrossCore.The enhanced version of CrossCore cuts complexity, increases efficiency and helps businesses to quickly respond to today's emerging fraud threats, the company said."Experian's enhanced CrossCore presents an opportunity for businesses to put consumers at the heart of the relationship," said Neeraj Dhawan, Managing Director, Experian India."With the latest version of CrossCore, Experian empowers businesses by consolidating numerous fraud risk signals into a single, holistic assessment, enabling them to improve operational processes, stay ahead of fraudsters, and protect their customers," Dhawan added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/46-of-businesses-in-india-saw-rise-in-fraud-amid-pandemic-report-256321
21-05-2021||New Delhi||67% Indians find no harm in delaying software updates: Report||While cyber crimes are on the rise, 67 per cent of Indian users think there is no harm in delaying a software update, giving hackers ample time to break into their devices and steal their data, a new report warned on Friday.Once the users receive update notifications on their devices, 41 per cent usually postpone the installation of updates. The most popular reason is because users are busy at work (32 per cent), followed by options where users do not want to stop using their device at that moment (22 per cent) and almost a quarter (24 per cent) do not want to close the application. All in all, 67 per cent of Indian users see no harm in such delay, according to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. "While it is quite understandable that people would not like to get their flow of work interrupted by a software update, it is also necessary to understand the importance of regularly updating their software. A regular system or software update is as good as an immunity boost given is to a human body," said Dipesh Kaura, General Manager, Kaspersky (South Asia).The updates not only offer new features to your device, but also help in improving system or device security, fix software bugs, remove outdated features, update drivers and identify and correct vulnerabilities in the software by overall improving the functioning of the software, he added.According to the study commissioned by Kaspersky in April, installing updates is considered a routine boring task and half of respondents commonly snooze them. At the same time however, three-in-10 (30 per cent) Indian respondents admit that the time spent waiting for updates to take place can be used productively, and they are making this a reality in their day-to-day lives.Generally, users mostly prefer to shift to other activities while updates are installed. For example, when their devices are unavailable, 25 per cent of respondents tries to switch off and relax (watch TV or read a book), 11 per cent distract themselves by cooking, and 14 per cent prefer sports or going for a walk."It makes complete sense to switch to another device while the gadget you were using originally is going through an update cycle. Playing sports, cooking, or a little meditation could be a timely break from the working day, helping people to relax and reboot," commented Maria Namestnikova, Head of GReAT Russia, Kaspersky. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/67-indians-find-no-harm-in-delaying-software-updates-report-256318
21-05-2021||New Delhi||Tejpal acquittal likely to deter other victims from reporting sexual assault cases: Activists||Several women’s rights activists on Friday questioned the grounds on which journalist Tarun Tejpal was acquitted in a rape case and said the Goa court’s verdict would deter other women from coming forward to report cases of sexual assault and abuse.Some of the activists pointed out that Tejpal had himself admitted to attempting to assault the woman and tendered apology, and said the judgement is disappointing and demotivating.A sessions court in Goa acquitted Tejpal, then editor-in-chief of Tehelka magazine, of sexually assaulting a woman who was his colleague at that time in an elevator of a five-star resort in 2013.Women rights activist and cyber safety expert Akancha Srivastava said Tejpal himself admitted that he attempted to assault her.“Half of these cases don’t even go in court and those that reach court and are fought and then to have this judgement is extremely demotivating. When a person has already accepted that he has misbehaved, then on what grounds has he been let off? If he is saying he did, then he did it,” she said.“When we set precedent with such verdicts then we deter more and more victims from coming forward to filing cases and fighting it,” she said.All India Progressive Women’s Association secretary Kavita Krishnan said the judicial system lets down another woman and the survivor had to go through hell.“The judicial system lets down another woman. No wonder women do not want to file a complaint with the police,” she said in a tweet.Krishnan said Tejpal penned several apologies admitting to the incident.“Goa police took suo motu notice, got FIR filed. Since then the survivor has been dragged through hell,” she tweeted.“The hell of being yanked around by police, courts, repeatedly to Goa. The hell of having this case tied to her neck like an albatross. The hell of systematic slander campaigns against her by TT (Tarun Tejpal) and Friends. Her integrity being smeared in court and in social parties,” Krishnan said in another tweet.She said at the end of it all, the courageous woman did not get even a tiny taste of justice. Rape trials are deeply violent towards survivors.“Yet again, a survivor has been demeaned, humiliated, and let down,” she tweeted.Chhavi Methi of the Bharatiya Samajik Jagritik Sanghatan said the judgement was disappointing.“It is disappointing for the whole humanity because it sets the precedent that someone who has power can get away with anything without any repercussions for their actions,” Methi said.The Goa police had registered an FIR against Tejpal in November 2013, following which he was arrested.The Goa crime branch had filed a charge sheet against Tejpal, who has been out on bail since May 2014.He faced the trial under IPC sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage modesty), 354-A (sexual harassment), 354-B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 376(2)(f) (person in a position of authority over women, committing rape) and 376(2)k) (rape by a person in a position of control). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tejpal-acquittal-likely-to-deter-other-victims-from-reporting-sexual-assault-cases-activists-256316

This will offer a buffer to absorb the losses in indirect tax revenues that are anticipated in May-June 2021, related to the  impact of the now widespread state lockdowns on the level of consumption on discretionary items and contact-intensive services," said ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar."Moreover, high commodity prices at a time when demand and pricing power are subdued, would dent the margins of corporates in many sectors, compressing the growth in direct tax collections."

Last week, my trial lawyer Rajiv Gomes died of Covid.”  “Dynamic and brilliant, at 47 he was on the brink of a scintillating career as a criminal lawyer at the national level,” he added. He also thanked a group of lawyers, including Pramod Dubey, Aamir Khan, Ankur Chawla, Amit Desai, Kapil Sibal, Salman Khurshid, Aman Lekhi, Sandeep Kapoor, Raian Karanjewala and Shrikant Shivade.The Goa police had registered an FIR against Tejpal in November 2013, following which he was arrested.The Goa crime branch had filed a charge sheet against Tejpal, who has been out on bail since May 2014.He faced the trial under IPC sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage modesty), 354-A (sexual harassment), 354-B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 376(2)(f) (person in a position of authority over women, committing rape) and 376(2)k) (rape by a person in a position of control).

21-05-2021||New Delhi||1 in 7 corona patients hospitalised in India's Covid 2.0||On average, 1 in 7 Covid (14 per cent) patients were hospitalised in India, during the second wave, higher than the western world where cumulatively 5 to 10 per cent of Covid positive patients have been hospitalised.According to research by Goldman Sachs on the state of the pandemic in India it's difficult to ascertain currently if the delta is arising due to higher hospitalisation requirements driven by the double mutant variant or these are more precautionary in nature.  US Epidemiology data presented by FDA, from early December-2020, also did show that weekly hospitalisation rates reached 15 per cent in the US in the 2nd wave. Covid related hospitalisations are starting to dip but ICU occupancy remains high We have seen Covid related hospitalisations dip over the past week as case load has reduced and recoveries/discharges have increased. If we were to go by the US experience of hospitalisations where the peak was in early January, India should see a substantial decrease in hospitalisations over the coming month. Although the overall bed occupancy for all Covid beds has dipped to 65 per cent, ICU bed occupancy in key metros (especially in the South of India) remains critical, the report said. Goldman Sachs said Covid fatalities have disproportionately been among the elderly population (> 60 years) at 60 per cent. If we were to include the adjacent cohort of 50 years, this proportion rises to 80%, given the multiple co-morbidities this population also suffers from, the report said. The report said state governments have ramped up Covid bed capacity by over 3.3x in the past 75 days, led by higher allocations in both government and private facilities. In the 13 states tracked, Covid bed capacity rose from 146k in early March to 486k by the middle of May.  "We have seen Covid related hospitalizations in India starting to dip over the past week and if the US experience is to go by, we could see significant improvements over the next month," Goldman Sachs said. Drug and oxygen shortages seem to be easing, led by a combination of increased domestic production, repurposing alternate sources as well as expedited imports.Testing protocol has been diversified with the addition of allied testing such as C-RP, D-Dimer and CT Scans, to ease the load off RT-PCR capacity as well as serve as a cross-check given concerns around false negatives/lower sensitivity. Vaccinations have been targeted at high risk groups, which has yielded positive results.For instance, the case fatality rate has declined by more than half among those more than 50 years of age in the second Covid wave. This is encouraging, as vaccinations continue to roll out, the report said. The virus reproduction rate, which is a key epidemiological barometer, has fallen below the critical rate of 1, implying that infection rate should continue to decline. Apart from the unavailability of hospital beds, the second big challenge in April was the shortage of key drugs required for clinical management of Covid patients: Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. Most key manufacturers have stepped up production of Remdesivir and as per Ministry of Health data, monthly capacity has reached 10mn from 3.9mn in the beginning of April. Cipla also noted during its Q4 earnings call, that with additional capacities coming online, the demand-supply gap has narrowed considerably. India has also placed an import order with GILD for 450K doses and received 75K recently. We have seen domestic growth seen a sharp surge in April (+53 per cent yoy) driven by Covid-19 related therapies: Favipiravir/Anti infectives, Vitamins/Nutrients and Gastrointestinal. Although there was adequate production of oxygen in the country in the early part of April, only 15 per cent of it was logistically linked to be used for medical purposes. The 2nd wave saw a sharp surge in medical oxygen requirements in April as cases picked up, leading to an acute shortage at healthcare facilities. Government action included production rampup from key suppliers, diverting oxygen from Industrial to medical purposes as well as placing import orders from surplus nations. In the phase 1 of the vaccination drive, vaccination has been targeted at healthcare and frontline workers as well as population above 50 years of age or with co-morbidities.The Ministry of Health also recently put out data on fatality rates in 2021 (vs. 2020) in the 2nd Covid wave - the key conclusion is that in the high risk group (more than 50 years of age), the case fatality rate has declined by more than half.This could potentially be explained by the progress achieved on vaccination. India has currently 11 per cent of the population that has taken the first dose and 3 per cent that has taken the second dose.However, if we were to look at the high risk individuals that the government has identified of c. 300mn (Healthcare, Frontline and Population more than 50 years or those with co-morbidities), the vaccination progress is better. A 40 per cent of this group has already taken a first dose while 14 per cent have been fully vaccinated. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-in-7-corona-patients-hospitalised-in-indias-covid-2-0-256277

21-05-2021||Beijing||Dalai Lama's successor has to be approved by Chinese govt: China's white paper on Tibet||China on Friday said that any successor to the present the Dalai Lama should be approved by it, ruling out recognition to any heir nominated by him or by his followers. The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas has been subjected to approval by the central government since the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), claimed an official white paper issued by the Chinese government here.The document has also asserted that Tibet was an inseparable part of China since ancient times."In 1793, after dispelling Gurkha invaders, the Qing government restored order in Tibet and promulgated the Imperially Approved Ordinance for Better Governance of Tibet, improving systems by which the central government-administered Tibet," the white paper titled 'Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity" said.The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of "drawing lots from the golden urn" and that the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the central government of China, the document said.The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 following a Chinese crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet. India granted him political asylum and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh since then.The Dalai Lama is 85 years old now and the issue of his successor has gained prominence in the last couple of years due to his advanced age.The Dalai Lama's succession issue was in the limelight, especially in the last few years after the US has stepped up campaign that the right relating to the reincarnation of Dalai Lama's successor should be within the exclusive authority of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people. The Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (TPSA) passed by the US Congress makes it official United States policy that decisions regarding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama are exclusively within the authority of the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders and the Tibetan people.Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have been asserting time and again that while the institution of reincarnation of the Dalai Lama has been in existence for several hundred years, the 14th (present) Dalai Lama himself was found and recognised following religious rituals and historic conventions, and his succession was approved by China's central government.The white paper said by 2020, a total of 92 reincarnated Living Buddhas had been identified and approved through traditional religious rituals and historical conventions for temples in Tibet.Traditional religious activities are carried out regularly in accordance with the law and examination on scriptures and subsequent promotion in academic degrees are also held in monasteries on a regular basis, it said.The white paper termed the demand for Tibetan independence as a product of imperialist aggression against China.In the middle of the 19th century, the UK-led imperialist powers began to cultivate the idea of "Tibet independence," intentionally undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, it said.It slammed the Dalai Lama group for promoting "Tibetan independence". “Over the years, the 14th Dalai Lama and his supporters have continued to try to promote "Tibetan independence" by provoking incidents to jeopardise peace and stability in Tibet," it said.After the failure of their armed rebellion in 1959, the reactionaries of Tibet's ruling class fled to India and subsequently began to campaign for "Tibetan independence" by force”, it said.No country or government in the world has ever acknowledged the "independence of Tibet," it said.China makes it mandatory to adhere to the 'One China' policy, recognising Tibet and Taiwan as an integral part of the country.Beijing made the 'One-China' policy a prerequisite for countries to establish diplomatic ties with it.About the incidents of over 100 Tibetans setting themselves on fire since 2011 demanding the return of the Dalai Lama from his exile, the white paper said the Dalai Lama and his supporters have incited Tibetan lamas into self-immolations.It also blamed the western anti-China forces for continuing to interfere in Tibetan affairs in an attempt to sabotage its social stability.Justifying China's taking over of Tibet in 1951, it said with the peaceful liberation of Tibet 70 years ago, the people of Tibet broke free from the fetters of invading imperialism for good and embarked on a bright road of unity, progress and development with all the other ethnic groups in China.China is a unified multi-ethnic country with a long history. The Chinese nation is a community of shared future. Tibet has developed through the combined efforts of all the ethnic groups in China, it said.Rejecting allegations of curbs on religion, it said the province has more than 1,700 sites for Tibetan Buddhist activities with 46,000 monks and nuns besides four mosques serving 12,000 native Muslims, and a Catholic church with more than 700 followers, it said."Following the peaceful liberation, all ethnic groups in Tibet, united under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, have worked together and stood firm in safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity," it said.China is building a new modern socialist Tibet, it said.It also refuted criticism that the Tibetan language is being undermined to promote the official Chinese language. The Tibetan spoken and written language is widely used in Tibet, the white paper said.The study and use of the Tibetan language are protected by law. Tibet now has 16 periodicals and 12 newspapers in the Tibetan language and has published more than 40 million copies of 7,185 Tibetan-language books, it said.Tibet is also economically thriving and prospering in the new era, it said.All those counties formerly classified as poor have risen out of poverty, and the people are leading better lives in every respect.The system of regional ethnic autonomy has been fully implemented in Tibet it said.The average life expectancy in Tibet has reached 71.1 years in 2019 from 35.5 years in 1951, due to the development of health infrastructure, it said.               It also said the number of Tibetans in the legislature has increased.Of the 439 deputies to the 11th People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region, 289 -- or almost two-thirds -- are from the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities, it said.

21-05-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||After Shailaja, ex-journo Veena George to helm Kerala Health dept in covid era||Journalist-turned-politician Veena George will helm Kerala's Health Ministry in the successive LDF cabinet, replacing K K Shailaja at a time when the state is witnessing an unprecedented Covid-19 surge.Shailaja's non-inclusion, after she played a leading role in the state's fight against Covid-19, had created a flutter and various sections of the society including celebrities had batted for her reinstatement.George, a two-time legislator, represents the Aranmula constituency in the state assembly.Expectations are high on the 45-year old mother of two to match up to Shaialaja's work in covid management, although Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said that it was a collective effort of the government.Known for her leadership qualities, well-articulated speech and matured interactions, George's name was being widely speculated for the challenging post since the Marxist party began the discussion for portfolio allocation.With her induction in the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF coalition cabinet, George earned the rare achievement of being the first woman journalist to reach the position in the southern state.Wresting of Aranmula, a traditional Congress fort in Pathanamthitta, in 2016 assembly polls and retaining the seat with a remarkable margin of 19,000 votes in the April 6 polls were considered to be among several other factors that helped her to cement a cabinet berth.A surprise entrant in the poll fray, George had defeated her nearest rival Sivadasan Nair of Congress by a margin of 7,646 votes in the 2016 election.She unsuccessfully contested in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Her able leadership was widely praised during the time of flood relief in Pathanamthitta in 2018 and 2019.As a TV personality, she was the co-presenter of "Naam Munnott", the television programme in which Vijayan used to interact with a select audience.Before plunging into politics, she had a striking career in visual media for over 15 years as she had been an established news anchor in prominent Malayalam channels including Manorama News and Reporter TV.A mother of two, George was noted for her in-depth questions and political analyses during her TV media stint and won several awards also for journalistic excellence.A rank holder of MSc (Physics) and B.Ed, George began her political career as an activist of the Students Federation of India (SFI), a wing of the CPI(M).She also tried her hand at teaching for a short period before beginning the media career.A member of the CPI(M) Pathanamthitta area committee, George was given the challenging portfolio of Health when the Marxist party was facing severe backlash, especially on social media platforms for not retaining Shailaja, who had won global acclaim for her deft leadership in checking the Covid-19 surge, in the new cabinet.A section of international media had earlier described Shailaja as a 'rockstar' health minister.People from various walks of life including politicians, writers and celebrities have come out in open questioning the Left party's decision to drop the well-performing woman minister.But the party made it clear her omission was part of its policies to give new faces an opportunity. Barring Vijayan, all 11 other CPI(M) nominees in the LDF coalition government are first time ministers.By giving the health and family welfare portfolio to another woman legislator, the Marxist party expects to douse the protests to some extent.Besides tackling the covid pandemic situation in an effective manner, George also has an added challenge of showcasing a better performance than her illustrious predecessor in the state's health sector.Her husband Dr George Joseph, a higher secondary school teacher, has served as secretary of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-shailaja-ex-journo-veena-george-to-helm-kerala-health-dept-in-covid-era-256255

But we need more flexibility and automatic access for developing countries, and at the same time we have to protect research and development," added the WTO chief.The Trade Committee is set to discuss calls for patent waivers for Covid-19 vaccines on May 25.No consensus was reached among the members of the European Parliament (MEPs) on Wednesday regarding a proposal for a temporary waiver of patent rights for Covid-19 vaccines in a bid to speed up the global vaccine rollout.A resolution will be put to a vote at the European Parliament's plenary session in June.

Hopes of finding any more survivors are slim, but the search will continue as the sea is known to throw up miraculous survivors even days after accidents, sources in the Navy said.Legally, those missing cannot be presumed dead till there is evidence to support it. Such a search at sea is normally not called off till a few weeks. Of the 261 persons on the ill-fated barge, 186 have been rescued and brought back to the shore in batches. All those who have been rescued had jumped off the barge as it sank. All were wearing self-illuminating life jackets with a special prop to keep a person’s head above water.The sunken barge was engaged by the Heera oil rig, part of the Bombay High oil rigs, 70 km off Mumbai.The government last night ordered a probe into the sequence of events that led to the stranding of several barges and ships. Three barges and three ships associated with oil rigs went adrift on Monday. Other than barge ‘P305’ that sunk, all others are safe. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) on Thursday towed the drill ship Sagar Bhushan and barge ‘Support Station 3’ to the Mumbai harbour. All 297 men on board are safe. All 137 personnel on barge GAL Constructor were rescued on Tuesday by the Navy and Coast Guard helicopters.Meanwhile, eleven more persons are missing at sea. They were on tug-ship ‘Varaprada’. Two survivors, picked up mid-sea on the night of May 17, were brought to the shore on board INS Kolkatta on Wednesday night.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/barge-death-toll-49-26-still-missing-256135

The disease is mostly being seen among diabetic Covid patients on steroid therapy.The Health Ministry’s letter to states says, “This fungal infection is leading to prolonged morbidity and mortality among Covid-19 patients. The treatment requires multidisciplinary approach consisting of eye surgeons, ENT specialists, general surgeons, neurosurgeons, dental maxillo facial surgeons and institution of antifungal medicine Amphotericin-B.”The ministry has asked states to make mucormycosis a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act-1897, wherein all “government and private health facilities, medical colleges will follow guidelines for screening, diagnosis and management issued by the Centre and ICMR, making it mandatory to report all suspected and confirmed cases.Gujarat alone has reported over 500 cases.

Alas, the deadly Covid can force many to retire from life prematurely and Chani too succumbed to its fatal reach.National School of Drama (NSD) alumnus, though he studied theatre as deeply as his fellow students, the path he created for himself was markedly different. If as a student he was piqued by the question “theatre for whom”, as a practitioner he found an answer and decided to dedicate it to the community and stage it right in the centre of the people.Read also: As renowned theatre-person from the city Gurcharan Singh Chani loses his battle with Covid-19, his friends remember the man who spread smilesFree of all isms, his plays were for, of and certainly by the people. Non-actors, ordinary men and women became stars of his plays, where he would take a song, a line, piece of poetry, toss it around and turn it into a play.While the rich proscenium theatre that NSDians so excel in never fascinated him, rich literature certainly did. In his theatre of protest and provocation one could often hear the poetry of radical poets like Avtar Pash. Returning to Punjab during times of militancy not only required courage, but also conviction in his beliefs.As a professor of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, he could easily have chosen an easy way out and opted for cinema as many of his contemporaries did. But not only did his home-state beckon, so did his beliefs which later became his cause celebre.Chandigarh may have been his home for the past several decades, but as the Sangeet Natak Akademi recipient became one of the city’s most notable persons, world was his oyster. His documentaries on Indian arts and heritage, encapsulating the true spirit of India’s majestic forts and more have that rare archival value. More recently, his documentary series on North-East celebrated the region’s ethnic diversity and the vigour of the land.Donning colourful turbans like an emblem, his zeal never waned. Forever a communicator, his past few years were also dedicated to bringing cheer to the ailing children. Through his numerous clowning acts, he and his “CEVA Drama Repertory Company” spread joy and laughter in children’s wards in city hospitals.Till last lockdown he believed in living in the moment and now the moment has frozen. But not that endearing smile which never left his lips, not even when nearly two decades ago he lost his mentor and teacher Balwant Gargi whose death he did not mourn but celebrated by throwing a party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurcharan-singh-chani-artiste-who-spent-his-last-years-bringing-cheer-to-ailing-kids-256093

On rare occasion when she did attend, she allegedly tried to disrupt them, Prasad said in Delhi.Sources said the DMs of nine districts from West Bengal, including Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hoogly, were asked by the PMO to take part in the meeting.The DM of North 24 Pargana was slated to speak in the conference. But, Mamata allegedly passed instructions last night that none of the DMs should participate in the meeting, said sources.The DMs of 45 districts from nine states and their respective CMs were present in the meeting. West Bengal, the 10th state, was represented by Mamata accompanied by Chief Secretary and Health Secretary. However, her comments were not sought.Claiming she had gone to the meeting prepared to flag several issues, Mamata claimed the PM never asked about the availability of beds, vaccine or oxygen or about the status of the black fungus infection in Covid patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-allowed-to-speak-west-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-calls-pms-covid-meeting-insulting-255959

These children are left with the trauma of loss and no support towards a stable education or future. I am writing to request you to consider providing free education at Navodaya Vidyalayas to children who have lost either both parents or an earning parent on account of the pandemic,” Sonia said in a letter to PM.Saying there are 661 Navodaya schools in the country, Sonia mentioned that the schools are one of the most significant legacies of late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and that it was his dream to make high-quality modern education accessible and affordable to talented youth, predominantly from rural areas.She said, “As a nation, we owe it to the children to give them hope for a robust future after the unimaginable tragedy that has befallen them.”Backing the suggestion by Sonia, her son and former party president Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Children are among the worst hit by Covid trauma, many having lost their parents.

Central government officials really disappointed us. Your officials are completely insensitive. Instead of making elderly people rush to the (vaccination) centres, you (government) must reach out to them,” the court said.The Bench noted that the Centre’s expert committee was working on surmises by saying door-to-door vaccination was not possible at present, because of the probability that people might develop an adverse reaction to the vaccine.“Is there any scientific data which shows that because of a particular vaccine a person has developed complications? Where is the data that even a single person has died after taking the vaccine? The expert committee should opine one way or the other. There cannot be any ifs and buts,” the HC said.The court noted that in the United Kingdom, the same Covishield vaccine is being used and door-to-door vaccination drive has been undertaken there.The court also lashed out at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for filing an affidavit saying it would start door-to-door vaccination only after the Central government issues guidelines for the same.“We are very disappointed with this stand. We are aghast to know that the BMC has succumbed to pressure,” Chief Justice Datta said.The Bench said instead of being proactive on the issue, the Centre is now not permitting other authorities at the state and civic level to start door-to-door vaccination.The court further said the BMC was so active on social media about the good work it was doing for citizens, but it was not willing to start the door-to-door vaccination drive.“You (BMC) cannot discriminate like this,” it said.The BMC in its affidavit said the Centre is yet to come up with a policy for door-to-door vaccination and till date, the corporation has followed all guidelines laid down by both the Union and Maharashtra governments.“As and when the guidelines for door-to-door vaccination are issued by the Central government, the same will be implemented by the corporation,” the affidavit said.It said the BMC is trying its best to procure sufficient stock of vaccines from all possible sources to ramp up the inoculation drive in Mumbai.On Wednesday, the Bench said if the BMC was willing to introduce door-to-door vaccination drive for senior citizens, specially-abled persons and those who are bed-ridden or wheelchair-bound, then the court would grant permission despite no nod from the Centre.The court was hearing a PIL filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, seeking a direction to the government to start door-to-door inoculation programme for senior citizens above the age of 75 and others who are unable to go to the vaccination centres.

He also accused Mamata of not allowing the District Magistrate of 24 Parganas to speak in Prime Minister Modi’s meeting with the DMs and field officials today.The West Bengal CM has accused the Prime Minister “for not allowing” her and her counterparts from other states to speak in the meeting.Prasad said the Prime Minister was trying to understand the good works done by districts and collectorates during the pandemic. “Mostly she (Mamata) does not participate in the meetings called by the PM. However, today she tried to disrupt it. If the PM is talking to DMs on the good work on their districts what is wrong with that,” he questioned, calling her behaviour “shameful, condemnable and least expected by the CM of a state at a meeting called by the PM”.“But nothing better can be expected of Mamatadi, she rarely attends a meeting called by the PM. She has not attended several meetings in the past. You don’t attend a meeting that is entirely your call…but you come to the meeting and try to derail it, that is unacceptable,” the Union minister said.Alleging that all CMs have been “reduced to puppets” and are “not allowed to speak” during the meetings with Prime Minister Modi, Mamata said, “The meeting was casual and a super flop. We were astonished that the Chief Ministers were made to sit like puppets in the meeting. If we are not allowed to speak, then how could we raise people’s issues?”The CM said if allowed to speak, she would have discussed black fungus and vaccination strategy. She said she wanted to ask the Prime Minister about the extension of the interval between the two doses of vaccines. “If states were not allowed to speak, why were they called? All the CMs must protest for not being allowed to speak,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-mamata-after-she-says-pm-modi-does-not-allow-any-cm-to-speak-255809

Introducing outdoor air in offices, homes and larger public spaces is advised. Measures to improve ventilation in these spaces must be taken up on urgent priority in urban and rural areas alike, recommendations for hutments, homes, offices and large centralised buildings are given. Simple strategic placement of fans, open windows and doors, even slightly open windows can introduce outdoor air and improve the air quality inside.Introduction of cross ventilation and exhaust fans will be beneficial in curtailing the spread of the disease.In buildings with central air-management systems improving central air filtration/increased filtration efficiency is especially helpful when enhanced outdoor air delivery options are limited. In offices, auditoriums, shopping malls etc use of gable fan systems and roof ventilators are recommended. Frequent cleaning and replacement of fiters is highly recommended.Saliva and nasal discharged in the form of droplets and aerosols, by an infected person while exhaling, talking, speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing etc is the primary mode of virus transmissions. infected person who shows no symptoms also transmit the virus.

Apparently, the BJP is considering taking away the command of its just missed state from senior leader Kailash Vijayvargiya and passing it to Irani so that she can strengthen the BJP's  ground and also keep Mamata engaged by giving her a good fight in days to come.As a leader, Irani is someone who the BJP leadership believes has it in her to challenge the TMC supremo who managed to take on the trio of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda with her grit, gumption and determination.One of the conclusions the BJP has drawn from the recent elections is the absence of a fiery leader who appeals to the grassroots and also speaks the language of the local people. Irani, who has proved her mettle by showing none less than Rahul Gandhi the door in Amethi, fits the bill. She knows the language well enough to communicate her mind to the local people. She also campaigned extensively in the just-concluded polls and knows the state well.Another reason, of course, is women voters, a sizable number of whom seems to be inclined towards Mamata. The leadership believes this to be another reason for its below expectations performance in recent elections. Irani can connect better with this segment, the BJP believes.While Vijayvargiya has delivered well for the party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, sources say the BJP wants to press a refresh button in Bengal. It remains to be seen whether Irani is part of the strategy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/is-smriti-irani-part-of-bjps-new-plan-to-take-on-mamata-banerjee-in-west-bengal-255791

21-05-2021||New Delhi||49 bodies found, 26 more missing four days after Cyclone Tauktae sank barge off Mumbai coast||A total of 49 bodies have been found in the Arabian Sea near the spot where the ill-fated barge ‘P305’ sunk on the night intervening May 17 and May 18 as Cyclone Tauktae ravaged past India’s western coast.A DNA profile of the dead would reveal their identity.After more than three days of search by the Indian Navy and Coast Guard in extreme sea conditions, 26 persons, who were on the barge are still missing at sea.Hopes of finding any more survivors are slim. The search will continue for now as the sea is known to throw up miraculous survivors even days after accidents, sources in the Navy said.Legally, those missing cannot be presumed dead till there is evidence to support it. Such a search at sea is normally not called off for a few weeks.After a long search a certification has to be done, saying the missing persons are presumed dead. This certification is needed for paper-work by the families to seek compensations and insurances etc.Of the 261 persons on the ill-fated barge, 186 have been rescued from the sea and brought back to shore in batches.All those who have been rescued had jumped off the barge as it sank. All were wearing self-illuminating life-jackets that have a special ‘prop’ to keep a person’s head above water.The sunken barge was working at the Heera oil rig part of the Bombay High oil rigs 70 kms south-west of Mumbai.The government last night ordered a probe asking a high-level committee to probe the sequence of events that led to the stranding of so many barges and ships.The committee will probe the following: Sequence of events leading to the stranding and drifting of these vessels, and subsequent events; if warnings issued by Meteorological Department and other authorities were adequately considered and acted upon; if standard operating procedures for securing theses were adequately followed and lapses and gaps in the system leading to the stranding and drifting of the vessels.Meanwhile, three barges and three ships associated with oil-rigs went adrift on Monday.Other than Barge ‘P305’ that sunk, all others are safe.The boats of Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) on Thursday towed the drill ship Sagar Bhushan and barge ‘Support Station 3’ to harbour to Mumbai. All 297 men on board are safe. All the 137 personnel on barge GAL Constructor were rescued on Tuesday by the Navy and Coast Guard helicopters.There is no sign of 11 persons who were on Tug ‘Vara prada’, they are also missing at sea. Two of the survivors were picked up mid-sea on the night of May 17. They have been brought ashore on board INS Kolkatta, last night.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/49-bodies-found-26-more-missing-four-days-after-cyclone-tauktae-sank-barge-off-mumbai-coast-255751
21-05-2021||Singapore||After Kejriwal’s post, Singapore tells Facebook, Twitter to carry correction notice on virus strain||Singapore on Thursday ordered Facebook and Twitter to carry a correction notice to users of the social media platforms in the country over what it says is a false statement about a new virus variant originating in Singapore.The ministry of health said it was aware of the statement circulating online on media outlets and social media platforms, which implied that a new, previously unknown variant of Covid -19 originated in Singapore and risked spreading to India from the city-state.The move came after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a Twitter post this week that a new form of the virus that was particularly harmful to children had come to Singapore, and urged for a ban on flights.Both the Singapore and Indian governments have criticised the opposition politician, saying his comments were not based on facts and were "irresponsible".The correction orders were issued under Singapore's fake news law, or the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.Facebook confirmed receipt of the order and said it was legally compelled to issue the correction notice.A prompt on users' Facebook news feeds linked to a government website that said there was no new 'Singapore' variant of Covid-19. Neither is their evidence of any Covid -19 variant that is 'extremely dangerous for kids', the health ministry said.It said the B16172 strain found in many new Covid -19 cases in Singapore was first detected in India.Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Singapore Press Holdings' SPH Magazines, which was also issued the order, said it had complied and posted the notice in its HardWareZone forum.Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-kejriwals-post-singapore-tells-facebook-twitter-to-carry-correction-notice-on-virus-strain-255748
