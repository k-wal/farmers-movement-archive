It is expected to attract an estimated investment of Rs 10,000 crore when implemented in the selected 53 clusters. The clusters will be implemented through Cluster Development Agencies (CDAs) which are appointed on the recommendations of the respective State/UT Government, according to an official statement.The programme was launched by Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in presence of ministers of state Parshottam Rupala and Kailash Chaudhary. Senior officials of the ministry, including Abhilaksh Likhi, Additional Secretary, and Rajbir Singh, NHB Managing Director, were also present. Speaking on the occasion, Tomar said the programme will address all major issues related to the Indian horticulture sector including pre-production, production, post-harvest management, logistics, marketing, and branding.The programme is designed to leverage geographical specialisation and promote integrated and market-led development of horticulture clusters, officials said. The Ministry has identified 53 horticulture clusters, of which 12 have been selected for the pilot launch of the programme. Based on the learnings from the pilot project, the programme will be scaled up to cover all the identified clusters.Regarding its reach and impact, Tomar said, “doubling farmers’ income is one of the biggest priorities of our government. The CDP will benefit about 10 lakh farmers and related stakeholders of the value chain. With this programme, we aim to improve exports of the targeted crops by approx. 20% and create cluster-specific brands to enhance the competitiveness of cluster crops.”The programme is expected to converge with other initiatives of the Government such as the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund which is a medium - long term financing facility for investment in projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets and will leverage the central sector scheme of the Ministry for Formation and Promotion of 10,000 Farmers Producer Organisations (FPOs).The CDP has a huge potential to transform the entire horticulture ecosystem, improving its global competitiveness by building last-mile connectivity with the use of multimodal transport for the efficient and timely evacuation and transport of horticulture produce, officials said.

He was not diagnosed with mucorycosis, but he developed a fear for it after he got mouth sores, he said.The victim also left behind a suicide note in which he mentioned the reason behind his extreme step and expressed fear that he may suffer due to mucormycosis as he had just recovered from COVID-19 and also had diabetes."The man was scared as he learnt that the black fungus mostly targets those who had contracted coronavirus and people having diabetes. He also mentioned (in the suicide note) that the treatment may not yield any result and he would suffer due to that infection in future," Solanki said, based on the suicide note and statements of his family members.The victim was from a well-off family and his fear was more psychological than about his financial condition and the ability to pay for the treatment, the official said."Since he had developed some mouth sores, he was under the notion that he had contracted mucormycosis and may not recover from it. He went to the terrace of his apartment on Thursday and consumed a pesticide to end his life," he said.The police have registered an accidental death report and are conducting further probe into the incident, he added.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-survivor-ends-life-over-fear-of-mucormycosis-261207

31-05-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala Assembly passes resolution seeking recall of Lakshadweep Administrator||The Kerala Assembly on Monday unanimously adopted a resolution seeking Lakshadweep Administrator Praful Khoda Patel’s recall, becoming the first state in the country to express solidarity with the islands, where regulations over beef and liquor, among others, have sparked a row.Voicing concern, the House adopted the first Assembly resolution moved by the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in its successive term on the issue, with the Opposition Congress bloc backing the government.The members sought the recall of Patel and requested the immediate intervention of the Centre to protect the lives and livelihood of the citizens.The hard-hitting resolution alleged attempts were being made to impose “saffron agendas” and “corporate interests” by destroying the unique way of life of Lakshadweep people.The BJP slammed the resolution adopted by the Assembly against the central government-appointed administrator and said the House had no authority to do so.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had earlier written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting his intervention in the matter, while criticising Patel’s administrative measures.An archipelago located in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep is witnessing protests by local people for some days over the recent actions and the administrative reforms.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan moved the government resolution, the first in the 15th state Assembly, reminiscing the historic and cultural bond between Kerala and Lakshadweep and criticised the Centre for allegedly trying to destroy the natural democracy there.Stating that the future of Lakshadweep is a matter of concern, he said any attempt to undermine its unique culture and indigenous lifestyle is unacceptable.Anyone who upholds Constitutional values should register a strong disagreement against the actions of the administrator of Lakshadweep, Vijayan urged.Setting aside their political differences, members of the ruling CPI (M)-led Left Democratic Front and the Congress-headed United Democratic Front unanimously backed the resolution, except some amendments suggested by the latter.The implementation of the “saffron agenda”, rolled out in the name of reforms, began with painting coconut trees with the colour and has now grown to destroying the traditional habitat, life and natural relationships of the island dwellers, the resolution alleged.Steps have been taken to implement the Goondas Act in the islands, where the crime rate is exceptionally low, it said, adding such measures were in anticipation of any protests and to silence voice of dissent.“A dictatorial system of governance is being developed through these measures,” it said.Claiming that authorities also aimed at destroying the traditional livelihood of fishing, it said sheds where the fishermen’s boats and nets are kept have been “rampantly destroyed”.Through the attempt to exclude beef, which is part of the natural diet of the people of the territory, the Sangh Parivar agenda of banning cow slaughter was being implemented through the back door, it alleged.Thus, the administrator has now taken the lead in ‘annihilating’ the indigenous life and culture of the people of a territory inch by inch, the brief resolution further charged.Criticising the Centre’s act of giving the administrator special powers to intervene into the affairs of various government departments, the chief minister said it amounted to undermining the island’s natural democracy by deploying officials of their choice.Steps are being taken to abolish all existing democratic systems in the UT and impose bureaucratic domination there.The move to bar those with more than two children from contesting in panchayat elections is unheard of in the country, he said, adding that with its implementation, the vast majority of the islanders would lose their democratic rights.“The recent developments in Lakshadweep should be seen as a practical laboratory of the Sangh Parivar agenda. They are attempting to change the culture, language, lifestyle and food habits of people of the country in tune with their ideology,” Vijayan alleged.They are also taking steps to disrupt the livelihood of the people and give a red carpet welcome to the corporates, he charged.Strong resistance should be raised against this bid to enslave people of a territory to “corporate interests and Hindutva politics”, he added.Stating that the Centre has the responsibility to ensure that the unique characteristics of the union territory and the native people are well-preserved, the Left veteran said the administrator, who posed a challenge to this, should be stripped of his responsibilities.Leader of the Opposition VD Satheesan backed the resolution and said the agenda, being implemented by Patel under the garb of reforms, should be thrown into the Arabian Sea.The Congress and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) urged the government to directly criticise the BJP-NDA government at the Centre in the resolution.Meanwhile, BJP state chief K Surendran slammed the resolution adopted by the House against the Central government appointed administrator and said it had no authority to do so.Terming the government action to come up with the resolution as “ridiculous”, he said the House was being misused for political purposes.It was not right to use the floor of the House for political gains, Surendran said, adding that if the people of Lakshadweep had any complaint, they could approach either the union government or the court.The BJP has no member in the present state assembly.Patel has come under intense criticism, as the administration’s move to allow sale of liquor in the islands dominated by Muslims and enforcing cow slaughter ban have met with strong criticism from political parties including the Congress, CPI (M), and the NCP.The under fire administration has rejected the allegations and has said it was laying the foundation for the future of islands in a planned way and to develop it on the lines of Maldives in two decades.Lakshadweep District Collector S Asker Ali had last week said those who are having vested interests and those involved in illegal business were carrying out propaganda against the administration. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-assembly-passes-resolution-seeking-recall-of-lakshadweep-administrator-261196
31-05-2021||New Delhi||Twitter has to comply with new IT rules for digital media, says HC||Twitter has to comply with the new Information Technology Rules for digital media if they have not been stayed, the Delhi High Court said on Monday.Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to the Centre and social media platform Twitter seeking their stand on a plea by a lawyer, Amit Acharya, claiming non-compliance of the rules by it.While Twitter claimed before the court that it has complied with the rules and appointed a resident grievance officer, the central government disputed the claim."They have to follow it (rules), if it has not been stayed," the court said.In his plea, filed through advocate Akash Vajpai and Manish Kumar, Acharya said that he came to know about the alleged non-compliance when he tried to lodge a complaint against a couple of tweets.During the hearing, central government standing counsel Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj told the court that Twitter has not complied with the rules.Acharya, in his plea, said that the new IT Rules took effect from February 25 and the Centre had given three months to every social media intermediary, including Twitter, to comply with them.He contended that the three-month period got over on May 25, but no resident grievance officer was appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform.The petition has sought a direction to Twitter to appoint a resident grievance officer without further delay. It has also sought a direction to the Centre to ensure that the IT rules are complied with.Twitter had recently said it was committed to India as a vital market, but criticised the new IT rules and regulations, saying they "inhibit free, open public conversation".Responding to Twitter's comments, the Centre had said the social media platform was levelling baseless and false allegations to defame India and dictating terms to the world's largest democracy.The Centre alleged that Twitter refused to comply with new digital rules requiring identification of the originator of a flagged message and appointing grievance redressal officers and the purported commitment of the US-based firm to India not only sounds hollow but completely self-serving.Under the new digital rules, social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter have been asked to identify within 36 hours the originator of a flagged message as well as conduct additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer.

31-05-2021||New Delhi||Delhi man turns his car into ‘emergency response vehicle’ to help COVID patients||A Delhi resident has turned his car into what he calls an ‘emergency response vehicle’ to help COVID patients amid the second wave of the pandemic.Nagia, who is working at an IT company in Noida, has equipped his car with all the necessary equipment like oxygen cylinders, medicines, oximeter, food, water, and oxygen cans.Talking to ANI, Nagia said, “It has been one month now since I started this service. I am trying to help people in need by providing a variety of help and support. I have converted my car into an ambulance. I have provided transport to around 23 COVID positive patients to different hospitals free of cost.”“It started in April. I was helping one of my neighbours as they needed oxygen. There was no oxygen cylinder available in the market at that time. Somehow, we arranged an oxygen cylinder from a Gurudwara in Rajouri Garden,” he said.“When I was going all the way from East Delhi to Rajouri Garden, I saw I am not the only one who is struggling for oxygen. Like me, there were hundreds of people who were going with cylinders in their cars, autos and cycles as well in search of oxygen. The idea popped up in my mind as I thought since I am working from home these days I have some time to devote to helping people,” Nagia explained the inspiration behind the move.He said that now since COVID-19 cases have decreased and there is a lesser demand for oxygen cylinders.“I am serving policemen and families with free clean drinking water and food as well. I have even provided costly medicines to multiple families free of cost. I have spent almost a month mostly in my car, away from my family and kids just to serve people who are facing issues,” he said.Nagia said that he has not sought any help from anyone but he received small funds from a couple of people.“They wanted me to donate this fund specifically for covering bodies. I gave that fund to NGOs, who were helping in cremation and funerals. Whatever I am doing with my car, I am doing it with my pocket,” he added.

31-05-2021||New Delhi [India]||Delhi Police initiate action in another case against wrestler Sushil Kumar||The Delhi Police have started taking action in another case registered against wrestler Sushil Kumar in September last year by a grocery shop owner in Delhi who has accused the wrestler and his associates of beating him up at Chhatrasal Stadium for asking for payments of dues, according to police.The complaint was lodged by Satish Goyal, who runs a grocery shop in the Model Town area of the national capital. In his complaint, Goyal had alleged that he was beaten badly by wrestler Sushil Kumar and his associates at Chhatrasal Stadium for asking for payments for the dues, according to police.Speaking to ANI, Goyal said, “The ration for the stadium used to be supplied from my shop. Around 300 children lived before the lockdown. All the rations for them used to go from my shop. My money was due before the last lockdown. Virendra ji, who used to be the coach was transferred a couple of days before the lockdown. A new coach Ashok Kumar replaced him. He said that the money will be paid when the children come. He kept postponing it for two months.”  Goyal said coach Ashok later took the due slip from him and made a calculation of Rs 4,05,950. Ashok had promised to make the payments but it was not made.Goyal further said he was called to the stadium by an associate of Sushil Kumar one day.“When I reached there, Sushil Kumar and 30-40 wrestlers were standing with him. He asked me the whole thing and then refused to pay. Then I said I would die if do not get the payment. Soon after this, Sushil Kumar and other wrestlers beat me heavily. After the assault, I felt I should die by jumping to the Yamuna. What to do with such a life if you are beaten up just for demanding your own money,” explained Goyal.Goyal then complained with the Model Town Police Station. However, no action was taken at that time due to Sushil Kumar’s influence.“I lodged a complaint against Sushil Kumar and his associates in September last year. But, then the police did not take action. Now that Sushil Kumar has been arrested in connection with the murder, police have asked me to record the statement. The truth is that I have not paid a single penny so far,” added Goyal.The 38-year-old wrestler, Sushil Kumar, a prime suspect in the murder case of wrestler Sagar Dhankar was arrested by a team of Special Cell, Delhi Police recently in the Mundka area of the national capital.A non-bailable warrant was issued against Kumar and others in the case relating to the alleged killing of Sagar Dhankar at Chhatrasal Stadium on May 4.

31-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid restrictions in Maharashtra extended till June 15||The Maharashtra government has extended the lockdown-like curbs till June 15 and also announced that relaxations will be granted depending upon the Covid-19 positivity rate and availability of oxygen beds.In municipal corporations or regions of districts with less than 10 per cent COVID-19 positivity rate and where the availability of occupied oxygen beds will be less than 40 per cent, all the establishments/shops engaged in essential commodities and services that are presently opened from 7 am to 11 am can now remain open from 7 am to 2 pm, the government said in an order on late Sunday.For districts and corporations having more than a 20 per cent positivity rate and where over 75 per cent of oxygen beds are occupied, the borders of such districts will be closed and no person will be allowed to enter or exit in such districts.The exceptions will be death from a family, medical reason and emergency services or services related to such situations.Instead of implementing the ‘Break the chain’ order uniformly in the state, the restrictions will now be relaxed or made more stringent till 7 amof June 15 by taking into account the positivity rate in the municipality jurisdiction and areas of districts, and the availability of oxygen beds at various places, the government said.As per the census of 2011, the municipal corporations that are having a population of more than 10 lakh will be considered as the independent administrative unit for curbing the spread of Covid-19.Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivali, VasaiVirar, Pune, PimpriChinchwad, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik corporations will be treated as the administrative units.Barring the jurisdiction of these corporations, the rest of the part of the district will be counted as a separate administrative unit, it said.The decision for keeping open all the shops and establishments that do not fall in the essential category will be taken by the local disaster management authority (LDMA) but their timings will be at uniformity with those shops and establishment falling in the essential group, as per the order.Similarly, the shops will remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays.In such regions, along with the essential commodities, the non-essential goods and services can also be distributed through the e-commerce system.However after 3 pm, except for medical services and medical-related emergency, there will be restrictions on commuting and traffic, it said.Besides the offices that are working for the pandemic-related services, all other government offices can function with the attendance of 25 per cent of employees.If the chief of any of these departments needs the attendance of more than 25 per cent, they can take permission from the disaster management authority, the order said.All the agricultural work and equipment-related shops will be open on the working days till 2 pm.Considering the monsoon and sowing period, the local disaster management authority can give the permission to increase the timings of such agriculture-related goods and service providers or can also give a nod to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays, the order said.Addressing the people of the state through social media, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said the daily coronavirus case count in the state is on the decline, but these numbers are close to the last year’s peak levels.Thackeray announced that the lockdown-like restrictions currently in force in the state since mid-April, have been extended by a fortnight till June 15.He said he was taking a district-wise review of the coronavirus situation and curbs will be made stricter where thenumbers are on the rise, while some relaxations will be given where the case count is on the decline.As of Sunday, Maharashtra’s tally of COVID-19 cases stood at 57,31,815 and the overall death toll is 94,844.

He was a defender of civil liberties during the tough Emergency era. He played a crucial role in some of the most iconic cases which have defined the legal landscape of this great nation,” the CJI said, heaping praise on the departed legal giant.The CJI, several judges and senior lawyers spoke at a memorial organised in remembrance of Sorabjee, who passed away on April 30 due to Covid-19 at the age of 91.Recalling how Sorabjee assisted veteran senior lawyer Nani Palkhivala in the Golaknath and Kesavananda Bharati cases, CJI Ramana said, “The true tribute to Sorabjee would be to continue to uphold fundamental rights and freedoms that are essential for human existence in a civilised society.”“Apart from his courtroom genius, Soli was an epitome of grace, modesty, humility, integrity and kindness, which always stood out to me…Though he has passed into the realm of the immortal, his memory will endure. We have lost a great soul but we shall continue to remember the great human qualities he possessed which can help us through these difficult times. His spirit and confidence in the constitutional ethos of this country and his never-ending quest for justice should be our guide,” the CJI said.Justice DY Chandrachud described Sorabjee as his mentor on whose advice he accepted judgeship in 1998. “I accepted that advice...and I have never regretted it even for a day,” he said.Besides the CJI and Justice Chandrachud, Justice UU Lalit and senior advocates Arvind Datar, Harish Salve and Gopal Subramanium recalled their association with the veteran jurist.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-judges-pay-tribute-to-jurist-soli-sorabjee-260985

Recently, 15 contracts worth more than Rs 16,000 crore have been concluded under normal schemes of procurement and 44 contracts worth Rs 5,000 crore have been concluded in 2020-21 under emergency procurements,” Gen Naravane said.“A number of capital acquisition proposals too are underway concurrently,” the Chief of Army Staff said. He was replying to a question on whether the much-needed modernisation of the Army has been impacted due to the need for allocation of greater resources to keep a large number of troops for guarding the LAC in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere in the wake of the standoff since last one year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modernisation-of-army-on-course-naravane-260987

Her reference to the fued, though has no direct mention of the AIADMK or its leadership, it is seen as a pointer to alleged differences between top two leaders, K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam.Confidante of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, Sasikala’s brief conversation with two of her loyalists over phone has surfaced and this has dropped hints about her rethink. In the first audio clip, she could be heard saying, “we will for sure streamline the party...certainly, I will come”. In the second, she could be heard telling the supporter that the party, apparently a reference to AIADMK, was built through hard work of leaders including her and it was anguishing to see “them fighting”, and she could not be a mute spectator to the party getting ruined due to it. Hence, Sasikala said she would come soon and meet supporters after the second wave of coronavirus faded.

In another Twitter swipe at the PM he said: “Be grateful to PM Cares for the promise of free education which is a right guaranteed by the Constitution and Right to Education Act.

But that’s not the case with 21 inmates in nine prisons of Uttar Pradesh who have written to the authorities saying they don’t want parole as staying incarcerated is “safer and healthier” for them during the Covid-19 pandemic. Parole is a temporary suspension of prison sentence. The inmates who have made such a request are lodged in nine jails of the state, including in Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Meerut, Maharajganj, Gorakhpur and Lucknow, Director General of Jail Administration Anand Kumar said on Sunday. The reason is that if they get a 90-day parole, then this will get added to the punishment term, he said. “The other overriding reason which they give is that if they go out, they will not get food and other healthcare facilities, which they get in the jails. The inmates say health check-up is done regularly in the jails. They get food on time, they are safe and healthy in jails. The inmates say once they go out of the jail, they will have to struggle to earn a living,” Kumar said. There are four such requests from Lucknow jail, three from Ghaziabad and two from Maharajganj jail. Asked what is the jail administration’s response to the request of the inmates, Kumar said, “Since they have given it in writing, we have to accept  it.” Over 2,200 inmates have been released on interim parole and more than 9,200 prisoners given interim bail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-safer-in-jail-21-prisoners-in-up-dont-want-parole-amid-pandemic-260982

We need to pay attention to ecology. If people continue to destroy forests, wild animals will continue to come closer to human habitations. Can we know what is out there is in animal populations before it gets to human populations. Certainly we can, and there is something underway which is called the Global Virome Project which aims to sequence 5,00,000 new viruses, discover new viruses from animal species,” Jameel said on the issue of what the world was doing to prevent future pandemics.1,65,553 fresh casesACTIVE CASES 21,14,5083,460 deaths in 24 hoursHe, however, noted that the trouble was the cost of the Global Virome Project.The cost is a monumental 5 billion dollar which would mean big considering nearly 25 trillion dollar losses in economy on account of Covid-19.Citing the silver lining in the Covid cloud, Jameel said the future of vaccinology was bright.“During Covid-19, new vaccine platforms gave us vaccines in less than a year. This is the bright spot. In future pandemics we will get vaccines far more quickly than this time,” he said.On when Covid-19 will end, Jameel said the end would depend on vaccine availability, coverage, the duration of protection the vaccines offer and people’s own behaviour.“Some modelling studies show if immunity lasts less than a year we will likely have annual winter outbreaks. If immunity lasts a little over two years, we will have outbreaks every other year. But we must remember these projections are based on influenza modelling. Covid virus is not an influenza virus. It is a new virus and we have not had any pre existing immunity to it,” the expert noted.States to get 12 crore vax doses in JuneThe government said in June, 6.09 crore vaccine doses will be given to the states for priority groups, while 5.86 crore doses will be available for direct procurement.HC: Extending doctors’ training not arbitraryThe Delhi High Court has said services of resident doctors are imperative for functioning of hospitals in the current situation arising out of the Covid pandemic, and the authorities’ decision to extend their training beyond schedule cannot be ex facie arbitrary or unreasonable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/efforts-on-to-identify-5-lakh-viruses-for-preventing-future-pandemics-261125

Pictures of Choksi (62), which have surfaced in Dominica, show him with a swollen eye and bruises on the hands.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are wanted for allegedly siphoning Rs 13,500 crore of public money from the state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) using letters of undertaking.

The remaining surplus may be compiled and reconciled with the Director General Defence Estates (DGDE) within three months, says a letter of the MoD sent out on May 6.Some of these expected surplus lands are old British time camping ground used when long campaigns had to be sustained, old unused airfields set up in War World II (1939-1945), or even lands which are now within civic areas and serve little military purpose. Another chunck of surplus lands could be with Ordnance factories – there are 41 such factories of varying vintage.The MoD is looking at identifying two categories of vacant lands — these are ‘Class A-2 and ‘Class B-4’. The Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1937, have bench-marked all lands as per their intended use of the land, its location and future expansions.Class A-2 land is not actually used or occupied by the Military Authorities but is used temporarily. The Class ‘B-4’ land is the one which is not included in any other class of lands.The letter stems from the MoD decision to take action on the recommendations of Sumit Bose Committee constituted for study on optimum use of defence land and to regulate its commercial exploitation. Bose, a former Revenue Secretary, Government of India, had submitted a report with 131 recommendations in December 2017. The Bose Committee recommendation, after a study by the MoD, has been classified under three categories.The MoD letter sent out on May 6 says it has been decided to implement a section of recommendations of the Bose committee with regard to vacant lands and optimal utilisation of defence land.Two categories of vacant land||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/process-to-monetise-surplus-defence-land-set-in-motion-261058

Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said the past seven years had been a story of unprecedented devastation, abdication of responsibility and abandonment of India’s people by the government. He listed seven blunders by the BJP government related to economy, unemployment, inflation, Covid mismanagement, disregard for middle and low income groups, national security and farmers.“The systematic destruction of the Indian economy has forced a deceleration. The Indian economy registered a technical recession for the first time since Independence. The growth in per capita income has been slowing since 2016-17 and Bangladesh has a better per capital income than us,” Surjewala noted.He said the BJP dispensation had promised two crore jobs every year but actually India saw the worst unemployment in 45 years in 2019.The Congress also cornered the government on inflation saying the prices of essential commodities had hit the roof. “When Modi government assumed power in 2014, the international crude oil prices were $108 per barrel, petrol prices were Rs 71.51 per litre and diesel was Rs 57.28 per litre. Today, the crude oil prices have fallen by 40 per cent but petrol prices have increased by 32 per cent to Rs 93.94 per litre; diesel prices increased by 48 per cent to Rs 84.89 per litre,” Surjewala said.The Congress reiterated its charge of Covid mismanagement. The Opposition party also accused the government of surrendering India’s strategic interests to China and betraying the farmers by refusing to repeal the three controversial agriculture reform laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-comes-out-with-7-point-chargesheet-261054

He, however, expressed confidence that India would prevail over the virus.PM lists achievementsAsserting that India is fighting Covid-19 with all its might, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat' address on a day he completed two years of his second term in office said the country's resolve to prevail over the virus was equal to the magnitude of the challenge it faced.“In the midst of this pandemic, India is moving forward with the resolve of service and cooperation. In the first wave, we fought courageously; this time too India will be victorious in the ongoing fight against the virus,” he said. Over the seven years, he said, the country had followed the mantra of “sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas”. Many old disputes have also been resolved with complete peace and harmony, and a new confidence underpinned by peace and development has arisen from the northeast to Kashmir, he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi listed a range of measures taken by his government to boost national security and the country’s social development index through household piped water supply, better roads, and power connections.“When we witness that now India gives a befitting reply to those who conspire against us, our confidence soars…. When India does not compromise on the issues of national security, when the strength of our armed forces increases, we feel that yes, we are on the right path,” the Prime Minister said, adding that India now moves ahead with its own convictions and not under pressure from other nations.Noting that in seven decades after Independence only 3.5 crore rural homes had water connections, he said 4.5 crore houses had been given clean water connections in the last 21 months alone. Of these, 15 months were during the Covid period, he added.When the poor come home healthy with free treatment under “Ayushman Yojana”, they feel that they have got a new life, he said.“Many people are thankful that electricity has reached their village for the first time in 70 years, while many others say their village too is now connected to city by a paved road,” he said, referring to development works undertaken by his government since it took office in May 2014.In these seven years, India has worked to show the world a new direction in digital transactions, and it is also setting records in launching satellites and constructing roads, he said.The PM also hailed the agricultural front, saying the sector had kept itself insulated from the scourge of the pandemic to a great extent and progressed.He lauded the farmers for record produce, saying that the available foodgrains had ensured free ration to 800 million underprivileged in this hour of crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fighting-virus-with-all-our-might-pm-narendra-modi-261044

31-05-2021||New Delhi||Congress lists seven ‘blunders’ of Modi Government on its 7th anniversary||On the 7th anniversary of the Narendra Modi dispensation, the Congress on Sunday alleged that it is harmful for the country as it has failed on every front and betrayed people’s trust.The Congress released a seven-point chargesheet of “blunders” it accused the government of committing, and alleged that the Modi dispensation abdicated its responsibilities towards people.The Congress listed out what it called the major failures of the government, including a declining economy, rising unemployment and inflation, and Covid-19 mismanagement.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the government needs to have the right intention, policy and determination to fight the coronavirus pandemic and not just a monthly talk.“You need the right intention, policy and determination to fight Corona and not just a pointless talk once in a month,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, on a day when Prime Minister Modi delivered his monthly “Mann ki Baat” radio address.Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the last seven years have been a story of unprecedented devastation, abdication of responsibility and abandonment of India’s people by a government that was showered with all the love and affection.“This government is harmful for the country as it has betrayed the faith of people of India. It is betraying the trust and the innate faith the people reposed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.“This is a deception of the worst kind heaped upon 140 crore Indians by a government they elected based on innumerable promises. After seven years time has come to do stock taking. Time has come to ask why the country is suffering,” he said.The Congress also came out with a 4.5-minute video, “Bharat Mata ki Kahani”, listing out the “failures” of the government in the last seven years.

31-05-2021||New Delhi||Choksi may have taken his girlfriend to Dominica for dinner: Antigua and Barbuda PM||Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi may have left his sanctuary in Antigua and taken a boat ride to neighbouring Dominica to have dinner or a "good time" with his girlfriend, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said.He said that the Government of Dominica and law enforcement agencies, unless the court rules otherwise, can deport him to India because he is an Indian citizen."The information that we are getting is that Mehul Choksi may have taken his girlfriend to Dominica probably to have dinner or have a good time and so on and got caught. That would have been a monumental error because in Antigua he is a citizen, we could not deport him...," he said in an interview to a local radio station as reported by Antigua News Room."The problem is if he is sent back to Antigua because he is an Antiguan citizen, even though his citizenship is unsettled, he still enjoys constitutional and legal protections. We have no doubt that his citizenship will ultimately be revoked because he did not disclose material information," Browne said.India seems to have spotted a window of opportunity in Choksi's arrest in Dominica where he was "detained" for illegal entry.A Qatar Airways private jet landed at the Douglas-Charles airport in Dominica, Antigua News Room reported, leading to speculation about the deportation of Choksi who was detained in the Caribbean island nation after his mysterious disappearance from Antigua and Barbuda.Browne told the radio show that the jet came from India carrying necessary documentation needed for the deportation of the businessman, the media outlet reported.There was, however, no immediate official confirmation from Indian authorities about it.Publicly available data of Qatar Executive flight A7CEE shows that it left the Delhi airport at 3.44 am on May 28 and reached Dominica at 1.16 pm local time on the same day, via Madrid.The Dominica High Court has stayed the removal of Choksi from its soil and put a gag order on the developments till the matter is heard in an open court on June 2.Choksi has alleged that he was abducted from Jolly Harbour in Antigua and Barbuda by Antiguan and Indian-looking policemen and was taken to Dominica.Pictures, purportedly of 62-year-old Choksi, surfaced in Dominica showing him with a red, swollen eye and bruises on his hands.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are wanted for allegedly siphoning Rs 13,500 crore of public money from the state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) using letters of undertaking. Both are facing a CBI and ED probe.While Modi is in a London prison after being repeatedly denied bail and is contesting his extradition to India, Choksi took the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 using the Citizenship by Investment programme before fleeing India in the first week of January 2018.The scam came to light subsequently. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/choksi-may-have-taken-his-girlfriend-to-dominica-for-dinner-antigua-and-barbuda-pm-260696

31-05-2021||New Delhi||‘Mann Ki Baat’: India has given befitting response to those who conspire against it, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said India has witnessed well-rounded progress and development during the last seven years against odds and has given a befitting response to those who conspire against it.Modi government has completed seven years since it assumed the reins in 2014.In his monthly radio address 'Mann Ki Baat', Modi said that during the last seven years, the country demonstrated its resolve to stand up to international pressure, and armed forces' determination to secure the borders."The country has given a befitting response to those conspiring against it," Modi said, listing the achievements in the seven years of his rule.He said there was peace in the country stretching from northeast to Jammu and Kashmir.The country has made rapid and long strides in the field of space technology and programmes by launching satellites.The country is also witnessing a heightened sense of awareness towards "Swachhta"-cleanliness.Penetration of power supply to villages that had no electricity during the past 70 years, road connectivity in villages, providing houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and the succour provided through Ayusuh Bharat Yojana were among the achievements highlighted by Modi.He referred to the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) under which 4.5 crores rural households have been provided piped drinking water since 2019. As many as 15 months of the mission's implementation was accounted for by the turbulence caused by the Covid pandemic.Before JJM was launched, only 3.5 crores households had piped water connections."The achievements are of the entire country," Modi said, and added, "We worked as Team India"."We worked with a vision of 'Sab ka saath, sab ka Vikas, and Sab ka vishwaas'".He, however, underlined that the progress was spliced with challenges that tested the country's resolve, and referred to the Covid pandemic with a focus on its second wave.He said the country will eventually win the war against the pandemic.He lavished praise on farmers and the agriculture sector, saying the produce has increased even during distressing times of the Covid.Simultaneously there has been record government procurement of agricultural produce. Mustard was given a high MSP.On account of ample food grains, 80 crore people from poor sections were given free ration during the pandemic period.He said the country unitedly made a push back against Covid, which he described as the biggest natural disaster striking the world after over 100 years.While the advanced countries were driven to their tether's end during the first wave, India battled it successfully, he said.Due to the sudden surge of the second wave of the pandemic, demand for medical oxygen increased manifold.The country has ramped up Oxygen generation through new plants and other medical logistics. Before Covid, only 900 Metric Tonnes of Oxygen was generated in the country. Now, it has increased to 9,500 Metric Tonnes.He lauded the armed forces, the Railways, the doctors, nurses and other categories of Covid warriors for their dedicated services, including reaching the medical Oxygen to the needy.He commiserated with the families affected by the two Cyclones: Tauktae and Yaas.He said the history of the country is that it rises in unison with the fortitude to meet challenges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mann-ki-baat-india-has-given-befitting-response-to-those-who-conspire-against-it-says-pm-modi-260686
