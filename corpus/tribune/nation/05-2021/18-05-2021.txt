India's government, however, did not factor in any production of J&J this year in the country in a list of likely vaccine output released last week.J&J said last month it had sought permission to conduct a local clinical trial in India for its single-dose vaccine. It has not given other details and a spokeswoman for J&J in India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Biological E., based in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, also plans to produce 75 million to 80 million doses of its own vaccine a month from August. The drug has been developed with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and Dynavax Technologies Corp.The United States said in March it would finance Biological E.'s efforts to produce at least 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022.Reuters reported on Tuesday that India was unlikely to resume major exports of COVID-19 vaccines until at least October as it diverts shots for domestic use, a longer-than-expected delay set to worsen supply shortages from the global COVAX initiative.(Reporting by Krishna N.

Though the government had earlier fixed the meal price at Rs 5, Kumar said the Annapurna meals are being supplied free with immediate effect until further orders in all the 250 centres. “Based on the instructions of Minister @KTRTRS, the Annapurna meals are being supplied free with immediate effect until further orders in all the 250 centers in @GHMCOnline,” Kumar tweeted. The Annapurna canteens will provide meals to daily wage workers, hawkers, and people living in shelter homes, etc., besides attendants of Covid-19 patients who are under treatment in the GHMC area, but belong to other parts of the state will also benefit from the free meals as the state is currently under lockdown. Initially, the price of the food was fixed at Rs 5, but in view of the lockdown, the government decided to provide it free to the needy. As the daily wage earners are without work due to lockdown, the minister directed GHMC to make the meals available free of cost. The state had 140 canteens, but recently the GHMC in association with the Hare Krishna Movement, Charitable Trust added 102 new canteens.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/free-meal-for-poor-during-the-lockdown-in-telangana-254759
18-05-2021||New Delhi||Narada case: CBI found nothing against BJP’s Mukul Roy, TMC’s Aparupa Poddar||Noting that no clean chit has been given to anybody, who has come under the ambit of investigation relating to the 2014 Narada sting tape case, officials in the CBI said, the agency’s application seeking sanction to prosecute four Members of Parliament including BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari was pending with the Lok Sabha Speaker for over two years.The officials, however, said the CBI had “so far” found nothing against another BJP leader from West Bengal Mukul Roy and Lok Sabha TMC member Aparupa Poddar in the case. They said the CBI had written to the Lok Sabha Speaker on April 6, 2019, for sanction to prosecute TMC MPs Sougata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Prasun Banerjee besides Adhikari, as all of them were members of the lower house when the alleged sting operation was conducted.Adhikari, once a close confidant of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, joined the BJP in December 2020 and registered a narrow victory over West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in his pocket borough Nandigram. He is now the leader of opposition in the state assembly.The case under investigation on the direction of Calcutta High Court pertains to a purported sting operation conducted by Mathew Samuel of Narada TV news channel in 2014 wherein people resembling TMC ministers, MPs and MLAs were allegedly seen receiving “illegal gratification” from representatives of a fictitious company in exchange for favours, the CBI officials said.The infamous Narada scam tapes, which were clandestinely shot in 2014, were leaked ahead of 2016 assembly polls in West Bengal. However, it had no bearing on the poll results as Mamata Banerjee-led TMC returned to power for a second consecutive term.The agency had on Monday arrested and charge-sheeted West Bengal ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, TMC MLA Madan Mitra, and former TMC leader and erstwhile Mayor of Kolkata Sovan Chatterjee, after the governor gave the sanction to prosecute them on May 7.IPS officer SMH Meerza, who is out on bail, was also among those named in the charge sheet.Among the 13 accused named by the CBI in its FIR, the officials said sanction for prosecution was not sought for Roy, who joined the BJP in November 2017, and Poddar, who is in TMC and is an MP from Arambagh, West Bengal.The CBI had sought sanction for prosecution from West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar, who gave his nod under Article 164 of the Constitution on May 7 this year, the officials said, adding that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had cleared the prosecution of Meerza after which the agency filed the charge sheet against the five.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narada-case-cbi-found-nothing-against-bjps-mukul-roy-tmcs-aparupa-poddar-254757
18-05-2021||New Delhi||Cong alleges BJP citing ‘fake toolkit’ to defame it, threatens legal action||The Congress on Tuesday accused the BJP of propagating a “fake toolkit” to defame it and said it would lodge a police complaint against the ruling party chief JP Nadda and its spokesperson Sambit Patra.The opposition party alleged on its Twitter handle that instead of helping people during the Covid-19 pandemic, the BJP is stooping to low-level politics.“BJP is propagating a fake ‘toolkit’ on ‘Covid-19 mismanagement’ and attributing it to AICC Research Department. We are filing an FIR for forgery against JP Nadda and Sambit Patra,” Congress’ research cell head Rajeev Gowda said on Twitter.“When our country is devastated by COVID, instead of providing relief, BJP shamelessly concocts forgeries,” he also alleged.The opposition party was reacting after the BJP alleged that the Congress wants to tarnish the image of the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi by calling the new strain of the coronavirus the “India strain” or the “Modi strain”.Citing a purported Congress toolkit, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sambit Patra said according to the document, it is clear that the Congress extending help to the needy during the pandemic is “more of a public relations exercise with the help of friendly journalists and influencers than a soulful endeavour”.However, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate at a virtual press conference claimed that there is no such document as shown by the BJP spokesperson and the party was initiating legal action.The party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Soon after the BJP forged the ‘fake toolkit’, all its ‘fake devotees’ and ‘friends in the media’ came out to set the agenda.”“We are going to file a case against BJP President JP Nadda and his spokespersons, but the truth about their misdeeds will not be left hidden,” he said.Shrinate alleged that the government’s priorities are misplaced as it was resorting to such “tactics” instead of helping the Covid affected.“We never expected that the national spokesperson of the BJP would resort to such blatant lies,” she said.Meanwhile, Nadda hit out the Congress, alleging that the opposition party is a “master” at “dividing society and spewing venom against others”.“India is seeing the Congress’ antics, while the nation is fighting COVID-19. I would urge Congress to go beyond ‘Toolkit Models’ and do something constructive,” the BJP chief tweeted.

18-05-2021|| New Delhi||Disha Ravi case: Delhi HC pulls up Centre for not filing response||The central government was rapped by the Delhi High Court on Tuesday for not filing its response to a plea by climate activist Disha Ravi for restraining the police from leaking to the media any probe material in relation to the FIR lodged against her in the toolkit case, despite granting a last and final opportunity to it in March this year."For Union of India is there no last and final opportunity? This is very bad. Then what is the meaning of the court saying last opportunity, I cannot understand that. What is the sanctity of (the court saying) last and final opportunity," Justice Rekha Palli said to the Centre.The strong remarks by the court came after it was told the Centre has not filed a response to Ravi's plea yet.The court on March 17 had granted a final opportunity to the Centre to file its reply to the petition.On Tuesday, it was inclined to impose costs on the Centre, but the court did not do so after central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul said that due to COVID-19 officials were not coming to office and therefore, the response could not be filed.The court, thereafter, gave the Centre six more weeks to file its reply and listed the matter for hearing in August.Ravi was arrested by Delhi Police on February 13 for allegedly being involved in sharing on social media a "toolkit" related to the ongoing farmers' protest against the Centre's three controversial agriculture laws, and was granted bail by a trial court here on February 23.The high court was hearing her plea to restrain police from leaking to the media any probe material in relation to the FIR lodged against her.The petition has also sought to restrain the media from publishing the content or extract of any private chats, including those on WhatsApp, between her and third parties.Ravi, in her plea, has said she is "severely aggrieved and prejudiced by the media trial surrounding her arrest and the ongoing investigation, where she is being viscerally attacked by the respondent 1 (police) and several media houses".She has claimed that her arrest from Bengaluru on February 13 by a Cyber Cell team of Delhi Police was "wholly unlawfully and without basis".She has also contended that in the present circumstances, it was "highly likely" that the general public will perceive the news items "as being conclusive as to the guilt of the petitioner (Ravi)".She has claimed that the police first "leaked investigative material"—like alleged WhatsApp chats—the substance and details of which were only in the possession of the investigating agency.The high court had on February 19 said certain media coverage of the investigation into the FIR against Ravi for her alleged involvement in sharing a toolkit backing farmers' protest indicates "sensationalism and prejudicial reporting", but declined to order the removal of any such content at this stage.The issue of removal of content that was already in the public domain shall be considered at a later stage, it had said.The high court, in an earlier order, had asked media houses to ensure that no leaked investigation material is broadcast as it could affect the probe and directed Delhi Police to abide by its stand on affidavit that it has not leaked nor intends to leak any probe details to the press.The police had placed an affidavit categorically denying the leak of any information to the media. It also assured the court that it had no intention of leaking any information to the media.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had said the petition was not maintainable as no complaint was first made to it for taking action against any TV channel or media house for any alleged incorrect reporting of the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disha-ravi-case-delhi-hc-pulls-up-centre-for-not-filing-response-254749
18-05-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Vijayan elected CPI (M) Parliamentary party leader, Shailaja’s omission sparks debate||Days after leading the ruling LDF to a stupendous electoral victory, CPI (M) veteran Pinarayi Vijayan was on Tuesday elected its Parliamentary Party Leader for a second term as Chief Minister but the omission of ‘rockstar’ health minister KK Shailaja from the new cabinet sparked a debate.Having won international accolades for her deft handling of the first wave of Covid-19 in Kerala after it reported India’s first case in 2020, Shailaja’s surprise omission drew instant comparisons with the late KR Gowri Amma, the firebrand Marxist who was once tipped to head the state but never did.However, Shailaja, described as a “rockstar health minister” by a section of international media, said she was not disappointed at being denied berth in the new cabinet.“There is no need to be emotional.. I became the minister earlier because of the party’s decision. I have absolute satisfaction in what I have done. I am confident that the new team can perform better than me,” she said.“Not the individual but the system is showcasing the fight against the pandemic. I am happy that I could lead the team,” the leader added.She was, however, entrusted with the position of party whip, a CPI(M) statement said here, even as the party took the position that all members except the Chief Minister should be fresh faces in the new cabinet.Among the fresh faces is Vijayan’s son-in-law P A Mohammed Riyas.The state committee of the Marxist party nominated 11 freshers including two women as its ministers in the new government which would be sworn-in on May 20 at the Central Stadium here in adherence to Covid-19 protocol.The state committee, which met at its headquarters AKG Centre, elected Vijayan to lead the party, the statement said.Vijayan had scripted history in the April 6 Assembly polls by leading the ruling Left front to a consecutive term, bucking the over four-decade-old trend in the state of the people choosing between the Communists and Congress-led governments alternatively.Though it was almost sure that no ministers in the previous VIjayan government would find a place in his new cabinet, Shailaja was expected to be given an exemption by the party, as the state is reeling under the second wave of the pandemic.She had won the polls with the highest margin of 60,963 votes from Mattannur in Kannur.The media, during the election, had even projected her as the first woman chief minister of the state in future.Belying all expectations, Shailaja was not included in the new ministry.Hailed as ‘rockstar health minister’ by the global media for her able leadership, effective crisis management and matured intervention in arresting the first wave of Covid-19 in the state, Shailaja’s non-inclusion raised many eyebrows cutting across party lines.A retired school teacher, she had done a commendable job in containing the covid surge in the state last year and also during the Nipah virus outbreak in 2018 and 2019.Social media users responded sharply to the omission of the 64-year-old leader, popularly known as “Shailaja Teacher” or “Teacher Amma” among her admirers.They pointed out that it would not be good to change the minister as Kerala was witnessing an unprecedented surge in coronavirus cases.There were many who put up her photos as their WhatsApp status, in an apparent act of extending solidarity with her.Some comparedShailaja being dropped from the cabinet with the manner in which late Gowri Amma was allegedly denied chief ministership in the last minute in 1987.Though projected as a CM candidate during the then elections, Gowri Amma was allegedly sidelined by the party which preferred E K Nayanar for the top post.Though critics and media alleged that Shailaja was sidelined, CPI(M) took the position that all ministers except the Chief Minister should be fresh faces in the new cabinet.So had been the case with T M Thomas Isaac, Finance Minister in the outgoing cabinet, among others who had not been given a chance as they were elected twice consecutively, party sources said.The dropping of Isaac, a known Left intellectual and a finance management expert, had also come as a shock for many including grassroot level party workers.Sources said the party wanted to evolve a second generation of leaders in parliamentary politics and give them more serious opportunities.They also claimed that the new cabinet would be a right blend of experienced seniors and youngsters.Party central committee member M V Govindan, former Rajya Sabha MPs P Rajeev and K N Balagopal, senior leaders K Radhakrishnan, V N Vasavan, Saji Cheriyan and V Sivankutty are among those inducted in Vijayan’s second cabinet.Veena George and R Bindhu, wife of CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan, would be the women members in the new ministry.Riyas, Vijayan’s son-in-law and national president of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), also managed to find a cabinet berth.The state committee meeting, chaired by senior leader Elamaram Kareem, picked M B Rajesh, who wrested the Thirthala seat from Congress’s V T Balaram, as the party nominee for the post of Speaker.The meeting, attended by polit bureau members S Ramachandran Pillai, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, M A Baby besides Vijayan, also electedsenior leader and former minister T P Ramakrishnan as the parliamentary party secretary.Meanwhile, taking a cue from the CPI(M), ally CPI alsonominated fresh faces to the cabinet.Newly elected MLAs K Rajan, P Prasad, J Chinchu Rani and G R Anil were its pick in the coalition government.Senior party leader and Adoor MLA Chittayam Gopakumar has been nominated to the post of  deputy speaker, the party said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vijayan-elected-cpi-m-parliamentary-party-leader-shailajas-omission-sparks-debate-254741

It also has options for providing specific information or a particular type of display.The aviation clock presently installed in the Mi-17 V5 helicopter is manufactured by Thommen Aircraft Equipment based in Switzerland that manufactures cockpit instruments for the global aviation industry.The IAF has about 150 Mi-17 V5s in service that have replaced the older Mi-8 helicopter and earlier versions of the Mi-17. It is the mainstay of the IAF’s utility helicopter fleet, capable for carrying 36 soldiers internally or 4,500 kg of load. It can also be armed with machine guns, rocket pods or anti-tank missiles.Indigenisation of aero-spares for all types of aircraft has been a major thrust area for the IAF, for which it has been making in-house efforts as well as tapping the private industry. This includes thousands of types of singular items as well as sub-systems and assemblies, which it is earlier constrained to import.Besides assembling and flight testing newly procured Mi-17 helicopters, 3 BRD has also carried out several modifications and retrofitments to the fleet to meet IAF’s operational requirements, including modifying the helicopter for VVIP use. A large number of Mi-17 components have also been indigenised by the depot.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/swiss-made-clocks-in-iafs-mi-17-helicopters-being-replaced-with-indigenously-developed-substitute-254734

The increasing gap between two Covishield doses in India while the UK reduces its window has laypersons confused, but several experts say there is little reason to worry and second jabs anytime before six months can still be effective boosters.The government last week extended the gap between two doses of the Covishield COVID-19 vaccine to 12-16 weeks, up from the previous maximum of eight weeks, on the recommendation of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI).  A day later, UK cut the gap from 12 weeks to eight weeks in view of the spread of the B.1.617 variant that originated in India. Responding to concerns that India increased the gap primarily because vaccines were in short supply and many states had complained of acute shortage in supplies, immunologist Rath said vaccine dosing is “quite flexible and forgiving”.Once four weeks have passed, the next dose can be taken whenever practicable, until six months. According to the scientist, vaccine doses will be safe no matter when they are taken but will not provide any great "boosting" if given within less than a month or so of the previous dose.“So vaccine doses can be taken any time after at least four weeks have passed from either the first dose or after an actual episode of COVID-19,” Rath, from New Delhi's National Institute of Immunology (NII), told PTI.“Secondly, vaccine doses will give perfectly good boosting if given any time up to as much as six months or so after a previous dose. So a second dose, or the first dose after a COVID-19 episode, does not have to be taken after four weeks,” he explained.The NTAGI, Rath added, is making these new recommendations based on evidence, and trying to provide support for practical steps. Referring to the UK reducing its Covishield doses gap just as India increased its, immunologist Vineeta Bal said these decisions are taken based on ground realities and “there is no yes or no answer” to whether they will have any consequence on tackling the variant better.In one country, the increased window will enable more people to be vaccinated, in the other, a decreased gap will accelerate the pace of inoculation.“If there are enough doses available, the second shot should be given at the optimal time as it will provide the best possible immunity in the present circumstances,” Bal, guest faculty at Pune's Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, told PTI.A vaccine triggered immune response, she admitted, will start declining with time. However, at the end of 12-16 weeks it is unlikely to come to complete baseline level.“Hence a booster effect can still be obtained after a gap of 12-16 weeks,” Bal said. “There are also data from various clinical trials for Covishield which are suggestive that a booster after 12-16 weeks will be fine,” she added.According to Rath, there is emerging evidence, mostly from the UK for Covishield, that very good protection is seen with a dose gap of 12 odd weeks.“So I think that the committee is trying to provide evidence-based support for delaying the permissible interval between doses as much as possible to accommodate the realities of vaccine supply shortage,” he added.Bal added it is not a serious cause of concern as long as there is assurance that everyone will get the first and second dose in the near future.According to a peer-reviewed study published in The Lancet in February, the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University is more effective when its second dose is given around three months after the first, instead of six weeks later."Vaccine supply is likely to be limited, at least in the short term, and so policy-makers must decide how best to deliver doses to achieve the greatest public health benefit,” Prof Andrew Pollard of the University of Oxford said in the study.“Where there is a limited supply, policies of initially vaccinating more people with a single dose may provide greater immediate population protection than vaccinating half the number of people with 2 doses,” he added.In India, the gap between two Covishield doses was four to six weeks, then increased to six to eight, and is now 12-16."Based on the available real-life evidences, particularly from the UK, the COVID-19 Working Group agreed for increasing the dosing interval to 12-16 weeks between two doses of Covishield vaccine. No change in interval of Covaxin vaccine doses was recommended," the Health Ministry said last week.The NTAGI has also stated that those having laboratory test proven SARS-CoV-2 illness should defer COVID-19 vaccination for six months after recovery.According to the Health Ministry's current protocol, the vaccine is to be taken four to eight weeks after recovery from COVID-19.Rath said the basis for this step seems to be based on the fact that there are good antibody levels in most people who have had COVID-19  and that they last for at least six months.So they are likely to be well protected for that period, and therefore there is no pressing need to vaccinate them before that,” the scientist said.“This reduces the burden on the stuttering vaccine supply and distribution system. I am not in disagreement with the recommendations based on such a rationale, ” he added.However, the immunologist hoped that the rationale will be clearly explained. If there is no explanation, it will add to confusion.Most viral infections, Bal noted, generate enough immunity to provide protection for a few months post-recovery. Based on that knowledge, this recommendation is not unreasonable.“RT-PCR positive patients post-recovery do not remain as vulnerable as those who are neither vaccinated nor infected,” she explained.“They have enough immunity in them, generally. Just because of this recommendation, the situation is not likely to worsen in India. Other things like unavailability of vaccine for a large section of people is more of a problem,” Bal added.On NTAGI suggesting no changed in the protocol for Covaxin, the other vaccine being administered in India, Rath said this is likely because the recommendations are based on UK-based evidence with Covishield. There is no no such evidence for Covaxin.“I am glad since this suggests that the committee, as I keep saying, is trying very hard to stay carefully on evidence while trying to help with the current unhappy realities,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/booster-effect-even-at-six-months-dont-worry-experts-on-covishield-dose-gap-254731
18-05-2021||London||How worrying is the variant first seen in India?||For the first time in months, people across England are meeting indoors at pubs, restaurants, cinemas, gyms and elsewhere as coronavirus rules were relaxed this week.But Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Britons to be cautious and some of the scientists advising him say restrictions might need to be reimposed quickly because of a worrying variant first detected in India.Here's a look at what we know and don't know about the variant: WHAT IS THIS VARIANT?The COVID-19 variant first identified in India has been classified as a “variant of concern” by Britain and the World Health Organisation, meaning there is some evidence that it spreads more easily between people, causes more severe disease, or might be less responsive to treatments and vaccines.“The absolute numbers of cases (of the variant) in the UK remain quite small, but the growth rate is quite high,” said Nick Loman, a professor of microbial genomics at the University of Birmingham.To date, there have been more than 2,300 cases identified in Britain. Figures released by Public Health England show cases of the variant first detected in India have tripled in the past week and experts say it's on track to become the most dominant COVID-19 variant in the country.Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's COVID-19 technical lead, said more information was still needed about the variant's spread globally.“We need more sequencing, targeted sequencing to be done and to be shared in India and elsewhere so that we know how much of this virus is circulating,” she said.HOW TRANSMISSIBLE IS THE VARIANT?We don't entirely know. But according to the minutes of an expert group advising the government last week, scientists said “it is a realistic possibility that (the variant first seen in India) is as much as 50% more transmissible” than the variant first reported in Britain — whose explosive spread led to the country's longest lockdown in January.“There are plausible biological reasons as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible,” they concluded.If the variant proves to be 40 to 50% more transmissible, the scientists predicted that would “lead to a much larger peak” of cases, hospitalisations and deaths than previous waves of coronavirus — particularly if the government continues with its existing plans to exit lockdown.Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and one of the scientists advising the government, said it was entirely possible the COVID-19 restrictions relaxed on Monday might need to be reintroduced soon if the variant's spread leads to a spike in hospitalisations and deaths.“A very careful lifting (of restrictions) is reasonable, but we may have to reverse that,” Farrar warned. Experts think the next few weeks should provide more details about how quickly the variant identified in India is sickening people and whether that might overwhelm hospitals.Johnson said any proof the variant identified in India is more dangerous could “pose a serious disruption” to the UK government's plans to lift all remaining COVID-19 restrictions next month.DO VACCINES WORK AGAINST THIS VARIANT?Scientists think so but are still waiting for definitive answers.At a press briefing last week, Marco Cavaleri, head of vaccines at the European Medicines Agency, said the data appeared “rather reassuring” that vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna would protect against the variant first seen in India.He said the agency was still gathering more information on the effectiveness of the shots made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson and was “pretty confident” those vaccines too would afford people enough protection from the variant.“Urgent experimental data is being generated (for this variant),” said Sharon Peacock of the UK COVID-19 Genomics Consortium. She noted that vaccines appear to work against other variants to date but that it is important to determine if one dose is effective or if two are needed.In the areas of the UK worst hit by the variant, Britain's health secretary Matt Hancock said most people hospitalised had “chosen not to have the jab.”On Monday, Johnson said people over 50 and those with underlying health conditions would have their wait for a second vaccine dose cut from 12 weeks to eight, over concerns about the variant's rapid spread. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-worrying-is-the-variant-first-seen-in-india-254730

My husband is admitted in this hospital with black fungus infection and has pain in his eyes and jaws. The injection (Amphotericin-B) is not available in this hospital. Where should I take him in this condition," the woman said in the video."If I don't get the injection today, then I will jump off the roof of the hospital and commit suicide. I have no other option left," she says further in the video message addressed to Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state health minister Prabhu Ram Choudhary and Indore collector Manish Singh.Meanwhile, Bombay Hospital general manager Rahul Parasher said the woman was counselled, but she is in a disturbed state of mind at present."Her husband has been administered 59 Amphotericin-B injections, but his requirement is more. These injections are not available in the hospital at present and patients are being treated for Mucormycosis with other anti-fungal drugs," Parasher explained.On Monday, a minister had said 122 patients were admitted in Indore with Mucormycosis.The shortage of Amphotericin-B injections is being highlighted by patients as well as political leaders over the past few days, including Congress Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh who has written a letter on this issue to the CM.Mucormycosis, a rare and dangerous fungal infection, is being seen in some COVID-19 patients as well as those who have recovered from the infection. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/black-fungus-injection-mp-woman-threatens-to-commit-suicide-254722
18-05-2021||Titabar (Assam)||ULFA(I) has kept kidnapped ONGC staff in Myanmar: Assam CM||Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday claimed that abducted ONGC employee Ritul Saikia has been "kept somewhere in Myanmar" by the proscribed ULFA (I).Sarma along with MPs Topon Kumar Gogoi, Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, and Pallab Lochan Das, and local MLA Bhaskar Jyoti Baruah visited Saikia's home at Titabar in Jorhat district during the day and assured his wife and parents that the government was doing everything possible to secure his release."We have assured the parents of Ritul Saikia that the government will do everything possible to get him back. As per information with the Assam Government, Ritul Saikia is in a place somewhere in Myanmar along the Indo-Myanmar border," the chief minister told reporters.The government also has information that Saikia is safe, Sarma said.Ritul Saikia, along with two other employees of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Alakesh Saikia, were on April 21 kidnapped by suspected militants of the United Liberation Front of Asom (Independent) from the Lakwa oilfield in Sivasagar district along the Assam-Nagaland border.Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Alakesh Saikia were rescued by security forces on April 24 after an encounter with the abductors near the India-Myanmar border in Mon district of Nagaland."For his release, various persons have contacted (us) for mediation. Some people have brought information. We are trying to bring him back hale and hearty."The government is firmly behind his family in these trying times and is doing its best to rescue Saikia at the earliest," he added.They (abductors) have placed some demands like reservation for locals in jobs, and nobody has any objection to such demands, the chief minister said."But there are other things that have not been made public and it has to be seen how many of them can be accepted.I cannot tell those in front of the media, but we are trying," Sarma said.On April 28, Special DGP (Law and Order) Gyanendra Pratap Singh had cited information from Assam Rifles, the Army, and Nagaland Police and said ULFA(I) militants were in hiding with Saikia in Mon district of the neighbouring state.Hours after the rescue of Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Alakesh Saikia on April 24, the banned outfit had issued a statement claiming that they had released all the three kidnapped persons at a village in Mon district when the encounter took place."The security forces are silent on Ritul Saikia. We, therefore, suspect he may have fallen to their bullets or the security agencies are refraining from revealing his status for their own reasons," the statement had said.Three persons, including one Assam Police constable, have been arrested for their active role in the kidnapping.The police has also taken into custody 20 persons for their alleged involvement or links with the banned organisation.

18-05-2021||New Delhi||Over 1000 children, parents reach out to govt helpline to tackle Covid woes||From facing loneliness in COVID-19 isolation ward to exhibiting aggressive behaviour after parents contracted the virus, over 1,000 children and parents have reached out to government helpline seeking help.With an objective of providing psychological first-aid and emotional support to children affected during the pandemic, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)is providing tele-counselling to children through SAMVEDNA(Sensitising Action on Mental Health Vulnerability through Emotional Development and Necessary Acceptance) - a toll-free helpline launched to provide psycho-social mental support for affected children.According to Women and Child Development Ministry officials, redressal of 1,009 complaints have been done between September, 2020 to May 7, 2021.In a case from a COVID-19 isolation centre in Aurangabad, a 15-year-old child expressed frustration over not getting enough love from parents due to more number of siblings and called up to talk about her parents' pressure of getting her married of early.The counsellor spoke to the child and her parents and suggested encouraging her to focus on academics. In another case, the parent of a six-year-old child in Kanpur called to discuss the aggressive behaviour of their child who was lodged in an isolation centre after contracting the virus.The counsellor suggested that the child engage in different activities like narrating stories or playing with toys. It was found that as the parents were keeping to themselves after the family tested positive, the child was feeling lonely and exhibiting aggressive behaviour.A 17-year-old boy from Madhya Pradesh's Singrauli isolation centre called up and talked about being scared of loneliness. The counsellor advised him to spend time engaging in activities he is interested in and making a regular routine to get away from boredom.This tele-counselling service is available on a toll-free number 1800-121-2830 from Monday to Saturday from 10 am to 1 pm and 3 pm to 8 pm and is exclusively for children who are willing to talk and are in need of counselling. When a child/caretaker/parent dials SAMVEDNA, they get to speak to a professional counsellor in a safe environment. Tele-counselling is provided to children under three categories: children who are in quarantine/isolation/Covid care centres, children who have Covid positive parents or family members, and children who have lost their parents due to the pandemic.This service caters to children from all over India in various regional languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Oriya, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, the Women and Child Development Ministry said.This service was launched in September, 2020 and aims to support children in the difficult times of COVID-19 pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-1000-children-parents-reach-out-to-govt-helpline-to-tackle-covid-woes-254716

18-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: CBSE extends deadline till June 30 for schools to tabulate marks for class 10||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Tuesday extended the deadline up to June 30 for schools to tabulate class 10 marks and submit it to the board, according to officials. The board had earlier announced that the entire exercise of tabulation of marks will be completed by June 11 and the result will be declared by June 20.The decision has been taken in view of the lockdown in several states due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation and to ensure safety of teachers and staff members. "CBSE accords the highest priority to safety and health of teachers. Keeping in view the situation of pandemic, lockdown in states and safety of teachers and other staff members of affiliated schools, the board has decided to extend the dates," said Sanyam Bhardwaj, Controller of Examinations, CBSE."The marks will have to be submitted to the board by June 30. For rest of the activities, the result committees can make their own schedule based on the scheme provided by CBSE, " he added. The CBSE had earlier this month announced a policy for tabulation of marks for class 10 board exams which have been cancelled in view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the country. According to the policy, while 20 marks for each subject will be for internal assessment as every year, 80 marks will be calculated on basis of the students' performance in various tests or exams throughout the year.The board had asked schools to form a result committee consisting of principal and seven teachers for finalising results. Five teachers from the school should be from Mathematics, Social Science, Science and two languages, and two teachers from neighbouring schools should be co-opted by the school as the external members of the committee.  "The schools will form eight-member result committees by May 5. The provision for school-wise distribution of marks as well as finalisation of rationale document will happen by May 10. For candidates who have not appeared in enough tests through the year, the schools will conduct online or telephonic assessment for them by May 15 and will have to finalise the result by May 25," Bhardwaj had then said. The CBSE had on April 14 cancelled class 10 exams and postponed class 12 exams in view of surge in COVID-19 cases.The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The board exams are usually conducted in February-March.

He is trying to build up a narrative of a severe breakdown of law and order with malafide motive of destabilising an elected government, " alleged Trinamool MP Saugata Roy.But Raj Bhavan sources rubbished the Trinamool charges.One said the Governor was a lawyer by training and was " totally conscious of this powers and responsibilities."  " He had raised valid concerns over breakdown of law and order. He had cleared the CBI to prosecute the politicians involved in the Narada scam," the Raj Bhavan source said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-wants-change-of-west-bengal-governor-writes-to-pm-president-254690

18-05-2021||New York||WHO reminds Serum Institute of its COVAX commitments amidst soaring demand in India||WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that once the devastating COVID-19 outbreak in India recedes, the Serum Institute of India will need to “get back on track and catch up” on its delivery commitments to COVAX, the global initiative to supply coronavirus vaccines to nations around the world.During a daily virtual press briefing on Monday, the World Health Organisation Director-General said that the surge in COVID-19 cases around the world has compromised the global vaccine supply and there is already a shortfall of 190 million doses to COVAX by the end of June.COVAX, “the global COVID vaccine equity scheme”, has so far delivered 65 million doses to 124 countries and economies but it is dependent on countries and manufacturers honouring their commitments.“Once the devastating outbreak in India recedes, we also need the Serum Institute of India to get back on track and catch up on its delivery commitments to COVAX,” Ghebreyesus said.The UN children's agency UNICEF said the devastating surge in coronavirus cases in India has impacted vaccine supplies to the COVAX facility.“Among the global consequences of the situation in India, a global hub for vaccine production, is a severe reduction in vaccines available to COVAX.“Soaring domestic demand has meant that 140 million doses intended for distribution to low- and middle-income countries through the end of May cannot be accessed by COVAX. Another 50 million doses are likely to be missed in June,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in a statement.A note to editors in the UNICEF statement said that “shortfall numbers are based on delays related to shipments from the Serum Institute of India (SII) only.” Other delays related to the original COVAX delivery schedule are expected to be made up by the end of June.“There is currently no timetable to resolve SII-related delays”, the note said.UNICEF said the COVAX facility will deliver its 65 millionth dose in the coming days when it should have been at least 170 millionth.By the time G7 leaders gather in the UK next month, and as a deadly second wave of COVID-19 will likely continue to sweep across India and many of its South Asian neighbours, the shortfall will be near 190 million doses.The UNICEF Executive Director said in addition to vaccine nationalism, limited production capacity and lack of funding is the reason why the roll-out of COVID vaccines is so behind schedule.While expressing concern over the surge in coronavirus cases in India, Fore said the UN has issued repeated warnings of the risks of "letting down our guard” and leaving low- and middle-income countries without equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics.“We are concerned that the deadly spike in India is a precursor to what will happen if those warnings remain unheeded. While the situation in India is tragic, it is not unique.“Cases are exploding and health systems are struggling in countries near – like Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives – and far, like Argentina and Brazil,” Fore said, warning that the cost for children and families will be incalculable.“The longer the virus continues to spread unchecked, the higher the risk of more deadly or contagious variants emerging,” she said, adding that the clearest pathway out of this pandemic is a global, equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics.While COVAX -- led by the WHO, Vaccine Alliance Gavi and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations with UNICEF as implementing partner -- represents such a pathway, Fore voiced her concern that COVAX is undersupplied.Earlier this month, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said it was not possible to ramp up production overnight since vaccine manufacturing is a specialised process. The SII has received total orders of over 26 crore doses from the Government of India, of which more than 15 crore doses have been supplied.In a tweet last week, Poonawalla said that the SII is doing “our best to ramp up production & launch new vaccines on priority for India.” Fore cited new data analysis provided by life sciences research facility Airfinity that indicates that G7 nations and ‘Team Europe' group of European Union Member States could donate around 153 million vaccine doses if they shared just 20 per cent of their available supply over June, July and August.The WHO chief said Pfizer has committed to providing 40 million doses of vaccines with COVAX this year, but the majority of these would be in the second half of 2021.Moderna also has signed a deal for 500 million doses with COVAX, but the majority has been promised only for 2022.As per the pact which included funding to support manufacturing increase, the SII is contracted to provide COVAX with the SII-licensed and manufactured AstraZeneca (AZ)-Oxford vaccine (known as COVISHIELD) to 64 lower-income economies participating in the Gavi COVAX AMC (including India), alongside its commitments to the Government of India, the WHO had said.Last year, it was announced that the collaboration among SII, Gavi and the Gates Foundation would accelerate manufacturing and delivery of up to an additional 100 million doses of future vaccines for low- and middle-income countries in 2021.India's COVID-19 death toll on Tuesday climbed to 2,78,719 with a record 4,329 fresh fatalities, while the single-day rise in cases stood at 2.63 lakh, the lowest in 28 days, according to the Union Health Ministry data.
