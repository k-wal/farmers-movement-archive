09-05-2021||Washington||Getting people vaccinated only long-term solution to COVID-19 crisis in India: Fauci||Getting people vaccinated is the only long-term solution to the current COVID-19 crisis in India, America's top public health expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on Sunday as he called for scaling up manufacturing of coronavirus vaccines both domestically and globally to fight the deadly pandemic.“The endgame of this all...is going to be to get people vaccinated...India is the largest vaccine-producing country in the world. They've got to get their resources, not only from within, but also from without,” Fauci, who is the Chief Medical Adviser to US President Joe Biden, told the ABC News in an interview.“That's the reason why other countries need to chip in to be able to get either supplies to the Indians to make their own vaccines or to get vaccines donated. One of the ways to do that is to have the big companies that have the capability of making vaccines to really scale up in a great way to get literally hundreds of millions of doses to be able to get to them,” he said.Responding to a question, Dr Fauci said that India needs to immediately build makeshift field hospitals like what China did a year ago.“You've got to get that. You can't have people out in the street not having a hospital bed. The oxygen situation is something that was really critical. I mean, to have people not have oxygen is really tragic, what's going on over there,” he said.The 80-year-old physician and immunologist, who serves as the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said there is an immediate problem of hospital beds, oxygen, PPE and other supplies.“Then there's the problem of looking forward to how are you going to shut this down, how are you going to turn it around, how are you going to break the chain of transmission?” he said, underlining the need for a countrywide lockdown to arrest the spread of the virus.“Vaccines is one of them but there are other ways too, like shutting down the government. I have advised them in the past that you really need to do that. You've got to shut down. I believe several of the Indian states have already done that, but you need to break the chain of transmission. And one of the ways to do that is to shut down,” the top American doctor said. Fauci, in an exclusive interview to PTI last week, had termed the situation in India “very desperate” and suggested that the government marshal all its resources, including the armed forces, to immediately build makeshift field hospitals, and urged other countries to help with not only materials but also personnel.He called for a nationwide lockdown, not necessarily for six months but “for a few weeks” to break the “continuity and transmission of infection.” He also recommended mass vaccination to arrest the current spread of the deadly disease across India.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 4,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days.China reported the first COVID-19 case in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and since then the deadly disease has become a pandemic, affecting more than 157,789,300 people and leading to over 3,285,200 deaths worldwide.

But there can't be an alliance without the Congress party. It will be the soul. Leadership can be decided through consultations," Raut told reporters."The Maha Vikas aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra was formed after three ideologically different parties (Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) came together and the leadership was unanimously given to Uddhav Thackeray. This is an ideal alliance, which is working fine," he said.The Congress has done well in Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the recent Assembly elections. But it did not win a single seat in West Bengal and this is not good. The party needs to be strengthened further, he said.The Congress is a pan-India party, whether in government or in opposition, he said."I discussed these issues with NCP president Sharad Pawar, but since he is indisposed, he is in Mumbai. Talks of forming an alliance of opposition parties will start in a few days," the Sena's Rajya Sabha member said.Replying to questions on Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis criticising the Maharashtra government on its handling of COVID-19 pandemic, Raut said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded to Fadnavis's allegations by saying that the state was doing well."Even the Supreme Court has taken note of the state government's work. Maharashtra is fighting against the virus with all its might and CM Uddhav Thackeray and all his cabinet colleagues need to be complimented," Raut said.Modi had called Thackeray on Saturday to take stock of the COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra, and said that the state was handling the situation well.

09-05-2021||New Delhi||Protest amid pandemic: Steadfast farmers work on immunity, seek Covid vaccination||Desi 'kaadha' and lemonade have become the most consumed beverages among farmers protesting against the new Central agricultural laws at three Delhi borders for nearly six months now, even as the raging coronavirus pandemic claims hundreds of lives daily and leaves thousands sick.They have also added multi-vitamin and zinc tablets as supplements hoping to improve their immunity against the virus, but are resolved not to yield ground until their demands—a repeal of the three contentious farm laws and a new one guaranteeing MSP on crops—are met. But, they say, they are open to COVID-19 vaccine jabs.Hundreds of farmers, chiefly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, continue to encamp Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur border points of Delhi despite "a few" of them being removed after testing positive for COVID-19 and some symptomatic protesters undergoing medication."There are no such cases of coronavirus here at Singhu border. The farmers are taking care of themselves by consuming 'kaadha' (a traditional Indian hot beverage mixed with herbs and spices to boost immunity) and multi-vitamins. The situation at the border area is normal, as it was earlier. There is nothing to worry about," said Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer. Farmer leader Kulwant Singh, who hails from Punjab, said a vaccination centre is being operated at a hospital at the Singhu border. "One of our leaders tested positive for the Covid-19. He has recovered and is now doing well. Those who are showing symptoms are getting tested for the virus. The farmers at the border are taking a healthy diet. The vaccination process is underway at a hospital near the border. I got my first jab in Punjab. To get the next dose, I will go back to the state," Kulwant said.At Tikri and Ghazipur, the protestors said they have demanded for a vaccination facility but the government has not responded to their appeal yet. They added they are firmly resolved to stay put at Delhi's borders, and are making arrangements to ensure COVID-appropriate behaviour among crowds. "We demanded the authorities to install a vaccination centre at Tikri border so that we could get the vaccine but nothing has happened so far," another farmer leader Buta Singh said, claiming the situation at Tikri "is normal".At Ghazipur on Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, not more than three farmers stay in bigger camps now which used to house many more before the second wave of coronavirus began. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is leading the charge there, recently arranged around 500 cots to ensure social distancing among the farmers when they sleep.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, who has got the first dose of vaccine, is also on the ground at Ghazipur leading his supporters, with all of them consuming 'kaadha' three to four times a day and lemonade too, BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said. "Thankfully, there has been no COVID positive case here till now. Some people had some health issues and they have got medication. Protestors are drinking 'kaadha' and 'nimbu paani' to improve immunity, several are taking multi-vitamins and zinc pills too," he told PTI.He said, "If you come to Ghazipur, you will see how amazingly normal the situation here is" despite the situation in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida looking so grim because of the deadly second wave.Malik said the BKU is also helping the oxygen langars, which provide oxygen cylinders to needy COVID patients, with whatever support the farmers union can extend. "We are dealing with the situation and hoping the government would soon make some arrangement to get all farmers vaccinated," he said, but added, "that does not mean we are going away without the Centre accepting our demands."Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders since November 2020 with their demands that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back, and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.However, the government, which has held multiple rounds of formal dialogue with the protestors, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protest-amid-pandemic-steadfast-farmers-work-on-immunity-seek-covid-vaccination-250396

09-05-2021|| Hyderabad||Telangana villagers impose self-lockdown to stem coronavirus transmission||In a sharp reaction to some states announcing a 14-day institutional quarantine for people arriving from the two Telugu states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, several villages in Telangana have announced a self-lockdown to send a positive message to the rest of the country.   After the state Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) ruled out a complete lockdown, many village elders took the decision after mutual consultation and have ordered to impose self-discipline like shutting businesses early and reducing human interaction.   Delhi and Odisha have named travellers from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh as “high risk” due to the possibility of a new virus strain N44K. Andhra Pradesh has denied that this virus was 15 times more virulent and a threat to the rest of the country. Known by many names the N440K strain also called Andhra Pradesh Strain or B.1.36, was detected in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana last year.   Elders in many villages have decided night curfews called by the state were insufficient to contain the virus, and have sent word around that they were imposing restrictions until the situation improves. For instance, Khammam Merchants Association decided to impose a partial lockdown by reducing business hours in the city and announced shops would be open from 8 am to 2.30 pm. In Cherla Mandal headquarters of Kothagudem district, the weekly markets have been canceled indefinitely, as has been done in Bhadrachalam and Dummugudem Mandals. Villagers of Salooora in Bodhan Mandal in the erstwhile Nizamabad district have passed a resolution for early closure of shops and prevent the entry of all non-village residents into the village. Only two hours have been given to each other to buy essential commodities. Similar reports have been received from various parts of the state. Where it has been decided to open commercial establishments from 7 am to 10 am and from 5.30 pm to 7.30 pm. People say that the state government has not imposed a lockdown for political reasons, but they need to isolate themselves to defeat corona.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana%C2%A0villagers%C2%A0impose-self-lockdown%C2%A0to-stem-coronavirus-transmission-250390
09-05-2021||New Delhi||Mallikarjun Kharge urges PM to convene all-party meeting to collectively tackle COVID||Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately convene an all-party meeting to collectively forge a holistic blueprint to tackle the COVID pandemic.In a letter to the prime minister, he alleged that the Union government seems to have abdicated its duties towards the people and the situation requires a collective and consensual effort.He also sent his set of six suggestions to tackle the crisis due to the pandemic and said the Prime Minister’s Office alone cannot handle it.“I request you to convene an all-party meeting to collectively forge a holistic blueprint to tackle the pandemic. This would be a good opportunity for us to meaningfully reflect on, and implement the recommendations of experts and activists, whose advice has unfortunately been ignored so far,” he told the prime minister.Kharge said he is writing to convey his deep concern and a sense of anguish regarding the unprecedented crisis the nation faces. Calling for free inoculation, he said, Parliament had allocated Rs 35,000 crores in the union budget to ensure free vaccines for all.Despite this, the Union government allowed private companies to set exorbitant and differential prices for vaccines and outsourced the procurement of vaccines to already stretched state governments.“This will adversely impact millions of Indians. Sir, corporate profit cannot triumph saving lives. I, therefore, urge you to not relinquish the State’s moral duty in immunising citizens. This is completely doable because India has a history of successful, large-scale immunisation programmes,” he said.It is heart-breaking to witness millions of ordinary Indians scrambling to access basic healthcare, oxygen, medicines, ventilators, hospital beds and even crematoriums and cemeteries, he said, adding that ordinary Indians are selling their land, jewellery and expending their savings to ensure treatment for their loved ones.Crematoriums and cemeteries are choked, while parks are being repurposed as cremation grounds, he said.Many state governments, opposition parties, doctors/nurses/allied healthcare organisations, civil society and citizen groups have taken up the mantle and are working collectively on the frontlines in this extraordinary national battle against COVID-19, he added.The leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha also called for free immunisation drive for all citizens and urged him to utilise the Rs 35,000 crore earmarked by Parliament for this purpose.Kharge said India boasts of some of the world’s best scientists, doctors, nurses, allied healtheare staff and has a vast network of community health workers and undoubtedly has the bandwidth and the resources to effectively combat the pandemic. “However, to do so, the Union government must leverage our collective strengths by governing consensually and inclusively.  It is impossible to tackle a crisis of this magnitude through the Prime Minister’s Office alone,” he said.The opposition leader said most nations planned in advance, prioritised their people and put in place contingencies for the anticipated second and third waves of the pandemic.“Experts have warned us that although the situation is dire, it can become far worse if leadership is not immediately exercised.  So, for the well-being of our people and in the national interest, I urge you to consider the suggestions outlined in this letter sensitively and urgently,” Kharge said.

However, BJP MLA from Khanpur Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion’s son Divya Pratap Singh Champion got the jab on May 5.The controversy broke out when pictures of Divya Pratap Singh getting the vaccine shot went viral on social media on Saturday.Doon hospital staff requesting anonymity said the MLA, along with his wife and son, arrived at the medical superintendent’s residence on May 5 and allegedly pressured the doctors to administer the vaccine dose to his son.When contacted, the MLA said his son got the vaccine shot as he is a frontline worker actively involved in stopping the spread of the virus.Further, the MLA’s son got a shot of Covaxin at a time when most people in the state are being administered Covishield vaccine.Covaxin is available only at a select few centres in the state.Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion is not new to controversies. He was in the news a few years ago when a video clip in which he was seen dancing to a popular Bollywood number with guns in his hands went viral.

The BJP-NDA came a cropper. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-poets-facebook-account-suspended-for-posting-satire-clip-on-bjp-poll-defeat-250379
09-05-2021||London||Nirav Modi's appeal against extradition awaits UK High Court judge decision||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, whose extradition to India was ordered last month by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, has filed an application for permission to appeal against the order in the High Court in London.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed an appeal has been lodged but a High Court judge who will make a decision on the matter is yet to be assigned.“The matter has not been sent to a judge for consideration on the papers,” the Administrative Division of the Royal Courts of Justice in London said this week.In the first instance, a High Court judge will make a decision “on the papers” submitted for the appeal and determine if there are any grounds for an appeal against the Home Secretary's decision or the Westminster Magistrates Court February ruling in favour of Modi's extradition to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering.Following that decision, there is scope for the defence team to seek an oral hearing to plead their case. There are no certain time-frames for the legal processes involved, which could take months.“We are waiting to see if they do apply for permission to appeal. If they are allowed to appeal then we would contest any appeal proceedings on behalf of the GOI (government of India),” a CPS spokesperson had said earlier.Meanwhile, 50-year-old Modi remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest over two years ago on March 19, 2019.In his ruling in February, District Judge Sam Goozee said that the diamond merchant has a case to answer before the Indian courts and that the bars to extradition under UK law do not apply in his case.As part of a very comprehensive judgment, the judge concluded that he was satisfied that there is evidence upon which Modi could be convicted in relation to the conspiracy to defraud the PNB.“A prima facie case is established,” he said, in relation to all counts of charges brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED)—including money laundering, intimidation of witnesses and disappearance of evidence.The court had also accepted that while Modi's mental health had deteriorated due to the lengthy incarceration in a London prison, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, his risk of suicide did not meet the high threshold to conclude that it would be "unjust or oppressive" to extradite him.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added on to the CBI case.As witnessed in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya—who remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” matter, believed to be related to an asylum request, is resolved—there is still some way to go before Modi can be moved from Wandsworth Prison in London to Barrack 12 Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai and face trial in India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nirav-modis-appeal-against-extradition-awaits-uk-high-court-judge-decision-250374

09-05-2021||Johannesburg||South Africa detects 4 cases of COVID variant found in India||South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has said that four cases of the Indian variant of coronavirus have been detected in the country, but there was no cause for panic as all such cases were quarantined."The four cases of B.1.617.2 (Indian variant of coronavirus) have been detected in Gauteng (2) and KwaZulu-Natal (2) and all have a history of recent arrival from India. All cases have been isolated and managed according to the national COVID-19 case management guidelines and contact tracing has been performed in order to limit the spread of this variant," Mkhize said in a statement on Saturday.The minister's statement was released amid growing concerns in the last fortnight about the Indian variant spreading after the crew of two ships travelling between the two countries tested positive for the virus."We reiterate that there is no need for panic, as the fundamentals of the public health response (testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine) have not changed," Mkhize said."It is important to emphasise that variants can develop at any time in any country so they do not have to be imported. The world is still grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, with surges in one territory bound to spill over into other territories."We are all deeply concerned about the threat of 'variants of concern' and these reports demonstrate that the issue is complicated," the minister said.Mkhize said travel restrictions will need to be balanced against the scientific realities in order to protect the economy."These findings are urgently being processed by the government and announcements pertaining to travel regulations will be made after all appropriate consultations have been undertaken by the Cabinet," he said.Mkhize did not specify if any of the four Indian variant cases were among the crew of the ships which recently returned from India. One of the ships has been docked in Durban in KwaZulu-Natal. The other ship has been docked in Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth), where police are investigating possible charges against the Ship Captain for falsely declaring that there were no ill crew onboard.Eleven cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, first detected in the UK, have also been identified in South Africa."The B.1.1.7 (strain) has been detected in community samples and this therefore suggests that community transmission of B.1.1.7 has already set in," Mkhize said."As the epidemic progresses, the detection of new variants is inevitable. The work of genomic surveillance assists us to detect the variants and understand their behaviour and to refine vaccines so they remain effective," he said.The B.1.351 strain, which was first detected in South Africa, has been found in a traveller from Bangladesh."There are a number of other samples from cases with a history of recent travel into South Africa that are currently being sequenced and results are expected over the next few days," Mkhize concluded.The coronavirus has so far killed 54,687 people in South Africa, along with over 1.59 million confirmed cases, according to John Hopkins University.The Indian variant is believed to be largely behind the current surge in infections in India, which is experience a deadly second wave of the pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/south-africa-detects-4-cases-of-covid-variant-found-in-india-250364

Hence, I have bought all that is necessary to run a home, including cereals and pulses and the necessary medicines for my parents and other family members."While the MK Stalin government has allowed shops to function till 9 p.m. on Sunday, from Monday onwards, fish and meat stalls will be allowed to function everyday till noon with 50 per cent capacity.Manoj says: "Unlike earlier lockdown this time people have got time to stock the necessary items and we have made use of this."Last April. when the government announced a four-day complete lockdown, only a nine-hour window was there and hence there was panic buying in all shops.Another important factor pointed out by the health department officials is that the mask awareness has not yet reached the desired level. Police were also seen taking extra measures to find out whether people are wearing masks and have conducted awareness among the motorists on masks.People are also travelling out of Chennai to their hometowns, especially IT professionals as they have the option to work from home.Srinivas Nair, an IT professional with an MNC while speaking to IANS said: "I am from Aluva in Kerala and I am driving down today and have already registered for the Kerala government. We can work from home and there is no point in staying here."However, as Kerala is also on a lockdown, I have stocked the necessary items to tide over this period.

That will be the case with the G7 meeting today as well,” he had posted hours after an in-person meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and UK Home Secretary Priti Patel.“There is concern the EAM might have been exposed to the virus. We will go by the British health authorities’ tracking and testing system. We are concerned about our delegation. We are happy no one is unwell. We would not like to confirm the story,” sources had then said.“It is not a straight-forward case. We are trying to work out with UK health authorities about the level of exposure. The travel plans of the delegation back to India will depend on exactly what the UK health authorities will say. The External Affairs Minister is well,” they had added.Jaishankar had arrived in London on Monday for a four-day visit on the invitation of UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to join the G7 Foreign and Development Ministers’ meeting as one of the guest ministers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/false-alarm-says-jaishankar-on-diplomats-testing-ve-in-london-250160

PMs Modi and Costa also jointly wrote an Op-ed in the prestigious European media portal ‘Politico’, emphasising trade and investment ties, supporting effective multilateralism and a rules-based order.The meeting provided a platform to the leaders of India and the EU to exchange views on key topical issues of mutual interest. The three broad clusters of discussions were: trade, technology and connectivity, Covid, environment and climate change, and foreign policy, security and regional issues, said MEA’s Secretary (West) Vikas Swarup at a media briefing.PM Modi and the EU leaders sought to give a push to bilateral commerce by welcoming the decision to resume negotiations for balanced and comprehensive free trade and investment agreements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/support-waiver-on-vaccine-patents-pm-modi-urges-eu-250161

A generic molecule and analogue of glucose, it can be easily produced and made available in plenty in the country.How it worksThe drug has been developed by DRDO’s Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Hyderabad. It comes in powder form and is taken orally by dissolving it in water. The drug accumulates in virus-infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production.Covid hospitals can accept over Rs2L cashThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has issued an order to allow hospitals and nursing homes treating Covid patients to accept over Rs2 lakh in cash. The provision will be effective from April 1 to May 31, 2021. TNSClinical trial results have shown that this molecule helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplementary oxygen dependence. “Higher proportion of patients treated with 2-DG showed RT-PCR negative conversion in patients,” the MoD said. It was found that 42 per cent patients, who were administered two sachets of the drug daily, were off oxygen support by the third day. The medicine has been found effective even in patients above 65 years of age.Company-wise Remdesivir supply planThe Centre on Friday issued a company-wise supply plan of Remdesivir for states/UTs up to May 16. The plan has been prepared in consultation with various marketing companies.In April last year, DRDO scientists conducted experiments with the help of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, and found that this molecule worked effectively against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Based on these results, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) permitted Phase II trials in May-October and the drug was found to be safe and effective.Congress for nationwide lockdownThe Congress on Saturday accused the Centre of abject failure in protecting the lives of people and urged a nationwide lockdown. Rahul Gandhi hit out at the PM for ‘not utilising the vax budget’. TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/regulator-nod-to-drdos-covid-drug-trials-show-fast-recovery-less-oxygen-need-250110

Modelling suggested falsely that India had reached herd immunity. At times, the Modi government seemed more intent on removing criticism on Twitter than trying to control the pandemic,” the editorial dedicated to India said. It took note of how the Modi government allowed religious festivals and huge political rallies giving a message that Covid-19 was essentially over.“This slowed the start of India’s vaccination campaign, which has covered less than 2 per cent of the population,” said the Lancet, adding that at a federal level, India’s vaccination plan fell apart as the government “abruptly shifted course expanding vaccination to everyone older than 18 years, draining supplies”.The Lancet advised India to rationalise the vaccine policy and implement it with due speed now.“Genome sequencing needs to be expanded to better track and understand more transmissible variants,” the comment elaborated, noting, “Modi’s actions in attempting to stifle criticism and open discussion during the crisis are inexcusable.”Citing a grim estimate by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation that India will see 1 million Covid deaths by August 1, The Lancet said if that were to happen, the government would be responsible for presiding over a self-inflicted national catastrophe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/provide-responsible-leadership-own-up-mistakes-lancet-tells-modi-govt-250120
