14-05-2021||New Delhi||Low-key Eid celebrations in Delhi amid COVID-19 restrictions||The vast expanse of Jama Masjid’s courtyard wore a deserted look and families stayed home on Friday as Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations remained a low-key affair in the city amid the COVID-19 restrictions.The celebrations, marking the end of the holy month of Ramzan, which would have been an opportunity to meet and greet relatives and friends in a different time and year, was limited to a timid affair due to the unrelenting scare of the coronavirus infection.Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Ahmed Bukhari said the celebrations were affected because of the pandemic.“People were troubled this year. The happiness that comes with Ramzan and Eid was also missing. Some were sick, there were so many deaths. Even if somebody dies in the neighbourhood, a Hindu or Muslim, it affects you personally,” Bukhari told PTI.He said usually people come to his house throughout the day on Eid, but “today we only talked on phone or conference calls”.Delhi-based student Kulsum Jaha rued that there were no guests at her home this time.“Usually there are guests throughout the day. The number of dishes also reduced so much. It’s just not the same this year. And the COVID situation is just so scary,” she said.This was the third time in a row that Eid was celebrated in a subdued manner in the national capital. Last year, Eid-ul-Fitr in May and Eid-ul-Azha in July were celebrated under the shadow of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.It was “almost a norm” for Adnan Saifi, manager at a healthcare company, to go out for iftar and host parties in the month of Ramzan, but the pandemic has restricted all such social meetings and Eid was “no different”.“Eid was also no different. No shopping, no congregational prayers, no visits and no elaborate menu at home, Eid seemed like just another weekend with good food and no work. However, being alive and healthy in this COVID era is like an Eid itself,” Saifi said.Delhi reported 8,506 new cases, the lowest since April 10, on Friday with a positivity rate of 12.40 per cent, even as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal pointed out that the number of serious patients has not declined much as ICU beds in hospitals are still full.The less number of fresh cases can also be attributed to a smaller number of tests -- 68575 -- conducted on Thursday.Delhi University student Afrida Sneha Wazbee also missed the “fun affair” of getting to meet family and friends, and having “yummy food” to on Eid.“Normally, we used to send people food or we used to receive food during the month of Ramzan but because of the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and fear of the virus, we weren’t able to do that. Getting to meet relatives, family and friends—visiting them, eating the yummy food, be it Pulao, chicken, etc. It was overall a fun affair,” she said.However, this year Ramzan felt “more spiritual” for her, as “we had a lot of time, and we did end up reading the Quran and offering namaz”.

14-05-2021||Beijing||China says price hike in anti-COVID medical supplies to India due to import of raw materials||China on Friday said the prices of some of the COVID-19 medical supplies like oxygen concentrators being procured by Indian companies from Chinese manufacturers have gone up as they had to import raw materials from Europe to meet the excess demand from India.Responding to a question from the official media here on India’s Consul General in Hong Kong Priyanka Chauhan’s recent remarks calling on China to stop surging prices of medical supplies to India, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing that China has been encouraging its companies to meet India’s procurement to meet the country’s surge in coronavirus cases.Soaring prices of medical supplies like oxygen concentrators and disruption of cargo flights to India are slowing arrivals of medical goods, Chauhan said this week.On price increases, especially of the oxygen concentrators, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that the feedback from the Chinese manufacturers suggests that they had to import raw materials to meet the excess demand from India.“As for the price issue you mentioned, it is a market factor determined by supply and demand. … Taking oxygen concentrators as an example, one reason is that the increase in demand affected global supply chains. Besides, due to shortage of raw materials which need to be imported from Europe, production capacity is affected,” Hua said in updated comments on the Chinese Foreign Ministry website.“What’s more, Indian buyers usually make the same demand through various channels and sometimes buy products through different channels. This has overly inflated demand, which has to some extent affected market order and pushed up prices.“In early 2020, when China was at the most difficult time of response, we have the same problems. Therefore, we hope all sides can work together to ensure that supply chains are kept open and stable,” she said.About Chauhan’s call to increase the cargo flights, Hua said, “we agree with the remarks by the Indian Consul General in Hong Kong that supply chains should remain open and stable”.“We hope all parties can take concrete actions to ensure that the global industrial and supply chains are stable and open. No one should intentionally disrupt and undermine the openness and stability of the global supply chains out of political agenda”, she said.The cargo flight disruptions were amplified by the decision by Sichuan Airlines to suspend all its 11 cargo flights for 15 days from April 26, citing the coronavirus the situation in India.Though the state-run airline said it is reviewing its plans to restore the flights, it is yet to do so.According to freight forwarders in Shanghai, Sichuan Airlines has announced plans to restore three of its freight flights from Chongqing and Xian to Delhi from May 17.“We are following reports on the situation in India and sympathise with the sufferings of the Indian people. China was one of the first countries to offer support and assistance to India”, Hua said.“Since the outbreak of the new wave of the epidemic in India, the Chinese government has been encouraging and guiding Chinese enterprises to work in a cooperative manner to facilitate India’s purchase of all kinds of anti-epidemic supplies,” she said.“Many Chinese companies and civil institutions are taking actions and providing various kinds of assistance to the Indian side in their own ways”, she said.Giving details of the materials procured by India recently, she said In April, China exported to India over 26,000 ventilators and oxygen concentrators, over 15,000 patient monitors and nearly 3,800 tonnes of medicinal materials and medicines.Chinese companies have received Indian orders for over 70,000 oxygen concentrators and are working around the clock to deliver them as soon as possible, she said.In addition, India has a strong demand for vaccines raw materials including auxiliary materials, she said.Since the beginning of this year, Chinese companies have provided more than 10 tonnes of such materials to India with more than 20 tonnes expected to be delivered soon, the spokesperson added.

Even online or offline examinations not feasible because of an unprecedented pandemic. Delay in the declaration of Class 12 results will hamper students taking admission in foreign universities”, the petition said.The petition filed by lawyer Mamta Sharma has made the Centre, Central Board of Secondary Education and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination as parties in the case.The plea contended that due to the unprecedented health emergency and surge in COVID-19 cases in the country, it is not possible to conduct examination and any further delay would cause irreparable loss to the future of students.Meanwhile, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) said on Friday that it has not taken any decision yet on class 12 board exams even as a section of students and parents have been demanding cancellation of exams in view of the pandemic situation.The board had on April 14 announced cancellation of class 10 exams and postponed class 12 exams in view of surge in COVID-19 cases.

14-05-2021||New Delhi||Online medical consultation service by retired military doctors rolled out for entire country||A free online medical consultation service launched by retired military doctors in view of a massive surge in coronavirus cases in India was on Friday extended to citizens across the country, officials said.The defence ministry roped in retired military doctors to provide online consultations to civilian patients under a telemedicine platform.The service was rolled out on May 7 for Uttar Pradesh and extended to Rajasthan and Uttarakhand days later as more veteran defence volunteer doctors came on board.Currently, 85 veteran defence doctors are providing their services on the portal and have provided online consultation to more than 1,000 patients, according to the defence ministry.“After the successful roll out in three states, ex-defence OPD, now renamed as Defence National OPD, has been rolled out pan-India on May 14 and is available on www.esanjeevaniopd.in,” it said in a statement.It said the vast experience of the military doctors is being optimally utilised.“This initiative will go a long way in obtaining necessary medical advice and consultation in the safe environment of patients’ homes, avoiding unnecessary visits to hospitals and increasing the risk of getting infected with COVID and overburdening the limited health resources,” the ministry said.The service was launched under the e-Sanjeevani OPD platform of the Union health ministry.The e-Sanjeevani OPD is a flagship telemedicine platform of the government developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/online-medical-consultation-service-by-retired-military-doctors-rolled-out-for-entire-country-252869
14-05-2021||Chitrakoot (UP)||Chitrakoot prison shootout: Three inmates killed; probe ordered||Three prisoners were shot dead inside the Chitrakoot district jail on Friday, police said.The three inmates gunned down in the district jail at Ragauli were identified by police as Anshu Dixit, Merazuddin alias Meraj Ali and Mukeem Kala, belonging to Sitapur, Ghazipur and Shamli in Uttar Pradesh.“Dixit shot dead Ali and Kala, and held some other prisoners at gunpoint and threatened to kill them. He was later killed in an exchange of fire with police,” Chitrakoot Range Inspector General of Police K Satyanarain said.Asked how did a firearm reach Dixit inside the jail, the IG said, “A judicial probe of the incident has been ordered. Only after the probe, it can be concluded how weapon reached inside the jail.”   Jailor SP Tripathi, however, had earlier said Dixit had snatched the service revolver of a jail staff when the official had intervened in an argument among the inmates.The IG said all three inmates were hardcore criminals and had several criminal cases pending against them.Taking note of the incident, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered a probe into the incident by a joint team of Divisional Commissioner D K Singh, Chitrakoot IG Satyanarain and DIG (Prison) Sanjeev Tripathi.The chief minister also demanded the probe report at the earliest.Police said Sitapur resident Dixit was a contract killer and had been lodged in the jail since December 8, 2019.Dixit had in the past worked for gangster Munna Bajrangi, accused of killing former BJP legislator Krishnanand Rai in 2005 in collusion with BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari, they said.Bajrangi was shot dead by another gangster Sunil Rathi earlier on Jul 9, 2018 in a similar shootout inside Baghpat jail, the police said.Detailing Shamli resident Kala’s alleged criminal antecedents, police said he was involved in 61 cases of murder, dacoity and extortion.In 2016, Kala had been accused by the BJP of being behind triggering a mass exodus of Hindus from Kairana in Shamli district, the police said adding Kala had been brought to the Ragauli jail from Saharanpur on May 7.Ali, the third prisoner killed inside Ragauli jail was allegedly an active member of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari’s gang.Ali was shifted to Chitrakoot on March 20 from Varanasi jail.The situation inside the jail is now under control, they added.

14-05-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt will bear cost of education and upbringing of children orphaned by pandemic: Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the Delhi government will extend financial help to families which have lost their earning members to the coronavirus and also bear the cost of education and upbringing of children orphaned by the pandemic.He said in the past 24 hours, Delhi has recorded around 8,500 cases as against over 28,000 cases on April 20 and that the positivity rate has come down to 12 per cent as against 36 per cent on April 22.But the fight against the coronavirus has not ended and there is no room for leniency, the chief minister said in an online briefing.“I know many children who have lost both their parents. I want to tell them that I am still there. Do not consider yourself an orphan. The government will take care of their studies and upbringing,” Kejriwal said.“I know elderly citizens who have lost their children. They depended on their earnings. I want to tell them that their son (Kejriwal) is alive. The government will help all such families who have lost their earning members,” the chief minister said.Kejriwal said that such families can be given financial aid but they need care and affection too.“They need empathy. It is my request to all the neighbours and the relatives of such families to take care of them. These families are facing great challenges. Give them love. The two-crore people of Delhi, we are a family. In these times of despair, we need to help each other. On the occasion of the festival of Eid, I pray for the health and happiness of all,” he said.The chief minister said that the lower positivity rate means that a lesser number of people are falling ill in Delhi.The number of people admitted at hospitals has also reduced, he said.“In the past 10 days, the number of patients in hospitals of Delhi has reduced by more than 3,000 patients. Which means that 3,000 beds have become empty. Now, there is no problem being faced to get beds in hospitals, yet one thing to be observed is that the ICU (intensive care unit) beds are still full,” Kejriwal said.While stressing that even till now ICU beds in hospitals of Delhi are almost full, he said that 1,200 new ICU beds have been prepared and are now ready to be utilised by Friday or Saturday.Kejriwal thanked the people of Delhi for following lockdown restrictions. There has been a decline in cases because of the contribution of every person in Delhi, he said.“We imposed a very strict lockdown in Delhi, but the people of Delhi offered their complete support in the same. Everyone adhered to the lockdown completely,” the chief minister said.“Today everyone is talking about how the people of Delhi managed to reduce the number of coronavirus cases. This has been possible only because of the disciplined behaviour of the people of Delhi. But the battle is not won yet. The battle is yet to finish. Even now 8,500 cases have come up. This has to be reduced to zero. We have to end coronavirus entirely,” he said.Kejriwal cautioned Delhiites against any laxity and said that “if we do not take precautions, the cases will increase again”.“Therefore, by no means, we can let loose. The lockdown has to be adhered to strictly and should employ all the ways to ensure protection from the coronavirus. The Delhi government is also not leaving any scope in its arrangements,” he added.The government is preparing more oxygen beds, buying thousands of oxygen cylinders, installing new ICU beds, so that in case the coronavirus cases increase, the national capital is fully prepared, the chief minister said.Delhi had reported 10,489 new cases and 308 more fatalities on Thursday while the positivity rate stood at 14.24 per cent, according to the health department.

The orchestrated incidents in Jerusalem were outrageous and triggered tensions and violence,” Sharma said.He said the escalation of conflict, air attacks on Gaza and the rocket attacks by Hamas have resulted in tragic loss of innocent human lives especially the children and elderly and also injuries to many civilians.The aggravated destruction of public property and infrastructure has caused hardships and disruption, Sharma said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unsc-must-intervene-congress-on-israel-palestinian-conflict-252863

Priorities are being fixed and re-fixed, implementing agencies are being settled and unsettled, quota for West Bengal is being downwardly revised and further downwardly revised every day."We were told we shall get 70 PSA plants, now we are told that we shall get four in the first phase with no clarity on the remaining plants (sic)," she wrote to Modi.PSA plants are expected to boost supply of oxygen to hospitals that are treating COVID-19 patients."I request you to kindly get the priorities, implementing agencies, and quota fixed, justly, fairly and quickly.

14-05-2021|| Hyderabad||Patients die as Telangana stops ambulances from AP||Despite Telangana High Court orders asking the state government not to stop ambulances carrying COVID-19 patients from Andhra Pradesh into Telangana, police on state highways continue to block entries of ambulances. As a result, two patients from Andhra Pradesh died on Friday after Telangana Police did not permit vehicles to cross the interstate border at Kurnool.  Andhra Pradesh officials have lodged a strong protest with their Telangana counterparts, saying that despite the acceptance of these patients by hospitals in advance, two natives of Nandyal and Kurnool died in the ambulances due to delay in medical aid. Sources said the development took place at the Panchalingala check-post on National Highway 44, where around 40 ambulances from Andhra Pradesh were forced to return from the Pullur toll plaza over the past few hours.   Reports from Ramapuram cross border post near Suryapet had similar tales to tell. Telangana is currently under lockdown, but medical emergencies are allowed movement. Police sources said that only ambulances without online permissions were stopped. As COVID-19 cases rise in Andhra Pradesh, critically-ill patients are being brought to Hyderabad, which puts pressure on bed availability and medical care in the state capital. However, as per directions, only people with e-permit and confirmation from the hospital can cross the borders.   In Hyderabad, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories administered the first dose of the Sputnik V vaccine, which had landed in India on May 1, to a recipient in Hyderabad on Friday. Dr Reddy is expected to roll out more vaccines by next week. The imported doses of the vaccine are presently priced at Rs 948 plus 5 per cent GST per dose.“With the rising cases in India, vaccination is the most effective tool in our battle against COVID-19. Contributing to the vaccination drive in India is our biggest priority right now to help Indians be healthy and safe.”, GV Prasad, co-chairman and managing director, saidDespite several fatalities, there are claims that a 110-year-old man has recovered from moderate COVID-19 symptoms at Gandhi hospital, which, if true, makes him one of the oldest patients in the country to recover from the disease.  Living in an older adults’ home, Ramananda Teertha, Gandhi Hospital superintendent Raja Rao said that Teertha was admitted with mild symptoms but had now recovered from COVID-19, and his oxygen saturation levels have risen to 97. There is, however no confirmation about the exact age of the centenarian.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/patients-die-as-telangana-stops-ambulances-from-ap-252851
14-05-2021||Guwahati||Death of 18 elephants in Assam 'mysterious', say experts||Even as the authorities are saying that the 18 wild elephants were killed after being struck by a massive 'lightning bolt in central Assam's Nagaon district, the wildlife experts are saying the tragic incident is very "mysterious" and demanded a thorough probe.Nagaon district Deputy Commissioner Kavitha Padmanabhan said that a team comprising wildlife, forest and veterinary department officials went to the forest areas to ascertain the exact cause of the deaths of 18 elephants including calves on Wednesday night in the mountainous Kandali Proposed Reserve Forest (PRF)."Before getting the reports of the official team, I am unable to give all the details of the 18 dead elephants," Padmanabhan told IANS over phone.Various organisations and wildlife experts have demanded in-depth inquiry by independent agencies to know the exact reasons for the death of so many wild elephants at one time.Wildlife expert and former top official of the Assam government Annarwaruddin Choudhary demanding a thorough probe termed the incident as very mysterious."If the elephants died due to the thunderbolt, there might be some burn injuries and other effects of the lightning at the spot. But whatever visuals I have seen there are some doubts about the nature of the death of the elephants," Choudhary told IANS over phone.He said that the bodies of the animals were scattered in the jungle and circumstantial signs of 'lightning' were not visible clearly."Only the post-mortems of the bodies of the dead elephants would reveal the cause of the deaths," he added.Green Guard Nature Organisation (GGNO) Secretary General Rituraj Phukan said that there is no telltale evidence visible in the images and videos circulating on social media."The GGNO, which has been working in the area since two decades, requested the government to conduct a thorough and independent inquiry to assuage the concerns of conservationists and wildlife lovers all over the world," said Phukan.Following the directions of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Environment and Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya accompanied by senior forest, wildlife and veterinary department officials visited the forest areas on Friday.After visiting the area Suklabaidya tweeted: "The preliminary report of enquiry has been asked to be submitted within three days and a detailed investigation report within 15 days. We will unravel the exact reason behind their tragic deaths soon." Assam's Forest (Wildlife) Department has constituted an 8-member team headed by Deputy Conservator of Forest (Publicity) K.K. Deori to probe the death of the 18 elephants.Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (WL) and Chief Wildlife Warden M.K. Yadava issued a notification constituting the inquiry committee which would submit a preliminary report within three days and the final report within fifteen days.The notification said that the investigating officer would undertake detailed investigation of the site including water and salt lick quality, and may engage experts and agencies for the purpose, and carry out detailed fact-finding from fringe communities and first informants.Yadava, quoting local wildlife officials, said that 18 elephants have died and lightning is the most likely cause of the deaths.Local people informed the forest officials that the carcasses of the elephants were scattered at different places in the deep forest area.Yadava said that cases are often reported of lightning striking animals and five elephants had died due to this in West Bengal recently, but Wednesday's incident in Nagaon is huge and terrible.The district has had cases of man-animal conflicts.The world-famous Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNP & TR), one of India's seven UNESCO world heritage sites in the natural and environment category since 1985, also falls in five districts of Assam, including Nagaon. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/death-of-18-elephants-in-assam-mysterious-say-experts-252850

14-05-2021||New Delhi||30-year-old woman from 'Love You Zindagi' viral video succumbs to Covid; netizens mourns loss||After battling COVID-19 for around 10 days, a woman, who came to be known as the 'Love You Zindagi' girl on Twitter after a video of her swaying to the Bollywood hit while getting oxygen at a hospital went viral, has succumbed to the infection. The doctor treating her on Friday said the woman's family does not want her identity to be revealed. On May 8, Dr Monika Langeh, a doctor at a hospital in Delhi, tweeted a video where the 30-year-old woman, while on non-invasive ventilation (NIV), was listening and swaying to the Bollywood song—Love You Zindagi which featured Shahrukh Khan and Alia Bhatt. "It was a stressful situation when she was admitted. There were no beds available at that time. We admitted her in the COVID emergency ward and were managing her."She  was given the best treatment possible. Remdesivir and plasma therapy was also given to her. But her condition deteriorated, and she did not respond well to the treatment," Langeh said.She was on the ventilator for the last three days and passed away on Thursday night, Langeh said.What struck Langeh about the woman was her fighting spirit and her zest for life."While I was on rounds in the COVID emergency ward, she was playing songs but with a great deal of trepidation. I asked her about her taste in music. "Swaying to the music she was listening, she said she liked Punjabi as well as romantic songs. I gave her the hotspot from my phone, and she started listening to the 'Love you Zindagi' song and it was then that I made the video," Langeh said.Langeh said she has seen many coronavirus patients, but this woman was different."As soon as patients get to know that they have contracted the virus, they develop anxiety and we have to counsel them a lot. But she was different. She had a strong will power," the doctor recalled.Langeh then helped the woman download a music app from which she would regularly listen to songs. The woman was later moved to the ICU."While she was in the ICU, her family members—right from the elderly to the young ones—would send audio messages encouraging her and saying things like—we are waiting for you and come back soon'. They also told her that they would go out for an outing after she comes back. "Her family members were mentally strong and despite knowing that she was in a critical condition and might not make it, they never once made her feel bad," she said.The woman is survived by her husband and five-year-old child."Her husband was crying yesterday and saying what would he tell his child, and how will he face him when the child asks me about his mother? I am shattered. I had developed a bond with her. I have seen patients much more critical than her recovering but it is sad that she couldn't survive," the doctor said.I am very sorry..we lost the brave soul..ॐ शांति .. please pray for the family and the kid to bear this loss🙏😭 https://t.co/dTYAuGFVxk  The woman's husband had also contracted the infection but recovered in home isolation.Bollywood actor Sonu Sood, who has been extending help to people during the COVID-19 pandemic, also mourned her demise."So so sad, never ever she would have imagined that she won't be able to see her family again. Life is so unfair. So many lives which deserved to live are lost. No matter how normal our life becomes but we will never be able to come out of this phase," he said in a tweet.So so sad, never ever she would have imagined that she won't be able to see her family again.

14-05-2021||New Delhi||Armed forces rope in Battlefield Nursing Assistants to help in Covid care||The armed forces have roped in Battlefield Nursing Assistants (BFNA) to help fight the second wave of COVID-19 and have suggested that a similar model can be followed by state governments and hospitals, according to senior officials.Lt General Madhuri Kanitkar, the Deputy Chief of Integrated Defence Staff (Medical), believes BFNAs can also train young volunteers to help relieve trained nurses of administration duties so that they can be gainfully utilised for more important duties in the fight against the pandemic.The armed forces are pulling out all available resources to augment its 'Ops CO-JEET', a joint effort of the Army, the Indian Air Force and the Navy against the pandemic, and have deployed BFNAs at COVID-19 care centres.BFNAs are generally trained in providing basic health care facilities in combat situation which include administering injections and helping in breathing exercise, Lt Gen Kanitkar said.The armed forces are even helping the state administrations by putting to use their personnel and military resources to provide succour to the needy, but more is required to be done in these testing times and, therefore, volunteers from the society are needed to assist the state governments, she said.Lt Gen Kanitkar also said a large number of Battlefield Nursing Assistants who are trained in basic medical care have been brought in for COVID-19 management."We have created a mechanism where we are trying for a dedicated buddy for 25 patients," the Lt General said.Already the fresh COVID-19 wave has been treated as a war and the armed forces have launched the operation "CO-JEET" which encompasses psychological measures to allay fears and panic and augmentation of medical facilities to combat the disease.Carrying on with the belief of 'conviction theory' that "in times of stress, if you have someone to talk to, it makes a huge difference", Lt Gen Kanitkar said the nursing assistants from the Army, the IAF and the Navy would reassure COVID-19 patients that everything will be fine soon."In case of need, these soldiers who are already trained in providing basic nursing aid during combat operations would help in respiratory issues by making the patients do breathing exercise," she said.The "Co-JEET" operation has engaged the personnel of the three wings of the armed forces—the Army, Indian Air Force and the Navy—to help restore the oxygen supply chain, setting up of COVID-19 beds and providing help to civilian administration in their fight to control the pandemic.The Department of Defence created a Covid crisis Management Committee. The CO-JEET stands for Co-workers of all the three services who will finally have 'Jeet' (victory) over Covid.Having vaccinated close to 98 per cent of the workforce, the services are pitching in every field of national effort towards COVID-19 relief while maintaining seamless coordination with government machinery to ensure optimisation of medical efforts.This move is part of the concerted efforts to upgrade the facilities of armed forces' hospitals which are being run beyond their capacity by the depleted medical manpower, she added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/armed-forces-rope-in-battlefield-nursing-assistants-to-help-in-covid-care-252831

Sorties by boats are being made in the river.Besides, local authorities have been directed to raise awareness among elected representatives of local bodies, and involve them in the campaign.Alarmed at reports of a large number of dead bodies found floating in the Ganges in Buxar and nearby Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh, the Ministry had taken up the matter with Chief Secretaries of the Ganga's basin states Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, and Jharkhand. The alarm was on account of suspicion that the dead bodies were related to COVID-19 infection. Director-General of NMCG Rajiv Ranjan Mishra in a letter to the Chief Secretaries had asked for a strict order to local authorities to stop the dumping of dead bodies in Ganga and its tributaries to prevent pollution.The Ministry vide NMCG had also issued an advisory to these states.The source said that water and crime are state subjects, and the Union Ministry could only appeal to state governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bodies-in-ganga-bihar-promises-to-remedy-situation-after-union-jal-shakti-ministry-intervenes-252830
14-05-2021||New Delhi||Kejriwal govt ‘failed’ in oxygen storage & distribution, has ‘criminal liability’ for deaths: BJP||The BJP on Friday alleged that the “criminal liability” for the death of many patients in two Delhi hospitals due to lack of oxygen falls on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying his government “failed” in proper distribution and storage of the life-saving gas.Citing a report by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), a central agency, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Delhi government on a few occasions returned the liquid medical oxygen supplied to the national capital because it had no storage capacity and even asked neighbouring states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to keep the additional quota in reserve.All this while Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia kept blaming the Centre and other states for the oxygen crisis and accused the Central government of meting out “step-motherly” treatment to the city, Patra said, adding that it was the chief minister who treated his own people in a “step-motherly” way.“The way you work has been exposed today.... The (oxygen) crisis could have been averted and managed. I am sorry to tell Arvind Kejriwal that the crisis was grossly mismanaged by you. I hope you and Sisodia will answer and apologise too. Your work has been all about spreading confusion,” Patra said at a virtual press conference.Citing one incident, the BJP leader said Linde plant in Faridabad was expected to supply 120 MT liquid medical oxygen to Delhi on May 9 but the local government sent 74 MT back due to non-availability of storage space or less demand in Delhi.The Delhi government could not prepare for the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic despite the Centre’s warnings to all states, and has worked only to spread confusion and do politics over the crisis, he claimed.While it kept seeking more oxygen, it could not make arrangements for storing the gas, he said.“Due to AAP government’s inability to build storage, 20 and 13 patients lost their lives in Jaipur Golden Hospital and Batra Hospital. Both hospitals had tried to contact the Aam Aadmi Party government but it did nothing. The criminal liability is on you, Arvind Kejriwal,” Patra alleged.

14-05-2021||New Delhi||National platform to determine impact of COVID-19 vaccines to be established soon||A national tracking platform will be established soon to determine the impact of the jabs against COVID-19 and the breakthrough infections that are likely to occur among those with complete and partial immunisation, official sources said.The recommendation of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) to establish such a platform has been accepted by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 and the Union Health Ministry, they said."The COVID-19 Working Group which is part of NTAGI has strongly recommended to urgently establish a national vaccine tracking platform to determine the impact of the COVID vaccine(s) and the breakthrough infections that are likely to occur among those with complete and partial immunisation," said Dr N K Arora, the INCLEN Trust chairperson who heads the COVID-19 Working Group.The vaccine tracker will be particularly important to monitor the impact of increasing the dosing schedule of Covishield, he said, as the government on Thursday accepted the working group's recommendation to extend the gap between the two doses of the Covishield vaccine from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks.The current data harmonisation work of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and other agencies can be leveraged to set up this facility for review of ground realities on real-time basis, the NTAGI has recommended.The government panel has also recommended that pregnant women may be offered the choice to take any of the COVID-19 vaccines and that lactating women can be inoculated any time after delivery.The NTAGI has also stated that those having laboratory test proven SARS-CoV-2 illness should defer COVID-19 vaccination for six months after recovery, the sources said.According to the health ministry's current protocol, vaccine is to be taken four to eight weeks after recovery from COVID-19 infection and pregnant and lactating women are not to be administered the shots.The NTAGI recommended that all pregnant women visiting for antenatal care (ANC) may be informed about risks and benefits associated with Covishield and Covaxin. Based on the information provided, a pregnant woman may be offered the choice to take any of the vaccines.An educational tool comprising information on risk of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, benefits associated with the vaccination and rare complications associated with vaccines like thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (with Covishield) may be developed.In case of individuals who have received the first dose and before completion of the dosing schedule if they test positive for COVID-19, they should wait for 4-8 weeks after clinical recovery from the illness.Also, COVID-19 patients who have been given anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma may defer vaccination for three months from the day of discharge from hospital, the recommendations stated.Individuals having any other serious illness requiring hospitalisation or ICU care should also wait for 4-8 weeks before getting the vaccine, it added.

The senior official confirmed that 13 more patients, admitted in various COVID-19wards in the GMCH, died during the wee hours of Friday.The number of patients who have died during the "dark hours (between 2 am and 6 am) at the hospital has touched 75 in the last four days.As per state government statistics, 26 patients had died at the GMCH during the wee hours of Tuesday, followed by 21 on Wednesday, 15 on Thursday and 13 on Friday (total 75).The HC is hearing a bunch of petitions on recent death of COVID-19 patients at the GMCH allegedly due to lack of medical oxygen.The Goa government had told the HC on Thursday that during the process of attaching the oxygen manifold there was some interruption, which results in fall of pressure in the supply lines of oxygen to patients.""We were explained that during this process there was some interruption, which resulted in fall of pressure in the supply lines of oxygen to the patients."It was pointed out that it is basically on account of these factors some casualties may have taken place," the bench had said."We expect the state administration to find out ways and means to overcome these logistical issues so that precious life is not lost on account of any deficiencies in the matter of supply of oxygen to patients," the HC had said.Reacting to the deaths, Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai said the high court should "take over the affairs of the state as there is collapse of governance". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/13-more-covid-19-patients-die-at-goa-gmch-toll-reaches-75-in-four-days-252808

Students will be given at least a 15-day notice before the exams are conducted," a board official had then said. The CBSE had earlier this month announced the marking policy for class 10 board exams.According to the policy, while 20 marks for each subject will be for internal assessment as every year, 80 marks will be calculated on basis of the students' performance in various tests or exams throughout the year.Schools across the country were closed in March last year to contain the spread of COVID-19 ahead of a nationwide lockdown.Several states started reopening the schools partially from October last year, but physical classes were again suspended because of the rise in coronavirus cases.Last year, the board exams had to be postponed mid-way in March. They were later cancelled and the results were announced based on an alternative assessment scheme.With 3.43 lakh people testing positive for coronavirus in a day, India's COVID-19 tally of cases climbed to 2,40,46,809, while the death toll rose to 2,62,317 with 4,000 fresh fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-decision-yet-on-pending-class-12-board-exams-says-cbse-252797

He appreciated Arvind from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh for providing training to young farmers of his region on organic farming and new farming techniques and Patrick from Car Nicobar in Andaman and Nicobar Islands for large-scale organic farming.He also praised N Vennurama from Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh for guiding more than 170 Adivasi farmers of her region, Revistar from Meghalaya for producing spices like ginger powder, turmeric, cinnamon, etc in the hilly areas of Meghalaya, and Khurshid Ahmed from Srinagar who cultivates vegetables like capsicum, green chilies and cucumber organically.The prime minister said for the first time the farmers of West Bengal would be getting the benefit of this scheme. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who was present on the occasion, said West Bengal has joined the scheme with more than 7 lakh farmers of the state getting the benefit today.The PM lauded the efforts of the farmers who have made a record produce in food grains and horticulture amidst the difficulties during this pandemic and helping in the government’s efforts towards providing free grains.He said the government is also setting new records in procurement at MSP every year.

14-05-2021||Mumbai||Black fungus has claimed 52 lives in Maha so far: Official||As many as 52 people have died due to Mucormycosis, a rare but dangerous fungal infection, in Maharashtra since the COVID-19 outbreak last year, a senior health department official said on Friday.Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, became a much talked about the subject after some recovering and recovered coronavirus patients were found infected with the disease, whose symptoms include headache, fever, pain under the eyes, nasal or sinus congestion and partial loss of vision.As many as 52 people in Maharashtra have died due to the Mucormycosis disease since the COVID-19 outbreak last year. All of them were COVID-19 survivors but succumbed to the black fungus infection, the official told PTI."For the first time, the state health department has compiled a list of deaths caused by black fungus," said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.On Wednesday, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope had said there were 1,500 cases of black fungus in the state, which is in the throes of a severe second wave of COVID-19.Rising Mucormycosis cases, whose treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, is expected to put a further burden on the state's healthcare infrastructure which is already under a strain.The state will float a tender to procure one lakh Amphotericin-B anti-fungal injections to treat Mucormycosis patients, Tope had said a couple of days back.Mucormycosis has a very high fatality rate and this has increased the woes of the health department which has deployed all its resources to combat COVID-19.Mucormycosis was not a notified disease like malaria and hence its cases were not mapped and a database was not prepared, the official said.With the rise in COVID-19 cases and preliminary reports of growing infection of black fungus, the state started creating a database. This exercise revealed that so far 52 people have died due to the black fungus infection, the official said.All the 52 patients died after the coronavirus infection spread in the country. However, very few deaths took place in 2020 in Maharashtra. A sizeable number of deaths have taken place in the current calendar year, he said.As per health experts, Mucormycosis is mostly found among COVID-19 patients who have diabetes, fluctuation in sugar level or increased iron level in the blood.Tope has said patients with suppressed immune system and co-morbidities are vulnerable to contract the disease.As part of a contingency plan to treat Mucormycosis patients, the state government has decided to set up separate wards for them at hospitals attached to 18 medical colleges.The treatment requires multidisciplinary expertise because the fungal infection spreads through the nose, eyes and can reach the brain, Tope has said.The Maharashtra government has already admitted that at least eight patients in the state have lost vision in one eye due to Mucormycosis.

14-05-2021||New Delhi||Blind parents lose only child to virus; couple mourn death of 5-month-old 'Pari' in Delhi||Nine-month-old Krishu, the only child to his blind parents, succumbed to COVID-19 at a Delhi government-run hospital, while his father, battled the deadly virus at another hospital.On Thursday evening, Jitender Singh 'Shunty', a former BJP MLA, buried Krishu in a corner of the Old Seemapuri cremation ground.This was the second time in two days that Singh was burying a child so young.The 59-year-old humanitarian, who has given dignified cremations to over 2,000 strangers during the second wave of COVID-19, buried five-month-old Pari on Wednesday evening, near the spot where Krishu now rests.A relative of Krishu told PTI that the boy was the only child to his parents who live in Dilshad Garden in East Delhi."Both the parents are blind," he said, choking on his tears.Krishu's mother contracted the infection around 18 days ago and since she breastfed the child, he also became ill, the relative said.A few days ago, Krishu was admitted to the Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, where he died in the early hours of Thursday.His father, Shashank Shekar, 26, is battling for his life in the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Tahirpur."He doesn't know he lost his beloved Krishu today. Please do not tell him. Now, I don't want to lose him too," the mother, Jyoti, said, as she broke down over the phone.Pari's father, Prahlad, 30, a resident of Nand Nagri in northeast Delhi, said his 'Laali' had been running high fever for some days."We took her to a private clinic nearby. When her condition deteriorated, we rushed her to Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya in Geeta Colony, where doctors conducted an RT-PCR test, which came out positive," he said.The family was sent to the Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital where Pari was put on ventilator support on May 6.Her mother, Reema, would spend the entire day at the hospital burning incense sticks and praying continuously, the father said."I spent every penny I had, but could not save her," Prahlad rued. Pari succumbed to the infection around 11.30 am."This broke our heart. I had never imagined that I would have to bury such small children here. I won't be able to forget it easily," Singh, the ex-BJP MLA, said, adding that no parent should have to bury their child.Children so young don't even know how to express to their parents what they feel, he said.Asked if he had to bury a child earlier too, Singh said, "Never before had I heard or seen anyone of this age dying due to COVID-19. This is the first I believe. The situation is really scary."

14-05-2021||Washington||Extended gap between 2 doses of Covishield reasonable approach: Fauci||Dramatically ramping up COVID-19 vaccination drive is key to ending the crisis in India and extending the gap between two doses of Covishield is a "reasonable approach," White House chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci told ANI in an exclusive interview on Thursday."When you are in a very difficult situation, the way you are in India, you have to try and figure out ways to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as you can, so I believe that it is a reasonable approach to do," Fauci said.On Thursday, the Government of India announced that the gap between the first and second doses of the Covishield COVID-19 vaccine has been increased to 12-16 weeks - from the existing 6-8 weeks. This is for the second time in three months that Covishield dosage intervals have been widened and this move has once again garnered criticism, as a cover-up for not having enough vaccines for the people in India. However, Dr Fauci said that this "extended interval" is beneficial even from the efficacy standpoint."The fact that you delay it that long, it is very unlikely that it would have a negative effect on the efficacy of the vaccine. I would not refer to it as a cover up when you don't have enough vaccines," Fauci told ANI.India is most likely to roll out Russia's Sputnik V vaccine against the coronavirus to be administered to citizens starting next week. With this, India will now have three vaccines to boost its mega vaccination drive, which was recently opened for those above 18 years. When asked about the efficacy of the Sputnik V Vaccine, "I've heard about the Sputnik, is that, it seems to be quite efficacious, at a high level of close to 90 per cent or so," Fauci responded.Last year, when the US was battling with the surge of COVID-19 cases, the Department of Defense docked two naval warships--USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort--on the coasts of New York and Los Angeles to step up the efforts in combating the virus.Dr Fauci, one of COVID's most trusted names, suggests that India should step up the role of the armed forces in combating COVID-19."You can use the military sometimes to get things done quickly that you otherwise in the private sector would not be able to, for example, I know that there's a shortage of hospital beds right now that people who need to be in a hospital or not getting into a hospital because of the shortage of the beds, you can get the military to put up field hospitals, the same way they would during time of war, that could serve as a substitute for the classic hospital." Fauci told ANI.While replying to a query on resuming travel to India amid the pandemic, Fauci said, "It really is going to depend on the level of infection right now. India has a very very high level of infection. And that would mean that it would be very very difficult to resume travel there right now."As more people around the world become vaccinated and the summer travel season is approaching, countries around the world are scrambling to get digital health certification programs or Vaccine passports in place.However, Fauci says that US borders will not have the vaccine passport mandate. "Several of the airlines may say you're not going to be able to fly on our flight, unless you have a verification that you've been vaccinated, in essence- a vaccine passport, but again to repeat that at least in the United State-that is not going to be mandated from a federal standpoint."India is currently experiencing a devastating surge of COVID-19 with record-breaking cases, hospitalisations and deaths. The country's health care system is teetering on the edge of collapse as hospitals are overcrowded and much-needed medical supplies are in low supply.

Blinken’s exclusion of India is a pointer that the Biden administration will also follow a similar course.Though Pakistan is on the CPC list, it has been given a waiver from sanctions along with Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, both major oil producing nations because “there were important national interests of the US requiring the exercise of the waiver authority”.Blinken did not mention India while he named several others such as Iran, which “continues to intimidate, harass, and arrest members of minority faith groups”.In Myanmar, military coup leaders were responsible for ethnic cleansing and other atrocities against Rohingya.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-spares-delhi-slams-china-for-rights-violation-252591

Thus there was request to create a mechanism so that press could attend the hearings, he said.Urging the media to use the resources (app) responsibly and follow Covid protocol, the CJI said technology, particularly one that is newly developed, was sensitive and might be subject to some flaws in the early days of its use ."Small issues are bound to arise, which should not be unnecessarily magnified. I request everyone to be patient, to be encouraging and supportive to the technical team to ensure that the application works without any problems,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/considering-live-telecast-of-supreme-court-proceedings-cji-252587

14-05-2021||Cooch Behar||West Bengal Governor shown black flags in Cooch Behar||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar was on Thursday shown black flags at Sitalkuchi, where four villagers died after firing by central forces during the elections, while “go back” slogans were raised at Dinhata during his visit to Cooch Behar district to meet people “affected” by the post-poll violence.Earlier in the day, the Governor said he was shocked by incidents of attacks following the West Bengal Assembly elections. “The country is facing a Covid crisis and West Bengal is facing twin challenges of the pandemic and unprecedented post-poll violence only because some people decided to vote as per their own choice,” he maintained. The run-up to the visit was marked by a war of words between the Governor and CM Mamata Banerjee.Posters and placards criticising the visit of the Governor were seen at Jorpatki, the scene of firing by central armed police force (CAPF) that killed four persons on April 10 during the fourth phase polling.A first time voter was also killed at Sitalkuchi while waiting outside a polling booth to exercise his franchise. Dhankhar went to Mathabhanga and Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar district in north Bengal and talked to people who claimed to have suffered attacks at the hands of goons owing allegiance to the ruling Trinamool Congress after the election results were announced on May 2.Women were seen wailing and falling at the Governor's feet claiming that all their belongings had been looted and the men had fled their homes to escape attacks.BJP MP Nisith Pramanik accompanied Dhankhar during his visit to the areas, where the saffron party has alleged loot and attack on its workers by goons owing allegiance to TMC.TMC spokesman Kunal Ghosh, accusing the Governor of partisan attitude, claimed that Dhankhar went to the houses of some BJP workers selectively. He also claimed that Dhankhar was working at the bidding of the BJP and was taking along its leaders during his visit. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-governor-shown-black-flags-in-cooch-behar-252581

He will submit his report.” He went on to add that the Baksar ghat “touches the border of many districts and people go there to cremate bodies”.“We will take appropriate action,” Kumar said. A team of the local police conducted a search operation in the area and found several bodies, sources in the district administration said, but refused to give the count. Authorities in the districts concerned believe that the relatives of the victims who succumbed to the virus might not have had the money or might not have found space for the last rites.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bodies-found-buried-near-ganga-in-unnao-252556

If the two doses were given less than six weeks apart, the efficacy was only 54.9 pc. “It’s a science-based decision. We started with a dosing interval of 4-6 weeks for Covishield which was raised to 6-8 weeks. The UK and WHO recommended an interval of over 12 weeks between the two doses of Covishield. In the UK, millions have been inoculated with the second dose at 12-16 weeks apart from the first,” said VK Paul, chairman, National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration.No changes were recommended for Covaxin dosing with two shots still to be taken 28 days apart.The working group is also learnt to have recommended that Covid-positive patients defer their vaccinations for six months after recovery instead of the present protocol of 4-8 weeks post recovery.It suggested that pregnant women be given an option to inoculate and lactating women be allowed to get vaccines any time after the delivery.

Zydus Cadila vaccine is in the last stage trials and will apply for licensure soon.“We expect over 2 billion doses to be made in India over August to December. Everyone will get vaccines. It takes time. Even the US, which had sufficient stockpiles, has inoculated only 46 per cent of its people aged 45 and above despite starting a month before India. We have covered one- third of our people over 45 years with a single dose.

14-05-2021||Mumbai||Explain how film stars, politicians are procuring, distributing Remdesivir: HC to govt||The Bombay High Court has asked the Union and Maharashtra governments to explain how some film stars and politicians were able to procure and distribute the anti-viral drug Remdesivir despite its shortages.The order was passed during the hearing of PILs on the coronavirus situation on Wednesday but published on the HC website on Thursday evening.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni said that as per previous orders of the Supreme Court and several high courts, Remdesivir was supposed to be allocated to  states only by the Union government.Advocate Rajesh Inamdar, lawyer of one of the petitioners, said while hospitals were running out of key drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, some celebrities and politicians were easily procuring and distributing them in response to pleas on Twitter.The court said it did not want to come in the way of those helping COVID-19 patients, but it has to pass orders in accordance with law.If Remdesivir is being allocated by the central government, "then how the same can be privately available for distribution at the hands of such political and film personalities", the court asked in the order.  "In our opinion, this would certainly amount to hoarding/illegal stocking of such drug," it said.Such a parallel system of distribution of anti-COVID drugs might cause "serious prejudice" to patients in urgent need, the high court further said.Some unscrupulous persons too may take advantage of this for profiteering, the court said."Also, such personalities making the drug available privately, raises a grave question as to its equitable distribution in a system/regime which is set into motion for its allocation," the judges noted.The Maharashtra government and Centre must file reply affidavits explaining how Remdesivir was being "parallely distributed by political and film personalities", the court said.The replies are to be filed by May 19.

Blinken’s exclusion of India is a pointer that the Biden administration will also follow a similar course.Though Pakistan is in the CPC list, it has been given a waiver from sanctions along with Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, both major oil producing nations because “there were important national interests of the US requiring the exercise of the waiver authority”.Blinken did not mention India while he named several others such as Iran which “continues to intimidate, harass, and arrest members of minority faith groups.’’In Myanmar, military coup leaders were responsible for ethnic cleansing and other atrocities against Rohingya and in Russia, authorities harass Jehovah’s Witnesses and Muslim minority groups, he said.In Nigeria, he said courts continue to convict people of blasphemy, sentencing them to long-term imprisonment or even death. Saudi Arabia, he noted, remains the only country in the world without a Christian church, though it has more than a million Christians.China broadly criminalises religious expression and continues to commit crimes against humanity and genocide against Muslim Uyghurs and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.Blinken also announced the designation of Chinese official Yu Hui for arbitrary detention of Falun Gong practitioners.

14-05-2021||New Delhi||Open community kitchen, facilitate transportation of migrant workers: SC||The Supreme Court Thursday directed Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to open community kitchens in the NCR for stranded migrant workers amid the current wave of COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate transportation for labourers who want to return home.Passing a slew of interim directions to ameliorate the miseries of migrant workers facing difficulties in wake of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and restrictions imposed in several parts of India, the apex court directed that dry ration be provided to them in the national capital region (NCR) under ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme’ or any other scheme by the Centre and governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah said the Centre may also issue instructions to the Ministry of Railways to take necessary and adequate measures to cater to the need of migrant workers.The top court passed the order on an application filed by three activists who sought directions to the Centre and states to ensure food security, cash transfers, transport facilities and other welfare measures for migrant workers who are facing distress due to the curbs clamped in several parts of the country amid the pandemic.“NCT of Delhi, state of UP and state of Haryana (for the districts included in the NCR) shall open community kitchen at well-advertised places (in the national capital region) for stranded migrant labourers so that they and their family members who are stranded could get two meals a day,” the bench said.“NCT of Delhi, state of UP and state of Haryana (for the districts included in the NCR) shall ensure that adequate transport is provided to stranded migrant labourers (in the national capital region) who want to return to their home,” it said.It directed that district administration, in coordination with police, may identify such stranded migrant labourers and facilitate their transport either by road or train.“Dry ration to migrant workers in National Capital Region under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme or any other scheme be provided by the Union of India, NCT of Delhi, state of UP and state of Haryana utilising the public distribution system prevalent in each state with effect from May 2021,” the bench said.It said while providing dry ration, the authorities of the states “shall not insist on an identity card for those migrant labourers who do not possess for the time being and on self-declaration made by the stranded migrant labourers dry ration be given to them”.It directed the Centre as well as the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to file their replies to the application suggesting means and measures by which they shall ameliorate miseries of stranded migrant labourers.“We also issue notice on the application to state of Maharashtra, state of Gujarat and state of Bihar to file their reply giving the details of the measures which they propose to take to ameliorate the miseries of migrant workers regarding transportation of stranded migrant workers and providing dry ration as well as cooked meals to the stranded migrant workers,” it said.The bench noted in its order than when nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 24 last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the migrant labourers were the “great sufferers” because of cessation of their employment and they being left with no financial support to sustain themselves, there were large exodus from metro cities like Delhi and Bombay.In May last year, the top court had taken suo motu cognisance of problems and miseries of migrant labourers amid pandemic and had passed a slew of directions, including asking the states not to charge fare from migrant workers and provide them food for free till they board trains or buses.In its order passed on Thursday, the bench referred to the June 9 last year order passed by the top court in which it had dealt with issues, including on taking care of those migrant workers who had returned to their native places after cessation of their employment.The apex court noted that it had granted two-week time to all the states and Union Territories (UTs) to submit affidavits in response to various aspects highlighted in the order and the Centre was also directed to bring on record different schemes which can be taken by migrant labourers for their welfare.The bench noted that by its September 1 last year order, it had granted further two-week time to states and UTs to file their responses and the steps taken on the issues raised earlier by the court.“It appears that most of the states have not filed their specific responses on the aforesaid issues and if filed, they are inadequate,” it said.The bench said as a “last chance”, it is giving further 10-day time to NCT of Delhi, states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Orissa to file their specific responses on the issues more particularly referred in its earlier orders and also the steps taken or to be taken and within how much time.“For the time being we have issued directions to file the response/counter on the aforesaid issues to the aforesaid states only. With respect to other states, further directions shall be issued hereinafter,” it said and posted the matter for hearing on May 24.Referring to resurgence of COVID-19 infections and consequent curbs, activists - Anjali Bharadwaj, Harsh Mander and Jagdeep Chhokar—have filed the fresh interim plea in the suo motu case seeking initiation of welfare measures.

Vaccine will be available for all as we move forward,” Niti Aayog Member V K Paul said, adding by the first quarter of the next year, the number is likely to be three billion.He estimated that between August to December, production of 75 crore doses of Covishield is estimated, while 55 cores doses of Covaxin will be made available.Further, Biological E is expected to produce 30 crore doses, Zydus Cadila 5 crore, Serum Institute of India 20 crore doses of Novavax, and Bharat Biotech 10 crore doses of its nasal vaccine, while Gennova will make available 6 crore doses and Sputnik V 15.6 crore doses.

14-05-2021||New Delhi||Govt increases interval between Covidshield doses to 12-16 weeks||The Centre on Thursday approved extending the gap between the two doses of the Covishield vaccine to 12-16 weeks following a recommendation from a government panel, and said it is a “science-based decision” taken with confidence that there will be no extra risk.However, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) has suggested no change for the dosage interval for Covaxin, the Union health ministry said.“Based on the available real-life evidences, particularly from the UK, the COVID-19 Working Group agreed for increasing the dosing interval to 12-16 weeks between two doses of Covishield vaccine. No change in interval of Covaxin vaccine doses was recommended,” the ministry said.The present gap between two doses of Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, is 6-8 weeks.The Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech’s indigenously developed Covaxin and Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield, being manufactured by the Pune-based SII, are currently being used in India’s inoculation drive against coronavirus.The Central government’s move comes amid reports from several states about shortage of COVID-19 vaccines. Some states and UTs have also reported that they had to suspend its vaccination drive for 18-44 years in view of the scarcity.While Maharashtra decided on Wednesday to suspend its drive to vaccinate people in the age group of 18 to 44 years in view of vaccine shortage, Delhi also temporarily shut Covaxin-administering centres for this age group as it has run out of stock.Several states and UTs including Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana have also decided to opt for global tenders for procurement of anti-coronavirus shots with the domestic supply falling short to meet the rising demand.Asserting that it has been a “science based decision” taken based on the recommendations of the NTAGI, V K Paul, member (Health) NITI Aayog said as per studies, initially the dosage interval between two doses of covishield was  4 to 6 weeks but then as more data became available secondary analysis showed increasing the dosage interval  to 4 to 8 weeks can have some “advantage”.NTAGI is a standing committee which was constituted much before COVID-19 had emerged and works on immunization for children, Paul said, and added that “it looks at scientific data and we must respect the decision of this institution. They make independent decision.” They had seen that the UK by that time had already extended it to 12 weeks and WHO also had said the same, but many nations had not changed the dosage pattern, Paul noted.At that time our science based technical committee anchored by ICMR along with DBT by looking at the available data felt breakthrough infections may increase if the gap is increased beyond eight weeks, Paul said.“So in good faith, based on science, without any pressures, they increased the dosage interval to 4 to 8 weeks. Now based on the available real-life evidences, particularly from the UK, the decision to extend it from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks has been taken with confidence that there will not be an extra risk,” he said.“This is a dynamic decision and, part of periodic review,” Paul added.Asked if the efficacy of the vaccine will be affected with this extension, Paul said, “The efficacy is so good even after the single dose...it’s not a problem at all.”       This is the second time in the past few months that the interval between the two doses of Covishield has been increased. In March, the Union health ministry had asked states and UTs to increase the gap from 28 days to 6-8 weeks. “The recommendation of the COVID-19 Working Group was accepted by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC)....in its meeting on May 12, 2021,” the ministry said.The COVID-19 Working Group is chaired by Dr N K Arora, who is director at the INCLEN Trust.Its members include Dr Rakesh Agarwal, Director and Dean, JIPMER, Puducherry; Dr Gagandeep Kang, professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore; Dr Naveen Khanna, Group Leader, International Centre For Genetic Engineering And Biotechnology (ICGEB), JNU, New Delhi; Dr Amulya Panda, Director, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi; and Dr V G Somani, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).
