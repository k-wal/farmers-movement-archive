12-05-2021||New Delhi/Mumbai||COVID vaccination drive faltering in several states due to vaccine shortage; Maha, Delhi say companies unable to meet demand||As states face an acute shortage of COVID-19 vaccines, Maharashtra decided on Wednesday to suspend its drive to vaccinate people in the age group of 18 to 44 years while Delhi also temporarily shut Covaxin administering centres for them as it has run out of stock.The Tamil Nadu government was the latest to announce global tenders for procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, while the Rajasthan government was also mulling a similar step. Uttarakhand officials said the state will import 20 lakh doses of Sputnik vaccine over the next two months.States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and  Delhi have already opted for global tenders to meet their needs.Amid demands to ramp up domestic supply, Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech have submitted to the Centre their production plan for the next four months, informing that they can scale it up to 10 crore and 7.8 crore doses respectively by August, official sources said.The Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech's indigenously developed Covaxin and Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield, being manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), are currently being used in India's inoculation drive against the coronavirus.While the vaccination drive appeared to be faltering in several states, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan urged them to first focus more on second dose vaccinations.He stressed that India is the fastest country globally to reach the landmark of administering 17 crore doses in 114 days.The minister pointed out that of this, while 13.66 crore people have been administered the first dose, the second dose has been administered to only to 3.86 crore, the ministry said."Hence, it is very important that we first focus more on second dose vaccinations. States should not lose sight of those who are to get the second dose of the COVID vaccine."Seventy percent ought to be allocated to meet the requirement of the second dose, while 30 percent ought to be reserved for the first dose," he was quoted as saying in a statement.Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said SII has informed it that it would be able to provide 1.5 crore Covishield vaccines to the state only May 20 onwards."There is no sufficient supply of vaccine vials by the Centre for inoculation of above-45 age group people. Hence, the state cabinet decided to divert the stock, purchased for the 18-44 age group, for the above-45 age group. Therefore, we are suspending the inoculation of the 18-44 age group for some period," Tope said.Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said Bharat Biotech has informed the Delhi government that it cannot provide "additional" Covaxin doses to the national capital.The stock of Covaxin in Delhi has finished and as a result around 100 vaccination centres set up in 17 schools have been closed, he said.The national capital received 2.67 lakh more doses of Covishield on Tuesday evening and there are 4.18 lakh Covishield doses left for people in the 18-44 age group which can last up to nine days,  AAP leader Atishi said.“The Covaxin manufacturer has in a letter said that it cannot provide Delhi government vaccines due to unavailability, under the instruction of concerned government official. It means that the central government is controlling the supply of the vaccine," Sisodia said.However, Joint Secretary in the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal on Tuesday denied that the Centre had any role to play in the purchase of vaccines by the states.Bharat Biotech Joint Managing Director Suchitra Ella said the company has already dispatched Covaxin lots to 18 states on May 10 and said it was disheartening to listen to some states complaining about Bharat Biotech's intentions regarding the supply of COVID vaccine.“50 of our employees are off work due to covid, yet we continue to work under pandemic lockdowns 24x7 for U," she said in a tweet.The Tamil Nadu government said an allocation of about 13 lakh vaccine doses to the state is not sufficient to cover all those in the 18-45 age group.Hence, "the government has decided to go in for global bids to procure vaccines," an official The Rajasthan government is exploring the possibility of purchasing COVID-19 vaccines from other countries through global tenders, Health Minister Raghu Sharma said.Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, however, said it would have been better if the central government had procured the vaccines by floating global tenders and distributing them to states.The Odisha government informed the Centre that about 22 lakh people in the state are waiting for the second shot and therefore the state requires at least 25 lakh doses of COVID-19 vaccines.The state's Health and Family Welfare Minister N K Das, who joined a virtual meeting of Vardhan , said that the state has been facing an acute shortage of vaccines.Amid rising COVID-19 cases, Kerala also urged the Centre to provide more vaccines.Chief Minister P Vijayan underlined the need for prioritising the vaccination of those in the 18 to 45 age group from the vaccine ordered by the state as there is not enough stock for everyone to be vaccinated in one go.The issue of shortage of vaccines has been used by parties like the Congress, Shiv Sena and the AAP to target the BJP-led central government. They have blamed the current situation on the export of vaccines to other countries early this year.The ruling BJP, however, accused the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday of spreading misinformation on India's vaccination programme and said over 84 percent of the vaccine doses sent abroad were part of the commercial and licensing liabilities of the two Indian manufacturers.Addressing a virtual press conference, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sambit Patra said 1.07 crore vaccine doses sent abroad were India's aid to different countries and noted that of those, 78.5 lakh were dispatched to seven neighbouring countries.A safer neighbourhood is good for India too, he added Meanwhile, leaders of 12 opposition parties wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a free mass vaccination campaign against coronavirus among other steps in the wake of the COVID crisis."Procure vaccines centrally from all available sources - global and domestic. Immediately begin a free, universal mass vaccination campaign across the country. Invoke compulsory licensing to expand domestic vaccine production. Spend budgetary allocation of Rs 35,000 crores for the vaccines," the leaders said in their letter.The signatories to the joint letter include Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former prime minister and JDS leader H D Deve Gowda and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar. Others include chief ministers Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena), Mamata Banerjee (TMC), MK Stalin (DMK), and Hemant Soren (JMM).Also on Wednesday, the Bombay High Court reiterated its earlier order of April 22 in which it asked the Union government to relook at its decision to not initiate a door-to-door vaccination.The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has gone past 17.70 crore, the Union Health Ministry said.The vaccination exercise as a tool to protect the most vulnerable population groups in the country from COVID-19 continues to be regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level, it said.

12-05-2021||New Delhi||SC says open for courts to order house arrest of accused in select cases||Concerned with the overcrowding of jails, the Supreme Court on Wednesday observed that it will be open for the courts to consider ordering house arrest of accused under provision of Criminal Procedure Code.The top court said that regarding post-conviction cases, it is leaving it open to the legislature to ponder over employment of house arrest to the accused in select cases.Referring to overcrowding in jails and the cost to the state in maintaining of prisons, the top court said the concept of house arrest be adopted.A bench of Justices UU Lalit and KM Joseph said, “We may indicate criteria like age, health condition and the antecedents of the accused, the nature of the crime, the need for other forms of custody and the ability to enforce the terms of the house arrest. We observe that under Section 167 (of CrpC) in appropriate cases it will be open to courts to order house arrest”. It said that “we would also indicate under Section 309 also that judicial custody being custody ordered, subject to following the criteria; the courts will be free to employ it in deserving and suitable cases”.The top court’s verdict came on a plea of activist Gautam Navlakha challenging the Bombay High Court order denying him default bail on the ground that charge sheet was not filed by the NIA within a stipulated time under the law.It said that the house arrest has been employed in the United States essentially as an intermediate level penal sanction and upon being found guilty instead of sentencing the convict to a term in prison and in lieu of incarceration, as a condition of probation, the convict is compelled to confine himself to his place of residence.It said that among the advantages which have been perceived in promoting the house arrest, have been avoidance of overcrowding of the prisons and also cost saving. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-says-open-for-courts-to-order-house-arrest-of-accused-in-select-cases-251895
12-05-2021||---||Over 84% Covid vaccines exported were part of the commercial, licensing liabilities: BJP||New Delhi, May 12The ruling BJP on Wednesday accused the Congress and AAP of “spreading misinformation” on India’s vaccination programme, saying that over 84 per cent of vaccine doses sent abroad were part of the commercial and licensing liabilities of the two Indian manufacturers.According to BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, 1.07 crore vaccine doses were India’s aid to different countries. Of which, 78.5 lakh were to seven neighbouring countries. A safer neighbourhood is good for India, too, he said.More than two lakh doses were given to the UN peace-keeping force, in which over 6,600 Indian soldiers are deployed, he added.Targeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, he said “misinformation is being spread that the Narendra Modi government exported over 6.5 crore vaccine doses abroad instead of using them to inoculate Indians”. “This misinformation is being spread that Indians were ignored and vaccines were sent abroad. In this global era, no country can exist as an island and there has to be cooperative globalisation,” he said.Patra said sending over 5.50 crore vaccine doses abroad was the compulsion of the two Indian manufacturers as it was part of their commercial and licensing liabilities. Intellectual property rights over Covishield, manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII), are with AstraZeneca, he said, adding that the SII was obliged to send a part of the vaccines produced by it abroad. The SII and Bharat Biotech, which manufactures Covaxin, had signed to procure raw materials for preparing the jabs.Regarding Kejriwal asking the Centre to share the vaccine formula of the two Indian manufacturers with other capable pharmaceutical companies to scale up production in the country, Patra said the SII cannot do it because it has only been given the sub-licence by AstraZeneca, which has the intellectual property rights over it.The vaccine produced by the Bharat Biotech requires a high level of biosafety, which only a few firms are capable of preparing, and the Centre is holding talks with them, including PSUs, to scale up its production, he added. All institutions are working day and night to boost vaccine production, Patra said, asking Kejriwal and other AAP leaders not to politicise the issue. The BJP leader also trashed the Delhi government’s claim that it had placed orders for over 1.34 crore vaccine doses and cited its letters to say that it only talked of “planning to procure” which, he added, is different from placing an order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-84-covid-vaccines-exported-were-part-of-the-commercial-licensing-liabilities-bjp-251894

12-05-2021||Kolkata||Your planned visit to post-poll violence-hit area violates norms: Mamata to Dhankhar||On the eve of West Bengal   Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s scheduled visit to post-poll violence-affected Cooch Behar district, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday wrote to him claiming that it violates long-standing protocols followed by his predecessors in case of field visits.In her letter, Banerjee also alleged that Dhankhar has been directly communicating with state government officers and dictating them, though she had earlier requested him to refrain from doing so.“I find from social media that you are unilaterally proceeding to Cooch Behar district on May 13 and, sadly, I find that to be violative of the long-standing norms as evolved over several decades. I, therefore, would expect you will kindly follow the well-established norms of protocol, as stated above, and desist from abrupt decisions with regards to field visits,” Banerjee’s letter to Dhankhar read.The CM referred to the ‘Manual of Protocol and Ceremonials’ of the home department of the state government, which says that visits of governors are finalised by the secretary of the governor after obtaining the orders of the government.The governor on Tuesday said that he will visit areas affected by post-poll violence in Cooch Behar district on May 13.Banerjee also referred to her letter written to Dhankhar on September 26 last year, in which she had urged him to “refrain from surpassing the Chief Minister and her Council of Ministers and communicating with and dictating the State officials, in excess of your power under the Constitution and directing them to attend before you”.The CM alleged that the governor is “steadily ignoring” this advice.At least 16 people, mainly from the BJP and the TMC, have been killed in post-poll violence in West Bengal and most of the killings were reported till May 3 when the law and order was under the Election Commission, Banerjee had said on May 6.Political clashes also left a number of people injured in the state since the results of the assembly elections were announced on May 2, when the TMC returned to power in a landslide victory. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/your-planned-visit-to-post-poll-violence-hit-area-violates-norms-mamata-to-dhankhar-251885
12-05-2021||Beijing||India may overtake China as most populous country sooner than UN projections of 2027: Report||Chinese demographers say India will become the world’s most populous country earlier than the United Nations’ projection of 2027, surpassing China where a steady drop in the birth rate has been recorded in the last few years.India is expected to add nearly 273 million people to its population between now and 2050, a UN report said in 2019, forecasting that the country will cross China as the world’s most populous country by 2027. India will remain the most populated country through the end of the current century, the report said. In 2019, India had an estimated population of 1.37 billion and China 1.43 billion, according to the UN figures.The once-in-a-decade census released by China on Tuesday said China’s population grew at its slowest pace to reach 1.41178 billion, keeping its status as the world’s most populous country amid official projections that the numbers may decline from next year.The drop in population was expected to lead to labour shortages and a fall in consumption levels, impacting the world’s second largest economy’s future economic outlook.China’s state-run Global Times daily on Wednesday quoted Chinese demographers as saying that India’s population may overtake China’s well before 2027.With the Chinese birth fertility rates expected to drop in the coming years, demographers predicted that India with its much higher fertility rate will overtake China as the world’s most populous country by 2023 or 2024, earlier than the last UN prediction in 2019, the daily’s report said. Lu Jiehua, professor of sociology at Peking University, said China’s population may peak by 2027 before it starts to decline. Some demographers believe the peak may come as soon as 2022.China is also facing the risk of falling into the trap of low fertility, as it recorded 12 million births in 2020, marking a drop for the fourth consecutive year. China’s total fertility rate of women of childbearing age was 1.3, a relatively low level.The global fertility rate was 2.5 in 2019, as per the UN’s World Fertility and Family Planning, 2020, report.  Liang Jianzhang, an economics professor at Peking University, told the Global Times that China’s fertility rate will continue to drop in the coming years, and may become the world’s lowest. “According to the existing data, in the next 10 years, the number of women aged 22 to 35, which is the childbearing period, will drop by more than 30 per cent compared with the present data”, he said. “Without strong policy intervention, China’s new-born population is likely to fall below 10 million in the next few years, and its fertility rate will be lower than Japan’s, perhaps the lowest in the world,” Liang predicted. In view of the demographic crisis, China stopped the one-child policy in 2016 and allowed two children, but it has had very limited impact to halt the declining population as few people came forward to have a second child. China is expected to lift all restrictions on the number of children that a couple can have.

12-05-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Andhra sees political war emerging over COVID vaccine||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, May 12 Andhra Pradesh has been gripped by what can be called vaccine politics with the state Chief Minister YSR Jagan Reddy accusing former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu of prevailing upon Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech deliberately withholding vaccine supply to the state. The move has gone a step further with the government allowing registering of cases against Naidu in Guntur town and Narasaraopet also in Guntur district for what it calls “fake propaganda over the N44K variant of Coronavirus spread in the state”. In a meeting with officials to take stock of the COVID-19 situation, Jagan Reddy alleged that Naidu has links with Bharat Biotech and that the supply of the vaccine was being hampered at the behest of Naidu. He has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking transfer of technology from the vaccine manufacturer to other pharmaceutical companies. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) that Naidu heads have strongly refuted the charge and said “this was just a ploy to divert public attention from the failure of the government in checking the spread of coronavirus”, TDP leader Pattabhiram Kommareddy told the media. In the police complaint registered against Naidu by two lawyers at Guntur and Narasaraopet saying that the former chief minister had brought the state into disrepute by saying that the N44K, also come to be known as the Andhra Pradesh Variant had brought disrepute to the state, while the facts were untrue. The complaint reads that Naidu said that the new variant was 10-15 times more virulent compared to the original virus. This, the complaint reads, have spread panic among the public. Such comments were demoralising the morale of the government “that was taking all care to check the spread of the virus”, the lawyers have alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-sees-political-war-emerging-over-covid-vaccine-251877

Fairfax wishes to assist India in traversing this incredibly difficult time and are hopeful that our commitment will provide some relief to India and its health-care system," Prem Watsa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited. The centre would provide much-needed relief and treatment for patients requiring oxygen support until they are able to get admission in a hospital.  Besides, the centre would be equipped with a pharmacy, pathology unit, station for nurses, restrooms and a dining area. Suitable drinking water facilities and visitor areas are provided. An ambulance would be on standby round-the clock to cater to emergencies, BIAL said.  The Fairfax-led initiative, in partnership with GiveIndia, is part-funded by Kempegowda International Airport Foundation (KIAF), BIAL said, adding  the initiative will be managed by Fairfax Financial Holdings Group's investee companies – KIAF and Quess Corp Limited. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/150-bed-covid-centre-with-oxygen-support-at-bengaluru-airport-251872
12-05-2021||New Delhi||Transmission of coronavirus through water is not a concern, say experts||Experts on Wednesday said transmission of coronavirus through water is not a concern, after bodies of suspected COVID-19 patients were fished out of the Ganga and Yamuna.Satish Tare, professor at IIT-Kanpur, said dumping of dead bodies in the Ganga or its tributaries or sub-tributaries is a serious matter, particularly at a time when the country is grappling with the COVID-19 crisis.The Ganga and Yamuna are key sources of drinking water for many villages, local bodies along the rivers.The professor, however, stressed that dumping of bodies will not have a significant effect on transmission. Tare said dumping bodies in the Ganga or its tributaries is not new, but it has come down significantly in the last 10-15 years. Dumping of bodies primarily leads to pollution of rivers, he said. Even if the bodies of suspected COVID-19 patients were fished out, there is a lot of dilution that happens (during the flow of water). The effect may not be significant,” he said."If the water is passed for water supply, then it passes through the water supply system. Normal treatment takes care of it,” said Tare, who teaches environmental engineering, water quality and wastewater treatment.He, however, added that there are patches where people draw water directly from the river. But even during this people do exercise caution.Tare is also associated with the National Mission for Clean Ganga, the apex body under the Jal Shakti Ministry that deals with the cleaning of Ganga, its tributaries and sub-tributaries.On Tuesday, the Bihar government fished out 71 bodies from the Ganges in Buxar district, where these were found floating in the river, triggering suspicion that the abandoned corpses could be those of COVID-19 patients.According to Ballia residents in Uttar Pradesh, at least 45 bodies were seen floating at the Ujiyar, Kulhadia and Bharauli ghats in the Narahi area. However, the district authorities did not tell the exact number of bodies found there.On Monday, residents in Hamirpur district spotted five bodies floating in the Yamuna, creating a scare that these were of COVID patients. The bodies were later fished out and cremated.Following this, the Centre on Tuesday asked states along the Ganga to ensure strict vigilance and check future incidences of people dumping bodies in Ganga and its tributaries after 71 corpses were fished out of the river body in Bihar. In a letter to the District Ganga Committees which are chaired by district magistrates/ collectors, the National Mission for Clean Ganga also asked the authorities to dispose of unidentified dead bodies of suspected COVID-19 victims in accordance with safety protocols."Ensure strict vigilance along length of the river within territorial jurisdiction of the district to prevent and check such future incidences of people dumping dead bodies in Ganga and its tributaries and of any other activities hazardous for river Ganga and health and hygiene of the area,” the NMCG Director General Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said in a letter to the chairpersons of the District Ganga Committees.It has also asked to submit an action-taken report (ATR) to the NMCG in the next 14 days, the letter said. Responding to a question on this in a briefing on May 7, V K Paul, Member (Health), Niti Aayog said, “Spread of transmission through water is not a concern. Not to worry.” Principal Scientific Adviser K VijayRaghavan said there is no worry about transmission through such mediums. "Primary transmission happens when people speak, or when two people are in close proximity and if the droplets drop on any surface come in contact with the other person then it can spread through water,” he said."But mostly it spreads through aerosol. It also depends on airflow. There is no need to worry. It dilutes in the water to an extent that there is little danger of transmission,” Raghavan said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/transmission-of-coronavirus-through-water-is-not-a-concern-say-experts-251869

12-05-2021||Vijay Mohan||AI-based tool that can detect COVID-19 from sound of cough developed||Tribune News ServiceMohali, May 12A novel online tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can detect COVID-19 infection in an individual by analysing the sound of coughing has been developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in Mohali.The tool, christened ‘Vaani Mitr’, only requires people to submit a brief recording of coughing through a mobile phone or a laptop, which would then be processed to determine their status in real time. It can be used by anyone at anytime from anywhere.A large data base is fundamental for AI tools to be effective. For the purpose, a data bank for coughing sounds of both, COVID-19 positive as well as COVID-19 negative persons is being built up by C-DAC, against which the samples are compared.“COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, which in turn causes subtle changes in the sounds produced during respiration, coughing or speaking,” Dr PK Khosla, Executive Director C-DAC, said. “The acoustic signature of COVID-positive individuals shows some particular characteristics and traits that can be identified and tracked,” he added.The indigenously developed automated AI system analyses the acoustic signatures to detect the possibility of COVID-19 infection in a human.So far, C-DAC’s data base for ‘Vaani Mitr’ comprises of over a thousand recordings from COVID-19 negative persons and over 300 recordings from COVID-19 positive persons. The data base has been built with assistance from Nation Health Mission, Haryana and the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.“We have to build up our data base further. Large the data base, more accurate the test will be.” Dr Khosla said. As of now, the tool is being looked at as a means of preliminary screening for suspected cases while sitting at home rather than a clinical diagnosis.C-DAC, which functions under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, is looking for volunteers who are either COVID-19 positive or have been cured to provide their voice and cough samples to build up its data base. This can be done online along with providing some basic medical details.Use of AI in the healthcare sector, including areas such as hospital information, drug management tele-medicine mobile healthcare and decision support, is among the niche areas C-DAC is working on.

A team of at least 30 stress counsellors has been deployed to soothe the frayed nerves of the inmates and their attendants, the officials said.Donning white PPE or personal protection suits with “stress counsellors” scribbled on them, these professionals take rounds of the facility and interact with the patients in the morning hours.“The ITBP is probably the only force that has stress counsellors in its ranks. They have been trained at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru,” a senior officer of the border guarding force said.During regular times, the stress counsellors interact with the troops, but now they have been deputed to the SPCCC to help in reducing the anxiety of patients and their attendants, he added.“Some old or weak patients have been allowed to have attendants at the centre. The counsellors talk to them about everything... physical exercises to keep fit, how to divert the mind from the fear of the unknown, anxiety and even what is happening across the globe on the COVID-19 battlefront,” the officer said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-team-visits-spccc-itbp-deploys-stress-counsellors-to-soothe-patients-frayed-nerves-251864

12-05-2021||New Delhi||Oxygen concentrator hoarding: Court order on ‘Khan Chacha’ owner’s anticipatory bail on Thursday||A Delhi Court will pronounce on Thursday the order on the anticipatory bail plea filed by businessman Navneet Kalra in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators, required by COVID-19 patients, from his upscale restaurants including ‘Khan Chacha’ in the national capital.Additional Session Judge Sandeep Garg reserved the order on the pre-arrest bail for Thursday at 10 am after hearing the arguments of both the prosecution and defense at length.During a recent raid, 524 oxygen concentrators were recovered from three restaurants owned by Kalra and it is suspected that he has left Delhi along with his family. These concentrators are the crucial medical equipment used for COVID-19 management.During the proceedings, Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava opposed the pre-arrest bail plea and told the court that Kalra’s custodial interrogation is required and that bail should not be granted as he is an influential person.“His intention was to cheat the public at large and wrongfully gain. Had Delhi Police not busted the racket, many people would have been cheated,” the Public Prosecutor said.Navneet Kalra, who is also the business owner of Dayal Opticals, started the business of oxygen concentrators “out of greed”, Srivastava said, adding that anticipatory or regular bail should not be granted in such white collar crimes.The prosecutor also apprised the court about a lab report which showed that the seized oxygen concentrators are not working, have poor quality and their working capacity is only 20.8 per cent.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, representing the accused, asked the court how his client can be accused of selling the oxygen concentrators at exorbitant prices, if there is no ceiling price fixed by the government.“Prosecution’s allegation is that it is an essential commodity and Kalra was earning profit. There is no maximum retailing price fixed by the government till date. How will you decide if the prices are exorbitant?,” he questioned.The senior advocate emphasised that selective leaks are made by the Delhi Police against Kalra and that he is being made a scapegoat to divert the attention from the “core issues”.“Kalra will appear before the agencies within two hours, along with his phone if given an opportunity. In these difficult times, when the decogention is happening in jail, anticipatory bail can be granted to him,” he said.Pahwa claimed that the case is a figment of imagination of the Delhi Police. “When all the recoveries have been made, they want to arrest me and have been opposing my anticipatory bail,” he claimed.The counsel said that oxygen concentrators are not cosmetic and are used for medically unfit and dying people. “When we are selling it through banking channels, where is the offence?” he asked.He said that even police officers, politicians, judicial officers and residential welfare associations (RWA) have purchased the concentrators from Kalra for emergency use and not for luxury.The application was first being heard by Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass but was then transferred to Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Garg on Wednesday due to change in jurisdiction after the case was transferred to the Crime branch of the Delhi Police.Another court will pronounce on Thursday morning the order on a regular bail application filed by one Hitesh Kumar, who is the employee of the ‘town hall’ restaurant owned by Kalra from where seizures were made recently. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxygen-concentrator-hoarding-court-order-on-khan-chacha-owners-anticipatory-bail-on-thursday-251857
12-05-2021||New Delhi||'Feel assisting people in distress my duty': Delhi Police ASI who helps cremate Covid dead||As he guides a grieving family which had just arrived at the Lodhi Crematorium here to conduct the last rites of their coronavirus dead, ASI Rakesh Chaudhury also keeps an eye on around eight-nine funeral pyres he helped set up. "On a daily basis, there are 20-30 bodies of coronavirus patients that we help cremate here," Assistant police sub-inspector Rakesh Chaudhury tells PTI. He tells the bereaved relatives of the victims where they can get the material required for conducting the last rites, consoles them, at times put firewood on bodies, and even prepares funeral pyres himself when families don't. "Many a times there is just only one attendant with the body. Sometimes even when there are more they do not want to touch the body. They either sit in the parking lot or on the road, and we carry the body and help in cremation," he says.Chaudhary says he has helped cremate 1300-1400 bodies, many of those being of Covid-19 patients, at the crematorium in the past one month. The 56-year-old father of three was posted at the crematorium on April 13 when the city had just begun to witness a sudden spike in coronavirus cases and deaths in the second wave, and when crematoriums were finding it difficult to manage the deluge of bodies. Chaudhury had joined the Delhi Police in 1986. His family lives back home in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, while he stays in the barracks of Nizamuddin Police Station, reporting for duty every day from 7 am to 8 pm."I talk to my family members daily over a video call. They are quite supportive. The only thing they tell me ‘just stay safe and continue doing what you are doing'. I feel that helping people in distress is my duty," he said.Talking about his own family, he was reminded of how he recently helped a young boy conduct the last rites of his grandmother while his parents joined over a video call from Singapore."Sometimes, I tell the family members that it's God's will and they need to stay patient," he said.His family has his elderly parents, wife and three children—two sons and a daughter.The ASI said he postponed his daughter's wedding scheduled for May 7 so that he could help more distressed families."There is so much sadness all around, and it doesn't look good that we hold a wedding," he added.Chaudhury has taken the coronavirus vaccine doses. He says he has been given a PPE kit, a hand sanitiser, a face shield and a mask to protect himself from getting the disease. "By God's grace, I have not been infected," he said. RP Meena, the Deputy Commissioner of Southeast district, said Chaudhury has been deployed there for permanent shifts, while other keep rotating."The people who come here are already in grief. Sometimes, for Covid bodies, there is only one attendant or no attendant at all. We try and provide the best help, even put firewood and arrange puja material. He is permanently deployed there while the other policeman keep changing," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/feel-assisting-people-in-distress-my-duty-delhi-police-asi-who-helps-cremate-covid-dead-251855

Many have isolated themselves from their families," Sinha said.Asked about constraints faced during these difficult times of pandemic, Sinha said there have been many instances where the force had to face stiff resistance while ensuring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour from a crowd and at many places faced attacks.A drive has been undertaken to impart awareness among people.More than 4,000 hoardings to create awareness have been installed by the Jharkhand police. It has also set up about 245 barriers to check people and ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.With the state facing a crisis, there have been several instances where police personnel actively ensured beds, oxygen and ventilators to people in need.Besides special drives were carried out to prevent hoarding and black marketing of essential medicines and items.To keep the forces moral high "two deputy superintendent rank officers have been specially deputed to monitor the condition and the health status of all Covid-19 positive police personnel and their family members through one to one direct contact, he said.The control room ensures that affected police personnel and their family get medical care besides handling other issues like food arrangements, medicines etc.At the district level, he said, similar arrangements have been made.Jharkhand will also be roping in some 300 ex-army personnel in managing Covid-19 patients and ancillary services needed to combat the pandemic, Chief Minister Hemant Soren had announced on Monday.Jharkhand on Wednesday reported 103 fresh fatalities, pushing the toll to 4,085, while 4,365 new cases raised the tally to 2,96,895 during the last 24 hours. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-warriors-12-of-police-force-afflicted-with-virus-in-line-of-duty-in-jharkhand-251853

12-05-2021||Dehradun||COVID-19: Ivermectin tablets to be distributed among Uttarakhand residents, says state govt||The Uttarakhand government will be distributing Ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, among the residents of the state as a preventive medicine against the spread of COVID-19, a senior official said. The Uttarakhand government's announcement comes after Goa and Karnataka issued similar directions.  The decision was taken on the recommendation of the state-level clinical technical committee, an order issued by Chief Secretary Om Prakash to all district magistrates said.The panel has recommended the Ivermectin tablet as “mass chemoprophylaxis” to effectively control the surge of COVID-19 infection apart from the vaccination drive, the order said.The 12 mg tablets of the drug will be distributed in a kit to all families through the health department and district magistrates, the order said.Usually, Ivermectin tablets have to be taken by adults and those above 15 years twice daily for three days after breakfast and dinner. One person will thus need six tablets and a family of four will need 24 tablets. Hence, each kit will contain two dozen tablets, the order said. Children between 10-15 years will take only one tablet daily whereas those aged between 2 to 10 years can be administered the drug only after doctor's advice. The tablet cannot be given to children below two years, pregnant women and those suffering from liver diseases, it said. The kit will come with directions on how to consume the medicine and dosage for different age groups. Information related to the daily distribution of the kits should be sent to the state nodal officer, the order said.  Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane had on Monday said all people above 18 years will be given Ivermectin drug irrespective of their coronavirus status to bring down the number of deaths due to the viral disease. Rane had said that people will be given Ivermectin 12 mg for five days as expert panels from the UK, Italy, Spain and Japan have found a statistically significant reduction in mortality, time to recovery and viral clearance in COVID-19 patients treated with this medicine.On Tuesday, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister and state's COVID task force head C N Ashwath Narayan said 10 lakh Ivermectin tablets have been procured and their supply will begin on May 14. It has been further decided to procure 25 lakh tablets and make them available in all hospitals across the state, he said. Medical experts, however, have questioned the efficacy of the five-day duration of the drug regimen announced by Goa government saying the treatment should not be given for a short period but ideally be continued till the pandemic is brought under control.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has warned against the use of Ivermectin to treat COVID-19. “Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication. @WHO recommends against the use of ivermectin for #COVID19 except within clinical trials,” Soumya Swaminathan, WHO Chief Scientist said in a tweet on Tuesday. However, regular use of the oral antiparasitic drug may significantly reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19, according to a review of available data by researchers who claim the medicine can help end the pandemic.The research, published in the May-June issue of the American Journal of Therapeutics, is the most comprehensive review of the available data on Ivermectin taken from clinical, in vitro, animal, and real-world studies, its authors said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-ivermectin-tablets-to-be-distributed-among-uttarakhand-residents-says-state-govt-251832

Those who are found positive will be isolated and treatment will be started while RTPCR test will be conducted for those who are negative in antigen test but have symptoms,” Sharma said. “This mechanism will help the government in early detection of virus spread in rural areas,” he said. The minister also said that the Rajasthan government has repeatedly requested the central government to allocate more oxygen to the state and from points which are near to the state. “The Centre has allotted us oxygen from places which are far from the state. This takes longer time in transportation. Therefore, we have requested the Centre to allocate oxygen from nearby places,” he said, adding there is a shortage of 300 MT oxygen. He said the state government has also directed private hospitals in the state with 60 or more beds to set up oxygen generation plant and centralised oxygen pipeline for 24x7 oxygen supply on 50 percent beds.“Also, looking at the possibility of a third wave of coronavirus, the chief minister has directed officials to make all necessary arrangements in all mother and child hospitals. Since the third wave is likely to affect children, all necessary arrangements like centralised oxygen pipeline etc. will be made,” he said. Apart from it, the state government has also started work on developing a genome sequencing facility at the SMS Medical College in Jaipur.He said that the state government had forwarded samples for genome sequencing and the UK strain of COVID-19 has been found in the samples.“We had sent samples for genome sequencing. In the samples, UK strain was found,” Sharma said. In Rajasthan, the number of active COVID cases has reached 2.05 lakh while 5994 people have died so far due to the virus.The state has reported a total of 789274 COVID positive cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-to-conduct-rapid-antigen-tests-in-rural-areas-to-check-spread-of-covid-19-251830

12-05-2021||New Delhi||Are you willing to date someone who is not vaccinated?||Amid the second and more lethal wave of Coronavirus in India, an increasing number of people prefer to date only those who are vaccinated, reveals a survey.The results of the survey, led by online dating app QuackQuack, showed that people are more likely to talk to someone who is pro-vaccine compared to anti-vaxxers.About 70 per cent of people in the age-group 18-30 will consider meeting their date only once they are vaccinated, and eight out of 10 people aged 31 and above feel that inoculation is a prerequisite for their date.On the other hand, 30 per cent of people in the age group 18-30 would not necessarily consider vaccination and would take other safety precautions while meeting, the study showed.About 80 per cent of women and 70 per cent of men wants their date to be vaccinated and if someone is an anti-vaccinator, then chances of them getting rejected are high. Only 25 per cent of men and women were found open to the idea of meeting anti-vaccinators."The survey has given us some very important insights into how people are not being negligent about the prevailing crisis and are strictly abiding by the health protocols issued for everybody's wellbeing. Conversations have now moved from 'lockdown', 'Covid', 'masks', asocial distancing' to 'vaccination' and athe greater fear about the second wave'," said Ravi Mittal, Founder & CEO, QuackQuack, in a statement on Wednesday."It has rather become essential to disclose that you have been vaccinated, because otherwise there are very slim chances of finding a match. Therefore, vaccination has become an added quality for a person to be liked and chosen."Also, as we put our users' safety over anything, we have provided links to a collective page to our users when they login to our website.

12-05-2021||New Delhi||A Ramzan like no other: COVID shadow on Muslim fasting month||The shadows over Ramzan are darker this time and the despair deeper, the scramble for oxygen, hospital beds and even a decent burial for their loved ones eclipsing the gloom that marked the fasting month last year.With no large congregations in mosques, no ‘iftar' parties and no late night shopping, it was said 2020 Ramzan was like no other in living memory. But as a second, deadlier COVID-19 wave ravages large parts of the country, Ramzan 2021 has rewritten even that pandemic norm. Almost every family across the country is affected by the pandemic in one way or another with many losing friends and family members and several others battling the dreaded virus."Ramzan is a time for family and friends, but this year I have lost many of my near and dear ones and many in the family have been infected by the virus. This has been a tough month and I spent it just praying to Allah that this deadly virus goes away from our lives," said Tanvir Parvez, a lawyer from Ghaziabad.The festivities, the cheer, the morning ‘sehri' at food joints that underscored Ramzan and Eid for not just devout Muslims but for others as well have receded like a distant dream for those like Parvez. Who would have thought that instead of dwelling on the spread laid out across virtually every dining table in a Muslim household at 'iftar', families this Ramzan would be sweating over arranging oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, hospital beds and plasma or a burial spot for friends and family hit by the deadly virus. "Iftar is such an amazing time when we pray to God, have a wholesome meal with the family and count our blessings. But it has not been so this time where we are daily dealing with some bad news or another,” Parvez told PTI as India on Wednesday again reported more 4,000 Covid deaths.With 4,205 fresh fatalities, the country's death toll has risen to 2,54,197. According to Health Ministry data, 3.48 lakh new cases were recorded to take the tally to 2,33,40,938 (23 million/2.33 crore).As the holy month of Ramzan nears its end with Eid likely to be celebrated on May 13 or 14 in India, depending on the sighting of the moon, Covid fears hang like a cloud over the festivities. "This year, the fasting month went by running around dealing with health emergencies, deaths and funerals for relatives and friends," said Qazi Rafat Masood, an agriculturist from Uttar Pradesh's Nagina district.Though mosques have been open in many places during Ramzan, prayers were held with COVID norms and restrictions. Also, many appeals were made by clerics asking people to pray at home, especially in Covid hotspots.Masood said Ramzan, a time for self-discipine and introspection, would be marked with great fanfare in his locality of 'Qazi Sarai' every year. Throughout the month, there would be a 'Roza Iftar' party in one house or the other. The inevitable comparisons of cooking skills of each household would add a dash of fun to the iftar parties, he said, looking back at the good times when the run-up to Eid was about shopping and preparing for feasts with 'sheer and sewai' sweet dishes topping the culinary agenda. This year, somewhat like last year, it has been about lockdowns, deserted streets and shuttered shops -- symbolic of the emptiness during what is generally a festive time.The special Eid prayers will also not be the same. In several cities, it has been decided that prayers will not be held in Eidgahs but in local mosques with social distancing norms. At other places, calls have made urging people to offer Eid prayers at home."I appeal to all Muslims to perform Eid prayers following all local Covid-related protocols and guidelines. Do not gather in large numbers and it would be best that you perform prayers inside your homes," prominent Muslim body Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani told PTI.In Delhi, two other prominent clerics -- Ahmed Bukhari of  the Jama Masjid and Mufti Mukarram Ahmed of the Fatehpuri mosque -- have issued separate video appeals to Muslims to offer Eid prayers at home.Social media is also abuzz with calls for celebrating Eid in accordance with Covid protocols with hashtags such as 'EidAtHome' and 'SayNoToEidShopping' doing the rounds on Twitter.Madani said Muslims had acted with a lot of patience during Ramzan as many lost their loved ones, many saw their family members struggle in hospitals and many were infected by the dreaded virus themselves. This Ramzan, several people also missed their fasts after getting infected by coronavirus and lamented about not being able to fast throughout the duration of the holy month."I usually never miss any Ramzan fasts, but this year I could not keep fasts after the first week as I tested positive for COVID-19. It was frustrating to miss out on fasts," Saad Majeed, a resident of Dwarka, said."Having been infected with coronavirus and then not being able to fast was a double whammy that took time to come to terms with," he told PTI.The going has been tough in many different ways. While middle and upper class homes struggled to come to terms with the social and emotional toll of the pandemic, the poor and the needy worked to make ends meet."Ramzan always brings cheer in our otherwise full of struggles life, but for two years we have been robbed of that. This year was even more dreadful as so many in my family got infected by this virus," said Shaheen Bano, a domestic help and mother of six."Also, financially we are struggling as many households have asked me not to come for the fear of the virus. We begin our fast just by drinking water and don't know whether our family will have enough for ‘iftar'," she said.With lockdown in several places as Eid approaches, medium and small traders have also been feeling the pinch with their businesses and shops taking a serious hit.As Muslims mark the end of the holy month and head for Eid, there is just one thing on everyone's mind—to pray for this pandemic to end.Ramzan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar during which Muslims worldwide refrain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk and end their fast in the evening. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-ramzan-like-no-other-covid-shadow-on-muslim-fasting-month-251810
12-05-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices up 25 paise; Bhopal, Indore join cities with Rs 100/litre petrol||Petrol and diesel prices on Wednesday were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, the third increase this week, propelling petrol price to cross Rs 100 per litre mark in more cities including Bhopal and Indore.Petrol and diesel prices are now at a record high across the country, price notification of state-owned fuel retailers showed.In Delhi, petrol now comes for Rs 92.05 per litre and diesel is priced at Rs 82.61.This was the third increase in prices this week and the seventh hike since May 4 when the state-owned oil firms ended an 18-hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.The price increase led to petrol rates crossing the Rs 100 mark in more places in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as value-added tax (VAT) and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest VAT on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh.Bhopal on Wednesday earned the distinction of being the first state capital in the country to see petrol cross the Rs 100 mark. Petrol in the city now costs Rs 100.08 a litre. Indore had petrol priced at Rs 100.16 per litre.Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan had the costliest petrol and diesel in the country at Rs 102.96 per litre and Rs 95.33 a litre, respectively.In seven increases, petrol price has risen by Rs 1.66 per litre and diesel by Rs 1.88.Since March last year, when the government raised excise duty on fuel to an all-time high, petrol price has increased by a record Rs 22.46 per litre (after accounting for a handful of occasions when rates fell) and diesel by Rs 20.32. Oil companies, that in recent months resorted to an unexplained freeze in rate revision, had hit a pause button after cutting prices marginally on April 15. This coincided with electioneering hitting a peak to elect new governments in five states including West Bengal.No sooner had voting ended, more oil companies indicated an impending increase in retail prices given the firming trend in international oil markets.They said prices have been on a continuous uptrend since April 27.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. The union government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 on diesel.In Mumbai, the petrol price was hiked to Rs 98.36 a litre on Wednesday from Rs 98.12, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 89.75 from Rs 89.48, the price notification showed. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petrol-diesel-prices-up-25-paise-bhopal-indore-join-cities-with-rs-100-litre-petrol-251807
12-05-2021||New Delhi||SC dismisses bail plea of activist Gautam Navlakha in Bhima Koregaon case||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea of activist Gautam Navlakha, seeking bail in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist link case of Bhima Koregaon in Maharashtra.  A bench of justices UU Lalit and K M Joseph dismissed the appeal of Navlakha against the Bombay High Court order denying him bail in the case.  Justice Joseph, who pronounced the verdict for the bench, said the court is dismissing the appeal of Navlakha. On March 26, the top court had reserved its verdict on a plea of Navlakha.  The top court had on March 3 sought a response from the NIA on Navlakha's plea in which he has claimed that the charge sheet was not filed within the stipulated period and hence, he was entitled to default bail.  The FIR against him was re-registered in January 2020, and Navlakha had surrendered before the NIA on April 14, last year.He had spent 11 days in the NIA's custody till April 25, and since then he is in judicial custody.  According to the prosecution, some activists allegedly made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence at Koregaon Bhima in the district the next day. It has also alleged that the event was backed by some Maoist groups. On February 8, the high court had dismissed Navlakha's plea saying that "it sees no reason to interfere with a special court's order which earlier rejected his bail plea".  Navlakha had approached the high court last year, challenging the special NIA court's order of July 12, 2020, that rejected his plea for statutory bail.  On December 16 last year, the high court bench reserved its verdict on the plea filed by Navlakha, seeking statutory or default bail on the grounds that he had been in custody for over 90 days, but the prosecution failed to file a charge sheet in the case within this period.  The NIA had argued that his plea was not maintainable, and sought an extension of time to file the charge sheet.The special court had then accepted NIA's plea seeking an extension of 90 to 180 days to file the charge sheet against Navlakha and his co-accused, activist Dr Anand Teltumbde.  Navlakha had earlier already argued that he has spent 93 days in custody, including 34 days of house arrest, and that the high court must count house arrest as a period of custody.While he was under house arrest, Navlakha's personal liberties remained curtailed, his counsel had submitted.  The NIA had earlier argued that Navlakha's house arrest could not be included in the time spent in the custody of police or NIA, or under judicial custody.  It had submitted that the Pune police arrested Navlakha in August 2018, but had not taken him into custody.  It had said that Navlakha remained under house arrest, and the Delhi High Court quashed his arrest and remand order in October 2018.

12-05-2021||Geneva||India's coronavirus variant spread to 44 countries: WHO||The Indian coronavirus variant (B1617), which has now been declared a "variant of global concern" has spread to 44 countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.The B1617 variant, first identified in India in October, has been detected in over 4500 sequences uploaded to the GISAID open-access database, till May 11, "from 44 countries in all six WHO regions," the global health agency said in its weekly epidemiological update on the pandemic on Tuesday.The WHO has also "received reports of detections from five additional countries", the update said.The Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) is a German non-profit organisation, launched in 2016 as a database for sharing flu genomes.The WHO's SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group on Tuesday determined that viruses within the lineage B1617 areA a variant of concern.The B1617 variant was, till now, deemed a 'variant of interest' by the WHO. It now has been added to the list of other Covid-19 "variants of concern" -- UK (B117), South African (B1351) and Brazilian (P1) variants.The B1617 variant was declared as a variant of concern based on early evidence of higher rates of transmission, including its observed rapid increases in prevalence in multiple countries.The UN health body also cited "preliminary evidence", which suggests that the B1617 variant reduces the effectiveness of treatment of Covid patients with Bamlanivimab -- a monoclonal antibody. It also pointed out lab studies that showed "slightly reduced susceptibility to neutralisation antibodies".Approximately 0.1 per cent of positive samples in India have been sequenced and uploaded to GISAID to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants, the WHO said.The agency said that spread of B1617, along with other more transmittable variants, is one of several factors fuelling India's dramatic surge in new cases and deaths.The number of new Covid-19 cases and deaths globally decreased slightly this week, with over 5.5 million cases and over 90, 000 deaths, the update said. "India continues to account for 95 per cent of cases and 93 per cent of deaths in the South-East Asia Region, as well as 50 per cent of global cases and 30 per cent of global deaths,", the update added.India on Wednesday recorded 4,205 deaths due to Covid, the highest to date with 3,48,421 fresh cases, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-coronavirus-variant-spread-to-44-countries-who-251798
12-05-2021||Washington||India opened up prematurely, Dr Fauci tells US Senators on COVID-19 crisis||India made the "incorrect assumption" that it was finished with the COVID-19 pandemic and opened up prematurely that has left the country in such "dire straits", America's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has told senators.India has been severely affected by the unprecedented second wave of the coronavirus and hospitals in several states are reeling under the shortage of health workers, vaccines, oxygen, drugs and beds."The reason that India is in such dire straits now is that they had an original surge and made the incorrect assumption that they were finished with it, and what happened, they opened up prematurely and wind up having a surge right now that we're all very well aware of is extremely devastating,” Fauci told the US Senate Health, Education, Labour and Pensions Committee during a hearing on Tuesday on the COVID-19 Response.Dr Fauci, who is the Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is also the chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden.Chairing the hearing, Senator Patty Murray said that the surge of COVID-19 that is devastating India is a painful reminder really that the US can't end the pandemic here until it ends it everywhere."I'm glad the Biden administration is leading that global fight by rejoining the World Health Organization and funding global vaccine efforts and committing to donate 60 million AstraZeneca vaccines to other countries by July 4,” she said."India's outbreak underscores the need for a robust public health infrastructure in the US to respond appropriately to this pandemic and future outbreaks, as well,” Senator Murray said as she asked Fauci what can the US learn from India's outbreak."One of the important things is don't ever underestimate the situation," Fauci said as he referred to India's incorrect assumption and premature opening up."The second thing is preparedness with regard to public health, preparedness, which we, as a lesson learned for future pandemics, have to realise that we need to continue to build up our local public health infrastructure, which over the last decades we have let actually in many respects go into disarray, likely because of our successes in controlling so many diseases,” Fauci said.The other lesson that is learned is that this is a global pandemic that requires a global response, and one has to pay attention to the "responsibility that we have, not only for our own country but to join with other countries to make sure that we have the access to interventions, particularly vaccines throughout the world,” he said."Because if it continues to have dynamics of virus anywhere in the world, we have a threat here in the United States, particularly with variants, and you know there's one variant in India that is also a new variant…So those are just a few of the lessons that I believe we can take from what's going on in India,”  the 80-year-old leading physician and immunologist said.India saw a record rise in COVID-19 deaths with 4,205 fresh fatalities taking the country's death toll to 2,54,197, while 3,48,421 new coronavirus infections were reported, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday.The total tally of COVID-19 cases in India now stands at 2,33,40,938.Senator Murray said that the deadly outbreak in India is a heartbreaking reminder of what can happen when this virus spreads unchecked, when it mutates into more contagious, more deadly strains and when it overwhelms healthcare systems."It's a reminder this pandemic won't fully be over for our country until it is over for the world, which is why I'm glad the Biden administration is sending medical support to India, sharing some of our excess doses globally and even considering other steps to remove barriers to vaccines for countries that need them, including a targeted waiver of COVID-19 patent protections,” she said."These moves won't just save lives in India; they will ultimately save lives in Washington State, North Carolina and across the country because people get that when there is a fire down the street, it's in their best interest to put it out before it gets to their family's home. Not to mention that helping your neighbour is always the right thing to do,” Murray said.Meanwhile, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 58 per cent of US adults -- and nearly 46 per cent of the country's total population -- have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. More than 34 per cent of the US population is fully vaccinated, CDC data shows.Fauci has previously estimated that about 70-85 per cent of people need to be immune for the country to reach a "total blanket of protection," he told CNN late last month."However, even before you get to that, as you get more and more people vaccinated, you will reach a point ... where you'll start to see the number of cases going down dramatically," Fauci said at the time.

Later, the victim realised that the money was withdrawn twice from his account, the official said.He contacted the person from the medical firm again and when the latter did not give any satisfactory reply, the victim realised that he had been duped.He then approached the Khar police and lodged a complaint, the official said.While conducting a probe into the case, the Khar police contacted the bank concerned and found the accused's account was in a Patna-based branch.The police asked the bank authorities to freeze the account of the accused, and the money deposited by the victim was returned to him, the official said.A case was registered under Indian Penal Code Section 420 (cheating) and other relevant provisions and a search was on for the accused, the police added.

Such patients need to keep their blood sugar level under control, she said.Mucormycosis is being detected in COVID-19 patients and there should not be excessive use of steroids for their treatment, the official said.According to health experts, the symptoms of mucormycosis include headache, fever, pain under the eyes, nasal or sinus congestion and partial loss of vision.On Tuesday, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said there could be over 2,000 mucormycosis patients in the state as of now and with more and more COVID-19 cases coming up, "their number would increase for sure".The state government has decided to use hospitals attached to medical colleges as treatment centres for mucormycosis, he had said.Meanwhile, Lok Sabha member from Kalyan Dr Shrikant Shinde in a release said during a virtual meeting with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray over the weekend, he made several suggestions on how to tackle the fungal infection.Shinde also suggested that a task force be set up to lay down protocols for the use of steroids for treating COVID-19 patients.

12-05-2021||Washington||India's decision allowing 5G trials without Chinese companies a sovereign one: US||India's recent decision authorising 5G trials without Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE is a sovereign one, a top State Department official has said, asserting that America is deeply concerned about the dangers of installing networks with equipment that can be manipulated, disrupted or potentially controlled by China.India's Department of Telecom last week approved applications of telecom companies Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and MTNL to conduct 5G trials but none of them will be using technologies of Chinese entities.State Department Spokesperson Ned Price, at his daily news conference on Tuesday, said: “This was a sovereign decision on the part of the Indian government, so we refer you to the Government of India for any comment on that decision”.“But I would say more broadly, it is true that we are deeply concerned about the dangers of installing networks with equipment that can be manipulated, disrupted or potentially controlled by the PRC (People's Republic of China).“Allowing untested, untrusted telecommunication suppliers, like Huawei or ZTE, to participate in or to have any control over any part of a 5G network creates unacceptable risks to national security, to critical infrastructure, to privacy and to human rights as well,” Price said.China last week regretted the decision by Indian authorities to not allow Chinese telecom companies to conduct 5G trials in India."We noted relevant notification, and express concern and regret that Chinese telecommunications companies have not been permitted to conduct 5G trials with Indian telecom service providers in India," Chinese embassy spokesperson Wang Xiaojian said in New Delhi."To exclude Chinese telecommunications companies from the trials will not only harm their legitimate rights and interests, but also hinder the improvement of the Indian business environment, which is not conducive to the innovation and development of related Indian industries," Wang said.Last year, the US designated Huawei and ZTE as “national security threats”, saying they have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China's military apparatus, and they are broadly subject to Chinese law obligating them to cooperate with the country's intelligence services.

We decide our foreign policy," he said.Initiated in 2007, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, Quad for short, is an informal grouping of the US, India, Australia and Japan.China has vehemently opposed the formation of the Quad with a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman emphasising in March that exchanges and cooperation between countries should help expand mutual understanding and trust, instead of targeting or harming the interests of third parties.The Quad member countries have resolved to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the strategically vital region.The first summit of the Quad leaders was hosted by US President Joe Biden on March 12 and the virtual meeting was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The four Quad leaders have vowed to strive for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion, sending a clear message to China against its aggressive actions in the region.

12-05-2021||Washington||US working closely with India on COVID-19 crisis: White House||The US is working closely with India on its continued and emerging needs during the unprecedented second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a top State Department official has said.While the assistance from the US government has been worth USD 100 million, the private sector has donated an additional USD 400 million, totalling half a billion dollars to India, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference on Tuesday.“We are continuing to work closely with Indian officials and health experts to identify continued needs and emerging needs in this ongoing crisis,” he said.“I was talking about our catalytic effect in another context earlier… Secretary (of State) Tony Blinken, Special Coordinator Gayle Smith participated in calls the other week with the US India Business Council and the Chamber of Commerce in an effort to elicit additional supplies from the private sector, which we'd be terrifically gratified to see,” Price said.Earlier in the day, top American senator Mark Warner spoke with India's ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu and assured his full commitment for the assistance to India.“India right now is at the epicenter of COVID-19. This morning I spoke with the Indian ambassador and pledged to do our part to help the Indian people respond to the surge.

The remaining seven will be shifted soon, he said.The hotel, around 170 km from the state capital, was converted into a Covid care centre by a private hospital.The fire was minor and was doused immediately, the official said.Smoke engulfed the third floor of the "Generation X Hotel" facility, where the patients were kept, said senior fire officer of Bhavnagar fire brigade, Bharat Kanada."The fire was caused by a spark in a TV shortly after midnight. It was brought under control quickly. However, thick smoke filled the top floor of the three-storey hotel, making it difficult for the patients to be kept there," he said."As a precaution, 61 patients were shifted to other hospitals with the help of fire personnel. The remaining seven will also be shofted soon," he said.Bhavnagar Collector Gaurang Makwana said all the 68 coronavirus patients at the centre were safe and the "minor fire" was brought under control immediately.Sixteen COVID-19 patients and two nurses died in a blaze at the four-storeyed Welfare Hospital in Bharuch in the state on May 1.The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday criticised the state government over the Bharuch hospital fire, saying it was contemptuous on its part to not remain vigilant and avoid such incidents, and cited many orders passed in this regard.

They will be guarded by commandos of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).Why The decisionThe decision was taken following a report of a four-member fact-finding central team, which visited the state following the post-poll violence there.Officials in the CISF said that keeping in view the comparatively large number of protectees in one go, they were recalibrating the strength of personnel to be deployed for VIP security in West Bengal.The officials further said security cover of 17 protectees had been withdrawn after the elections concluded. They had ‘Y’, ‘Y’ plus and ‘Z’ category security cover, involving a large number of personnel.“The relived commandos will now be attached with the newly elected MLAs. Their number is enough to provide ‘X’-category security cover to all legislators,” said a senior CISF official.The protectees, whose security has been withdrawn, are mostly BJP leaders from other states and party office-bearers, who were accorded VIP security during their stay in West Bengal during the election campaign.Under the ‘X’ category security, two or three armed commandos escort a protectee and under the ‘Y’ category, four to five commandos do the job.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-accords-cisf-cover-to-all-77-bjp-mlas-in-bengal-251657

Tope’s remarks came a day after state Tourism Minister Aditya Thackeray said global procurement of vaccines was a viable option and would mean Mumbai could be inoculated in three weeks.States free to importDrug controller had on May 5 issued guidelines for states and private entities to import vaccines not licensed for use in India but authorised by regulators of the US, UK, EU and for those on WHO emergency use list.What importer needs3,29,942 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS 2,49,992ACTIVE CASES 37,15,221Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation chief Iqbal Singh Chahal has separately requested Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to allow the corporation to float a global tender to cover Mumbai. As states grapple with inadequate stocks of Covaxin and Covishield, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia today said the state will float a global tender to procure vaccines, accusing the Centre of forcing states to compete for vaccine procurement globally.Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, meanwhile, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure the vaccine formula of Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute was shared with other manufacturers to boost national production.Kejriwal said this would help acquire a national safety net ahead of the third wave and could be done by invoking relevant provisions of the Patents Act and issuing compulsory licences to firms. A royalty from the profits of manufacturers could be given to Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute, said Kejriwal. The Congress had made a similar demand earlier.Uttarakhand too has written to the Centre asking if they could directly import vaccines; this on a day when Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote to the PM urging transfer of Covishield and Covaxin technologies to other jab manufacturers under the Patents Law. Reddy said at the current pace, it may take several months to get everyone vaccinated.The Centre, meanwhile, held a vaccine review meeting with states asking them to prioritise second doses and reserve 70 per cent stocks provided free of cost by the government of India for the second doses.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “There is an urgent need to address a large number of beneficiaries waiting for the second dose. States can reserve at least 70 per cent of the vaccines supplied to them from the Government of India channel (free of cost) for second dose vaccination and remaining 30 per cent for first dose.” A pre-bid meeting for the UP Government’s global tender for Covid vaccines is expected to be held tomorrow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-up-invites-global-vax-bids-maharashtra-delhi-eye-imports-too-251587

The research, currently under peer review, concludes that Pfizer prevents severe disease in those infected with B.1.617 variant.Though researchers have documented partial ability of the Indian variant to escape vaccine-elicited antibodies, they say these are too mild to escape jab effectiveness.“While the Indian variant has some ability to avoid neutralising antibodies elicited by vaccination, it is very mild. The vaccine continues to be effective against the variant and prevent severe disease,” Anurag Agarwal, Director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, told The Tribune a day after the WHO classified the Indian variant as a “variant of concern”.Agarwal said India had classified B.1.617 as a “variant of concern” long ago.“When the WHO does the same thing, it applies to the world. Otherwise B.1.617 has been a variant of concern in India. The moot point here is that as of today, there is no evidence that variants can escape vaccine effectiveness,” he said.The B.1.617 variant emerged in Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India and at least 40 countries. It is linked to the massive Covid surge in India over the past 1.5 months. The authors further argue against using the term “double mutant” for the Indian variant, saying, “The fold reduction in the ability of two key mutations of B.1.617 — L452R and E484Q — to avoid neutralising antibodies elicited by the vaccine was no greater than the individual mutations alone, arguing against use of the term double mutant.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-effective-against-indian-variant-study-251588

Other members are former ministers Salman Khurshid and Manish Tewari, ex-MoS Vincent Pala and MP Jothi Mani. TNSNadda said the conduct of certain Congress leaders, including former party president Rahul Gandhi, during the pandemic would be remembered for “duplicity and pettiness”. In his four-page letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Nadda accused her party’s leadership of trying to create vaccine hesitancy. The BJP president said the Modi government’s fight against the pandemic was driven by belief in science, support for innovation, trust in Covid warriors and cooperative federalism. “While there are a few members of your party doing commendable work in helping people, their hard work gets eclipsed by negativity spread by senior members of the party. One would wish that while India is fighting Covid-19 with utmost courage, the top Congress leaders would stop misleading people, creating false panic and even contradicting their stands just based on political considerations,” he wrote.Citing high mortality rate in Congress-ruled states, including Punjab, he said, “There are other aspects that also need greater thought. For instance, the data from February and March would reveal which states failed to track the rising cases. Why are mortality rates in states such as Punjab so high? These are questions you must ask your own Chief Ministers.”Nadda also hit back over the criticism of the BJP for holding big poll rallies while cases surged across the nation and the ongoing construction of the Central Vista project. He said the need for a new Parliament building was raised during the Congress-led UPA regime with the then Speaker Meira Kumar underscoring the need for it. “Yet, the Congress does not believe in facts. People are also contrasting the Congress’ stand on Central Vista with the Chhattisgarh Government going ahead to build a new Assembly complex,” he said.Accusing the Congress of “ignoring” the Centre’s advisories on the second wave, he said it was doing no favours to itself by opposing lockdowns and then demanding it.The Congress leaders, he said, held massive election rallies in Kerala causing a spike in cases, and were now “grandstanding” about poll rallies elsewhere.The BJP leadership is in a damage-control mode over perceptions over the Centre’s handling of Covid crisis with leaders taking to newspaper columns to present the BJP-led government’s point of view on related issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-create-false-panic-nadda-to-congress-251629

Earlier, one or two elderly persons died in a couple of months. Now, there has been a sudden surge in deaths. What else could be the cause if not Covid?” he said.The lone Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Malhrabas village is operating from a makeshift building.

In the hearing before the apex court, they had said that the plea was only opposed to the permission granted for continuing the construction going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.“Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Rajpath and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them,” they had told the apex court.The apex court had declined to interfere in the matter as the issue was pending before the high court.It asked the petitioners to seek an early hearing before the high court and subsequently, they moved an application to advance the matter.The petitioners have claimed before the high court that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.Their plea has also contended that the continuation of the project was a matter of concern in view of the “crumbling” healthcare system and the lives at stake of the workers employed at the construction site.The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, said the plea, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha.The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.

It is being alleged that Yogendra Yadav and other protesters of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha were aware of the sexual assault committed upon the girl but unfortunately, they did not inform the police about the incident.“The Commission has sent a notice to Yadav seeking an explanation for the delay in informing police about the incident. The Commission has also sought a reply from Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president, BKU Ekta Ugrahan, to provide an explanation on the said matter and to inform the Commission as to what steps have been taken to ensure safety and security of women associated with the agitation. The reply has to be communicated to the Commission within 10 days,” the commission said.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had on Sunday said that it had zero tolerance towards violence against women amidst reports that the woman activist from West Bengal was sexually assaulted on her way to join the farmers protest and later at Tikri border by some persons posing to be “Kisan Social Army” members.It said it will probe the allegations that some of its leaders were aware of the reported sexual assault of a woman activist at the Tikri border protest site, who later died due to COVID-19 at a private hospital in Haryana.Laying down the timeline of events, Yadav said the farmers outfit came to know about the alleged assault only after the victim’s father, who was also present in the press conference, came to meet them on May 2.The farmer leader in a tweet replied to NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma, who said in a post that she was sending a notice to the activist for not reporting the matter to the police.“Eagerly waiting for your notice @sharmarekha ji. I thought @NCWIndia would honour me for going out of my way to rescue a woman. But I was wrong. Your agenda is different. I hope you are as prompt in using Twitter to do what your commission was meant to do,” Yadav said.The Haryana Police had on Sunday formed a special investigation team to probe the case.Several farmers are protesting against the farm laws at border points of Delhi, including Tikri and Singhu, since November last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncw-issues-notices-to-yogendra-yadav-ugrahan-over-reports-of-sexual-assault-on-woman-activist-251377
