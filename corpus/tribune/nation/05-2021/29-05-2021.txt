We do not have any reasons to believe that the terror infrastructure along the LoC has been dismantled by the Pakistan Army.“Whether it is their inability or unwillingness, both are equally dangerous and concerning, especially seen in the light of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan,” the Army chief said, referring to the Biden administration’s decision to pull out American troops from Afghanistan by September 11.Referring to the ceasefire, Gen Naravane said there was not a single incident of cross-border firing by the two armies after the pact came into effect though there was an incident involving the Pakistani Rangers in the Jammu sector.“This year, we have seen a drastic reduction in the violence levels in Jammu and Kashmir. Security forces and other government agencies are working in sync to maintain pressure on terror groups and squeeze out the logistics support,” he said.“Consistency in a reduction in infiltration attempts and terrorist incidents in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir will go a long way in assuring us of Pakistani intent to foster good neighbourly relations with us,” Gen Naravane said.He said there was a renewed emphasis on observing the ceasefire agreement of 2003 due to the heavy losses of civilian and military lives across the LoC.“Cessation of firing is in the interest of building trust between the two armies, for giving chance to peace and for the benefit of the population residing along the LoC,” he said.The Army Chief said India would like to continue with the ceasefire so that it contributes to stability and improvement in the relationship.“It is the first step towards the long road of normalisation of relations with Pakistan. From our side, we would like to continue with the ceasefire so that it contributes to stability and improvement in the relationship,” he said.Gen Naravane also said that recruitment of local youths into militant outfits has also witnessed reduction, adding it is an indicator that the common people desired peace.“We remain committed to providing a conducive environment for peace to prevail. Economic activity had commenced well this year but has been slowed down due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic,” he said.“I am sure that this is a temporary pause and commercial activities will resume soon as, during the winter months, we had seen a record number of tourists visiting the Valley,” he noted.At the same time, he said smuggling of weapons and narcotics remained a concern and there have been attempts to use unmanned systems after individuals have been caught.“We continue to monitor these developments and maintain a robust counter-infiltration grid. We do not want the youth of Jammu and Kashmir to indulge in drugs, crime or violence,” he said.“The youth are bright and many have demonstrated their capability by doing well in sports and academics, bringing laurels to their families, their village, town, district and the union territory,” he said.Gen Naravane said the Indian Army actively encourages such aspirations by organising various sports and educational events.“We remain hopeful that the menace will end with concerted efforts of the government and ‘Awaam’,” he noted.Pakistan has been making concerted efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue. The neighbouring country stepped up its anti-India campaign after New Delhi announced in August 2019 its decision to withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two union territories.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. It has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.

29-05-2021||New Delhi||Over half of 211.8 million jabs administered in India have been through walk-ins||The central government said on Saturday that more than half—55 per cent of the 211.8 million Covid doses administered till date have been through walk-ins.It also said that the issue of unavailability of vaccination slots—which started once the adult drive was opened up—is slowly easing.A steep skew is visible in the demand-supply situation for vaccines in this age group (18 to 44 years) with the situation improving slowly.Government data shows the ratio of registrations to doses administered is today 6.5:1 as against an alarming 11:1 a week before.“Overall, out of 244 million registrations, 167 million have received at least one dose as of today,” said RS Sharma, who heads CoWIN taskforce.He said over 167 million persons have been administered at least one dose of the vaccine in a nation of over 1.37 billion which means 12.21 pc coverage or nearly 1 in every 8 Indians.“Looking at the actual target population of 18+ of 944.7 million, the number goes up to 17.67 pc or 2 in every 11 Indians,” Sharma said.He also assured that CoWIN cannot be hacked and that online registrations have been smooth. “We have smoothly scaled to over 90 million vaccines till date through online registrations. That would have been impossible if the system was not smooth. Taking a cue from our efforts, various densely populated African nations like Nigeria have also sought our support in their efforts to digitise their vaccination drive to monitor equitable geographical coverage. The logistical challenges of scale faced by such nations are similar to that of India, and hence they understand that digital is the only way ahead,” Sharma said, adding that vaccine slots in CoWIN will ease as supplies improve.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-half-of-211-8-million-jabs-administered-in-india-have-been-through-walk-ins-260482
29-05-2021||Vibha Sharma||PM Modi completes one more year in power; BJP to mark day with welfare events||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 29On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will complete two years of his second tenure at the Centre. Otherwise, it has been seven years since he assumed power. Unlike the first five years, the first year was tough for the BJP-led NDA government 2.0 whether the protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or loss of political ground in states like Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Delhi, and Haryana. However, the past year is easily the most difficult for PM Modi ever since he assumed power seven years ago, with farmers’ protest against the three farm laws and questions over the handling/management of the second wave of deadly coronavirus by his government occupying the centrestage and the mind-space not just in India but across the World.        As PM Modi completes one more year in power amidst what has been described as a “once in a century pandemic”, the road ahead for him and his party is expected to get only tougher. In the past year, the BJP lost one state it been politically investing in for five years, West Bengal, and is now facing an uphill task in one of the most crucial states in the country—Uttar Pradesh. The effects of the farmers’ agitation, the growing negative perceptions over his government’s “handling of the second wave of the Covid-19 virus” and the opposition’s build-up over “missing Covid-19 vaccines” is showing. In fact, the results of the recent panchayat polls in UP are, to an extent, commentary on the issues the PM and the BJP have been facing of late. Improving the perceptions and confidence of people in him will be among his biggest challenges as PM Modi steps into the third year of his second tenure tomorrow. The future of the BJP governments in poll-bound states like UP, Gujarat, Uttarakhand depends upon how well he delivers on the issues concerning the people, healthcare, economy, and jobs, etc, and compensates those who suffered in the deadly second wave. It will not be an easy job, say observers. The pandemic has exposed huge gaps, denting the reputation of the PM and the saffron party on the delivery front.  In fact, the Assembly elections next year will be a referendum on both the BJP and PM Modi. The Ram temple at Ayodhya will not be able to cover for the party now, they say.The BJP is not celebrating PM Modi’s seventh year in power with its usual blitzkrieg. Instead, the saffron party has decided not to organise any public function. It has set a target of covering 100,000 villages, organising blood donation camps, and other welfare functions. Ministers have been told to visit villages and interact with people through video. The party will also organise welfare programmes for children orphaned by the Covid-19.On the sixth anniversary in power, last year, the party released a video highlighting the achievements of PM Modi’s government like the ‘Swachh Bharat’ campaign, abrogation of Article 370 to divest Jammu and Kashmir of its special status, and the passage of the CAA, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-completes-one-more-year-in-power-bjp-to-mark-day-with-welfare-events-260477
29-05-2021||New Delhi||Farmers to observe June 5 as ‘Sampoorna Kranti Divas’ by burning copies of farm laws||Farmers will observe June 5 as ‘Sampoorna Kranti Divas’ by burning copies of the Central farm laws in front of the offices of BJP MPs and MLAs to mark the day when these legislations were initially promulgated as ordinances last year, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha said on Saturday.After being promulgated as ordinances, Parliament in September last year passed the proposed legislations and were later made law following presidential assent.Scores of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year demanding the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for their crops.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of protesting farmers unions spearheading the agitation, said, “On June 5, 1974, Jayaprakash Narayan had declared ‘Sampoorna Kranti’ and launched a mass movement against the then central government. Last year on June 5 the government had presented these anti-farmer laws as ordinances.”        Jayprakash Narayan had at a public meeting in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on June 5, 1974, asked the people of Bihar to observe the day as ‘Sampoorna Kranti Divas’ (Total Revolution) and then form a ‘janata sarkar’ in every village to usher in a new social order.“The SKM has decided that on June 5, ‘Sampoorna Kranti Divas’ will be observed all over the country. We appeal to citizens to burn the copies of three agricultural laws in front of offices of BJP MPs, MLAs and representatives... make it a mass movement and force the government to repeal the farm laws,” the umbrella body of protesting farmers unions added.The protesting farmers on Saturday also paid tribute to former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh on his death anniversary and remembered his contribution for the development of agriculture, farmers and villages.“Chaudhary Charan Singh wanted to make the country ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) in which the farmers, labourers and the people of the villages could live happily.“The distrust of farmers in this government reminds them of Chaudhary Charan Singh, who faithfully put every problem and pain of the farmers before the society and the government and resolved it,” they said.According to the SKM, a large batch of farmers from Punjab’s Doaba have joined the protesters at the Singhu border on Saturday and many more are expected to join in the coming days to strengthen the ongoing movement.The Centre has been maintaining that the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of minimum support price and do away with the ‘mandi’ (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

We have decided to keep these parks and reserves open from June 1 to June 30," Shah said in a video statement.The move will help people involved in tourism activities in these national parks, the minister said, adding that visitors will have to follow Covid-19 guidelines during their trips.Madhya Pradesh is home to several tiger reserves such as Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Pench, Satpura and Panna.The central state had regained the top slot in the 2018 census with a population of 526 tigers.The maximum number of big cats (3,421) were found in Madhya Pradesh, followed by Karnataka at 1,783 and Maharashtra 1,690.Earlier on Friday, forest officials had revealed that 41 tiger cubs, from newborns to 1-year-olds, had been spotted at Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-to-reopen-national-parks-tiger-reserves-from-june-1-260466

29-05-2021||New Delhi||Prosecution must establish 'proximate and live link' between dowry death & cruelty: SC||Expressing “grave concern” over family members of the husband being falsely implicated, the Supreme Court has said the prosecution must establish the existence of "proximate and live link" between the dowry death and cruelty or harassment for dowry demand by the husband or his relatives.Clarifying the legal position on dowry death and harassment, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, however, said the penal provision on it must be interpreted by keeping in mind the legislative intent to curb the social evil of bride burning and dowry demand. Often, trial courts recorded the statement of an accused in a “very casual and cursory manner, without specifically questioning the accused as to his defense” and sometimes family members of the husband were roped in, even though they had no active role in the commission of the offence, it noted on Friday.“Section 304-B (Dowry death), Indian Penal Code is one among many legislative initiatives undertaken by Parliament to remedy a long-standing social evil. The pestiferous nature of dowry harassment, wherein married women are being subjected to cruelty because of covetous demands by husband and his relatives have not gone unnoticed,” said the Bench which also included Justice Aniruddha Bose.It emphasised that the provision on dowry death must be interpreted keeping in mind the legislative intent to curb the social evil of bride burning and dowry demand and the section does not take a “pigeonhole approach” in categorising death as homicidal or suicidal or accidental. The ruling came on an appeal by one Gurmeet Singh and others challenging the conviction and seven-year jail term given to them by the courts below for dowry death and abetment to suicide. While acquitting them of abetment to suicide, the top court upheld their conviction and seven-year imprisonment for dowry death. It said the phrase ''immediately before'' in the law can’t be construed to mean ''immediately before'' the death of the bride and the prosecution must establish the existence of “proximate and live link” between the dowry death and cruelty or harassment for dowry demand by the husband or his relatives.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prosecution-must-establish-proximate-and-live-link-between-dowry-death-cruelty-sc-260463

29-05-2021||New Delhi||Freight train on DFC clocks record speed of 99.30 kmph, runs faster than Rajdhani trains||Goods trains on the dedicated freight corridor are running at speeds faster than Rajdhani trains, with one clocking a record 99.30 kmph on Saturday, officials said.The feat was achieved on the 331-km New Khurja-New Bhaupur section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC), which was opened for operations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 29, 2020. The other section, the 306 km between Rewari and Madar on the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC), was opened on January 7. Till date in these sections, a total of 4,000 trains have been run with more than 3,000 trains being run on the EDFC."Some of the trains in the section are achieving an average speed of 99.40 kmph in EDFC and 89.50 kmph in WDFC. These speeds are comparable to any of the fastest mail express trains," an official said.In fact, of the 3077 trains that ran on EDFC so far the maximum speed was 97.85 kmph before the milestone was reached on Saturday. On WDFC, the maximum speed of the 837 trains was 89.50 kmph.This speed is faster than the Rajdhani trains which run at an average speed of around 80 kmph on the rail network.On Saturday, an empty train on its way to load coal clocked 99.30 km, completing its journey of over 300 km in three hours and twenty minutes.Officials said that the high speeds being maintained on the DFCs are primarily due to the lack of restrictions on the dedicated corridors which are prevalent on the network of Indian Railways which is so congested that with time loss of up to 10 minutes per 100 km.However, over the last year, mainly due to the restrictions on passenger traffic because of the coronavirus pandemic, freight trains on the rail network too have gained momentum with around  a 60 per cent jump in average speeds, but nowhere near the pace achieved on the DFCs.During normal times, goods trains on the rail network run at an average speed of 24 kmph, but during the lockdown last year, some zones managed to double their speeds. Over the last 18 months around six zonal railways have registered average speed of freight trains even above 50 km per hour. However, it is to be seen if these speeds are maintained when restrictions are removed on passenger services. The freight train on Saturday which achieved the highest speed completed its 351 km journey in three hours and twenty minutes. "Improvement in freight speed leads to cost saving for all stake holders," an official said.A total of approximately 2,800 route km of the whole WDFC and EDFC (excluding the Sonnagar-Dankuni PPP section) will be commissioned by June 2022.The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCIL), in the first phase of the DFC project, is constructing the 1,504 route km of the WDFC and 1,856 route km of the Eastern DFC. The Eastern DFC will start from Sahnewal and before terminating at Dankuni, West Bengal, it will pass through the states of Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand. On the other hand, the Western DFC connecting Dadri in Uttar Pradesh to JNPT in Mumbai will pass through the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Haryana. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/freight-train-on-dfc-clocks-record-speed-of-99-30-kmph-runs-faster-than-rajdhani-trains-260457

He will be lodged at Jully jail during the period.Further action, whatever is to be taken, will be decided by the court," said SP of Special Investigating Team (SIT) Rohit Rajbir Singh.The court on Friday sent the YouTuber to one-day police custody to investigate the matter of racial remarks he had made against senior Congress MLA Ninong Ering and the people of Arunachal Pradesh.Singh was brought to Itanagar from Ludhiana in Punjab by the police's SIT late on Thursday.The three-member team that brought him to the state was led by inspector Techi Vijay and consisted of constables GL Ray and Aman Kumar Meena.The superintendent of police said that during interrogation, Singh revealed that he has two accounts on YouTube, both of which were created to "generate quick money"."The account with the channel name 'Paras Official', having 4.68 lakh subscribers, is used for showing tips, tricks, and informing his subscribers about the new skins of games like Call Of Duty (COD) mobile and PUBG un-boxing videos.

29-05-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi announces benefits for children orphaned by Covid||On the eve of his government's second anniversary in its second term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced a number of welfare measures for children who lost their parents to Covid-19, including ensuring a corpus of Rs 10 lakh when they turn 18 and providing for their education.Chairing a meeting to deliberate on steps that could be taken to support such children, he said they will be supported under the "PM-CARES for Children" scheme.The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement that fixed deposits will be opened in the names of such children, and the PM-CARES fund will contribute through a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each of them when he or she reaches 18 years of age.Identify Covid orphans, provide relief: Supreme Court to statesThis corpus will be used to give monthly financial support or stipend from 18 years of age for the next five years to take care of his or her personal requirements during the period of higher education. On reaching the age of 23 years, they will get the corpus amount as one lump-sum for personal and professional use.While announcing these measures, Modi emphasised that children represent the country's future and the government will do everything possible to support and protect them so that they develop as strong citizens and have a bright future.Educate Covid orphans free in Navodaya schools: Sonia to PM Narendra Modi"The PM said that in such trying times it is our duty, as a society, to care for our children and instil hope for a bright future. All children who have lost both parents or surviving parent or legal guardian/adoptive parents due to Covid-19 will be supported under ‘PM-CARES for Children' scheme," he said, according to the statement.Highlighting measures for their education, the PMO said children under 10 years will be given admission to the nearest Kendriya Vidyalaya or in a private school as a day scholar.Those between 11-18 years of age will be given admission to any central government residential school such as Sainik School and Navodaya Vidyalaya. In case the child remains under the care of a guardian or extended family, then he or she will be given admission to the nearest Kendriya Vidyalaya or in a private school as a day scholar.If the child is admitted to a private school, fees as prescribed under the Right to Education Act norms will be given from the PM-CARES fund, and it will also pay for expenditure on uniform, textbooks and notebooks, the PMO added.For higher education, children will be assisted in obtaining education loan for professional courses or higher education in India according to existing norms.

BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia, who cited alleged remarks of former Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath that India is not great but infamous following the spread of the infectious disease wanted to know the Congress’ stand on the comments.Claiming that “defaming India has become a priority for Congress’ leaders”, he noted that Nath had earlier described a Covid variant that originated in India as the “Indian variant”. He also alleged that whatever Nath says is at the “behest of Congress president Sonia Gandhi”.“What Kamal Nath says is the Congress’ ideology and does so on behalf of Sonia Gandhi. Why is the Congress silent at his abhorrent statement, why is Sonia Gandhi silent, does she agree with him,” questioned Bhatia, also citing comments of other senior Congress leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Shashi Tharoor to claim that the opposition party has been making “irresponsible” statements to weaken India's fight against Covid.Referring to a media report in Pakistan, the BJP spokesperson alleged that the term Indian variant used by it had “originated” at the Congress headquarters and the opposition party provided tools to countries like Pakistan to target India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-accuses-the-congress-of-working-to-weaken-indias-fight-against-covid-19-260443

29-05-2021||New Delhi||Centre's latest citizenship move back door entry of CAA, exposes govt's fascist nature: Left||The Centre's move to verify and approve citizenship applications from members of minority communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh living in five Indian states reveals the government's "fascist character" and is a way to give a "back door entry" to the CAA-2019, the Left parties alleged Saturday.The Centre on Friday issued a gazette notification granting powers under existing rules to authorities in 13 districts of Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab to accept, verify and approve citizenship applications from members of minority communities hailing from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. With the Centre yet to frame rules under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019, which was fiercely protested against by various sections, the order has been issued under the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Citizenship Rules, 2009.The Friday notification lists Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as the communities that will be allowed. The applications will have to be submitted online."Subterfuge. Rules under CAA 2019 not framed, yet the Central govt issues gazette notification to implement it. Petitions challenging Constitutional validity of CAA continue to remain unheard. Hope SC takes this up promptly & stops back door implementation," CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in a Tweet.CPI general secretary D Raja alleged the move "completely exposes the fascist character" of the present government. He said there were huge protests against the CAA 2019 before the agitators relented because of the coronavirus pandemic, while some protests earlier were "ruthlessly crushed"."It (the latest citizenship move) shows the insensitivity of a government if it pursues its political agenda at a time when thousands are dying every day due to a pandemic. This exposes the government as insensitive, anti-people and anti-democracy," he said. Dipankar Bhattacharya, CPI-ML general secretary, questioned as to how such an order can be passed when the CAA rules are still not in place."In election rallies, BJP leaders were 'distributing' citizenship like they deposited those Rs 15 lakh in every account. Now they are asking for applications from refugees! So if you're an undocumented citizen, you now become a refugee! By the way, are the CAA rules in place?" he asked. In December 2019, the Parliament had amended the Citizenship Act to grant citizenship to illegal immigrants belonging to Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Parsi, Christian and Buddhist communities—but not Muslims—from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Under this law, they will be granted fast track Indian citizenship in six years. So far, 12 years of residence has been the standard eligibility requirement for citizenship through naturalisation.The legislation was passed amid strong criticism from the Opposition, which has been calling it discriminatory, and triggered massive nationwide protests. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-latest-citizenship-move-back-door-entry-of-caa-exposes-govts-fascist-nature-left-260427

But in reality no money was transferred to the victims accounts, the officer said By using this modus operandi, he cheated several shopkeepers, Singh said.The matter came to light on May 28, after a shopkeeper who was duped by Sharma of Rs 2,560 lodged a complaint at the Palam police station.In his complaint, the shopkeeper said a customer had come to buy refined oil at his shop, but did not have cash, and so offered to make the payment through an online application, they said, adding that the complainant never received the payment.DCP Singh said, "With the help of technical surveillance, our team identified the accused and accordingly, a raid was conducted, and Kunal Sharma was arrested from the Palam village area."

29-05-2021||Dehradun||IMA challenges yoga guru Ramdev, ask him to participate in open debate||After yoga guru Ramdev made defamatory statements against allopathy and "defaming" scientific medicine, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Uttarakhand on Friday challenged him for an open debate on a public platform in the presence of media.IMA Uttarakhand President Dr Ajay Khanna in a letter to yoga guru Ramdev called his statement rash, irresponsible and selfish."This is to inform you that IMA UA State through its state office request you to constitute a team of qualified and duly registered Ayurvedacharyas from Patanjali Yogpeeth to have a one-to-one discussion with a team of doctors of IMA UA State which has already been constituted by the state office. This one-to-one panel discussion shall be closely supervised and recorded by the electronic and print media which shall also be invited in this panel discussion," IMA letter reads.The letter further stated that Ramdev and his aide Balkrishna can also join the team of Ayurvedacharyas but only as spectators because they have not sent the qualification to the state office of the IMA."The responsibility is on you to decide the date and time of the above proposed healthy discussion, however, the venue shall be decided by us," it said."The above proposal is for your kind consideration and implementation at the earliest to ensure that the deadlock and the confusion created by you shall meet its end. From this day onwards the onus lies on you regarding the above issue," the letter said.The letter further said that this activity shall ensure the harmony between Allopath and Ayurved to be restored again as it was in the past but was disturbed for these couple of days by your rash, irresponsible and selfish statement.In another letter, IMA also demanded details of hospitals where he has claimed that Patanjali medicines have been used.Earlier on Wednesday, IMA appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take appropriate action under sedition and other charges against Ramdev for allegedly "spearheading a misinformation campaign on COVID vaccination"."At this juncture, we are pained to bring to your kind notice, two videos where Ramdev, owner of Patanjali Ayurved, is seen inter alia to be claiming that 10,000 doctors have died in spite of taking both the dose of vaccine and that lakhs of people have died due to allopathic medicine. He has also claimed that 'Allopathy Ek stupid Aur Diwaliya Science Hai' and that thousands of people have died from taking allopathic medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 related symptoms. These videos are circulating virally on social media," IMA claimed in a letter to PM Modi.The IMA on last Saturday sent a legal notice to Ramdev over his alleged statements against allopathy and "defaming" scientific medicine. However, the Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust has denied allegations by the IMA that Ramdev has misled people by making "unlearned" statements against allopathy and defamed scientific medicine.On Sunday, Ramdev withdrew his statements on allopathic medicine after receiving a strong-worded letter from Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan who called his remarks "inappropriate".According to a Haridwar-based Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust statement, Ramdev was reading out a WhatsApp forwarded message in the video that has gone viral on social media. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ima-challenges-yoga-guru-ramdev-ask-him-to-participate-in-open-debate-260388
29-05-2021||Washington||Quad fills ‘very important gap’ that has emerged in contemporary times: Jaishankar||The informal Quad grouping in the strategically vital Indo-Pacific region comprising Australia, India, Japan and the US fills a “very important gap” that has emerged in contemporary times and New Delhi has clarity on its membership in it, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said.The Quad aims at strengthening a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific amidst China’s aggressive actions in the region.“Quad today fills a very important gap that has emerged in contemporary times, where there are global or regional requirements, which cannot be filled by a single country. It cannot even be filled by one bilateral relationship, and which is not being addressed at the multilateral level,” he told a group of Indian journalists as he concluded most of his meetings here on Friday.Jaishankar, who is on an official trip to the US, is the first Indian Cabinet minister to visit the country since Joe Biden became the President on January 20.He asserted that India has clarity on its membership to Quad, adding that he had been personally involved with its progress over the past several years, including when he was India’s foreign secretary.“We are members of Quad. When we are members of anything, we are very keen about it, otherwise, we won’t be its members. We have clarity on the Quad,” Jaishankar underlined.Quad was one of the key issues of discussion between Jaishankar and top officials of the Biden administration, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.“Quad used to (and) still does discuss maritime security and connectivity, in recent years. It has started to discuss technology issues, supply chain issues and vaccine production. There are marine, sort of safety quality issues. So, there are a whole set of issues,” the minister noted.Without naming any country, Jaishankar said there are “many, many concerns” which have to be addressed by somebody.“Big countries can do a large portion of it. Big relationships can add to it. But at the end of the day, most things work better if a group of countries sit together and say, okay, we all have similar positions and similar interests, and why don’t we all sit and address those sets of issues.“So that is how we see Quad. Quad is an expression of the convergence of interests of many countries. It is in many ways a reflection of the contemporary nature of the world, where it is not a set of, you know…., at some stage, we have to put the Cold War behind us. It is only those who are stuck in the Cold War who cannot understand Quad,” he added.Initiated in 2007, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad is an informal grouping of the US, India, Australia and Japan.The Quad member countries have resolved to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the region.China, which is flexing its military muscles in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond, is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea.The country claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region.China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.Both maritime areas in the South and East China seas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.China has vehemently opposed the formation of the Quad with a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman emphasising in March that exchanges and cooperation between countries should help expand mutual understanding and trust, instead of targeting or harming the interests of third parties.The first summit of the Quad leaders was hosted by US President Joe Biden on March 12 and the virtual meeting was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The four Quad leaders have vowed to strive for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion, sending a clear message to China against its aggressive actions in the region.

Several raids were carried out in various parts of the district throughout the night and are still continuing, he said.A reward of Rs 50,000 each has been announced on the arrest of Rishi Sharma and Vipin Yadav, associates of Anil Chaudhary, the SSP added.Anil Chaudhary and Rishi Sharma are reported to have strong political connections, and police are looking into their “network”, according to an official who did not wish to be named.The police are also looking into media reports claiming that the illicit liquor was a leftover from the huge quantity of spurious liquor which was in circulation during last month’s panchayat polls.At least five liquor vends have been sealed and a team of senior district officials are checking vends all over the district, the police said.The authorities have already ordered a magisterial probe and suspended five excise officials.Additional Chief Secretary (Excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy said District Excise Officer Dheeraj Sharma, Excise Inspectors Rajesh Kumar Yadav and Chandraprakash Yadav, head constable Ashok Kumar, and constable Ram Raj Rana have been suspended with immediate effect.The inquiry will be conducted by an additional district magistrate-rank officer. The administration is likely to invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against those found guilty, DM Chandra Bhushan Singh said on Friday.The district magistrate has recommended Rs 5 lakh ex gratia to the kin of the deceased.

29-05-2021||New Delhi||Delhi records 956 fresh COVID-19 cases, lowest in over 2 months||Delhi on Saturday recorded 956 fresh COVID-19 cases, the lowest in over two months, and 122 more fatalities while the positivity rate slipped to 1.19 per cent, according to health department data.This is the first time since March 22, when 888 infections were recorded, that daily cases in Delhi have fallen below 1,000.The 122 fresh fatalities pushed the death toll in Delhi to 24,073, the health department bulletin stated.On Thursday, 1,072 COVID-19 cases and 117 deaths were recorded while the positivity rate was 1.53 per cent. On Friday, 1,141 cases and 139 fatalities were recorded while the positivity rate stood at 1.59 per cent.Earlier on Saturday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal stressed that if new infections continue to decline, more activities will be allowed to open up in the City.The process of lifting the lockdown gradually in the National Capital will begin from Monday, starting with resumption of construction activities and reopening of factories for a week, Kejriwal had announced on Friday.The phase-wise unlocking process in Delhi will begin after over six weeks of lockdown enforced in view of the second wave of Covid-19.“Delhi recorded around 900 cases in the last 24 hours. Cases have come down below 1000 and the infections decline, we will begin unlocking more activities. We want the economic activities to come on track,” Kejriwal said on the sidelines of an event.Kejriwal visited the Delhi government’s drive-through Covid-19 vaccination centre at the Chhatrasal Stadium.“People can come to this centre in a car or on a motrocycle. They are also coming on foot. As soon as we receive vaccines for the 18-44 age group, we will also start this for them,” he said.The Delhi government has floated a global expression of interest (EOI) for procurement of Covid-19 vaccine on an urgent basis.“We have done global tender and are hoping that some company comes. Different governments have done global tendering but the results have not been inspiring. If some company approaches us, it will be good. But what I understand is that world over companies want to talk to the Centre for procurement of vaccines,” he told reporters.

It is for this reason that the jointness among the three services is far more important than in the past," he said.The armed forces are seeing landmark defence reforms with the establishment of the Department of Military Affairs, institution of Chief of Defence Staff(CDS) and soon to be formed theatre commands, the Navy chief said."Traditions, identity, uniforms and customs of each service matter as do the requirements generated by the distinctive role of the three services. But jointness in the armed forces is paramount for more synergised and effective application of force in today's complex battlefield." The NDA has been a symbol of jointness for 72 years and its existence enforces the core values of jointmanship, which are the founding principles of the academy, Admiral Singh said."All of you must remember that no matter how future warfare evolves, few personal abilities and attributes remain the key for effective leadership. Leadership, as you know is the essence of an officer," he said in his address to the cadets.Admiral Singh, an alumnus of the NDA's 56th course, arrived at his alma mater on Friday, after which he visited his parent squadron "H" (Hunter Squadron) and interacted with the cadets. He presented a memento for the squadron to the cadets, an official statement said.During his visit, the Navy chief got down on his hands and did push-ups with the cadets, as is the tradition followed in the squadron, it said.The entire staff of the Admiral, NDA Commandant and other officers present there also joined him, the statement added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jointness-of-three-armed-forces-important-amid-changing-nature-of-war-navy-chief-karambir-singh-260368

"We're united in confronting Covid-19 together," Blinken said.He said the two countries were also united in addressing climate change, and were partnered together directly through the Quad -- a four country group that also includes Japan and Australia - and through UN institutions "in dealing with many of the challenges we face in the region and around the world." India, the world's second most-populous country, this month has recorded its highest Covid-19 death toll since the pandemic began last year. Only about 3% of India's 1.3 billion people have been fully vaccinated, the lowest rate among the 10 countries with the most cases.Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government has faced mounting criticism for its failure to secure Covid-19 vaccines for its people, even though India is one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines. Indian officials have said Jaishankar has been seeking supplies while in the United States.Jaishankar said India was appreciative to Washington for its "strong support and solidarity at a moment of great difficulty for us."US Acting Assistant Secretary for South Asia Dean Thompson later told a briefing hosted by the State Department's Foreign Press Center that vaccine manufacturing, procurement and delivery were discussed with Jaishankar, but declined to give details.He said final decisions were still pending as to where up to 80 million vaccine doses President Joe Biden has promised to send abroad would go.Thomson said the US Government, state governments, US companies, and private citizens had provided over $500 million in Covid-19 relief supplies to India.He said the assistance had included redirecting a US order of critical vaccine manufacturing supplies that would allow India to make over 20 million additional doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.India pledged last month to fast-track vaccine imports. Its insistence on local trials and a dispute over indemnity stalled discussions with US firm Pfizer. India scrapped local trials for "well-established" foreign vaccines on Thursday and a government official said Pfizer shots could arrive by July.Jaishankar met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in New York on Tuesday. Guterres' spokesman said they had a "very good discussion" on "Covid-19, the issue of vaccines and also a number of other peace and security issues in general."

Asking Rahul “not to spread fear among people” by talking of “third, fourth, and fifth wave”, the minister said India was second country globally to carry out the fastest and largest inoculation programme.Rahul Gandhi, Congress At current vax pace, 3rd wave inevitablePM exported vaccines…. 2nd wave is a result of his theatrics. At today’s pace, vaccinations will conclude by May 2024, but by then we will have multiple waves.“At a time when PM Modi is leading the fight against Covid, the use of words like “nautanki” for him is an insult to the country and its people. We will not use such words for him (Rahul) because people have stopped his “nautanki” long time back,” Javadekar said. He called Rahul’s today’s press conference a “proof of the ‘toolkit’ prepared by the Congress to tarnish the government’s image”.Addressing the media virtually, Rahul claimed the current rate of vaccination guaranteed a third wave and the PM and the government had not yet understood the disease that was evolving fast, nor did they have an inoculation strategy to prevent future waves.“At today’s pace, vaccinations will be completed by May 2024, but by then we will have multiple waves and people will remain vulnerable,” the Congress leader said, defending his recent tweet where he called Covid “Movid”, in an attack on PM Modi and expressing concern over 3 per cent inoculation coverage in India.Javadekar questioned Rahul saying considering the importance he was giving to vaccines now, why did he and leaders of his party raise questions regarding Covaxin. “The PM opted for Covaxin to put a full stop on all questions,” he said.Covaxin production cycle of 120 daysCovaxin maker Bharat Biotech on Friday said it was working to ramp up production, but the process was time consuming. “The timeline for manufacturing, testing and release for a batch of Covaxin is approximately 120 days, depending on the technology framework and regulatory guidelines to be met.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/108-cr-to-get-jab-by-december-rahul-gandhi-stoking-fear-as-per-toolkit-script-prakash-javadekar-259960

The review meeting snowballed into a political controversy after Mamata personally met the PM before the meeting and submitted a copy of the damages caused by the cyclone to him.The CM is learnt to have skipped the meeting due to the presence of her friend-turned-bitter foe Suvendu Adhikari.Later, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik tweeted he decided not to burden the Union Government by asking for additional funds, considering the Covid-19 situation in the country.Modi, nevertheless, announced a financial assistance of Rs 500 crore to Odisha. Another Rs 500 crore was allocated for West Bengal and Jharkhand, which will be released on the basis of the damage. The Union Government will deploy an inter-ministerial team to visit the states to assess the extent of damage, based on which further assistance will be given.The PM also announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of the kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to the seriously injured in the cyclone.

29-05-2021||New Delhi||Ladakh standoff: No de-escalation without complete disengagement, says Army Chief Gen Naravane||In a clear and unambiguous message to China, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane on Friday said there can be no de-escalation without complete disengagement at all friction points in eastern Ladakh and that the Indian Army is prepared for all contingencies in the region.In an exclusive interview to PTI, Gen Naravane said India is dealing with China in a “firm” and “non-escalatory” manner to ensure the sanctity of its claims in eastern Ladakh, and that it was even open to initiating confidence-building measures.It has been more than a year since the military standoff between the two sides erupted in eastern Ladakh on May 5 during which there were fatalities on both sides for the first time in 45 years. They have made limited progress in achieving disengagement in the Pangong lake area, while negotiations for similar steps at other points remained deadlocked.Gen Naravane asserted that the Indian Army is currently holding onto all important areas in the high-altitude region and it has adequate personnel in the form of “reserves” to react to any contingencies.“We are very clear that no de-escalation can take place before disengagement at all friction points. India and China have signed a number of border agreements which have been unilaterally breached by the People’s Liberation Army(PLA),” Gen Naravane said.“Though we want peace and tranquillity at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and are open to initiating confidence-building measures, we remain prepared for all contingencies.”    He also said the situation along the northern border is under control and that the coming rounds of military talks with China will focus on restoring the status quo ante of April 2020.“The Indian Army is very clear that no loss of territory or unilateral change in status quo will be permitted. We are dealing with the Chinese in a firm and non-escalatory way, ensuring the sanctity of our claims in eastern Ladakh,” he said.To a question on when a resolution of the standoff can be expected in areas like Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang, the Army Chief said it was difficult to predict the timeline.“The Indian Army maintains all protocols and agreements between the two countries while the PLA escalated the situation by utilisation of unorthodox weapons and amassing a large number of troops,” he said, in a reference to the Galwan Valley clashes last June.“Troops are currently holding all important areas and we have adequate troops in the form of ‘reserves’ to react to any contingencies,” the Army Chief added.India-China ties came under severe strain following the deadly clash at the Galwan valley following which both sides rushed in thousands of additional troops as well as battle tanks and other large weapons to the region.“The trust levels are bound to be low when a major standoff takes place between two countries leading to casualties on both sides. However, it is always our endeavour that this trust deficit should not hinder the negotiation process,” Gen Naravane said.“As two professional armies, it is imperative that we resolve the situation and make progress to restore trust at the earliest,” he said.Asked about the possibility of any escalation of tension in the region, Gen Naravane said there has been no infringement by the Chinese side following the agreement on the disengagement in the Pangong lake area and that chances of any untoward incident is low.He also said the strength of troops on both sides at present are more or less what it was last year and that the Indian Army was aware of what is happening in the region, adding “you cannot be complacent”.The Chief of Army Staff said the training areas of the PLA located in depth areas at a distance of around 1,000 km from the LAC are also being looked at. Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.The military standoff began at multiple friction points on May 5 last year. Both sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of the Pangong lake in February as part of an agreement reached following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides have held 11 rounds of military talks with an aim to ensure disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points. Both the militaries are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach at the last round of talks on April 9.

29-05-2021||New Delhi||Take care of children orphaned by Covid, Supreme Court directs states||Observing that it cannot even imagine how many children in this large country have got orphaned due to the devastating Covid-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court on Friday directed the state authorities to immediately identify them and provide relief.The top court asked the state governments to understand the agony of children starving on streets and directed the district authorities that they be immediately taken care of without waiting for any further orders from the courts.A vacation bench of Justices L N Rao and Aniruddha Bose directed district administrations to identify the orphans in their areas and upload their data on the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) website by Saturday evening.The top court’s direction came on an application filed by amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal in the pending suo motu case seeking identification of orphaned children due to Covid-19 or otherwise and providing them immediate relief by the state governments.The Bench said state governments must inform it of the position of these children and the steps they have taken to provide them immediate relief.“We have read somewhere that in Maharashtra over 2,900 children have lost their one or both the parents due to Covid-19. We don’t have an exact number of such children. We cannot even imagine how many such children in this large country have got orphaned due to this devastating pandemic,” the bench said.It told the state government’s counsel appearing in the matter, “I hope you understand the agony of the children starving on the streets. You please ask the state authorities to immediately take care of their basic needs”.The top court noted that the Centre has already issued advisory to the authorities concerned for the protection of children, who have lost their parents due to Covid-19.“There is an obligation on the part of the authorities to ensure such children in need are taken care of,” the bench said, while referring to various provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act.It said the district administration authorities should upload the latest data of such orphaned children on the website ‘Baal Swaraj’ of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) by Saturday evening.“We are of the opinion that Centre and State shall get the latest information on the identification of children, who have lost their one or both the parents due to pandemic and the steps taken to attend to their basic needs”, it said, and listed the matter on June 1.At the outset, Agrawal said that he has filed the application as there are numerous children, who have lost one or both the parents or guardians due to the Covid and they need to be immediately taken care of by the state governments.He said there are two categories of children adversely affected due to the Covid-19 -- the ones who lost both parents/guardians and those who have lost the earning parent/guardian of the family since March 2020.Agrawal said another issue of concern is that there are increased instances of child trafficking, especially of the girl child.“The situation is likely to become acute as the number of families adversely affected by the second wave of Covid-19 is perhaps higher,” he said.It is imperative that the functionaries under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 as also the state governments take steps to identify vulnerable families that is families who have children and have lost livelihood due to Covid-19, he added.He further said that they should be provided assistance in terms of food, ration, clothing, other necessities and financial help (to the extent possible), and assistance in locating temporary employment under government schemes.Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, said the government has already issued an advisory to the state government to ensure that children orphaned or in need are taken care of.She said the NCPCR has already developed a portal and is tracking such children who got orphaned due to the pandemic.Advocate Swarupama Chaturvedi, appearing for NCPCR, said that they have a portal called ‘Baal Swaraj’ to track such children and officers at the district level have been given passwords to upload their data on the centralised portal to ensure their tracking.In the application, Agrawal said that coordinated efforts by district administration, the district police and the functionaries under Juvenile Justice Act like Child Welfare Committees for identification and providing support was needed.“It is humbly suggested that state governments may consider setting up a District Task Force in each district having representatives from the district administration (like SDM), the police authorities (like DSP) and the functionaries under JJ Act, which would be tasked with identification of vulnerable families and providing assistance that is food, ration, clothing, other necessities and financial assistance to vulnerable families”, the application said.It sought direction to state governments to take concrete steps to identify victims of child trafficking, children who have lost their parent/guardian(s)/earning parent/ guardian, and children whose families have lost all means of livelihood due to the present pandemic.

29-05-2021||New Delhi||India will get 216 crore new vaccines by December: Javadekar||Senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar on Friday slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for using the word ‘nautanki’ (drama) in reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Responding to Congress leader Gandhi’s scathing questions and claims on India’s vaccination plan, Javadekar said that India will get 216 crore new vaccines by December. “India will be able to vaccinate more than 108 crore people with the help of these vaccines,” Javadekar said, asking Gandhi to not spread fear among people on this issue.Javadekar said India is the second country to carry out the fastest and largest vaccinations.The BJP leader said that at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi is fighting Covid with people of the country, the use of words like ‘nautanki’ is an insult of the country and its people.“We will not use such words for him (Rahul Gandhi) because people have stopped his nautanki long time back,” he said.Javadekar also took a dig at Gandhi saying that people understand that his press conference had been conducted according to the ‘toolkit’ prepared by the Congress party.Asking Gandhi to not spread fear about third, fourth and fifth waves, Javadekar said that India’s vaccination programme is going on well and till December 2021, 216 crore vaccines will be given.“Till December more than 100 crore people will receive vaccines,” he said.Gandhi on Friday said that the current state of vaccination “will guarantee a third Covid-19 wave”, and that Prime Minister Modi and the government have not understood the disease yet, which was evolving fast and nor do they have an inoculation strategy to prevent the future waves.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-will-get-216-crore-new-vaccines-by-december-javadekar-259850
29-05-2021||New Delhi||Suspension of scheduled international passenger flights extended till June 30||The coronavirus-induced suspension of scheduled international passenger flights has been extended till June 30, aviation regulator DGCA said on Friday."However, international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case-to-case basis," the Directorate General of Civil Aviation added.Scheduled international passenger services have been suspended in India since March 23, 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.But special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May 2020, and under bilateral "air bubble" arrangements with select countries since July 2020.India has formed air bubble pacts with around 27 countries including the US, the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan and France. Under an air bubble pact between two countries, special international flights can be operated by their airlines between their territories.The DGCA's Friday circular also said that the suspension does not affect international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by it. The decision to extend the suspension on scheduled international passenger flights comes as India battles a second wave of coronavirus, even though daily cases have seen a steady decline over the past several days. — PTI Notification:||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suspension-of-scheduled-international-passenger-flights-extended-till-june-30-259832
29-05-2021||New Delhi||Current pace of vaccination guarantees third Covid wave: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that the current state of vaccination "will guarantee a third Covid-19 wave", and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government have not understood the disease yet, which was evolving fast and nor do they have an inoculation strategy to prevent the future waves. Addressing the virtual press meet, Gandhi rejected the Centre's assertion that Covid management was going well till the Government of India was managing the response, and the decision-making had not been decentralised to the states.   “The Congress-led Chhattisgarh government did not export the vaccines. The PM did. The buck stops with him …. Here, I am saying, that the PM is responsible for the second Covid wave. It is the result of his theatrics and lack of responsibility. At today’s pace, vaccinations will be completed in May 2024, but by then we will have multiple waves and people will remain vulnerable,” the Congress leader said defending his recent tweet where he called Covid as “Movid” in an attack on PM Narendra Modi, and expressing grave concern over 3 per cent inoculation coverage in India. Gandhi urged the PM to evolve a vaccine strategy, and cover all Indians as soon as possible saying, it was time for the Prime Minister to “be a leader and organize jabs for everyone.”“I’ve been speaking to experts since February. Covid is not a single disease. It is transforming. The disease that attacked us in the second wave is different from the one that attacked us in the first. We are lucky that this second wave is still under the umbrella of the virus. The third may be much more dangerous. Covid is evolving and we have to stop the space for it. Lockdown, masks and social distancing are temporary solutions to Covid. Vaccination is the permanent solution,” the Congress leader said adding: "In my understanding, the current rate of vaccination guarantees the third wave of the virus. If vaccination was 50-60 pc you would not have a third wave and certainly not the fourth.”Accusing the Prime Minister of lacking in strategic thought, Gandhi said: “He is an event manager.”The Congress MP also lamented Foreign minister S Jaishankar’s remarks about there being a conspiracy to defame India in Covid times and noted: “The opposition is like a warning system. We are on the side of the government in this war but the problem is everything is seen as a conspiracy. We have been warning the government since February and they have mocked us.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/current-pace-of-vaccination-guarantees-third-covid-wave-rahul-gandhi-259830
29-05-2021||New Delhi||Delhi to begin unlock process from May 31; factories, construction activities allowed for one week||The process of lifting the lockdown gradually in the National Capital will begin from Monday, starting with resumption of construction activities and reopening of factories for a week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Friday.The phase-wise unlocking process in Delhi will begin after over six weeks of lockdown enforced in view of the second wave of Covid-19. Noting that Delhi somehow gained control over the second wave of Covid-19 with the positivity rate coming down to 1.5 per cent, the chief minister said the fight against the deadly disease has not ended yet.Kejriwal also stressed that if cases start rising again, the unlock process will have to be stopped.The chief minister said it is time to start the unlock process. However, he cautioned that it should not be the case that people escape coronavirus but die of hunger.“We have to maintain a balance between controlling the spread of Covid-19 and allowing economic activities,” Kejriwal said during an online press briefing.                                “At a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday, it was decided that the lockdown be lifted gradually. In this process, we have to take care of the lowest strata first ... daily wagers, labourers, migrant workers who come to Delhi from far off areas in search of livelihood.“Keeping this in mind, it has been decided to open factories and allow construction activities for one week from Monday,” he said, adding that the government will continue the unlock process every week based on the opinion of experts and the public.  However, if the cases start rising again, we will have to stop the unlock exercise, he added, and appealed to the people to not step out unless it is absolutely necessary.In the last 24 hours, Delhi reported a positivity rate of around 1.5 per cent and around 11,00 new cases, the chief minister said.The chief minister had announced a lockdown in Delhi on April 19, after the city recorded over one lakh cases in the previous five days.Thereafter, the government kept extending the restrictions every week, hoping to break the chain of infection as hospitals reeled under a massive surge of cases and shortage of oxygen and essential drugs.  “The number of cases and the positivity rate has declined gradually. There is no difficulty in getting beds, oxygen and ICU beds are also available in good numbers. But the fight against the virus hasn’t ended,” Kejriwal said.So, whatever gains Delhi has been made in the one-and-a-half month of lockdown, it cannot be squandered by lifting the restrictions in one go, he added.On Thursday, Delhi recorded 117 Covid-19 fatalities, the lowest since April 15, and 1,072 cases, while the positivity rate dipped to a nearly two-month low of 1.53 per cent, according to the health bulletin.It was the fifth day in a row when the daily cases in Delhi have remained below 2,000 and the second consecutive day when the cases were below 1,500.

29-05-2021||---||‘Be optimistic’, says SC; defers hearing on Class 12 exams to Monday||New Delhi, May 28The Supreme Court on Friday deferred to May 31 hearing on a petition seeking directions to cancel the Class 12 exams of the CBSE and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) amidst the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country.“Be optimistic. Maybe by Monday some resolution will be there. Let us have it on Monday,” a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar told petitioner Mamata Sharma who has sought directions to devise an “objective methodology” to declare Class 12 results within a specific time frame.The CBSE had on April 14 announced cancellation of Class 10 exams and postponement of Class 12 exams in view of the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases.The Ministry of Education recently sought detailed suggestions from the states and Union Territories on the proposals discussed in a high-level meeting held on the issue.The CBSE has proposed conducting the exams between July 15-August 26 and the result to be declared in September. It gave two options -- conducting regular exams for 19 major subjects at notified centres or conducting shorter duration exams at respective schools where students are enrolled.The Bench asked her to serve an advance copy of her petition to the standing counsel for CBSE, ICSE and the office of the Attorney General for India.The petitioner contended that due to the unprecedented health emergency and surge in Covid-19 cases in the country, it is not possible to conduct the examination and any further delay would cause irreparable loss to the future of students.It was the utmost duty of the state to take care of the health and safety of students and at the same time, not to hamper their higher education and career prospects, she said.Sharma referred to the June 26 last order passed by the apex court which had approved the schemes of CBSE and CISCE for cancellations of remaining board examinations scheduled from July 1 to 15 last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and also approved their formula for assessment of examinees.“In view of the unprecedented health emergency and rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the conduct of examination (either offline/online/blended) in upcoming weeks is not possible and delay in examination will cause irreparable loss to the students as time is the essence in taking admission in higher education courses in foreign universities,” she submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/be-optimistic-says-sc-defers-hearing-on-class-12-exams-to-monday-259799
