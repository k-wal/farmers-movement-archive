He has little or no vision in his left eye due to the swelling, which has spread to the cheek, ear and forehead, compromising other vital organs as well, and posing a significant risk to his life if it spreads to the brain,” the undertrial’s wife Jenny Rowena and brothers Harish MT and MT Ansari said on Tuesday.They said due to acute water shortage in the prison, Babu does not have access to clean water to clean his eye.The family said appeals to get Babu to medical help had failed.They said he started experiencing pain and swelling in the left eye on May 3, which soon developed into double vision and severe pain.“Since the prison Medical Officer had already informed Hany Babu that the prison did not have the facilities to treat his eye infection, Hany Babu had immediately requested for consultation and treatment with a specialised doctor. But he was not taken for consultation, because an escort officer was not available. It was only after his lawyers sent an email on May 6 to the Superintendent, Taloja Jail that he was taken to a Government Hospital in Vashi on May 7. At the Vashi Government Hospital, Hany Babu was examined by an Ophthalmologist, prescribed certain anti-bacterial medication, and advised to return for follow-up treatment in two days. Whilst his condition deteriorated alarmingly, he was still not taken back to the hospital after two days, once again due to the lack of escort officers, the prison claims,” the family said.They said that on May 10, Babu's lawyer made over eight calls to the prison to speak with the Superintendent, who refused to come on the line. “At 8:30 pm, the lawyer was informed that arrangements to take Babu's to the hospital were being made. The lawyer again sent an email emphasising the gravity of the situation and that even a day’s delay may lead to an irreversible deterioration leading to partial or complete loss of sight as well as a life-threatening complication if it affects the brain. But Babu wasn’t taken to the hospital even on May 11,” the family said appealing for medical care.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhima-koregaon-undertrial-hany-babu-battling-life-threatening-eye-infection-says-family-251385
11-05-2021||New Delhi||Second Covid wave seems to have flattened but won’t end before July: Virologist Shahid Jameel||India’s second COVID-19 wave seems to have flattened but the climbdown will be a more prolonged, long drawn-out process than the first and will possibly run till July, eminent virologist Shahid Jameel said here on Tuesday.Though the new variants of the virus may partly be responsible for the explosion in the number of cases, there is no indication the mutant versions are more lethal, added the director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University, amid mounting worries about what is fuelling the second wave in India.Addressing an online event organised by the Indian Express, Jameel noted that it is a little too early to say if the Covid wave has peaked.“The curve may have flattened but the other side of the peak is not going to be an easy climbdown. It’s possibly going to be a more prolonged long-drawn-out process running possibly till July, that means, even if the curve starts to decline, we will continue to have to deal with a large number of infections every day,” Jameel said.According to the scientist, COVID-19 cases in the second wave also won’t come down in as steady a fashion as they did after the first wave.“In the first wave, we did see a steady decline. But remember… this time we are starting from a higher number. Instead of 96,000-97,000 cases, we are starting from over 4,00,000. So, it will take that much longer. And during the process at every time point, you’ll have a lot of cases,” Jameel explained.In his view, the actual mortality data for India is completely wrong. “… not because of some evil design of someone or a group of people or the state or whatever. But the way we record data I think is faulty.”  Discussing why India faced a second wave, he said the constant narrative was that somehow Indians are special and have some special kind of immunity.“You know, we had BCG shots when we are children. We get a lot of malaria. So, you get all sorts of arguments,” he said. The BCG vaccine is primarily used against tuberculosis.The noted virologist also said people gave opportunity to the virus not to just spread but also to transmit quickly by not adhering to COVID-19 protocols.“…by the time we came to December and the cases kept going down, we did start believing in this narrative (of immunity). There were a lot of big weddings that we had in January and February. So super spreading events happened,” he added.He cited other “super spreading events”, including elections rallies and religious congregations, for the high number of cases in the second wave.Vaccine coverage is a matter of concern in his view.Enough people, he said, did not get vaccinated when they had the opportunity in January and February.“… around the third week of February when numbers started going up, we had very, very little vaccine coverage, possibly about 2 per cent of people,” Jameel said, adding that some people believed in the messaging that vaccines were not safe.“Vaccines are safe and the side effects are very rare. There are more chances of someone dying from lightning than due to rare side effects of vaccines.”  Referring to the vaccine shortage in some states, he noted that all big countries that had vaccinated a considerable proportion of their population had booked their doses around June 2020.“India didn’t do that. We did have a big vaccine enterprise but remember our biggest vaccine companies are private limited companies. You know, it’s another story that going back a few years we closed down all our public vaccine enterprises. So, we depend entirely on the private sector.“Private sector does not work on charity. The private sector needs to be given orders for them to be confident or, you know, building facilities to make vaccines. And that is where we took our eye off the ball,” he said.However, the virologist said funds have now been allotted to Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India, Pune, and both are expanding facilities. But it will take around July by the time vaccine supplies normalise.

11-05-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan would not hold talks with India until New Delhi reverses its decision on Kashmir: Imran||Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday that Pakistan would not hold talks with India until New Delhi reverses its decision of scrapping the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated it into two Union territories.“Unless India retreats from the steps taken on August 5…, the Pakistani government will not talk to India at all,” Khan said while responding to questions from the public during a live broadcast session.Earlier in the day, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that no talks presently were taking place with India but parleys could be held if New Delhi revisited its policy regarding Kashmir and provided relief to the people of Kashmir.“Jammu and Kashmir cannot be an internal issue of India as it is on the agenda of the UN and there are several Security Council resolutions on it,” he said while addressing a news conference in Islamabad.India has repeatedly said Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and the country is capable of solving its own problems.New Delhi has told Islamabad that it desires normal neighbourly relations with it in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.Indo-Pak relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two Union territories in August 2019. India has maintained that issue related to Article 370 of the Indian Constitution was entirely an internal matter of the country.However, lately there has been some improvement when the two countries agreed in February to restore peace on the Line of Control. It is said that the rival officials have been interacting through the backchannel diplomacy to ease tension.Khan also responded to several questions about domestic issues and defended the performance of his government which came to power in August 2018.

11-05-2021||New Delhi||Farmers returning to protest sites after harvest season: Samyukta Kisan Morcha||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions, on Tuesday said farmers were returning to Singhu and Tikri border protest sites after finishing harvesting their crops.In a statement, the SKM said that large convoys of farmers arrived at the two border points on Monday and this will now continue.“Yesterday, large convoys of farmers arrived on the Singhu border and Tikri border. Farmers were welcomed at many places on their way to these sites from Punjab. These farmers, who have travelled in tractors, cars and other vehicles, have made arrangements to live in tents and trolleys as they were living before harvesting,” it said.“The farmers’ strike is getting stronger and the protest sites are also becoming larger. Farmers’ tents, trolleys and other vehicles have been permanently there for the last five months in long queues. The pattern of farmers coming back after the harvesting season will now continue,” it added.The farmers’ outfit said that the government was “promoting privatisation” even at a time when “thousands of people have lost their lives due to the mismanagement of the public health system”.“The government should increase investment in education, health and agriculture sectors. Along with taking guarantee of the purchase and remunerative price for the crops of the farmers, the government should make a law on MSP and repeal the three anti-farmer laws immediately,” it said.Delhi reported 319 more COVID-19 fatalities and 12,651 new cases on Monday, with a positivity rate of 19.10 per cent.

We are working together to scale up and committed to provide more vaccines to India by July. This will help us to protect countless lives against this devastating virus,” SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot noted that the company remains steadfast in its continued commitment to changing the course of the pandemic for the people of India.“We hope that through increasing vaccinations, humanitarian relief efforts, and critical donations of medicines and needed equipment, India will steadily recover from this crisis. We stand united with the people of India, as we work tirelessly to bring this pandemic to an end as quickly as possible,” he added.

11-05-2021||New Delhi||Mumbai hospital moves SC seeking medical oxygen for treating COVID patients||A Mumbai-based private hospital has moved the Supreme Court seeking direction to the Centre and the Maharashtra government to take urgent steps to ensure sufficient supply of Oxygen to it for saving lives of COVID-19 patients.The plea said it is a COVID hospital with 90 beds of which 13 are hi-tech ICU facilities and the hospitals which are requisitioned by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) can retain 20 percent of the beds for non-COVID patients.It said that from April 12, 2021, oxygen was denied by a private medical gas provider to it and the hospital had to shift the patients to other hospitals.“At a time when there is great shortage of beds and ICU facilities for the treatment of COVID patients, the petitioner Hospital, one well equipped with all modern, hybrid facilities for COOVID treatment, is forced to remain handicapped, practically closed,” the plea said.The hospital claimed it was even willing to pay five times the approved rates for oxygen but the private medical gas provider demanded a minimum of 10 times the official rate.The petitioner hospital said that they had complained to BMC, police authorities and even made representations to various other authorities but it had not received any help of any kind.“The said representations to the various authorities unfortunately fell only on deaf ears at a time when the state continues to face an extreme emergency where death stares in large numbers of COVID patients, who are struggling to breathe and require immediate supply of oxygen”, it said. The hospital also alleged black marketing of medical grade oxygen in the state and sought action by authorities against the medical gas providers. The top court is currently seized of a suo motu case on ensuring supplies of essential commodities and services for management of COVID-19 across the country and has also dealt with the issue of supply and demand of oxygen to hospitals. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-hospital-moves-sc-seeking-medical-oxygen-for-treating-covid-patients-251360
11-05-2021||New Delhi||Oxygen concentrator case: ‘Khan Chacha’ owner Navneet Kalra fails to get protection from arrest||A Delhi court on Tuesday refused to give any interim relief from arrest to businessman Navneet Kalra for the second time in the alleged oxygen concentrator hoarding and black-marketing case.Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass also placed his anticipatory bail before the District and Sessions Judge which will now decide which court will hear the plea on Wednesday.“Bail application placed before the District Judge South East at 10 am tomorrow; they will send it to the concerned court. There is no interim relief or any sort of protection to the accused yet,” the judge remarked.The court was hearing the arguments on the issue of jurisdiction on the anticipatory bail petition filed by the businessman in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators from his upscale restaurants, including ‘Khan Chacha’ in Khan Market. During the course of proceedings, Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said that since the matter was transferred to the Crime Branch after registration of FIR, the court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter.   “On May 7, the court had the power but now since the case has been transferred, it has no jurisdiction over the matter,” Shrivastava apprised the judge.However, advocate Vineet Malhotra, representing the accused, told the court that on May 7, the case was registered at Lodhi Colony police station and hence the court has the jurisdiction over the matter, despite the investigation being transferred later.“Just because it was transferred, they cannot take away the jurisdiction of this court. The court cannot be bound to their action,” Malhotra said.The court on Monday had directed the investigating officer of the case to be present in court today along with a copy of the reply to Kalra’s pre-arrest bail.During a recent raid, 524 oxygen concentrators were recovered from three restaurants owned by Kalra and it is suspected that he has left Delhi along with his family.These concentrators are the crucial medical equipment used for COVID-19 management.

11-05-2021||Patna||Pappu Yadav arrested in Patna, taken away to far-off Madhepura||Several supporters of controversial former Bihar MP Pappu Yadav on Tuesday staged a protest here in defiance of the lockdown as their leader was picked up from his house, kept at a local police station for hours and whisked away to a far-off district in the evening in connection with a 32-year-old case.The supporters of Yadav, who is the founding president of Jan Adhikar Party, alleged that he was being hounded because of his recent “expose” of Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who is an MP of the BJP which rules the Centre and shares power in the state.Yadav's wife Ranjit Ranjan, herself a former Congress MP from Supaul, said she “feared” for her husband’s life, smelt a “big conspiracy” behind his arrest and warned that she would hold the NDA government and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar accountable if anything untoward happened to Yadav while in custody.The high drama began in the forenoon when Yadav was picked up from his Mandiri residence and taken to the Gandhi Maidan police station.The local administration here came out with a release hours later stating that Yadav and 10 of his supporters had been booked for creating a ruckus at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH).The FIR, lodged under the Disaster Management Act, the Epidemics Act and relevant sections of the IPC, was however registered at Pir Bahore police station, situated about a kilometre and a half away, which has jurisdiction in matters relating to the PMCH.The arrest of Yadav, a politician with criminal antecedents who has fashioned himself after Robinhood, was decried by political leaders from almost all parties who pointed out towards his acts of charity during the ongoing pandemic and warned of the episode sending a wrong message.From the NDA camp, Yadav’s arrest was frowned upon by Rajnish Kumar, a BJP MLC, minister Mukesh Sahni who is founding president of a fledgling Vikassheel Insaan Party, and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who heads the Hindustani Awam Morcha and whose son Santosh Suman is a member of the state cabinet.Leaders of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) however, chose not to react over the stormy episode.Those from opposition parties like RJD and Congress predictably denounced the arrest and sought to link it with Yadav’s recent spat with Rudy, the sitting MP from Saran.Yadav had recently accused Rudy of having “hoarded” a number of unused ambulances at a property owned by the latter.His accusations had met with a strong rebuttal by the BJP MP.Outside the Gandhi Maidan police station, a large number of JAP supporters stood shouting slogans denouncing the “conspiratorial” manner in which their leader was picked up in connection with a “fabricated” local case and held under detention for hours before being told that he will be taken away by a visiting police team to Madhepura where a court had passed a non-bailable warrant against him.The case, relating to abduction, is said to have been lodged way back in 1989 and the warrant, which followed Yadav’s failure to appear before the court despite repeated summons, was issued in March this year.“He is being taken to Madhepura in connection with a case registered at Kumarkhand police station there”, Deputy SP (Town), Patna, Suresh Kumar told PTI-Bhasha.“Anybody can see it is a conspiracy and a farce. A 32 years old case, a warrant that is two months old.“And a day is chosen when our leader is first made to sit at a police station in sweltering weather for the whole day before undertaking an arduous road journey”, cried an exasperated JAP worker.

11-05-2021||New Delhi||India conducting 18-20 lakh COVID tests a day: ICMR||India is conducting 18-20 lakh tests for detection of COVID-19 per day, the ICMR chief said on Tuesday underlining that despite infection among laboratory staff, the test performance is still being maintained.At a press conference, ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said that the national COVID-19 positivity rate is around 21 per cent and about 42 per cent (310/734) of the districts are reporting a positivity rate more than the national average.Stressing that early testing, isolation and home-based care is the key to control transmission, Bhargava said, “The RT-PCR testing capacity is about 16 lakh per day in our laboratories and RAT capacity is also around 17 lakh per day.”       “Laboratories are working 24X7 to meet the increased testing demand. Despite infection among laboratory staff, test performance is still being maintained,” he said.Giving an example, Bhargava said that in the month of April and May, they were doing, on an average, 16-20 lakh RTPCR and RAT tests combined per day.On April 30, India conducted 19,45,299 tests for detection of COVID-19 that is the highest number of tests by any country ever, he said, stressing even the US has never reached this number. On May 5,19,23,131 tests were conducted.“So, we are hovering around 18-20 lakh per day except for on Sundays when we find a dip of one or two lakh,” he said.There are at present 2,520 COVID-19 government and private molecular testing labs, over 7,000 RT-PCR machines and over 3,800 TrueNat and CBNAAT machines.A total 30,04,10,043 samples have been tested up to May 7 in India.In the second wave, Bhargava said three initiatives were taken—rationalising RT-PCR tests, increasing RAT testing for early detection, isolation and home care and third COVID-19 tests approved by reputed global agencies have been accorded marketing permission by DCGI.In terms of rationalisation of RT-PCR tests, he said RT-PCR must not be repeated in individuals tested positive once either by RAT or RT-PCR. No testing is required for recovered individuals at the time of hospital discharge and there is no need for RT-PCR tests in healthy individuals undertaking inter-state domestic travel.Non-essential travel and interstate travel of symptomatic individuals should be essentially avoided. All asymptomatic individuals undertaking essential travel must follow COVID appropriate behaviour, he said, adding that mobile testing laboratories are also being deployed.With the second wave of coronavirus raging, Bhargava stressed on aggressively increasing the usage of Rapid Antigen Tests in rural and hard to reach areas to ensure faster isolation.He recommended setting up multiple 24X7 RAT booths in cities, towns and villages. He said RATs are to be allowed at all government and private healthcare facilities and no accreditation is required.RAT booths are to be set up with the community in schools, colleges, community centers, RWA offices etc. Public-private partnership models must be encouraged to establish innovative and convenient testing centers. He said RATs must be conducted in accordance with RAT algorithm defined by ICMR and all RT-PCR and RAT test results should be uploaded on ICMR portal, he added.Social distancing norms are to be ensured at all RAT and RT-PCR testing centers.“COVID-19 tests approved by reputed global agencies have been accorded marketing permission by the DCGI and home-based testing solutions are also being explored,” he added.In response to a question on whether children are getting more affected, Bhargava said the comparison of data during the first and second wave of COVID has shown that there is not much age difference and people above age of 40 are more vulnerable for adverse outcomes.“We have found that younger people are getting slightly more involved because suddenly they have gone out and there are variants also prevalent in the nation which may be affecting them as well,” he said.Bhargava further said that if one has fever with or without cough, headache, sore throat, breathlessness, bodyache, recent loss of taste or smell, fatigue, diarrhoea, then they should be tested immediately, and while awaiting test results, they should be isolated. Some people make the mistake of monitoring pulse rate, he said, adding that those in home isolation should not confuse pulse rate as oxygen saturation.

11-05-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Rising Covid numbers force lockdown in Telangana||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, May 11Within days of ruling out the imposition of lockdown in Telangana by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR), the state cabinet in its meeting on Tuesday took a decision to impose a 10-day lockdown from midnight tonight. People will be given a few hours in the morning to buy essentials, otherwise everything has been shut down. Despite the fact that one of the two vaccines being administered in India is being produced in the state, Telangana is facing a huge shortage of vaccines as the COVID-19 cases continue to rise. Yesterday, Telangana blocked entry of ambulance that were ferrying patients from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, because Telangana does not have enough space for its own. The Telangana High Court has pulled up the state for blocking the highways between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. A division bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy questioned the state and asked why ambulances were stopped at the Telangana border despite not having any inter-state regulations in place, terming it as ‘unconstitutional’ and a violation of the fundamental rights of citizens. Given various factors, including the questioning by the High Court over not taking adequate measure like enforcing night curfew and ensuring COVID-19 protocols, the Telangana Government has announced a lockdown to prevent further spread of coronavirus.  According to a state official, the state cabinet decided to clamp a lockdown from 10 am on May 12 (Wednesday) for 10 days. “However, there would be relaxation for all the activities from 6 am to 10 am daily,” it said.  In the past 24 hours, the number of cases of corona infections crossed half a million as 4,826 fresh cases were added while the toll stood at 2,771 with 35 more casualties. The cabinet also decided to invite global tenders for procurement of COVID-19 vaccine, the official said. Soon after the announcement people rushed to markets, fruit and vegetable markets, and wine shops to accumulate stocks of food and drinks for the next ten days. There were many road blocks due to this, forcing the police to come onto roads to manage traffic and people gathering without maintaining social distance. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is already in a partial lockdown for the last one week for the most part of the day, except for a few hours in the morning to allow people to buy their daily needs. There is no activity between 12 noon to 6 am the next day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rising-covid-numbers-force-lockdown-in-telangana-251353
11-05-2021||New Delhi||AAP govt bought no ventilators last year, using those provided under PM-CARES: Delhi BJP||BJP leader Meenakashi Lekhi on Tuesday alleged that the Delhi government did not buy any new ventilators last year and is using those delivered through the PM-CARES Fund.Addressing a press conference here, Lekhi alleged that the Delhi government did not increase the number of ICU beds either.“If you talk about ICU beds in Delhi, they haven’t increased them at all. The (AAP) government is using the ventilators given through the PM-CARES Fund. It did not buy a single new ventilator last year,” the BJP leader claimed.She also added that the Centre and the Defence Research and Development Organisation have been providing oxygen, hospitals, and special beds, while “even the medical staff are being provided by ITBP and other defence organisations”.The New Delhi MP also slammed the Kejriwal government for advertising about “universal vaccination”.“The MCD was running 150 vaccination centres. The AAP government closed 60 centres and are showing advertisements that Arvind Kejriwal will run universal vaccination in Delhi. They have not floated a global tender nor have they availed vaccines from anywhere,” Lekhi said.While no immediate reaction was available from the Aam Aadmi Party, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Monday that a 500 ICU-bed COVID care centre attached to the GTB hospital will be ready for use by May 11.Another 500 ICU-bed facility near the LNJP Hospital at the main Ramlila ground will also be ready soon, he had said.

11-05-2021||Mumbai||Muslim woman performs last rites of Hindu man in Kolhapur||Putting humanity above religion, a Muslim woman in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur city performed the last rites of a COVID-19 infected Hindu man whose close relatives could not come for the funeral as they had tested positive for coronavirus.The humanitarian act by Ayesha Raut, who works as a senior manager at Aster Adhar Hospital in Kolhapur, has come in the midst of a gloomy atmosphere caused by the COVID-19 pandemic when family members and relatives are shying away from ensuring decent last rites for their near and dear ones.On May 9, she performed the last rites of one Sudhakar Vedak (81), who died after battling COVID-19 for a week in the Aster Adhar Hospital, as per Hindu tradition.Speaking to PTI, Raut said, As part of annual distribution drive during the holy month of Ramzan, my family had decided to donate PPE kits to people working in cemeteries and crematoriums in Kolhapur city.“When I was at the Panchganga crematorium to distribute PPE kits, I received a call from Dr Harshala Vedak, whose father Sudhakar Vedak had died on Sunday (May 9).Dr Harshala Vedak asked Raut if she could facilitate the last rites of her father at the Panchganga crematorium as all her family members, including herself, were infected with coronavirus. She and Raut know each other professionally.Dr Harshala Vedak works as a resident medical officer at state-run Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Hospital in the city, around 375km from Mumbai.I was a bit upset as there was no one from Sudhakar Vedaks side to even attend the funeral. So I called Dr Vedak and sought her permission to perform her father’s last rites.“With her nod, I wore PPE kit and performed the last rites as per Hindu rituals, Raut said.Dr Harshala Vedak hailed Rauts noble and kind gesture.“When a relative dies, there is grief in the family and due to COVID-19 restrictions, people feel the pain more because they can not even attend funeral or perform last rites,” Dr Harshala Vedak said.Sudhakar Vedak’s condition deteriorated on Friday and he died on Sunday, but none from his family could visit the hospital because all of them, including Dr Harshala Vedak, had tested positive for coronavirus and were in home quarantine.My father has three daughters and I am the eldest one. Three years back, when my mother lost her battle to cancer, I had performed her last rites in Mumbai.“Our parents were always proud of their daughters and we never faced any discrimination while growing up. Hence, it was not very difficult for me to accept that a woman is going to perform the last rites on my father, Dr Harshala Vedak said.She said Raut’s religion was not an issue.“There was no issue at all with Ayesha, being a Muslim, performing the last rites. In fact, we all are full of gratitude for what she did.“I know Ayesha professionally for the last few years.I saw her initiative as a good example being set before the society, Dr Harshala Vedak said.Asked about her state of mind when she decided to perform the last rites, Raut said, I felt very sad that no relative was present and Sudhakar Vedaks body was kept there along with other bodies.“There was a long queue of dead bodies at the crematorium and most of them were put on funeral pyre by crematorium workers. It was a very depressing scene.”           Raut said she did not think about religion when she lit the funeral pyre.“I could at least offer some solace to the family by performing the rites. I did not think for a second that I am a Muslim and I am performing the last rites of a Hindu, Raut said.Asked how people perceived her act, she said, This is Kolhapur which has a long history of movements related to social reforms. I have not face any disapproval of my act...everyone appreciated my gesture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/muslim-woman-performs-last-rites-of-hindu-man-in-kolhapur-251340
11-05-2021||  Ahmedabad||Gujarat government faces HC fire over COVID-19 hospital blaze||The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday criticised the state government over the recent fire at a COVID-19 hospital in Bharuch, saying it was contemptuous on its part to not remain vigilant and avoid such incidents, and cited many orders passed in this regard in the past.A division bench expressed surprise over Advocate General Kamal Trivedi’s submission that the COVID-19 facility at the trust-run Bharuch Welfare Hospital, where the fire on May 1 killed 18 people, was set up “surreptitiously, without intimating the authorities”.Sixteen COVID-19 patients and two nurses were killed in the blaze.The bench of Justices Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav D Karia said that “somebody has to be made accountable” for the deadly fire.The bench was hearing a petition filed by advocate Amit Panchal seeking a direction to hold government officials accountable and punish them for failing to comply with the court’s previous directions related to fire incidents in COVID-19 hospitals.“The anxiety of the court is what are you supposed to do to prevent such incidents in the coming days... Ultimately, what are the measures that you are going to take?” the court asked.The judges said the government failed to take action on the court’s previous orders pertaining to all hospitals in the state so that fire incidents do not occur again at these medical facilities.“It amounts to the contempt of courts of all the orders passed by the courts in the past. Ultimately, it amounts to the contemptuous action on the part of the state for not being vigilant so that such incidents are not repeated again and again,” the bench said.The court said the government’s affidavit, filed in the matter, only talks about letters issued by top authorities but was silent on actions taken by lower-level officials pursuant to previous orders passed by the court.Trivedi said the fire-hit COVID-19 facility in Bharuch town was set up “surreptitiously, without intimating the authorities,” and hence no-objection certificate (NOC) on fire safety could not be issued by local authorities to the new unit.The court expressed surprise over Trivedi’s submission and said if the state was not intimated about a COVID-19 facility, how was it possible for it to compile data on coronavirus patients who are hospitalised.The bench also issued notices to the Bharuch municipality, the trust which runs the hospital, its nodal officer for fire safety and the government, and kept the matter for hearing after two weeks.On the petitioner’s plea to make public, the DA Mehta Commission of Inquiry report on fire incidents at two Gujarat hospitals, the government told the HC the report was submitted late in the evening on March 31 this year and could not be tabled in the Assembly as its session got over on April 1.The Mehta commission had probed the fire incidents at two hospitals - one in Rajkot (November 11, 2020) and the other in Ahmedabad (August 2020) - in which altogether 13 COVID-19 patients were killed.“As per the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry, the report is required to be studied, prepared, and thereafter tabled before the Assembly.“There is no question of keeping the report under carpet or else we should not have appointed a commission,” Trivedi told the court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-government-faces-hc-fire-over-covid-19-hospital-blaze-251336
11-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to divert 3 lakh Covaxin doses for 45-plus age group||Amid a shortage of COVID-19 vaccine does, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday decided to divert three lakh vials of Covaxin meant for the 18-44 age group for the use of the people aged 45 years and above.Speaking to reporters, state Health Minister Rajesh Tope also said more than five lakh people above 45 years are awaiting the second dose for the want of the vaccine.“Efficacy of the vaccine is largely affected if the second dose is not administered in a stipulated time. To avoid such health crisis, the state government has decided to divert three lakh vials (of Covaxin) purchased for the 18-44 age category for the people above 45 years,” Tope said.He said only 35,000 vials of Covaxin are currently available with the state government for administering the second dose to the people above 45 years.According to the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, COVID-19 vaccination is free at government vaccination centres that receive doses from the Centre for eligible population groups comprising healthcare workers, frontline workers and people above the 45 years of age.However, states and private hospitals have to procure 50 per cent of the vaccines in order to immunise persons in the age group of 18 to 44 years.

11-05-2021||New Delhi||Prioritise vaccinating those due for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine: Centre to states||The Centre appealed to states on Tuesday to prioritise vaccinating those due for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine and reserve at least 70 per cent of the shots supplied from the central pool for the purpose.States have also been urged to minimise wastage of vaccine doses, the health ministry said in a statement.All wastage more than the national average hereafter is to be adjusted from the subsequent allocations to that state or union territory.The urgent need to address a large number of beneficiaries waiting for second dose of vaccine was stressed in a meeting held by Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Dr R S Sharma, the Chairman of Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management to Combat COVID-19, with state officials to review the status of COVID-19 vaccination on Tuesday.States were urged to “ensure all beneficiaries who have taken the first dose are prioritised for the second doses”, the ministry said in the statement.In this regard, states can reserve at least 70 per cent of the vaccines supplied to them from the Government of India channel for second dose vaccination and the remaining 30 per cent for first dose.“This however is indicative. States have the liberty to enhance this to as much as 100 per cent. State-wise numbers on CoWIN have been shared with states for their planning purposes.“The states were asked to undertake awareness campaign for reinforcing the importance of complete vaccination with two doses of the vaccine,” the statement said.Presenting details of states who have ensured high coverage of priority groups (like population aged 45+, frontline workers and healthcare workers) and the others, the Union Health secretary urged states to ensure that priority groups are vaccinated.States have been informed in a transparent manner in advance about the COVID vaccines being provided to them from Govt of India channel. The visibility for the forthcoming fortnight is conveyed to them in advance to enable better and more effective planning by them, the statement stated.The next allocation for the period 15-31th May will be conveyed to them on May 14. It was pointed out that states can utilize the information regarding dose allocation for the next 15 days to plan their vaccination sessions.States were also urged to minimise vaccine wastage, the statement said. While the overall levels have considerably reduced, Union Health Secretary pointed that there were many states which still needed to substantially reduce the wastage.It was suggested to states and UTs to retrain and reorient vaccinators to ensure judicious usage of the vaccines.“All wastage more than the national average hereafter is to be adjusted from the subsequent allocations to that state and UT,” the statement said.In this context, it was also pointed out that certain states are able to report a negative wastage because the well-trained health workers can extract maximum doses per vial than what is otherwise generally earmarked.States were also briefed about procurement from the ‘Other than Government of India’ (OGoI) channel which has been opened in the Liberalised Phase-III Strategy of Vaccination.In view of the payments pending from states to the private vaccine manufacturers, the states were advised to constitute a dedicated team at state level of 2 or 3 senior officers to coordinate with vaccine manufacturers on a daily basis and secure State Govt. supplies promptly, the statement said.This team is to also coordinate with private hospitals to facilitate their procurement thereby maintaining the momentum of the overall vaccination exercise in the State.The CoWIN platform is also being modified to better reflect the changing needs of the vaccination exercise, the statement said.The states can download a second dose due report to better plan the completion of vaccination of the target groups., the statement said.The District Immunization Officer and COVID Vaccination Centre Manager can increase the session capacity according to demand and can also visualise the target group in their upcoming sessions. Beneficiaries without relevant photo ID cards like senior citizens at old-age homes, etc., can also be registered, the ministry said.

11-05-2021||New Delhi||India might see ‘serious livelihood crisis’, says economist Jean Dreze||India might be heading towards a “serious livelihood crisis” as the situation seems to be worse this time for the working class amid the COVID crisis and local restrictions by states already add up to something close to a nationwide lockdown, according to noted economist Jean Dreze.In an interview to PTI, he also said the government’s target to make India a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was never a “feasible target” and was just to pander to the “super-power ambitions” of the Indian elite.About the impact of the second wave of COVID on the Indian economy, the eminent economist said the situation today is not very different from what it was around this time last year as far as working people are concerned.“The economic consequences of local lockdowns may not be as destructive as those of a national lockdown. But in some respects, things are worse this time for the working class,” he opined.Further, the eminent economist said the fear of infection is more widespread and that will make it hard to revive economic activity.“Despite mass vaccination, there is a serious possibility that intermittent crises will continue for a long time, perhaps years.”“Compared with last year, many people have depleted savings and larger debts. Those who borrowed their way through last year’s crisis may not be able to do it again this time,” he observed.Dreze also pointed out that last year there was a relief package and today relief measures are not even being discussed.“On top of all this, local lockdowns may give way to a national lockdown relatively soon. In fact, they already add up to something close to a country-wide lockdown.  In short, we are heading towards a serious livelihood crisis,” he said.On how the government could have missed seeing the second COVID-19 wave coming, Dreze said the Indian government has been in denial all along.“Remember, the government refused to admit about any ‘community transmission’ of COVID for a long time, even as recorded cases were counted in millions.  When an early analysis of official data exposed the collapse of health services, the government retracted the data,” he said.He pointed out that misleading statistics have been routinely invoked to reassure the public that all is well. “Denying a crisis is the surest way to make it worse. We are now paying the price of this complacency,” he said.India has been reporting more than three lakh new COVID cases daily in recent weeks and the death toll due to the infection is also rising.Noting that India is also paying the price of a long history of neglect of the health sector, especially public health, Dreze said nothing is more important than health for the quality of life, yet public expenditure on health in India has hovered around a measly 1 per cent of GDP for decades.When asked about the sort of relief measures that could be put in place to deal with possible livelihood crisis, he said as a starter, the central government could replay the 2020 relief package.“But it is important to go beyond that, and to consolidate the social security system on a durable basis,” the eminent economist said, adding that ad-hoc, short-term relief measures tend to breed confusion, corruption and waste.Dreze, who was also part of the National Advisory Council (NAC) that had advised the previous UPA government, said much can be done within the framework of existing social security schemes and laws such as the public distribution system, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), the National Social Assistance Programme, and the Integrated Child Development Services.He also noted it would be easy to provide supplementary food rations to all ration-card holders for much longer than the proposed two months, and also to expand the coverage of the public distribution system.“Going beyond existing schemes, I think that a well-designed, inclusive cash-transfer programme would be useful,” Dreze opined.According to him, if intermittent crises are going to continue for years, which is very possible, it would really help to have a well-functioning system of cash relief that can be activated whenever the need arises.“Turning India into a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was never a feasible target, and it is a useless target in any case. The function of this target is to pander to the super-power ambitions of the Indian elite,” the Belgian-born Indian economist said.  In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi envisioned to make India a USD 5 trillion economy and global power house by 2024-25.According to Dreze, even if we accept GDP as a valid development indicator, the standard approach is to look at GDP at its per capita terms.“But then India looks like one of the poorer countries in the world, which it is. Looking at aggregate GDP, which is naturally quite large because of India’s large population, creates an illusion of prosperity and power,” he argued.Dreze pointed out that actually it is not entirely an illusion because if the government’s interest is in power on the world stage rather than in the living conditions of the people, then, yes, aggregate GDP would matter.“For instance, it would enable you maintain a large army. But this has nothing to do with development,” he observed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-might-see-serious-livelihood-crisis-says-economist-jean-dreze-251326

A probe into the matter is underway," MP Singh, Ghazipur's District Magistrate told ANI.The local people, traumatised by the sight of floating human bodies in the Ganga, fear spreading of diseases in the area, which has not been spared by the ravaging Covid pandemic.They complained of stench coming from the bloated, decomposed corpses and accused the authorities of ineptitude."We informed the administration about the matter, but no action has been taken by them. If the situation continues like this, there is fear of us getting infected by Coronavirus," Akhand, a resident, told ANI.The incident of floating and piling up of corpses in Bihar sparked fears about the scale of the Covid crisis in the country. Authorities believe the relatives of those succumbed to the virus, may not have been able to find space for the last.Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday termed the incident as "unfortunate" and asked concerned states to take immediate cognizance. "The incident of corpses found floating in Ganga in Buxar region of Bihar is unfortunate.

11-05-2021||Ahmedabad||Doctors warn against cow dung as COVID-19 cure, point to 'health risks'||Doctors in India are warning against the practice of using cow dung in the belief it will ward off COVID-19, saying there is no scientific evidence for its effectiveness and that it risks spreading other diseases.The coronavirus pandemic has wrought devastation on India, with 22.66 million cases and 246,116 deaths reported so far.Experts say actual numbers could be five to 10 times higher, and citizens across the country are struggling to find hospital beds, oxygen, or medicines, leaving many to die for lack of treatment.In the state of Gujarat in western India, some believers have been going to cow shelters once a week to cover their bodies in cow dung and urine in the hope it will boost their immunity against, or help them recover from, the coronavirus.In Hinduism, the cow is a sacred symbol of life and the earth, and for centuries Hindus have used cow dung to clean their homes and for prayer rituals, believing it has therapeutic and antiseptic properties."We see ... even doctors come here. Their belief is that this therapy improves their immunity and they can go and tend to patients with no fear," said Gautam Manilal Borisa, an associate manager at a pharmaceuticals company, who said the practice helped him recover from COVID-19 last year.He has since been a regular at the Shree Swaminarayan Gurukul Vishwavidya Pratishthanam, a school run by Hindu monks that lies just across the road from the Indian headquarters of Zydus Cadila, which is developing https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-zydus-vaccine-idINKCN2510MP its own COVID-19 vaccine.As participants wait for the dung and urine mixture on their bodies to dry, they hug or honour the cows at the shelter, and practice yoga to boost energy levels. The packs are then washed off with milk or buttermilk.Doctors and scientists in India and across the world have repeatedly warned against practising alternative treatments for COVID-19, saying they can lead to a false sense of security and complicate health problems."There is no concrete scientific evidence that cow dung or urine work to boost immunity against COVID-19, it is based entirely on belief," said Dr JA Jayalal, national president at the Indian Medical Association."There are also health risks involved in smearing or consuming these products - other diseases can spread from the animal to humans."There are also concerns the practice could contribute to the spread of the virus as it involved people gathering in groups.Madhucharan Das, in charge of another cow shelter in Ahmedabad, said they were limiting the number of participants. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctors-warn-against-cow-dung-as-covid-19-cure-point-to-health-risks-251312

11-05-2021||Jodhpur||29 new COVID cases at IIT Jodhpur||As many as 29, including 25 students, were tested positive for COVID-19 at IIT Jodhpur, taking the total number of coronavirus cases reported at the campus to 225, authorities said.The report for the new 29 cases at the institute came out on Monday after a massive campaign was put in place to test every campus resident, said Amardeep Sharma, Spokesperson and Deputy Registrar of the institute."These 29 students and staff members have been reported positive after the fresh sample tests conducted on May 7," he added.He said the last semester of the trimester ended on May 7 and the activities were now taking place online as the courses have been completed.With the arrival of students on campus for practical sessions in April, the infection started to spread in the campus, Sharma said.“Since practical sessions were essential, we started calling students, with adherence to the guidelines by Human Resource (and Development) ministry,” he said.“Fortunately, none of these infected cases bordered serious condition and all those who had tested positive earlier, have recovered,” he added.Generally, students start leaving for their homes after the semester examinations are over but given the lockdown in different states, it would not be possible for them to leave now, Sharma said.The IIT administration, however, has put in place adequate arrangements given the spike in positive cases, wherein isolation and super-isolation centres have been set up.“We take samples of every student or staff coming to the college and keep him or her in the isolation centre until the report is obtained. If tested positive, they are shifted to the super isolation centre for recovery,” said Sharma. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/29-new-covid-cases-at-iit-jodhpur-251306
11-05-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan says Indian variant of COVID-19 not present in country||The Indian variant of the coronavirus has not been found yet in Pakistan, a senior minister in-charge of the coronavirus task force has said, rejecting reports that the Indian strain of the virus reached Thailand from the country.According to reports, health authorities in Thailand on Monday confirmed the country's first cases of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, in a Thai woman and her 4-year-old son who have been in state quarantine since arriving from Pakistan.The finding comes amid Thailand battling a new wave of the coronavirus.Reacting to the reports, Minister of Planning Asad Umar, who also heads the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) -- a centralised body set up to coordinate the national COVID-19 response -- on Monday said it is not possible that two Thai nationals had contracted the Indian coronavirus variant from Pakistan as it is not yet present in the country.Some of the variants such as UK, Brazilian and South African were reported in the country, but not a single case of Indian variant has been reported yet, he was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.The Indian variant -- officially known as B.1.617 -- was first detected in the state of Maharashtra in October last year. The strain has reportedly been spotted in at least 21 countries. It was quite possible that the woman had contracted the virus from Thailand or somewhere else as the virus was not reported in Pakistan, Umar said.Thailand has banned travellers from India, other than Thai citizens, starting on May 1 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. It extended the entry ban to foreigners visiting from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal on Monday in an effort to keep the Indian variant from spreading, Thai Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tanee Sangrat said.Meanwhile, Pakistan's coronavirus death toll reached 19,106 on Tuesday with 113 succumbing to the viral infection in the last 24 hours, health officials said.The nationwide confirmed cases now stand at 864,557 with 3,684 new cases, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-says-indian-variant-of-covid-19-not-present-in-country-251298
11-05-2021||Bengaluru||Cooling therapy breathes life into newborn 11 minutes after he was born||As the second Covid wave is sweeping across Karnataka, here's a heart-touching story of the baby soldier, who took his first breath, a whopping 11 minutes after he was born.Bengaluru North's Rainbow Children Hospital revived the baby that was born floppy, which in other words means he couldn't breathe at birth, couldn't cry, didn't have a heartbeat rate and no sign of breathing movement at all.The hospital's consultant, Dr Pradeep Kumar disclosed that the baby was born normal but with a very poor APGAR score. "After taking note of this condition, we immediately used every medical intervention technique including newborn resuscitation technique after which the baby's heartbeat came up in one minute but it took 11 minutes for this baby to take its first breath," he explained.According to him, the APGAR score is a test given to newborns soon after birth. This test checks a baby's heart rate, muscle tone, and other signs to see if extra medical care or emergency care is needed. The test is usually given twice: once at one minute after birth, and again at five minutes after birth.He added that when this newborn was born with challenging conditions, a team of doctors in Rainbow Hospitals diagnosed the baby with Stage-2 Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy. So to cure him, these experts used the 'Therapeutic Hypothermia method', which is also called the 'whole body cooling method'.Dr Kumar said that this was a very rare scenario and is observed only in two per cent of live births but contributes for 20 per cent of neonatal deaths."Prenatal Asphyxia happens because of decreased blood flow from mother to the placenta and to baby, impaired oxygenation to the baby, reduced gas exchange across the placenta and increased foetal oxygen requirement," he claimed.Talking about the procedure, and the mental state of the parents, the Neonatology and Paediatrics consultant, Dr M. S. Sreedhara, who treated the baby right from day one stated that parents were in a state of emotional shock, despair and denial. "As clinicians, in addition to giving the best clinical care to the infant, we counselled the parents in such a way that they understand the clinical condition of the baby. We made sure they are ready to accept and face the short term and long-term challenges," he explained.Another team member who handled this case, Neonatology and Paediatrics, Dr Sushma Kalyan Achuta said that the baby was cooled for 72 hours and slowly rewarmed over 12 hours. "He was monitored closely for vitals and systemic functions and seizures were treated appropriately with medications. After an MRI, the baby was normal in condition and after a neurological examination, and was discharged," she said.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cooling-therapy-breathes-life-into-newborn-11-minutes-after-he-was-born-251296
11-05-2021||New Delhi||Disinfection drives, serving 'kadha' in langars among safety measures taken by farmers to keep virus at bay||From conducting disinfection drives to serving immunity-boosting 'kadha' in langars, farmers protesting at Tikri and Singhu borders in the national capital against the Centre's three agricultural laws are taking new steps everyday to keep the deadly coronavirus at bay.Delhi reported 319 more COVID-19 fatalities and 12,651 new cases on Monday, with a positivity rate of 19.10 per cent."We disinfected 17-km of the protest site at the Tikri border. And will do it again in the coming days as well. We have been taking all preventive measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, including distributing masks and sanitisers to the protesting farmers," Roop Singh of Bharat Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) said on Tuesday.Singh claimed that the farmers have not got any support from the government in fighting against coronavirus, and that all measures taken to curb the spread of the virus at the Tikri border have been taken by them only.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for almost six months, demanding a repeal of the three agri reform laws enacted by the central government in September last year.According to farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar, each and every langar at the Singhu border is being sanitised regularly and to improve the immunity of protesting farmers, 'kadha' is also being served on a daily basis."The langars operating round-the-clock are being sanitised regularly. To improve the immunity of farmers, they are being served with 'kadha' as well. Also, there are vaccination camps in the vicinity and whoever wants to get vaccinated is free to get the jab," said Kohar from Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers' unions spearheading the stir."We, from our end, are neither forcing anyone to not have it or have it, this is their personal choice," he said.The Centre has been maintaining that the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws will pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the 'mandi' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disinfection-drives-serving-kadha-in-langars-among-safety-measures-taken-by-farmers-to-keep-virus-at-bay-251295
11-05-2021||New Delhi||Irrational plasma use could trigger virulent Covid variants: Scientists warn PM’s adviser||Top Indian scientists and clinicians on Monday wrote an open letter to government Covid strategists demanding the removal of convalescent plasma therapy from national Covid clinical protocols and warned against possibilities of plasma use triggering virulent Covid variants while being of no clinical benefit among Covid patients.“Current research evidence unanimously indicates there is no benefit offered by convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19. However, it continues to be prescribed rampantly in hospitals across India. Families of patients run from pillar-to-post for getting plasma, which is in short supply and black marketing is common. Some very early evidence indicated a possible association between emergence of variants with lower susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies in immunosuppressed people given plasma therapy. This raises the possibility of more virulent strains developing due to irrational use of plasma therapy which can fuel the pandemic,” clinicians said in a signed letter addressed to prime minister’s principal scientific adviser K Vijay Raghvan, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava and AIIMS New Delhi Director Randeep Guleria.The signatories include top vaccinologist Gagandeep Kang, Editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Amar Jesani, public health researcher Shahid Jameel, and other scientists including Oomen John, Gautam Menon, CS Parmesh and Anant Bhan.The signatories said that the problematic scenario of Covid patients running after plasma arose because of ICMR and AIIMS guidelines which currently recommend plasma therapy (April 2021 version) as "off label" use.“This is rather unusual as off-label use by its very definition implies unapproved use. International guidelines such as those from National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA and the IDSA guidelines also recommend against general use of plasma therapy for COVID-19. We request you to urgently review the guidelines and remove this unnecessary therapy which has no benefit but is only causing harassment of patients, their families and even COVID-19 survivors who are being pressured to donate plasma,” said the signatories adding that new guidance should be twinned with clear instructions to blood banks across the country on the same.They said they were willing to assist and appraise evidence critically to inform the policy change they are seeking.“We hope you will look into this as a matter of urgency and get the ICMR and AIIMS guidelines rectified so they reflect the current research and scientific consensus on plasma therapy,” the signatories said citing all global and Indian studies on convalescent plasma therapy, none of which has shown any benefits in Covid patients.The signatories cited conclusions of the ICMR-PLACID Trial, the world’s first randomised controlled trial on convalescent plasma which found convalescent plasma was not associated with a reduction in progression to severe covid-19 or all-cause mortality. They also cited the Recovery Trial, the large global trial of 11,588 patients found no difference in death or proportion of patients discharged from hospital and the PlasmAr Trial, from Argentina, concluded there is no significant difference in clinical status or overall mortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who received placebo.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/irrational-plasma-use-could-trigger-virulent-covid-variants-scientists-warn-pms-adviser-251285

11-05-2021||New York||Give India resources to make vaccines, says Fauci||Antony Fauci, the top US expert on Covid-19, has called on countries to provide India with resources to make its own vaccines or donate vaccines."India is the largest vaccine-producing country in the world. They've got to get their resources -- not only from within but also from without and that's the reason why other countries need to chip in to be able to get either supplies for the Indians to make their own vaccines or to get vaccines donated," he told a TV interviewer on Sunday."One of the ways to do that is to have the big companies that have the capability of making vaccines to really scale up in a great way to get literally hundreds of millions of doses to be able to get to them," he said.He said that the "endgame" in fighting the pandemic is vaccinating everyone.At the same time, he said that all of India should "shut down", as some states have done.Vaccines are one of the ways of "breaking the transmission", but others "like shutting down the government" should be undertaken, Fauci said."I have advised them in the past that you really need to do that. You've got to shut down. I believe several of the Indian states have already done that but you need to break the chain of transmission," he said.Fauci made the observations in an interview on ABC TV with George Stephanopoulos, who was former President Bill Clinton's spokesperson.Fauci said that a priority for India should be to set up field hospitals as China had done."They have really got to get hospital beds and do really what the Chinese did way back a year or so ago, where you essentially build up with -- the equivalent of field hospitals. You've got to get that. You can't have people out in the street not having a hospital bed," he said.In fact, during the Covid crisis last year, tents were also set up in New York's Central Park to treat those who could not find hospital beds and convention centres and sports venues were also made into emergency medical facilities.Fauci called the oxygen shortages in India "really tragic".President Joe Biden has ordered the supply of vaccine manufacturing equipment and ingredients to India along with oxygen and devices for making the gas and medications to treat Covid-19. The total Covid-19 aid package for India is expected to run to $100 million, according to his Spokesperson Jen Psaki.Biden's administration has also agreed to a request made by India and South Africa to the World Trade Organisation to waive the intellectual property rights. However, it faces opposition from other countries, including Germany and Switzerland, blocking WTO approval.Fauci dismissed suggestions that dropping the patent rights to allow others to make the vaccines would hamper the manufacture by companies now making them."I don't think that's the case," he said. "They can scale up. You know, they've done an extraordinary amount. You've got to give them credit. They've really just really done something that is really quite impressive in the way they've gotten their vaccine supply up and out for the rest of the world." Waiving patents won't interfere with that now, he said.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/give-india-resources-to-make-vaccines-says-fauci-251272

11-05-2021||New Delhi||What we know about the Indian variant as coronavirus sweeps South Asia||India has recorded the world's sharpest spike in coronavirus infections this month, with political and financial capitals New Delhi and Mumbai running out of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines.Scientists are studying what led to the unexpected surge, and particularly whether a variant of the novel coronavirus first detected in India is to blame. The variant, named B.1.617, has been reported in 17 countries, raising global concern. Here are the basics:WHAT IS THE INDIAN VARIANT?The B.1.617 variant contains two key mutations to the outer "spike" portion of the virus that attaches to human cells, said senior Indian virologist Shahid Jameel.The World Health Organization (WHO) said the predominant lineage of B.1.617 was first identified in India last December, although an earlier version was spotted in October 2020.On May 10, the WHO classified it as a "variant of concern," which also includes variants first detected in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. Some initial studies showed the Indian variant spreads more easily."There is increased transmissibility demonstrated by some preliminary studies," Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, said, adding it needs more information about the Indian variant to understand how much of it is circulating.ARE VARIANTS DRIVING THE SURGE IN CASES?It's hard to say.Laboratory-based studies of limited sample size suggest potential increased transmissibility, according to the WHO.The picture is complicated because the highly transmissible B.117 variant first detected in the UK is behind spikes in some parts of India. In New Delhi, UK variant cases almost doubled during the second half of March, according to Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control. The Indian variant, though, is widely present in Maharashtra, the country's hardest-hit state, Singh said.Prominent U.S. disease modeller Chris Murray, from the University of Washington, said the sheer magnitude of infections in India in a short period of time suggests an "escape variant" may be overpowering any prior immunity from natural infections in those populations."That makes it most likely that it’s B.1.617," he said. But Murray cautioned that gene sequencing data on the coronavirus in India is sparse, and that many cases are also being driven by the UK and South African variants.Carlo Federico Perno, Head of Microbiology and Immunology Diagnostics at Rome's Bambino Gesù Hospital, said the Indian variant couldn't alone be the reason for India's huge surge, pointing instead to large social gatherings.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticised for allowing massive political rallies and religious festivals which have been super-spreader events in recent weeks.DO VACCINES STOP IT?One bright spot is that vaccines may be protective. White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said that preliminary evidence from lab studies suggest Covaxin, a vaccine developed in India, appears capable of neutralizing the variant.Public Health England said it was working with international partners but that there is currently no evidence that the Indian variant and two related variants cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed less effective."We don't have anything to suggest that our diagnostics, our therapeutics and our vaccines don't work. This is important," said Van Kerkhove at WHO. Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-we-know-about-the-indian-variant-as-coronavirus-sweeps-south-asia-251269

11-05-2021||Washington||COVID-19: US congresswoman urges Biden to send more direct support to India||A US congresswoman has urged President Joe Biden to send more direct support to India which is battling an unprecedented second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Congresswoman Haley Stevens, in a letter to Biden on Monday, said that India is now the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic.“This past week India registered over 400,000 daily cases. On May 4, there were 3,786 deaths, bringing the total to 226,188 fatalities. The sharp increase in cases has severely strained the healthcare system, overwhelming hospitals, and depleting oxygen supplies. India is in great need of oxygen, therapeutics, and vaccines,” Stevens wrote.Asking the White House to increase shipments of oxygen cylinders, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and ventilators to Indian hospitals, she thanked Biden for his support of more than USD 100 million to India.“I urge you to provide the following items: Oxygen Cylinders, 10 liters and 45 liters Liquid Medical Oxygen Capacity; Oxygen Concentrator; Oxygen Generator Plants; Remdesivir; Tocilizumab, Ventilators/BiPAP,” she said.“As you continue to assess the situation in India, I urge you to consider fulfilling the additional needs outlined above. As long as COVID persists in India, there is the potential for additional variants that could pose a serious threat to a vaccinated America.

We will go through the affidavits and keep the matter on Thursday,” said a Bench of Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice LN Rao and Justice SR Bhat as the proceedings got hit by technical glitches.In an affidavit filed on late Sunday night, the Centre cautioned the SC against judicial interference in the matter and asked it to trust the wisdom of the executive which needed the discretion to formulate a policy in the larger interest.Executive’s wisdom should be trustedIn view of the unprecedented and peculiar circumstances under which vaccination drive is devised as an executive policy, the wisdom of the executive should be trusted. — Union Government“Any overzealous, though well-meaning judicial intervention, may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences,” the affidavit submitted. The Centre also rejected the court’s suggestion to exercise its powers under the Patents Act — such as compulsory licensing or government authorisation — over Covid vaccines and medicines, saying it would be counter-productive at this stage.The SC had earlier asked the Centre to reconsider its vaccine pricing policy as it would prima facie prove detrimental to the right to public health.Defending its vaccination policy, the Centre said the price factor would not have any impact on the ultimate beneficiary since all state governments had declared they would be administering vaccines to their residents free of cost. The vaccine price was not only reasonable, but also uniform throughout India, it submitted.“Due to consultations and ‘persuasion’ by the Centre, both Bharat Biotech and SII have declared their prices which are uniform for all state governments,” it said, adding, the new “Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy” would further ramp up the pace of vaccination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-defends-vax-policy-says-no-room-for-court-intervention-250941

The question about the future of Sonowal, a popular tribal leader, remains.Tribals have a significant presence in upper Assam districts of Jorhat, Golaghat, Sivsagar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Dhemaji and Lakhimpur. Observers say Sonowal and other tribal leaders gave the BJP a foothold in the region. Perceived largely as a “north Indian” party, the BJP was able to garner the support of tribals, including the Kachari tribe to which Sonowal belongs.Sources say Sonowal is expecting a “meaningful role in the state, not at the Centre”. Speculations are rife he may be handed over the reins of the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) in consonance with the BJP’s “one man, one post” policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sarma-sworn-in-unhappy-tribals-his-biggest-challenge-250968

The corresponding count for oxygen-supported beds is 1,54,993 and 1,00,175. In the latest meeting of the group of ministers held on Saturday, experts informed the government that 1.34 per cent of the current active cases—37,45,237—were on ICU support and 1.34 per cent of the active patients were on oxygen support. That translates to occupancy of 50,186 ICU beds and 1,38,573 oxygen-supported beds.The occupancy rate for ICU beds stands at 66.3 per cent (two-thirds) as of today while oxygen-supported bed occupancy rate is 54.3%, exerting daily pressures on the system unless active cases reduce. “Even as we ramp up critical care and hospital infrastructure to deal with active cases, we have to work to reduce the cases too for which local restrictions in areas with high positivity rate are important to break the chain of transmission,” AIIMS (New Delhi) Director Randeep Guleria said as the virus moved to tier 2 and 3 cities.Meanwhile, the daily new cases today dropped to 3,66,161, a much needed dip after four straight days of more than 4 lakh cases each.

However, it continues to be prescribed rampantly in hospitals... Some early evidence indicated a possible association between emergence of variants with lower susceptibility to neutralising antibodies in immunosuppressed people given plasma therapy. This raises the possibility of more virulent strains developing due to irrational use of plasma therapy which can fuel the pandemic,” clinicians said in a signed letter addressed to PM’s principal scientific adviser K Vijay Raghavan, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava and AIIMS-New Delhi Director Randeep Guleria.The signatories, including top vaccinologist Gagandeep Kang, Editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Amar Jesani and public health researcher Shahid Jameel, said they were willing to assist and appraise evidence critically to inform the policy change they were seeking. “We hope you will look into this as a matter of urgency and get the ICMR and AIIMS guidelines rectified,” the signatories said, citing studies on convalescent plasma therapy with none showing any benefits. — TNSOdisha reports first black fungus caseOdisha has detected its first case of mucormycosis or ‘black fungus’ in a 71-year-old Covid patient with a known history of uncontrolled diabetes, officials said on Monday.

On why the case was registered late when he knew of the sexual assault before the victim’s death, he said, “I was shaken by the sudden demise of my daughter and how she was tortured by the accused.”The victim's father, meanwhile, today filed a second statement with the Bahadurgarh police stating that only two persons, Anil Malik and Anup Singh, were accused in the case, and that "he had no complaint against the four others named in the FIR". "We want punishment for the guilty, not the innocent. Hence, the names of the four others should be excluded from the FIR," he demanded.Yogendra Yadav, another SKM leader, said the police had also included the names of two women activists in the FIR. “The women, in fact, had helped the victim. Their names were not even mentioned by the complainant,” he said.Asked whether union leaders knew about the incident and why a police complaint was not lodged earlier, Yadav claimed they weren’t aware about the sexual assault.Jhajjar SP Rajesh Duggal today inspected the crime spot at Tikri where the Kisan Social Army had pitched its tent. The tent is learnt to have been removed by farmers a few days after the incident came to light.

Bodies coming from as far as 70 km away (from Varanasi) would have got untied,” said Kalicharan Singh, a resident of Chausa block.He went on to add: “The cremation charges, which used to be between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000, have gone up manifold. Now the charges range from Rs 16,000 to Rs 20,000. This may also be the reason for people abandoning bodies.”However, District Magistrate of Buxar Aman Sameer said, “After finding the bodies on the banks of the Ganga, senior officials rushed to the spot to assess the situation.

Prime Minister Oli secured 93 votes in the lower house of parliament during a special session convened on the directives of the President. Oli required at least 136 votes in the 275-member House to win the confidence motion as four members are currently under suspension.A total of 124 members voted against the confidence motion while 15 members stayed neutral, Speaker Agni Sapkota announced. The session was attended by 232 lawmakers.Some 28 Lawmakers belonging to Oli’s rival faction led by Madhav Nepal-Jhala Nath Khanal abstained during the voting. The main opposition Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), which control 61 and 49 votes, respectively, voted against Oli’s trust motion.The political uncertainty in Nepal comes at a time when it is battling a rise in Covid cases. This is an issue that Oli has seized upon by writing an op-ed appealing for help from the UK as the head of G-7.Sources here noted that one solace is that the Chinese envoy to Nepal Hou Yanqi was unsuccessful in gathering support for Oli. In case the trio of Prachanda, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Upendra Yadav manage to make common cause, a new PM, because of support from the Nepali Congress will look more for support from the western world and India.Last week, Maldives, which does not have a reputation for extremism, saw a car bomb attack targeting Nasheed, a pro-India figure and the man who broke a 36-year authoritarian stranglehold over power. Politics has gone murky in the Maldives as the island has witnessed contestation between India and the US on one side and China and Pakistan on the other.While the US, China, Pakistan and Russia call the shots in deciding Afghanistan’s future, the bloodbath in the country continued.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-pm-oli-loses-trust-vote-250959

Luthra had told the top court that the plea was only opposed to the permission granted for continuing the construction going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.“Labourers are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Rajpath and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them,” Luthra had told the apex court.Luthra had told the top court that when the nation was considering lockdown and even the Indian Premier League was being shut, the construction activity cannot be allowed.The plea before the high court has contended that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-vista-hc-to-take-up-early-hearing-plea-to-stop-work-on-tuesday-250846

The CWC authorised Sonia Gandhi to form panels to review state wise losses. Earlier, Sonia Gandhi called for frank discussions on why the party lost.The meeting began with a presentation by chief ministers of Congress ruled states on the Covid situation and challenges.In her address to the CWC, Sonia said the CWC meeting has been convened to discuss the recent election results. “We have to take note of our serious setbacks. To say that we are deeply disappointed is to make an understatement. I intend to set up a small group to look at every aspect that caused such reverses and report back very quickly.  We need to candidly understand why in Kerala and Assam we failed to dislodge the incumbent governments, and why in West Bengal we drew a complete blank. These will yield uncomfortable lessons, but if we do not face reality, if we do not look the facts in the face, we will not draw the right lessons,” she said.Gandhi also took the CWC on board on the issue of electing a Congress president.“When we met on January 22 we decided to complete the election process by end-June. The election authority chairperson Madhusudan Mistri ji, has prepared a schedule. Venugopal will read it out to you after our discussion on Covid-19 and the election results,” she said.Soon the CWC will hear AICC General Secretaries - Jitender Singh for Assam, Tariq Anwar for Kerala, in charge Dinesh Gundurao for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and Jitin Prasada for West Bengal on why the  Congress lost.“I expect them to brief us very frankly on our performance in their respective states. We want them to tell us why we performed well below expectation. These results tell us clearly that we need to put our house in order. Finally, we can discuss the election of the Congress president,” Gandhi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cwc-postpones-cong-chiefs-organisational-election-till-covid-settles-250767

11-05-2021||New Delhi||Centre to SC on vax policy: No judicial interference needed, trust wisdom of executive||In a late-night affidavit submitted in the Supreme Court, the Centre defended its Covid vaccination policy, which has been criticised for differential pricing, shortage of doses, and slow rollout.The Centre added that the price factor will not have any impact on the ultimate beneficiary namely, the eligible person getting the vaccine since all state governments have already declared their policy decision that each state will be administering the vaccine to its residents, free of cost.Urging against judicial interference on its vaccine policy, the Centre's Sunday night affidavit said: "Any overzealous, though well-meaning judicial intervention may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences, in absence of any expert advice or administrative experience, leaving the doctors, scientists, experts and executive very little room to find innovative solutions on the go." The Centre said it is most respectfully submitted that in the times of such grave and unprecedented crisis which the nation is fighting the disaster of an unprecedented magnitude, the executive functioning of the government needs the discretion to formulate policy in the larger interest."It is submitted that in view of the unprecedented and peculiar circumstances under which vaccination drive is devised as an executive policy, the wisdom of the executive should be trusted," said the affidavit.The affidavit said with a view to ensuring that there is no disparity between the states inter-se, with active consultation of the Centre with both the manufacturers, the central government has successfully fixed uniform price to be paid by all the State Governments.Defending its vaccine policy, the affidavit said: "The policy is framed as above which is just, equitable, non-discriminatory and based upon an intelligible differentiating factor between the two age groups (45 plus and below)." The affidavit added: "This policy thus, conforms to mandate of Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India and is made after several rounds of consultation and discussion with experts, State Government and vaccine manufacturers requiring no interference by this Court as while dealing with a pandemic of this magnitude, the Executive does have a room for free play in the joints, in larger public interest." The Centre said the policy was framed keeping in mind limited availability of vaccines, the vulnerability of age groups, and the fact that vaccinating the entire country was not possible in one go due to the suddenness of the pandemic, as the prime considerations.The Centre emphasized that it is ensured that the pricing of vaccine is also not only reasonable but uniform throughout the country removing any possibility of one citizen in one state getting the vaccine at a higher price as compared to a similarly situated resident residing in another state."Due to consultations and "persuasion" by the Central Government both the manufacturers of vaccine, Bharat Biotech and SII, have declared their respective prices which are uniform for all State Governments," added the affidavit.A bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat will take up the matter arising out of a suo motu case, later Monday.The affidavit added that the new 'Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy would further ramp up the pace of COVID-19 vaccination." "It aims at liberalized vaccine pricing and scaling up of vaccine coverage to incentivize vaccine manufacturers to rapidly scale up their production and to attract new vaccine manufacturers. It would make pricing, procurement and administration of vaccines more flexible and ensure augmented vaccine production as well as wider availability of vaccines in the country", said the affidavit.The Centre submitted that two vaccines are currently part of the vaccination drive since January 2021. Another COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V developed by Gamaleya Institute, Russia and distributed in partnership with Dr Reddy's Laboratories, has received Emergency Use Authorization by the National Regulator in April 2021 and would be available now. Many other candidates are in the late stages of clinical trials and, therefore, expected to receive 50 necessary approval that would further increase the availability of vaccines.On April 30, the top court while hearing a suo moto matter in connection with Covid-19 management issues, had called for revisiting the Centre's vaccine policy. The top court had remarked that the manner in which the current policy has been framed would prima facie result in a detriment to the right to public health, which is an integral element of Article 21 of the Constitution."Sometimes, steps that are taken for immediate needs, to tide over an imminent crisis, may turn out to be imprudent in a long run. However, they need to be appreciated, understood and acknowledged, keeping in mind the complete strategy and policy and holistic picture of immediate-, medium- and long-term needs, while also retaining the capacity to remain dynamic to deal with an ever-mutating virus, whose exact graph cannot be predicted with accuracy and continuous upgradation of knowledge pool with further experience and research," added the affidavit.The Centre said both manufacturers (one an Indian company and second a licensee of a British company) have taken the financial risk in developing and manufacturing these vaccines and it is prudent to take decisions on pricing through negotiations in a transparent consultative process keeping statutory provisions as a last resort under the present circumstances.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-sc-on-vax-policy-no-judicial-interference-needed-trust-wisdom-of-executive-250756
