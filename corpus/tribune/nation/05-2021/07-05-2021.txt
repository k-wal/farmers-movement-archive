On Thursday, one lion tested positive for the virus, while another was considered as a suspected case. The remaining 12 lions have tested negative," IVRI Joint Director Dr KP Singh said.He said the sample of a lion was also received from the Delhi zoo and its report came out negative on Friday.He said the report of the samples of the lions is being sent to the government besides the safari park management.The chain of transmission of the virus could have taken place through any asymptomatic human carrier, probably caretakers, working at the park, Dr Singh said. He said the safari park authorities have been advised to shift the infected animals in isolation.The safari park has already been shut for public.The CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology had on Tuesday said eight Asiatic lions in the Hyderabad zoo have tested positive for COVID-19.It had said these animals must have got infected through zoo-keeping staff.The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change had said the infected animals were behaving normally. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lion-at-etawah-safari-park-tests-covid-positive-249560

Instructions have been given to hospitals with more than 50 beds capacity to manage their own oxygen needs, whether through liquid oxygen plants or by arranging a PSA. A letter has also been sent to them to this effect,” said a senior administration official.It may be noted that small hospitals, clinics and home isolated patients had been crying foul over higher oxygen allocation to ‘VIP’ hospitals leaving them high and dry and begging for same through social media.There is a plan to set up six oxygen plants in the district and more are being planned with collaboration of CSR initiatives.A PSA-based 1,000 MLP oxygen plant will be set up in the Civil Hospital in Gurgaon.In addition, PSA-based oxygen plants of 200 MLP capacity each will also be set up at the sub-divisional hospitals in Pataudi and Sohna.Not only this, in a bid to resolve the woes of the home isolated oxygen dependent patients, the local administration has decided to provide oxygen at doorstep to them through RWAs.“We have streamlined the process of oxygen allocation now. We will be providing cylinders to patients in need at their doorstep after getting verified details from RWA. We are in the process to develop a portal to make the process of procuring oxygen cylinders smoother for those in home isolation. There is panic hoarding and black-marketing which has led to the issues but now things will be resolved,” said Jitender Yadav, Acting MCG Commissioner and in-charge of oxygen supply.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hospitals-with-capacity-of-more-than-50-beds-told-to-arrange-their-own-oxygen-in-gurugram-249538

07-05-2021||New Delhi||COVID not just lung disease, can also cause dangerous blood clots: Experts||There is increasing evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is not just a disease of the lungs as initially thought but can also cause dangerous blood clots which need to be immediately retrieved to save limbs in some cases, say experts.Global studies have shown that the prevalence of blood clot formation known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is 14-28 per cent and is a lower 2-5 per cent for arterial thrombosis.The India experience is similar, said experts, stressing that the infection is about the blood vessels as much as about the lungs. “We are dealing with five-six such cases per week on average. This week it has been one a day of such complications,” said Dr Ambarish Satwik, vascular and endovascular surgeon at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.The prevalence of blood clot formation in COVID-19 is high in patients who have conditions such as type-2 Diabetes Mellitus, although the exact incidence remains unknown, added Dr Amrish Kumar, consultant, cardio-thoracic vascular department,  Aakash Healthcare in southwest Delhi's Dwarka locality.While DVT is a serious condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein located deep inside the body, arterial thrombosis is a clot that develops in an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body, while veins carry blood low in oxygen from the body back to the heart.Satwik drew attention to the Covid-clot connection in a tweet earlier this week in which he posted a picture of a blood clot cast retrieved from the lower limb arteries of a COVID-19 patient.“What COVID clots look like. Covid produces blood clots. The incidence of heart attack, stroke, or limb loss due to an arterial clot in Covid varies from 2 per cent-5 per cent. We pried these out of the lower limb arteries of a Covid patient. We were able to save the limb,” Satwik said on May 5. Explaining his tweet, which attracted a lot of attention and questions too, Satwik said the COVID-19 patient had an acute circulatory cut off  because of the clots, and the limb was threatened.“So we had to physically do a surgical procedure and extract these clots, otherwise there would have been gangrene, and he would have ended up with an amputation. We were successfully able to take the clots out and save the limb,” the surgeon explained. Authors of a Lancet paper published in November last year said studies suggested there is increased association between COVID-19 and the risk of thromboembolism (TE) or obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot.The authors of the paper concluded that TE rates of COVID-19 are high and associated with a higher risk of death.“We have been understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 for over a year now. When it first hit China and the global west, it was thought that it was typical viral pneumonia. Severe cases of acute COVID were being labelled as similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to respiratory failure,” Satwik noted.However, a series of autopsies on COVID patients and their lungs revealed that what the doctors were seeing was not typical ARDS.“...in addition to that, they were finding clots in the microcirculation of the lungs. So it was then kind of understood that COVID is as much a disease of blood vessels as much it's a disease of the lungs,” Satwik added.In a COVID-19 patient, when blood vessels are injured, they produce a protein that attracts platelets and other clotting factors that come together to form a clot, Kumar added. “Studies have shown that around 20 to 30 per cent of hospitalised COVID-19 patients have developed this complication,” he told PTI.Because blood vessels are everywhere on the body, these clots could form anywhere, Satwik said. Some of these clots occupy big blood vessels and become macroscopic blood clots.“But otherwise we are seeing diffused microscopic clots in microcirculation in various organs,” he noted.According to a University of Oxford study published in April, the risk of rare blood clotting following COVID-19 is around 100 times greater than normal.The research found that the rare blood clotting known as cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)—a blood clot of a cerebral vein in the brain—is more common after COVID-19 than in any of the comparison groups, with 30 per cent of these cases occurring in the under 30s.“The signals that COVID-19 is linked to CVT, as well as portal vein thrombosis a clotting disorder of the liver is clear, and one we should take note of,” said Oxford's Maxime Taquet, one of the authors of the study.Explaining how the virus causes blood clots in COVID-19 patients, Satwik said the virus is known to attach itself to the inner lining of the lung, and right next to these air sacs are very thin blood vessels or capillaries.“The virus invades these blood vessels and starts affecting the inner lining of these blood vessels which produces a dysfunction within the blood vessels which produces these clots,”  the surgeon said.As a result, he said, some clinicians were using blood thinners as part of the treatment and getting success.“What we have understood is these micro clots need immediate retrieval in order to save the limbs,” Satwik added.He also said it is very difficult to know the prevalence of clots in the entire population infected with COVID.Although it is difficult to determine the vulnerability of COVID-19, individuals with existing cardiovascular morbidities are the ones who will suffer thrombotic complications, Satwik said.According to Kumar, in COVID-19 patients, the clots seem to form in the tiny vessels of the lungs rather than the major vessels, adding that clots in the lungs usually happen in the case of typical strokes or heart attacks or deep vein thrombosis.“Risk of COVID-19 patients associated with blood clots are stroke (clot in the cerebral artery), clots in the lungs, heart attack, deep vein thrombosis, and thrombosis in both upper and lower limb arteries. Stroke can cause paralysis, but we have not seen any such so far in our hospital,” Kumar added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-not-just-lung-disease-can-also-cause-dangerous-blood-clots-experts-249520
07-05-2021||Singapore||Singapore cautions against scammers requesting COVID-19 aid to India||The Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Friday alerted the public that a new type of scam is being perpetrated where compromised WhatsApp accounts are being used to solicit donations for the purchase of oxygen concentrator machines to aid coronavirus-hit India.In such cases, the fraudsters communicate with the victims using compromised WhatsApp account numbers, posing as their friends, the SPF said.The fraudsters would claim to be raising funds to purchase oxygen concentrator machines for donation to India, which is currently facing one of the worst waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.Scammers would request for the victims to assist with the purchase or to donate to patients in India who are critically ill and are in need of life-saving oxygen.“The scammers would emphasise the urgency of the issue and provide the victims with a bank account number for fund transfer, claiming that the bank account belonged to a supplier,” said the police.“The victims would only realise that they have been scammed when the scammer became uncontactable or when they were informed by their friends that their WhatsApp account had been hacked,” the Channel News Asia reported, citing the police statement.In screenshots of a WhatsApp conversation provided by the SPF, a scammer tells a victim: “I am ordering 20 pieces for charity. To be sent to India.”  The scammer then claimed that their credit card was “maxed out” and there was “a remaining amount of SGD 3,750” to be paid to the supplier.“Could you help me wire it to the supplier? Will wire it back to you on Monday morning. As I have already committed to purchasing. Can’t back out now,” the scammer added.The victim then made the transfer as requested by the fraudster.But when the scammer was contacted twice on Monday and Tuesday, there was no answer.The police advised the public to beware of unusual requests received over WhatsApp, even if sent by their WhatsApp contacts.“Verify whether the request is legitimate by checking with your family and friends offline” and “never send money to people whom you do not know or have not met in person before”, said the SPF.Any unauthorised transaction made to their bank account should be reported immediately, it added.The report comes as there has been unprecedented outpouring of support to India during a raging second wave of the pandemic in the country. Foreign governments, charitable organisations, celebrities and the Indian diaspora have mobilised efforts to deliver ventilators, oxygen concentrators and medicines to India.India is recording over 4,00,000 coronavirus infections and over 3,000 deaths daily for the last one week.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India has a total of over 20.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 2,26,000 deaths.

07-05-2021||Mumbai||War rooms, field hospitals helped Mumbai in battle of second wave: Officials||A system of ward-level ‘war rooms’ where hospital beds are allocated by civic officials and the decision not to dismantle field hospitals were key to Mumbai’s success in tackling the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, officials believe.As much of the country is reeling under an unprecedented surge in cases, the “Mumbai model” has drawn appreciation even from the Supreme Court.Since May 1, Mumbai is reporting less than 4,000 cases every day, a significant fall from over 8,500 cases a day in the first week of April. On April 4, the city logged 11,163 cases, the highest so far. On May 6, it recorded 3,056 cases.To be sure, the financial capital of the country is still reporting more cases daily than the peak of 2,848 cases recorded on October 7 during the first wave last year.But there is no shortage of hospital beds and oxygen for patients, civic officials claimed.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court lauded the efforts of authorities to ensure adequate oxygen supply in Mumbai.“Bombay Municipal Corporation is doing some great work, with no disrespect to Delhi. What they are doing, how they are managing, we can learn from them.“I also understand that Maharashtra also produces oxygen which Delhi cannot do,” said a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud, hearing pleas on the dire situation in Delhi.As the second wave began, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation focused on testing, contact tracing and treatment besides ensuring that people followed guidelines.But the decision not to take down the infrastructure put in place during the first wave proved to be more crucial.“There would have been chaos if we hadn’t kept jumbo COVID centres (field hospitals), oxygen beds, ICU beds ready before the start of second wave,” said Mayor Kishori Pednekar.Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani, who insisted that jumbo centres should not be dismantled till March 31, said the BMC was ready for a new surge.“The whole system—oxygen, catering, housekeeping, doctors and nurses—was in place at jumbo centres,” he said.The civic body continued to augment availability of oxygen and ICU beds and medicine stocks, he said.“This is why the BMC had sufficient stock of Remdesivir when everywhere there was a shortage,” Kakani said.The number of beds was doubled from around 12,000 to 24,000 within a month when cases began to rise in February. At present, Mumbai has 31,695 COVID-19 beds, including 12,754 oxygen beds and 2,929 ICU ones.There is no shortage of medical oxygen in the city now, but there were some scary moments when on the night of April 16-17, the BMC had to shift 168 COVID-19 patients from six civic hospitals as oxygen supply ran out.Learning a lesson, it started monitoring the movement of oxygen cylinders from plants to hospitals in real time.“We have now deputed six officers at control rooms to ensure seamless supply of oxygen. There is also a monitoring committee headed by a deputy commissioner,” Kakani added.During the first wave, the BMC set up a ‘war room’ in each of the 24 wards to guide patients. Thanks to this system, people are not needed to run from one hospital to another in search of beds, as allocation of beds is done by war room officials.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said during a recent interview to the Indian Express that war rooms, dashboards for bed management, prohibition of release of test report directly to patients and the decision not to dismantle jumbo COVID facilities proved useful.The system is on “auto pilot” now, he said.“When I joined, we did not have a dashboard, our control room operators used to check with individual hospitals if a bed is available,” he said.After the April 17 incident when oxygen in six hospitals ran out, the BMC sought a protocol for oxygen consumption from the Maharashtra government’s COVID-19 task force.It was decided that oxygen saturation level need not be maintained beyond 94 per cent, high-flow nasal oxygen should not be used indiscriminately, and there should be an oxygen consumption audit, Chahal said. The protocol was conveyed to all 176 hospitals in the city.Mayor Pednekar said the BMC also focused on setting up oxygen plants. “We didn’t rely only on oxygen cylinders, but we set up liquid oxygen plants. Because of this, not a single person died due to lack of oxygen,” she said.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to enforce fresh lockdown also helped, she noted.The civic body has already started preparing for the possible third wave of the pandemic, she said.The number of jumbo COVID facilities will be increased from nine to 15, including dedicated facilities for children and the disabled, Pednekar said.

The accused has returned the cheated money to the victim after being nabbed by the police.The police have also seized one ambulance given by him to numerous patients over the last one month in the case."My mother is COVID-19 positive and was in very critical condition. We were not getting bed in Delhi-NCR, Gurugram and Faridabad. So we came to know about one hospital in Ludhiana where there was one empty bed. We contacted them and gave all the details about my mother's condition and they agreed to take her. So we looked for the ambulance but no one has the oxygen and I needed an ambulance with an oxygen supply," said Amandeep Kaur, the patient's daughter."In the end, I contacted the Cardiacare ambulance service and they agreed to go but they asked Rs 1.40 lakh. Later when I told them that I have my own oxygen cylinder then they said that they will take Rs 1.20 lakh," Kaur said.Also read: Ambulance charges Rs1.2 lakh for 350-km rideShe said that the ambulance driver took 20,000 initial amounts in cash from her and later her husband transferred 95 thousand to their bank account."Later, when I reached here one of my friend circulated the bill on social media and at the end reached to Human Rights department in Ludhiana and investigation started. I have also lodged a complaint in Delhi's Inder Puri police station," she added.A case has been registered under section 420 Indian Penal Code (IPC) in Inder Puri police station.Further investigation is in progress. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-arrests-owner-of-ambulance-service-company-for-charging-rs-1-2-lakh-from-patients-daughter-249513

07-05-2021||Patna||Bihar lockdown: Rush to postpone weddings, many shed grandeur||There is a rush to cancel or postpone weddings in Bihar, while many are still going ahead sans the 'band-baajaa-baaraat' as the state went into an 11-day lockdown amid the COVID crisis.There were a number of auspicious dates between May 5 and 15 -- the lockdown period, and owners of wedding halls said that most of the bookings have been cancelled.The state government has allowed only 50 people to take part in the weddings during the lockdown. Besides, DJs and procession with 'band-baajaa' (orchestra) have been prohibited.Further, the local police station has to be informed three days in advance for hosting a wedding, and the function can go ahead only after its clearance.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also appealed to the people to put off social functions such as weddings in the wake of the surge in COVID-19 cases.Kumud Sharma, the manager of the luxury Panache hotel in Patna, told PTI that almost 90 per of the advance bookings for weddings have been postponed."A few people, for whom shifting the date was unavoidable, are going ahead with a simple wedding. Only a handful of guests will be present and there would be no band- baajaa-baaraat," he said.Also, these weddings will be held only after getting permission from the Gandhi Maidan police station, he added.Similar is the situation in Maurya Hotel."Majority of the bookings during this period have been moved to future dates," a senior official of the hotel, which is part of the ITDC chain, said.Vijay Sinha, owner of the Masala Junction restaurant- cum-banquet hall in Patna, said that almost all the advance bookings at his property have been put on hold.Families that could not postpone the weddings expressed their dissatisfaction with cutting down on the pomp and show."We had planned a grand wedding of our nephew in Aurangabad on May 6. But, it turned out to be a 'fika samaroh' (tasteless function) for want of 'band-baajaa' and drastically cutting down the guest list," Ram Bihari Singh, a native of Chulhan Bigha village in Arwal district, said.Dharmendra Rai, who attended one such wedding in Maner on the outskirts of Patna, echoed similar views.The situation has left decorators and 'band parties' or orchestra groups staring at losses."We had four-five bookings per day during this period but all of them have been cancelled," said Mohd Tajuddin, the proprietor of the famous Patna Bachcha Band.Pradeep Kumar, the owner of Shiv Garden banquet hall in Darbhanga, said he had to cancel all the bookings on the request of the families.Reports from almost all the districts said thousands of weddings have either been cancelled or postponed.Not more than two cars are allowed in a wedding and that also after furnishing an affidavit in favour of obeying all the COVID protocols, said Suman Verma, whose daughter got married in Bhagalpur on Thursday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-lockdown-rush-to-postpone-weddings-many-shed-grandeur-249508

07-05-2021||Chennai||Over crowded shared autos a matter of concern for Chennai officials||Sharing autos in Chennai are a hit among the commuters as public transport buses are allowing passengers only at 50 per cent capacity. Besides, no standing passengers are allowed inside buses and so most of these vehicles do not stop at the designated stops.The sharing autos of the city are emerging as the replacement for buses and most of the commuters who are not able to take a bus are using the sharing auto services which amount to around 60,000 numbers in Chennai city.However, most of these shared autos are taking passengers above their allowed numbers creating crowding inside the vehicles which is a major health hazard given the spread of the virus transmission.Harinarayanan, a commuter who regularly takes shared autos from Anna Nagar to Nungambakkam, told IANS: "I am a regular commuter of shared autos, but now these autos are taking passengers beyond their allowed limits and in some cases they accommodate more than 6 passengers at a time and this is creating discomfort. The police are turning a blind eye to such a scenario and this is a major health hazard."The auto drivers however dismissed such allegations and Muruganandam , an auto driver who ferries passengers near Koyambedu market said, "We are aware of the situation and the grave danger the pandemic has inflicted on us as a society and hence we will not overlook the Covid standard protocol. Maybe one or two sharing autos would have taken a few extra passengers and please dont generalize this. We are taking people only on the basis of the numbers allowed by the authorities."However, there were several instances of police charging the auto drivers for having taken more commuters than allowed and fined them.Thangavelu.R, a traffic police sub-inspector attached to the Chennai traffic control room, said, "The police is on the alert, and we are charging those autos who are violating the government guidelines in carrying more passengers and creating a crowd in the autos. We have charged many auto drivers and this tendency has come down following the tough stand taken by the police. However, we have to plug all holes to clear this menace." With the buses continuing to reduce the intake of passengers, the shared autos will continue to operate and most of them will pay a small amount and settle the matter. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-crowded-shared-autos-a-matter-of-concern-for-chennai-officials-249485

07-05-2021||New Delhi||Cannot leave citizens of Karnataka in lurch, says SC, refuses to interfere with HC order on oxygen||The Supreme Court Friday said it will not leave Karnataka citizens in lurch as it refused to interfere with the Karnataka High Court order asking the Centre to increase the daily oxygen allocation for the state from 965 MT to 1200 MT for treating COVID-19 patients.A bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said the high court order of May 5 is a well calibrated, deliberated and judicious exercise of power”.It refused to accept the Centre's contention that if every high court starts passing orders for allocating oxygen, it would make the supply network of the country “unworkable”.The bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre, that it has read the sequence of events and it can say that it is “well calibrated, deliberated and judicious exercise of power after taking into account the number of COVID-19 positive cases. We will not interfere with it”.It said the order does not preclude the Centre from considering the representation of the state government and work out a mutual resolution mechanism of supplying 1200 MT of liquid medical oxygen (LMO).Mehta said every state needs oxygen but his concern is that if all the high courts start directing LMO allocation of the said amount then it will be a big problem.The bench said it was looking at the wider issue and “we will not keep citizens of Karnataka in lurch”.It said the high court had not passed the order without considering the facts and circumstances and it is based on the projection of COVID-19 cases made by the state government itself of minimum 1165 MT of LMO.“The High Court has furnished adequate reasons for passing the ad-interim order having regard to the fact that projection of demand made by the state was a minimum of 1165 MT of LMO. The direction of the High Court is only ad-interim and it does not preclude a mutual resolution mechanism between the Centre and the state,” it said.It added that the High Court has considered the death of people in Chamarajanagar and Kalburgi among other places due to shortage of oxygen and added, “Judges are also human beings and they are also seeing the suffering faced by the people. The High Courts will not simply shut their eyes”.The Centre in its appeal filed on Thursday had said that the High Court has passed the order based on purported shortage of oxygen in the city of Bangalore and it will have a cascading effect and result in total collapse of the system of the supply network of LMO.The high court had noted that the required quantity of LMO was not allotted to the state and directed the Centre to increase the allocation to 1200 MT of oxygen.It had said that the Centre has not offered any explanation as to why buffer stock of LMO was not created despite the directions of the top court.

07-05-2021||---||Sonia demands all-party meet to discuss Covid situation||New Delhi, May 7Attacking the BJP-led government for mismanagement of the pandemic response, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday demanded an all-party meeting to discuss the Covid situation and immediate convening of standing committee meetings to ensure collective response and accountability.Addressing party MPs virtually, she said the Congress firmly believed that fighting Covid was not a “Government versus Us” battle but a “Us versus Corona” battle. “This battle transcends political differences. We have to fight this battle together as a nation. In that spirit, as a first step, I believe that the Modi government must urgently call an all-party meeting on the Covid-19 situation.  The Congress, also, demands that standing committees must be convened to ensure collective action and accountability to combat the pandemic better,” she said.Urging “the resourceful Congress persons to come forward and help people”, Gandhi said the Congress Covid control room was functional and asked leaders to pitch in with aid across states.Lamenting the loss of lives during pandemic, Gandhi said the government instead of alleviating people’s suffering and pain, had abdicated its fundamental responsibilities and duties.Noting that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and opposition parties had raised serious concerns regarding preparedness, Gandhi said “earlier this year the Prime Minister arrogantly boasted that he had defeated the pandemic and his party obediently felicitated him for his so-called success.”Accusing the government of ignoring expert advice, Sonia said supply chains for oxygen, medicine, and ventilators were not strengthened neither sufficient orders for vaccines placed in time to meet the needs of our people.She attacked the government for allocating thousands of crores for non-essential projects (read Central Vista) and said questioned some BJP governments for arresting  people merely for crying out for help.The Congress chief said though the Parliament had allocated Rs 35,000 crores in the union budget to ensure free vaccines for all, the government had placed the burden on already stretched state governments.“It has allowed differential pricing for vaccines. It has refused to enforce compulsory licensing to increase the vaccines production. The government’s inequitable vaccination policy will exclude millions of Dalits, Adivasis, Other Backwards Classes, as well as the poor and the marginalised.  It is utterly shocking to see the Modi government abdicate its moral obligation and its sworn duty towards the people,” she said adding “Let us be absolutely clear -- the system hasn’t failed, the Modi government has been unable to constructively channelise India’s many strengths and resources.”Gandhi said India is crippled by a political leadership today that has no empathy for the people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-demands-all-party-meet-to-discuss-covid-situation-249470

Stalin and the Left for their handsome victories. Most unfortunately, our own performance in all the states was very disappointing and if I may say, unexpectedly so,” she said.The Congress chief added that the CWC is meeting shortly to review the results “but it goes without saying that we as a party collective must draw the appropriate lessons from this setback in a spirit of humility and honesty.”The Congress recently drew a blank in Bengal, in its worst performance having fought alongside the Left against TMC; failed to wrest Kerala and Assam from incumbents LDF and BJP and lost Puducherry to NDA.In Kerala, a weak UDF led by Congress allowed CM Pinarayi Vijayan to script history by not just repeating a government for the first time in four decades but also winning the maximum ever seats for the Left since the formation of the Kerala assembly.In Assam, BJP led by Sarbanand Sonowal became the first non-Congress government to return to power.Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were party’s principal campaigners in the recent poll cycle.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-lost-unexpectedly-sonia-on-cong-debacle-in-states-congratulates-mamata-249463

Hundreds of thousands of new COVID cases are confirmed every day, there are no hospital beds open or oxygen supply left, and people are tragically dying before they can even get to a doctor,” Jayapal, the first and only Indian-American in the US House of Representatives, said.“India needs our help — and it is our moral responsibility to rise to the challenge at the local, Federal, and international level because to defeat a global pandemic, we need a global response,” said Jayapal, who was recently in India to meet her parents who were hospitalised due to COVID-19 infections.Chairwoman of the powerful Progressive Caucus in the House of Representatives, Jayapal on Thursday also had a virtual meeting with Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.After holding an Indian-American community roundtable with advocates, local leaders, and residents about worsening health conditions in India, Jayapal said that she has repeatedly called on the Biden administration to approve India's request for raw vaccine materials, release some of America's stockpile of unused COVID vaccines to India, and support a resolution at the WTO to waive patent protections so that they can finally put people's lives over pharmaceutical profits.“The Biden administration's willingness to quickly heed my call on each of these life-saving requests comes at a moment when wealthy countries have administered more than 80 per cent of global vaccines while low-income countries have received just 0.3 per cent,” she said.“To redress this injustice, the Congressional Progressive Caucus is focused on partnering with Ambassadors, multilateral organisations, and the Biden Administration to achieve our shared goal of an equitable global vaccination programme that quickly gets more vaccines to countries in need around the world,” Jayapal said.“As we work to accomplish this globally, I am proud of the critical efforts that Indian-American advocates, activists, and allies are doing locally. Groups like the India Association of Western Washington (IAWW) are bringing people throughout our region together to aid families in India,” she said.Jayapal also condemned anti-Asian hate in the US as a spike in COVID cases abroad leads to an upsetting spike in anti-Asian discrimination and violence at home.“As the first Indian-American woman ever elected to the House of Representatives, I will do everything in my power to ensure that we end anti-Asian hate. We each have a role to play — and I am committed to playing mine as we stand together against violence, discrimination, and white supremacy,” Jayapal said.

07-05-2021||Washington||COVID-19: Six US planes carrying medical supplies reached India in past few days||The US has so far sent six planes carrying emergency supplies to India, which is battling one of its worst public health crises.The emergency supplies include 20,000 courses of remdesivir (125,000 vials) to help treat critically ill patients, nearly 1,500 oxygen cylinders, which can be repeatedly refilled at local supply centres, and one million rapid diagnostic tests to quickly identify COVID-19 cases.The six planes, which have landed in just six days, also carried nearly 550 mobile oxygen concentrators that obtain oxygen from ambient air. These units have a lifespan of more than five years and can serve multiple patients at once, depending on their oxygen needs.The US has also sent nearly 2.5 million N95 masks to protect healthcare professionals and other frontline workers.The American people continue to deliver life-saving assistance to India, with the 6th flight of emergency relief in 6 days! This shipment includes a climate-friendly oxygen generation unit which can turn air into oxygen. Thanks to the people of California! #USIndiaDosti pic.twitter.com/b6conyzovH  According to the USAID, a large-scale deployable Oxygen Concentration System that can provide oxygen to treat 20 or more patients at a time and 210 pulse oximeters to measure oxygen levels in a patient's blood to determine whether a higher level of care is needed has also been sent to India. The US government assistance to combat the current crisis is about USD100 million. The United States is continuing to work closely with Indian officials and health experts to identify and respond to emerging trends in this ongoing crisis, the USAID said.The six shipments were made possible by a USAID-led whole-of-government effort, which included the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Health and Human Services, Travis Air Force Base, in partnership with the state of California, National Airlines, and United Airlines, it added.Last week, the USAID immediately allocated funding to purchase locally an additional 1,000 mobile oxygen concentrators.These life-saving units will be used in hundreds of primary health care facilities to address India's critical oxygen shortage.The USAID said it is also supporting the Government of India's efforts to stand up 150 Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen generating plants, allowing 150 healthcare facilities to generate their own oxygen for years to come."The official US response over the last few days to India's horrific COVID crisis underscores the depth and breadth of Washington's unwavering commitment to India. Both the Biden administration and the US Congress have spared no effort toward this end in a testament to the strength and character of the bilateral relationship,” Ronak D. Desai, an expert on US-India relations at Harvard University and an international investigations attorney at Paul Hastings LLP, told PTI.Observing that Congressional efforts to assist India in its darkest hour have proven pervasive, bipartisan and bicameral, Desai said the speed at which members in both the House and Senate have mobilised to reduce India's suffering serves as a potent reminder of the enduring goodwill India continues to enjoy in the corridors of the US Congress."Profound credit is due to Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi, Ro Khanna, Pramilia Jayapal, and Dr Ami Bera for their steadfast leadership in helping mobilize the Congressional response to India's COVID crisis and bringing national and international attention to the grave situation in India, why it matters, and why all American should care,” he said.Less than five years ago, such community representation in Congress would have been hard to predict. Less than five years later, it is clear why such representation is so crucially important, he said in response to a question.Noting that the scope and substance of Washington's assistance to India over the past several days demonstrates the sincerity and reliability of the US, Desai said the Biden administration and its Congressional partners have proven that they treat their partnership and engagement with India in a non-transactional manner.

07-05-2021||Washington||US govt, businesses and people of America working together to provide COVID relief to India: Sullivan||The US government, corporates and the people of America are working together to provide COVID-19 relief to India, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has said.Sullivan made the remarks after joining the first meeting of the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response."Our people, our businesses, and our entire government are working together to provide COVID-19 relief for the people of India — and we will continue our efforts to help around the world," he said on Thursday.More than 45 top American companies and its CEOs have joined the task force created by the US Chambers of Commerce and Business Roundtable in association with US-India Business Council and US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum.Working in close coordination with the Indian government, the task force has so far announced to send 25,000 oxygen concentrators and 1,000 ventilators.US companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Deloitte, Walmart, Boeing and Mastercard among others announced major assistance to India.So far, the USAID has sent six planes carrying health supplies to India.The Biden administration has promised USD100 million aid to India. This number is expected to go up in coming weeks, as President Joe Biden reviews it.In addition, there has been overwhelming support from the Indian-Americans.Sewa International USA, a non-profit body, has so far raised more than USD 10 million."The administration can count on the US Chamber, Business Roundtable, and this coalition of companies to help address COVID-19 surges around the world," Suzanne Clark, president and CEO of US Chambers of Commerce, said after the meeting of the task force."This is a global crisis. If the virus is in one environment, and then mutates, it will impact everybody. No one is safe unless all of us are safe. So, we have to step up. This is the right thing to do. It is also the right thing to do for each of us as business leaders," Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen told PTI.The speed with which the COVID crisis in India has escalated and ravaged the entire country, has created a sense of urgency in the corporate community, Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council told PTI a day earlier."We have not seen in any prior instance this kind of an effort to create a unified coordinated structure," she said.

07-05-2021||Washington||Pichai among 2 other Indian-Americans on Covid Global Task Force penal||Three Indian-American CEOs Sunder Pichai from Google, Punit Renjen from Deloitte and Shantanu Narayen from Adobe have joined the steering committee of the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, which is overseeing an unprecedented corporate sector initiative to help India successfully fight COVID19.The names of the three Indian-American CEOs were added to the list of the steering committee on Thursday.The three CEOs have been active in organising US companies' response to the COVID-19 crisis in India.Others who were added to the list on Thursday are Mark Suzman, CEO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Joshua Bolten, president and CEO, Business Roundtable and Suzanne Clark, president and CEO, US Chamber of Commerce.The task force is a newly formed public-private partnership organised by the US Chamber of Commerce and supported by Business Roundtable. It is working with the Chamber's US-India Business Council and the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum to take immediate actions to help address the COVID-19 surge in India.The US corporate sector so far has committed more than 25,000 oxygen concentrators for India. The first 1,000 oxygen concentrators, provided by Deloitte, arrived in India on April 25, with critical logistical support from FedEx.These concentrators will be shipped to designated healthcare facilities for immediate use, the task force said.The first shipment of ventilators landed in India early this week. All 1,000 ventilators are expected to reach India by June 3.Medtronic will provide end-to-end support for the initiative.As many as 16 businesses have joined the task force's ventilator initiative.Together these businesses will provide over US$ 30 million in support for India's healthcare response – joining the dozens of businesses which have pledged their support in efforts to provide oxygen concentrators, develop information and best practices to support employees in India and more, the task force said.According to the task force, while the country has been reporting over 4,00,000 cases daily, the actual case rate in India is estimated to be much higher.Experts forecast the crisis will only worsen, with India's peak not expected until mid-May, it said.Other members of the steering committee include Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture; Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, Brian Moynihan, Chairman of the Board and CEO, Bank of America; Raj Subramaniam, president FedEx; and Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM.Gail McGovern, president and CEO, American Red Cross; Mike Parra, CEO Americas, DHL Express; Jim Fitterling, Chairman and CEO, Dow; Alex Gorsky, chairman of the Board and CEO, Johnson & Johnson; Michael Miebach, CEO, Mastercard; Geoff Martha, chairman and CEO, Medtronic; Brad Smith, president, Microsoft; Ramon Laguarta, Chairman of the Board and CEO, PepsiCo; Carol Tomé, CEO, UPS; Sanjay Poonen, COO, VMware; and Judith McKenna, President and CEO, Walmart International are also members of the task force.Till date, over 45 US businesses and associations have contributed to the Global Task Force's activities.While the task force is focusing initial efforts on the pressing need in India, additional working groups will be formed to address COVID-19 surges in other countries.Through its steering committee, the task force will work to concentrate efforts where corporate support will be most beneficial, it said.

07-05-2021||Washington||Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen says countries need to step up efforts to assist India in its battle against second wave of COVID||As India faces one of its worst public health crises, a top Indian-American CEO has said it is time for other countries to step up their efforts and help the country deal with the COVID-19 situation.Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen said the company is encouraging its 3,00,000 professionals across the globe to support three charities -- GiveIndia, United Way India and the PM cares Fund."This is India's hour of need. India helped us out when we were going through it in the Western world. And it is up to us to step up, not only for the people that call India home, but for all of us,” Renjen told PTI."This is a global crisis. If the virus is in one environment, and then mutates, it will impact everybody. No one is safe unless all of us are safe. So, we have to step up. This is the right thing to do. It is also the right thing to do for each of us as business leaders,” he said.Renjen's mother who lives in Rohtak in Haryana has tested positive for COVID-19."We are focused on two things. One taking care of our people. 15 per cent of Deloitte is in India. So, taking care of our people is very important, and then giving back to India,” he said.Responding to a question, he said Deloitte's strategy is to protect its people and support those impacted.Protecting its people ranges from providing wellness support and vaccines to getting them tested, Renjen said, adding that “six per cent of Deloitte is impacted by COVID-19”.Deloitte has created a network of support for its workforce and their families in India, including covering the costs of vaccination and testing, instituting a 24/7 helpline for medical and wellness support, and offering flexible work schedules and mental health services, he said."In terms of giving back to India, I think we really need to do three things. One, we need to address the current situation. That is really around oxygen and supplies. Second, we need to prepare for the next wave because like we saw in the United States, like we've seen elsewhere in the world, there will be multiple waves, that is the way COVID happens,” he said."And then the third thing that we need to do is to address the mid-to-long term,” he said.The CEO said it's time for companies to invest in the healthcare infrastructure."For many, many decades, we have under invested, and I think it's time for us to invest. That's the way to approach it,” he added.Deloitte as part of the global business task force is focused on getting immediate aid to India. The first set of 1,000 oxygen concentrators was delivered to India recently."We have now commitments from a number of corporates, for 25,000, oxygen concentrators,” he said, adding that all consignments are consigned to the Red Cross in partnership with the Ministry of Health and they are allocating it in a transparent way."We are also focused on cryogenic containers for oxygen,” he said.Renjen said Deloitte is working with other companies to get essential medical supplies to India.  “What we also need to do is, we have to stop the crunch at hospitals. We are close to announcing an innovative approach to expand the medical ward,” he said."As the head of AIIMS said a large portion of the population will have COVID and can be taken care of at home with appropriate medical supervision, like my mother,” Renjen said.Other multinationals, he observed, are stepping up efforts and are doing the same things that Deloitte is doing.Deloitte, he said, is directly supporting the US India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) in its work with the Government of India. It is providing pro-bono services to help USISPF manage the tasks to orchestrate this endeavour.Responding to a question, Renjen said he is extremely impressed with the Biden administration's efforts to help India."The one thing that the Biden administration needs to recognise is that this will take time. I think we have to stay with India and with the rest of the countries which are going through this, and provide them assistance," he said.

07-05-2021||Washington||Top American civil rights leader urges Biden to release 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine for India||A top American civil rights leader has urged President Joe Biden to release 60 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses for India, which is battling a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.The AstraZeneca vaccine has not been approved by the US and is unlikely to be used by the Biden administration.Biden had recently said that he intended to give AstraZeneca vaccines to other countries.At a news conference in Chicago, American civil rights activist Rev Jesse Jackson said he would speak to Biden to immediately release 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines to India.Mass level vaccination is said to be the only cure to the current public health crisis in India, he said."They are human beings. As the wind blows, if we don't stop it today, it'll spread around the world,” he said.Expressing concern over the current situation in India, Rev Jackson said he will personally speak to the healthcare industry to donate oxygen concentrators and cylinders to India and follow up with the pharmaceutical giants to ensure therapeutic supplies to the country.Other Indian Americans from the Chicago area echoed similar sentiments."It is everyone's duty to help India flatten this COVID-19 surge as we live in a world that cannot be separated by borders," said Dr Vijay Prabhakar, the chairman of American Association of Multiethnic Physicians."Based on the current projections some of the models are suggesting, there may be 1 million deaths by the end of August. As we know, that would be a tragic humanitarian crisis,” said Dr Srinivas Reddy, the trustee of Chicago Medical Society.

Oral arguments are postulated on an open exchange of ideas. It is through such an exchange that legal arguments are tested and analysed,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.The Bench said, “It would be retrograde to promote the rule of law and access to justice on the one hand and shield the daily operations of HCs and this court from the media in all its forms by gagging the reporting of proceedings, on the other.“An open court proceeding ensures that the judicial process is subject to public scrutiny. Public scrutiny is crucial to maintaining transparency and accountability.”The EC had challenged Madras HC’s observation that the panel was responsible for the surge in Covid cases and murder charges must be slapped on its officers. The Bench junked EC’s plea, saying oral observations were not part of “official judicial record” and there was no question of expunging these. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-junks-election-commission-plea-wont-expunge-madras-hc-remarks-249284

Each plant has the capacity to generate oxygen with 93% (plus, minus 3%) concentration which can be directly supplied to hospital beds or used to fill medical oxygen cylinders.The DRDO plants use the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technique and molecular sieve (zeolite) technology to generate oxygen directly from atmospheric air. At present, Haryana’s oxygen quota is 257 MT. With the caseload rising, the state has already requested the Centre to enhance this quota to 300 MT to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply across the state.For Punjab, the daily oxygen allocation stands at 195 MT of which 90 MT comes from Bokaro in eastern India. The remaining 105 MT comes from LMO facilities in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. However, Punjab is not getting its daily allocated quota owing to shortage of containers. In addition, there are 15 air separation units (ASUs) with a generation capacity of around 60-65 tonnes per day.Amid the oxygen crisis, Punjab has announced “thrust sector” status for all oxygen units. It has appointed a nodal officer to coordinate with the Customs Department for quick clearance of foreign aid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nhai-to-raise-infrastructure-for-63-oxygen-plants-in-punjab-haryana-249248

They need not wait for the formalities and incur costs on patents and other IP-related rights to Covid-19 drugs, vaccines and other treatments.4.12 lakh fresh cases2,30,168However, this will not happen soon. Negotiations will take time because of the complexity of the issues involved and also because the decision at the WTO has to be unanimously adopted.Issue compulsory licences for jabs, drugs: CongCongress leader Jairam Ramesh has asked the Centre to urgently invoke compulsory licensing provisions to make Covid jabs easily available.Welcoming the US government’s announcement, India hoped the waiver would be approved quickly at the WTO. The MEA said the waiver was an important step for enabling rapid scaling up of manufacture and timely availability of affordable Covid vaccines and essential medical products. The US and the EU were outliers to the proposal, which has the support of 120 countries.Washington’s changed stance was announced by US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai in a statement.“The (US) administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible. As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the administration will continue to ramp up its efforts—working with the private sector and all possible partners—to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution. It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines,” she said while “announcing the Biden-Harris administration’s support for waiving intellectual property protections for Covid vaccines”.India and South Africa, later joined by other countries, including Pakistan, have been arguing before the WTO that IP rights could hinder the supply of vaccines and drugs at affordable prices. At a time when production needs to be scaled up, there should be “a waiver from the implementation, application and enforcement of patents, copyright and trademarks” in Covid-related areas.Tai said the US will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the WTO “to make that happen”. The WTO will have to decide whether the waiver under Articles IX.3 and IX.4 should be granted to an individual country or collectively. The WTO has provided waivers under both modes in the past.Sydney faces curbs after India-linked Mystery caseAustralian officials reinstated social distancing measures across Sydney as they scrambled to find missing transmission links in a Covid case linked to an Indian variant.SL bans India travellersSri Lanka on Thursday banned arrivals from India due to the record rise in Covid-19 cases in the neighbouring country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-backs-indias-proposal-for-patent-waiver-on-vax-but-eu-still-reluctant-249227

Amid the surge in demand for oxygen cylinders across the national capital, the Delhi Government said on Thursday that it has set up a new system to ensure the smooth availability of cylinders.In a notification issued by the health department of the Delhi government on Thursday, district authorities have been directed to look after the issue of oxygen supply to the people in home isolation.As per the Delhi Government's notification, those needing oxygen for themselves or looking out for their relatives must register on the portal - https://delhi.gov.in. One would have to submit these required documents to book oxygen cylinders online - copies of their Aadhaar, Covid test report, and CT-Scan report if any."Each district has been assigned a re-filler for accessing its lump-sum allocation and the respective district magistrates have been directed to supervise the management of distribution of cylinders," notification said.The government's move has come after witnessing residents struggling in long queues at various refill centres and depots across the city.All district magistrates have been told to set aside enough officials to sort out the applications and ensure that those eligible receive their e-pass on priority.Those whose applications are approved will receive the e-pass from the district magistrate stating when, where, at what time, and at which depot they would get the oxygen cylinders, the release said. This will, however, depend on the availability of stocks.The district magistrates have also been asked to appoint only such depots and dealers where availability is hassle-free so that the patients or their relatives are not put into any further trouble for the sake of oxygen.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-patients-in-home-isolation-can-book-oxygen-online-delhi-govt-248958

07-05-2021||New Delhi||Country needs to be prepared for third surge of COVID-19, prepare buffer stock of Oxygen: SC||The Supreme Court Thursday said the country needs to be prepared for the third wave of COVID-19 which experts say could be more harmful, especially for children, and emphasised upon the need to create buffer stock of oxygen.It asked the Centre not to reduce oxygen supply to Delhi from 700MT till further orders and ensure that rationalisation exercise is completed while taking into account the pan-India perspective.The top court said that people in Delhi are dying despite efforts being made to treat COVID-19 patients and there is also no denying that many have lost their lives due to shortage of oxygen supply.It made clear to the Centre and Delhi government that it will not allow the top court of the country to be a ground of recrimination between the two as both indulged in a blame game on the issue of allocation and supply of oxygen.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said: “We need to prepare for the third surge of COVID-19 which may have altogether different parameters. We have to be ready for that. We have been reading that some experts have said that the third surge will be more harmful especially to children.“We understand children are more resilient as compared to elders but we have to also consider that they themselves will not go to hospitals and their parents will have to take them making them vulnerable”.The bench warned both Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre, and senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, that the Supreme Court being the top Constitutional court of the country cannot be allowed to be a ground of recrimination.“We are making it clear that this is not an adversarial litigation. We are not going to allow this court to become a ground of recrimination between two governments. We won’t allow any recrimination to be made against Delhi government or the Central government. All we want is that everyone should work in a cooperative manner,” the bench told Mehta and Mehra.Mehra further said despite the top court’s direction, Centre has failed to allocate requisite Oxygen to the state even on Thursday as per their estimate, a day after it had given 730MT.He said that the Centre has tried to put the Delhi government in dock in every affidavit they have filed before the courts claimed that other States like Madhya Pradesh and Punjab were given more Oxygen than their demands.At the outset, Mehta told the bench that the Centre has complied with top court’s order and instead of 700 MT oxygen ordered, it had ensured a supply of 730 MT to Delhi on Wednesday for treating COVID-19 patients.He said that a survey was conducted in 56 major hospitals of the national capital on May 4 and it revealed that they had significant stock of liquid medical oxygen (LMO).Mehta said that unloading of Oxygen tankers brought to Delhi is taking too long as the vehicles need to be sent back for refilling to the eastern corridors.He said if Centre keeps on giving 700MT of oxygen to Delhi, it will deprive other states of equitable distribution as the demand of 700MT is not correct.The bench said people and hospitals are making SOS calls including on social media that they have very limited oxygen left or they are running out of it, which is creating panic.“People and even some big hospitals of the national capital are making SOS calls about a shortage of oxygen supply. Why are you not creating a buffer stock? If as you claim, Delhi is not using or needs 700MT and only 490MT is needed, then this excess 200MT can be used to create a buffer stock,” the bench told Mehta.There can be a centralised pool of buffer stock, like if any hospital runs out of the oxygen, then it can immediately contact to replenish its supply which can save lives and avoid creating panic, it said.Mehta said there was no dearth of medical grade oxygen in the country but without blaming anybody, there are some lacunae with Delhi government efforts in distributing the gas internally. He suggested that an audit of oxygen supply and demand be conducted across the country, which would clear the actual picture of which state needs how much gas and how much is allocated to it.The bench said, “Your (Centre) formula of oxygen allocation seriously needs to be revamped. Although the court does not mean disrespect to the experts who devised that formula but it needs to be revamped. There are many COVID positive people who are in their houses but also need oxygen”.It said creating of buffer stocks like was done in Mumbai, where several centralised points were made and it was publicised properly that if any hospital needed oxygen they could contact them, will assuage the people to a great extent and save lives.“No one can deny that people have not died due to shortage of oxygen. We accept that not all lives are lost due to want of oxygen but still many have lost their lives. It’s a fact,” the bench observed.The top court said the Centre will also have to consider the situation not only in small cities and metropolitan cities but also in rural areas where people are suffering for want of oxygen.“Have you, being a central government, devised a mechanism to check how oxygen is being distributed. Have you checked whether it is not black marketed or have it reached the required hospital? Have you fixed any accountability”, the bench asked Mehta.The Solicitor General said that health is a state subject and it is they who decide how to distribute oxygen and how much to distribute.

07-05-2021||New Delhi||Media has the right to cover court proceedings, SC tells Election Commission||The Supreme Court Thursday said Madras High Court’s oral observations holding the EC responsible for surge in COVID cases are not part of “official judicial record” leaving no question of expunging them and also trashed the plea that media be restrained from reporting such remarks, saying freedom of speech “extends to reporting proceedings of judicial institutions as well”.The top court, referring to Constitutional importance of high courts and the Election Commission (EC), said it has attempted to strike a balance and emphasised that there was a “need for judges to exercise caution in off-the-cuff remarks in open court, which may be susceptible to misinterpretation”.Rejecting the plea of the poll panel, a bench comprising justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said the oral remarks are not a part of official judicial record, and therefore, the question of expunging them does not arise.The 31-page judgement said: “It is trite to say that a formal opinion of a judicial institution is reflected through its judgments and orders, and not its oral observations during the hearing. Hence...we find no substance in the prayer of the EC for restraining the media from reporting on court proceedings.“This Court stands as a staunch proponent of the freedom of the media to report court proceedings. This we believe is integral to the freedom of speech and expression of those who speak, of those who wish to hear and to be heard and above all, in holding the judiciary accountable to the values which justify its existence as a constitutional institution”.Justice Chandrachud, writing judgement for the bench, said the duty to preserve independence of the judiciary and to allow freedom of expression of judges in court is one end of the spectrum.“The other end of the spectrum, which is equally important, is that the power of judges must not be unbridled and judicial restraint must be exercised, before using strong and scathing language to criticize any individual or institution,” it said.Referring to the independence of judiciary from the executive and the legislature, the bench said it is the “cornerstone” of the republic and such independence translates to being impartial, free from bias and uninfluenced by the actions of those in power, but also recognises the freedom to judges to conduct court proceedings within the contours of the well-established principles of natural justice.“Judges in the performance of their duty must remain faithful to the oath of the office they hold, which requires them to bear allegiance to the Constitution. An independent judiciary must also be one which is accountable to the public in its actions (and omissions),” it said.The verdict praised the poll panel for its “track record” of being an independent constitutional body which shoulders a significant burden in ensuring the sanctity of electoral democracy.“Language, both on the Bench and in judgments, must comport with judicial propriety. Language is an important instrument of a judicial process which is sensitive to constitutional values. Judicial language is a window to a conscience sensitive to constitutional ethos. Bereft of its understated balance, language risks losing its symbolism as a protector of human dignity. The power of judicial review is entrusted to the High Courts under the Constitution...,” it said.The verdict said the top court has been tasked with balancing of rights of two independent constitutional authorities, Madras High Court and the poll panel.Praising high courts, it said they are constantly in touch with ground realities in their jurisdictions and during the pandemic, “the High Courts across the country have shown commendable foresight in managing the public health crisis which threatens to submerge humanity”.“Their anguish when they come face to face with reality must be understood in that sense. On the other hand is the EC, a constitutional authority tasked with the critical task of undertaking superintendence and control of elections under Article 324 of the Constitution. The EC has facilitated the operation of our constitutional democracy by conducting free and fair elections and regulating conduct around them for over seven decades. Its independence and integrity are essential for democracy to thrive,” it said.The verdict came on an appeal by the poll panel against the Madras High Court’s observation.The high court had on April 26 castigated the EC for the surge in COVID-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic, holding it “singularly” responsible for the spread of the viral disease, called it the “the most irresponsible institution” and even said its officials may be booked under murder charges.

07-05-2021||New Delhi||US relents, announces support for COVID-19 vaccine patent waiver as proposed by India, South Africa||The United States has relented to the six-month-old joint proposal of India and South Africa at the WTO asking for a temporary waiver of intellectual property (IP) rights on Covid vaccines and drugs.If the European Union, the other major party blocking the waiver at WTO, also agrees to a temporary waiver, many countries can quickly produce vaccines and life-saving medicines. They need not wait for the formalities and incur costs on patents and other IP-related rights to Covid-19 drugs, vaccines, and other treatments.However, this will not happen soon. Negotiations will take time because of the complexity of the issues involved and also because the decision at WTO has to be unanimously adopted.Washington’s changed stance was announced by US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai in a statement.“The [US] Administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible.  As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts – working with the private sector and all possible partners – to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution.  It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines,” she said while ``announcing the Biden-Harris Administration’s support for waiving intellectual property protections for Covid vaccines’’.“This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures.  The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines,’’ she added.India and South Africa, later joined by other countries including Pakistan, have been arguing before the WTO that IP rights could hinder the supply of vaccines and drugs at affordable prices. At a time when production needs to be scaled up, there should be “a waiver from the implementation, application, and enforcement of patents, copyright and trademarks’’ in Covid related areas.Tai said the US will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the WTO “to make that happen”. The WTO will have to decide whether the waiver under Articles IX.3 and IX.4 should be granted to an individual country or collectively. WTO has provided waivers under both modes in the past.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-relents-announces-support-for-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-as-proposed-by-india-south-africa-248909
