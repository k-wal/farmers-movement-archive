20-05-2021||Kolkata||Low-pressure area on Bay of Bengal likely to develop into cyclone: Met dept||A low-pressure area, set to form over east-central Bay of Bengal on May 22, is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm and strike the Odisha-West Bengal coast on May 26, the Met department said on Thursday, sparking fears of another Amphan-like catastrophe.Regional Met director G K Das said several places in Bengal are likely to experience light to moderate rainfall from May 25, and isolated areas may encounter heavy showers.The intensity of rainfall may gradually increase, especially in the Gangetic belts.The Met department has also warned of rough to very rough sea conditions.Fishermen in West Bengal have been advised against venturing into the sea for a few days from May 23. Those who are out with trawlers have been requested to return to the shore in the next two days.The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) said it is closely monitoring the developments on the Bay of Bengal, and has initiated preventive measures."Coast Guard Dornier aircraft and ships are intimating the fishermen operating close to the shore and those at sea about the formation of cyclonic storm over Odisha-West Bengal coast, and directing them to return back to the harbour safely," an ICG official said.He said that radar stations at the ICG in West Bengal and Odisha have also started transmitting weather warnings at regular intervals, both in English and in vernacular language.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday held a high-level meeting with officials of the disaster management authority, district magistrates and police superintendents to review the preparations in place in the event of a cyclone.She has asked them to make necessary arrangements, while strictly following the COVID protocols.The Amphan super cyclone, which struck Bengal in the third week of May last year, had claimed at least 98 lives and caused widespread destruction of property and infrastructure in the state's southern districts, including Kolkata, causing immense hardship to millions of people.The prevailing low-pressure area, if it develops into a cyclone, will be christened 'Yaas', a name given by Oman, in accordance with a standard procedure.The Indian Metrological Department (IMD), being a Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre (RSMC) -- one of the six in the world -- provide tropical cyclone and storm surge advisories to 13 countries, including Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.The RSMC, New Delhi has released a list of names for tropical cyclones  after taking into consideration suggestions made by these 13 member countries - all members of WMO/ESCAP (World Meteorological Organisation/United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific).

20-05-2021||New Delhi||'Captain of barge P-305 chose not to move vessel away from cyclone path'||Faced with high-speed wind and swelling sea, the ill-fated barge Pappa-305, with 261 crew onboard, lost anchors and smashed into an unmanned platform before sinking in the Arabian Sea after its captain ignored weather warnings and chose not to move the vessel away from the path of severe cyclonic storm Tauktae, a survivor recounted.  A person, rescued from one of the three barges that adrifted after being smashed by the severe cyclone, said that while other barges started to move out of the path of the cyclone when they received warning, the Master of P-305 hardly moved 200 metres from its location near Heera oilfield in the Arabian Sea.P-305 probably had very little remaining work at the ONGC platform and wanted to remain anchored near the worksite rather than moving towards shore and return after a few days, the person, who did not wish to be named, said.But, the cyclone broke all its anchors and pushed it towards the ONGC platform, he said.An unsigned note from Afcons, the private contract which had deployed the barge for performance of a contract it had got from ONGC, said all its vessels were on May 14 advised to secure their respective work locations and move to safe locations at the earliest.The master of P-305 chose to move 200 metres away from the Heera platform where it was working and remain at the location, the note sent to ONGC said.This, it said, was based on his assessment that it was a safe location since the maximum predicted wind speed was only 40 knots and his location was 120 nautical miles away from the eye of the tropical storm.But, the weather conditions deteriorated rapidly from the evening of May 16, reaching worse than predicted levels a day later. This sudden deterioration of weather left no time at all for any further action to be taken by the master of the vessel, it said.Sources said the master of the P-305 was one of the 26 missing from the barge. Of the 261 onboard P-305, 186 were rescued while bodies of 49 have so far been recovered.Afcons had chartered the vessel from Durmast.Durmast, the note said, is the owner and the responsibility for marine operations rests with it.Cyclone Tauktae made landfall on Monday night on the Gujarat coast, which is dotted with oil and gas installations. While the offshore has fields producing oil and gas, the coast houses two big refineries and some of the busiest ports.While 6,961 persons on 337 offshore wells, platforms and other oil and gas installations that dot the west coast stayed safe, five vessels encountered mechanical faults, putting at risk 714 personnel on board.Three barges and an anchor handling boat deployed by Afcons for the project it was doing for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), and a drillship of a state-owned firm lost anchors and drifted away.While 440 persons on two barges and the drillship were brought to safety, barge P-305 carrying 261 personnel sank.Naval and Coast Guard vessels and aircraft scoured the waters off the west coast to look for the missing.The sources said based on the weather warning, ONGC, which operates the giant Mumbai High oil and gas field and other fields in the region, activated its emergency response system and issued instructions to all installations to take action.ONGC's installations, which include giant platforms that house hundreds of staff, wells, drillships and support vessels, took appropriate actions like staying at safe mode or moving to a safe location, they said.Afcons' construction barge Support Station-3, while moving to a safe location, encountered mechanical problems after its towing wire line snapped and it started drifting. It had 202 persons onboard.Its Gal Constructor barge, with 137 persons on board, was at a safe location but its anchors gave away and it too started drifting.ONGC's drillship Sagar Bhushan was required to stay at its position as per the standard operating procedure, but its anchors gave away and it developed a mechanical fault in the steering system. All its 101 persons as also those aboard Afcons' two barges were rescued to safety.

20-05-2021||New Delhi||India-China ties at crossroads: Jaishankar||The relationship between India and China is at a crossroads and its direction depends on whether the neighbouring country adheres to various agreements on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday referring to the eastern Ladakh standoff.Jaishankar said the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s visit in 1988 to China 26 years after the 1962 conflict led to a consensus on having stability along the frontier which was followed by the signing of two important agreements in 1993 and 1996 on maintaining peace and tranquillity at the border.The stability at the border led to the expansion of relations in several sectors, but it was adversely impacted following what happened in eastern Ladakh, he said at a webinar organised jointly organised by the Financial Times and the Indian Express.At a media briefing, Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Arindam Bagchi said full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would enable progress in the bilateral relationship.The ties between the two countries came under severe strain following a deadly clash in the Galwan valley in eastern Ladakh in June last, over a month after the border standoff began between the Indian and Chinese militaries in multiple friction points in the region.“I think the relationship is at a crossroads and which direction we go depends on whether the Chinese side would adhere to the consensus; whether it would follow through on the agreements which we both have done... What is very clear in the last year is that border tensions cannot continue with cooperation in other areas,” he said.Asked about China’s attempts to expand influence in the region and competition between the two countries, Jaishankar said India is ready to compete and it has its inherent strength as well as the influence that goes deep into the Indo-Pacific on the one side and Africa and Europe on the other.“It is one thing to compete, it is another thing to have violence on the border,” he said.“I am ready to compete. That is not the issue for me. The issue for me is how do I manage a relationship if the basis of the relationship has been violated by one side,” he said.The external affairs minister said the economic relationship and ties in other sectors between the two countries were driven by the stabilisation of the border through the 1980s and 1990s.“I do not have a clear cut answer at this point of time. We had the border conflict of 1962 and it took us really 26 years to have the first prime minister’s visit in 1988 when Rajiv Gandhi went to China. There was a 1988 sort of consensus which stabilised the border,” he said.He was asked about where things stand now in ties between the two nations.Jaishankar said the agreements in 1993 and 1996 on border management paved the way for the expansion of overall ties.“Those agreements essentially stipulated that you will not bring large armed forces to the border and the Line of Actual Control would be observed, respected and there would be no attempt to change the status quo unilaterally. Now what we saw last year was actually China departing from the 1988 consensus,” he said.Jaishankar said there is definitely going to impact the ties if the peace and tranquillity at the border are disturbed, “if you disturb the peace and tranquillity if you have bloodshed as you pointed out if there is intimidation if there is continuing friction at the border.”         To a question on further disengagement in eastern Ladakh, Bagchi said that full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would enable progress in the bilateral ties.He also referred to Jaishankar’s telephonic talks with the Chinese foreign minister last month.Bagchi said Jaishankar conveyed to his Chinese counterpart that while the process of disengagement had commenced earlier this year it remained unfinished and emphasised on early completion of the process.“In this context, the two sides have agreed in the interim that they would maintain stability on the ground and avoid any new incidents,” he said.“It is our expectation therefore that neither side should take any action that is not keeping with these understandings. Full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would enable progress in the bilateral relationship,” Bagchi added.India and China completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach on it at the 11th round of military talks with the Indian Army on April 9.The Chinese military is currently conducting a drill in its training areas near the Ladakh region.Chief of Army Staff Gen M M Naravane said on Wednesday said India is keeping a constant eye on activities by the Chinese military. He also hoped that both sides will be able to make forward movement in resolving issues in other areas. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-ties-at-crossroads-jaishankar-255841
20-05-2021||New Delhi||JNU faculty member Prof Deepak Gaur dies of Covid-19||JNU faculty member and recipient of prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award Professor Deepak Gaur died of coronavirus here on Thursday. He was 48.Gaur was a faculty member of the School of Biotechnology (SBT) and was currently on deputation to the International Aids Vaccine Institute (IAVI).He was serving as the Deputy Country Director there since mid-November last year.Professor Pawan Dhar, Dean, SBT, said he had known Gaur for the last six years and recalled him as “one of the best faculty members”.“I can’t believe that I am talking about him in past tense. In the beginning of this month, I had spoken to him after learning from our Whatsapp group that he had been infected with Covid-19. He was as usual full of energy, cool and calm when I spoke to him. ‘Everything is fine. You don’t worry’, he had said. He was talking very confidently,” recalled Dhar.However, almost eight days later, Dhar learnt that his friend and colleague had been admitted to the ICU.“That was when we got worried. Yesterday morning, I spoke with his wife and she told me he had secondary infection. He was on ventilator support. He was in ICU at RML but was shifted to AIIMS yesterday after he developed renal issues,” Dhar said.He said Gaur had received his first dose of coronavirus vaccine but was not sure whether he had also taken the second dose.Gaur is survived by his parents, his wife Ritu Gaur and two sons. His wife is a faculty member at the South Asian University.Professor Rupesh Chaturvedi, a faculty member of JNU, who is currently in the US, termed Gaur’s death as a “personal loss”.“We shared our lab, our office and were friends since 2014 when we had joined the varsity. My children were friends with his children. We had spoken when he had told me that he and his elder son have been infected with the virus. I can feel the pain of his parents. I don’t have the strength to talk to his family,” Chaturvedi said over the phone from the US.Along with being a good scientist, he was also a good administrator, Chaturvedi added.Gaur had been the Director of Admissions in JNU and he was instrumental in introducing the online system of admissions in 2019.He was awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 2017. His research focussed on understanding the biology of parasites that cause malaria and developing vaccines that can prevent the disease.His group had discovered a molecular complex on the surface of the malaria parasite (pathogen) that plays an essential role in invasion of red blood cells.After winning the award, he had told PTI, “JNU supports research in a big way...” Gaur had done his PhD in Life Sciences from National Institute of Immunology, JNU.Gaur had done his B.Sc (Honours) in Human Biology from AIIMS and his masters in Biotechnology from the same institute. His schooling was in Springdales School, Pusa Road. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jnu-faculty-member-prof-deepak-gaur-dies-of-covid-19-255840

20-05-2021||New Delhi||Phase-3 clinical trials for 2-DG may continue till August, suggests registry data||With the government presenting DRDO-developed drug 2-DG as a potential game-changer in the fight against COVID-19, the clinical trial registry data suggests that the phase-3 trials for the medicine at over two dozen government and private hospitals and involving 220 patients may continue till August.The third-phase trials began in January, while the phase-2 trials were conducted over a three-month period between June and September last year and involved 110 patients.While 2-DG has been studied in more than 200 clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers globally, trials to use it as a Covid-19 drug are apparently being done in India only and incidentally, a strong case for its therapeutic use against the novel coronavirus was made in a study paper last year that had Patanjali Research Institute’s Acharya Balkrishna as the lead author.His co-authors included four others from Patanjali—Pallavi Thakur, Shivam Singh, Swami Narsingh Dev, Anurag Varshney—as also Viney Jain (Jain Vishwa Bharti Institute, Rajasthan) and Rakesh Kumar Sharma (Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai).When contacted, Sharma said the paper was completed in October 2020 and it has been peer-reviewed as well.He said the possibility of repurposing of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a radio-chemo-modifier drug used as an adjuvant to cancer therapy, and one of its derivative (1, 3, 4, 6-Tetra-O-acetyl-2- deoxy-D-glucopyranose), has been investigated by conducting ligand-receptor docking.“The paper was submitted to the Annals of National Academy of Medical Sciences on October 15, 2020. It was peer-reviewed and it was accepted on May 11,” said Sharma, Dean of Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences.According to the paper, entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through the viral spike glycoprotein (S2) and afterward, the virus gets hold of the host cell machinery by employing the use of viral main protease 3CLpro and NSP15 endoribonuclease.It said that the possibility of repurposing of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a radiochemo-modifier drug used for optimising cancer therapy, and one of its derivative (1, 3, 4, 6-Tetra-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose), has been investigated by conducting ligand-receptor docking.It said 2-DG can dock efficiently with viral main protease 3CLpro as well as NSP15 endoribonuclease, thus efficiently inactivating these viral receptors leading to incapacitation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.“The 2-DG derivative formed a hydrogen bond with the glutamine amino acid residues of the viral spike glycoprotein. The present in silico study supports the potential benefits of using 2-DG and its glucopyranose derivative as repurposed drugs/prodrugs for mitigating the novel COVID-19 infection.“Since both these moieties present no signs of serious toxicity, further empirical studies on model systems and human clinical trials to ascertain effective dose-response are warranted and should be urgently initiated,” it added.An article in the January-February issue of the Indian Journal of Medical Research, a publication of the Indian Council of Medical Research, also cited this paper, while referring to the potential benefits of using 2-DG to mitigate COVID-19 infection.The Drugs Controller General India (DCGI) had granted permission in May last year to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for conducting a clinical trial of 2-DG for “acute treatment of moderate to severe Covid-19 patients”.Interestingly, Dr Reddy’s became the secondary sponsor after phase-2 trials and the DRDO’s Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences became the primary sponsor and main source for material or monetary support during the phase-3 trial.The phase II clinical trials were conducted at 12 sites across India, including at private and government hospitals. The trials were conducted over a three-month period between June-September 2020, for which a total of 110 COVID-19 patients aged 18-65 years were enrolled.Those with Covid-19 symptoms like fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, fatigue, body ache, headache, diarrhoea, nasal congestion took part in phase-2 clinical trials. The drug was found to be safe in Covid-19 patients and showed significant improvement in their recovery.Subsequently, phase-3 trials began in January 2021 on a sample size of 220 individuals aged between 18 and 90 years. According to the clinical trial registry data, the estimated duration of these trials are eight months and should therefore continue till August.While more than 25 sites have been selected for the phase-3 trials, DRDO’s Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences has been listed as the ‘source of monetary or material support’ as the primary sponsor in this stage, relegating Dr Reddy’s to the position of ‘secondary sponsor’.As per the registry, “This is a prospective, interventional, multi-centre, phase III, randomised, open-label, two treatment group, parallel design trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 2-DG administered as adjunctive (or add-on) therapy to standard of care, in comparison to standard of care alone, in the acute treatment of patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and presenting with moderate or severe COVID-19.”        An interim analysis will be planned for futility assessment and re-estimation of the sample size, it added.Earlier, the phase-2-trial report had mentioned that “while 2-DG is not an approved drug, it has been studied in 218 clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers globally”.Noting at that time that 2-DG has not been evaluated in the acute treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, the sponsors had stated the “mechanistic and in-vitro-evidence as well efficacy seen in the interventional clinical studies in malignancies and genital herpes” made them believe that 2-DG could be developed for the specific treatment of patients with COVID-19 disease in conjunction with other anti-viral therapies.It credited INMAS, DRDO, Ministry of Defence for the genesis of this hypothesis and testing of the efficacy of 2-DG against SARS-CoV2.The government recently launched 2-DG as an anti-COVID-19 therapeutic application of the drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG).The Health Ministry has said that clinical trial results have shown that this molecule helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplemental oxygen dependence. A higher proportion of patients treated with 2-DG showed RT-PCR negative conversion in Covid patients.  In the Covid infected cells, it inhibits virus synthesis and energy production for the process.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said the drug has the potential to become a game-changer in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic as it reduces the dependence of patients on oxygen administration and has the potential of getting absorbed differentially and in a selected manner.

20-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: Weather deteriorated rapidly, left no time for vessel master, says Afcons||Afcons Infrastructure, whose chartered barge P305 with 261 personnel at the Bombay High offshore oilfield was wrecked by cyclonic storm Tauktae earlier this week, on Thursday said the weather deteriorated rapidly and reached levels far worse than forecasts. As many as 37 personnel on board the barge have been killed and 38 are still missing.Afcons Infrastructure, the engineering arm of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, also claimed it has followed all standard practices.Read also: 38 still missing four days after Cyclone Tauktae sank Barge off Mumbai coastAfcons, on behalf of its three consortium partners—Triune Energy Services, Nauvata Engineering and Halani International—in a statement said “weather forecasts received on May 14 predicted that sustained wind speed of maximum 40 knots (classified as a ‘tropical storm’ by them) is likely to occur at our specific work location late May 16-early 17”.“On May 14 itself, all our vessels were advised to secure their respective work locations and move to safety at the earliest. Accordingly, all vessels and barges, including Pappa 305 (P305), began moving back on May 14-15,” it said.While all other barges moved to Mumbai port/Mumbai outer anchorage/ anchorage close to Revandanda, the master of P305 chose to move 200 miles away from the HT platform where the barge was working, and to remain at that location, deciding this as a safe location since the maximum wind speed predicted was only 40 knots and his location was 120 nautical miles away from the eye of the tropical storm. “Unfortunately, the weather deteriorated rapidly from the evening of May 16, reaching levels far worse than predicted on May 17. This sudden deterioration left no time at all for any further action to be taken by the P305 vessel master,” the statement said.As of Thursday morning, the Navy and Coast Guard have retrieved 37 bodies, and said as many as 38 of the 261 personnel from the sunken barge are still to be traced four days into the tragedy.  All these men were deployed at the Heera platform of the national energy major ONGC on the Bombay High—around 70 km southwest of Mumbai—its largest asset in the country.  Despite seeing bleak chance of the missing people being rescued, the Navy on Thursday morning launched a fresh aerial search and rescue mission, deploying helicopters to scour the high waters.Afcons also said according to the normal marine protocol, as well as the specific charter agreement for P305, matters concerning vessel safety is the responsibility of the owner/barge master. Pointing out that the published weather reports, including cyclone alerts, were for the general region of operations and not particularly relevant for any exact area of operation, it said the standard practise of offshore contractors is to obtain weather forecast for the work location from well-known weather forecasters twice a day. Marine and construction operations are planned based on the above location-specific forecasts and the same practice was followed by Afcons, it said.The company also clarified that it has chartered the wrecked vessel P305 from Durmast and that charting is different from subcontracting.Durmast is the owner and the responsibility for marine operations rests with the owner and his marine crew stationed on the vessel, it said. Afcons, as charterer, has deployed its construction workmen and supervisors, who stay on the barge and carry out construction/ revamp work on the platform. Accordingly, under the international standard vessel chartering terms, which was adopted for P305, the responsibility for marine side of operations—safe vessel operation, navigation and vessel management—come under the scope of work of Durmast, it said. Afcons also said of the 261 people on the wrecked P305, 13 were its employees, but did not say whether all of them have been rescued or not. The other five vessels/barges were SS-3 with a total of 202 people on board, Gal Constructor (137 people), Trinity Nissie (268), Ocean 303 had 170 personnel on board and Falcon Warrior had 203. The first four vessels had eight Afcons employees each, while the last one had six staffers. All these personnel are safe and back home/in hospitals after being rescued by the Navy and Coast Guard.

In our assessment the motive element in the chain of circumstances is not acceptable and the benefit of the broken link must be made available to the appellants,” the Bench said and added that “there can be no uniform or universal reaction for a crime witness and inferences must not be drawn on court’s assumption”.The apex court said it was of considered opinion that there are several missing components in the chain of circumstantial evidence and the high court misdirected itself in finding support for conviction on such unclinching evidence.“The innocence of the appellants is a distinct possibility in the present matter and when two views are possible the benefit must go to the accused. The impugned judgment is accordingly set aside with direction for immediate release of both appellants,” the Bench said.According to the prosecution, on August 8, 1993 Kamla Rani, after spending some days with her parents was returning back on the scooter driven by her brother-in-law Surendra.On her way two armed miscreants ambushed the scooter near the forested area and took Kamla Rani to the roadside sugarcane field and shot her from close range and robbed her of the gold and silver ornaments worn on her person.Surendra then rode the scooter to village Phlawada to inform the father of Kamla about the incident.The scooter was left behind with Kamla Rani’s father and Surendra then returned to his own village and informed his brother and other family members in the matrimonial home of the deceased at village Mahal.Both brothers accompanied by their father, thereafter rushed to the police station.Around the same time, two witnesses who were near the site of incident, after hearing the sound of firing went towards the field and they noticed two miscreants removing ornaments from the body of Kamla Rani.                       Since maltreatment of the deceased in the matrimonial home was alleged in the FIR, the appellants were detained in the police lock up and four days later, the police formally arrested all three, on charge of conspiracy and murder.The apex court in its judgment said when confronted by the armed robbers, he may not have counter attacked to invite injury upon himself but this by itself can’t be construed as suspicious conduct.“Yet his post incident conduct was found to be suspicious enough by the courts below, to link him with the murder. In the present case, no criminal act is attributed to Surendra and conspiracy between him and the two armed miscreants is not shown.“Therefore, to link the appellant with the murder is nothing more than a matter of surmises and conjectures,” it said.

20-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra village breaks coronavirus infection chain by isolation||Two months ago, a girl in Bhosi village of Maharashtra’s Nanded district was found coronavirus positive, infected after attending a wedding.Days later, five people from the village, having a population of around 6,000 were also infected, sending local body members and health officials into a tizzy.“A health camp was held in the village in coordination with the gram panchayat and the health department to conduct Covid tests. Rapid Antigen Tests and RT-PCR tests revealed that 119 people were positive,” an official release said.“It was decided to isolate the patients to break the chain of coronavirus spreading to others. Accordingly, all the infected people were persuaded to go and live on their fields for 15-17 days, as mandated by the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for people with mild infections,” the release said.Farm labourers and others who did not own farms were accommodated in a makeshift 40 feet by 60 feet shed on the farm of Zilla Parishad member Prakash Deshmukh Bhosikar who took the initiative to organise the health camp, the release said.“Ashatai village health workers and Anganwadi sevika would visit the fields every day and interact with patients.Food and medicines were also provided on the spot and all the villagers cooperated,” the release said.After 15 to 20 days of isolation, the villagers returned home as coronavirus-free persons after a health check-up, it said.“A month and a half later, there is no new patient in the village. Covid can be fought effectively by adopting the age-old path of isolation as was being done during the days of the plague, even in villages without adequate health facilities,” the release by the Central government’s Press Information Bureau (PIB) said.“Separation is the only way to save the villagers from getting infected,” it quoted Lakshmibai Akkemwad, who spent a fortnight in quarantine on the fields.Nanded Zilla Parishad CEO Varsha Thakur Ghuge said the ‘Bhosi pattern’ is a good example of coordination between the villagers, people’s representatives and the administration, worthy of implementation in other villages.“Preventing coronavirus spread in rural areas is a relatively complicated process due to the lack of testing facilities and health infrastructure, as compared to urban areas. However, Bhosi village has shown the way of fighting the pandemic through the path of isolation,” the release said.

These children are left with the trauma of loss and no support towards a stable education or future. l am writing to request you to consider providing a free education at the Navodaya Vidhyalayas to children who have lost either both parents or an earning parent on account the Covid pandemic,” Gandhi said in a letter to PM.She said there are 661 Navodaya schools in India today. Gandhi also mentioned that the schools are one of the most significant legacies of late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and that it was his dream to make high-quality modern education accessible and affordable to talented youth, predominantly from rural areas. Gandhi said as a nation, "We owe it to the children to give them hope for a robust future after the unimaginable tragedy that has befallen them."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/educate-covid-orphans-free-in-navodaya-schools-sonia-to-pm-255800

20-05-2021||New Delhi||No money, no documents, Rohingyas battle Covid symptoms with home remedies||With no money for treatment and no documents that will enable them to get vaccinated or tested, they are the Rohingyas, the nowhere people fending for themselves as a continuing pandemic pushes them further into the shadows of a city they call home.The helplessness in the face of COVID-19 plays out in southeast Delhi's Madanpur Khadar, one of the several camps in the city for Rohingya Muslims where the refugees battle it out on their own without access to testing centres, vaccines or doctors.The government has eased testing and vaccine guidelines even for those who don't have the requisite documentation, but many refugees said it hasn't made a tangible difference at the ground level. The Madanpur Khadar camp is home to about 270 Rohingya Muslims, who fled their homes in Myanmar to escape persecution. Many of those living in the slum cluster said they have learnt to battle symptoms on their own – depending on home remedies such as saltwater gargles and withdrawing indoors into their cramped tenements to quarantine when they think it has gotten worse.Among those showing symptoms is Amir*, a young daily wager who has been gargling with hot water four times a day to make his cough go away. It is helping somewhat but he doesn't know what he will do if the situation aggravates. He doesn't have an Aadhaar card or any other document, and neither do his neighbours.“What can we do? We can't get tests done, we can't get vaccinated. For everything you need government documents which we don't have,” he said.“There are around 20-25 people right now who are displaying Covid symptoms. We are treating ourselves at home. Going to the hospital is not even an option as we do not have the necessary documents,” he said.Last month, when the pandemic was at its peak, about 50-60 Rohingya refugees in the Madanpur Khadar camp displayed Covid symptoms. It has now come down to about 20-25, the residents said.According to NGOs, around 40,000 Rohingyas are living in India. About 900 Rohingyas are living in Delhi in camps in Madanpur Khadar, Kalindi Kunj and Shaheen Bagh.Naseer* lost his wife six months ago. He thinks it was COVID-19 but can't be sure even though he somehow managed to take her to the hospital.“My wife died after suffering from Covid like symptoms. I had taken my wife to the hospital but she passed away before she could get treated,” he said, adding that an ID card issued to him by the UN helped him access a hospital. Many others are scared of doing so because they fear they will be deported if identified as refugees. “People feel if they go to the hospital they will be identified as outsiders,” said the father of two. Naseer*, who runs a small grocery shop in the neighbourhood, also said people get scared when they have symptoms.“They quarantine themselves, drink hot water and add lime to it, eat onions. Many of them have breathing difficulties and fever and cold and cough. Many people don't even want to talk about it,” he said. While untreated COVID-19 poses a risk not just for individuals but the community, it is not just about health for Rohingya Muslim refugees.“Most of us work in the informal sector and have lost our jobs in this lockdown. The last one-and-a-half years have been tough. We have not been able to get employment and those who are working are also putting their lives at risk,” Naseer* said.The majority of those in the Madanpur Khadar settlement and others work as daily wage and contract labourers, ragpickers and other odd jobs.Both Naseer* and Amir* came to India in 2012 to look for a better life and to escape the brutalities faced by the Rohingyas in Myanmar's Rakhine state.The Rohingya Muslims are the most persecuted minority in the world, the UN has said.According to NGOs, there are about 40,000 Rohingyas in India. Of these, about 900 live in Delhi in camps in Madanpur Khadar, Kalindi Kunj and Shaheen Bagh.A representative of the Rohingya Human Rights Initiative said health facilities have always been a problem for the Rohingya refugees. “Rohingyas are more exposed because of the congested areas they live in… it's not just about coronavirus but other diseases as well. Recently, several cases of diarrhoea were seen among children in the camp,” he said.“We have identified such cases where symptoms of coronavirus are being seen. But without the requisite documents, treatment has been an issue and getting them vaccinated is a very big concern,” he said, asking not to be identified.     He said no deaths due to the disease have been reported yet in Madanpur Khadar. According to recent guidelines by the Health ministry, those without ID cards will also be covered in the Covid vaccination drive through special sessions. However, it is not clear whether the list includes refugees. The list includes nomads (including sadhu/saints from various religions), prison inmates, inmates in mental health Institutions, citizens in old age homes, roadside beggars, people in rehabilitation centres/camps and any other identified eligible persons, aged 18 years or more. The Centre has asked state governments to form district-level task forces to identify those who don't have any of the seven prescribed photo ID cards.A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesperson said inclusion in health responses, vaccines to social safety nets is key to protecting refugees and their hosts from the COVID-19 virus.“The UNHCR welcome the SOP issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for COVID-19 vaccination of persons without prescribed identity cards. This will provide an opportunity for vulnerable groups including refugees and asylum seekers to access vaccines… Safeguarding their health also protects the health of their host communities and members of societies,” the spokesperson told PTI in a written response. Rohingyas have been displaced by waves of violence between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine. Thousands of them have fled Myanmar to take refuge in neighbouring countries, including India. (*names have been changed to protect identities) PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-money-no-documents-rohingyas-battle-covid-symptoms-with-home-remedies-255789

20-05-2021||United Nations||Estimated 4,000-6,000 refugees from Myanmar sought safety in India: UN||An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 refugees from Myanmar have sought safety in India, a spokesperson for the UN chief has said, as the world body voiced concern over the rising levels of displacement of people since the military coup in the country in February.  The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said that in Myanmar, as of last week, approximately 60,700 women, children and men have been internally displaced.More than 1,700 refugees have crossed into Thailand in March and April, most of whom subsequently returned to Myanmar, and an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 have sought safety in India, Spokesman for the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Stephane Dujarric told reporters at the daily press briefing on Wednesday.Myanmar shares an over 1,600 km long unfenced and porous land border with India as well as a maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. Four North-Eastern states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram share the international boundary with Myanmar.The UN team in Myanmar has called on all countries across the region to offer refuge and protection to all people seeking safety, while humanitarian workers should be granted access to help them. UN colleagues again call on the military to refrain from violence and the use of disproportionate use, including the use of live ammunition.Dujarric said that UN officials in Myanmar are still gravely concerned over rising levels of displacement since the military takeover of the Government on February 1.  “Since then, there has been widespread violence against civilians across the country. Clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces and ethnic armed organisations in border areas has intensified,” he said.Last week, a statement issued by the spokesperson for the UN chief had said that 100 days since the Myanmar military takeover that left hundreds of civilians killed and included numerous arbitrary arrests and other human rights violations, the Secretary-General renews his call on the country's military to respect the will of the people and act in the greater interest of peace and stability in the country.The Secretary-General also encouraged ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) to swiftly follow through on its own commitments, and the international community to support regional efforts, to bring an end to the repression by the military.Guterres also called on the international community to respond to the increased humanitarian needs.The Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Christine Schraner Burgener, was in the region and engaged intensively with a range of key stakeholders, including in light of the broader ramifications of the crisis.India has condemned the violence in Myanmar and condoled the loss of life, as it urged maximum restraint and called for the release of detained leaders, emphasised the situation to be resolved peacefully and underlined its steadfast commitment to democratic transition.India has also welcomed the ASEAN Five-point consensus on Myanmar, which calls for an “immediate cessation” of violence in the country and that all parties shall exercise utmost restraint.The 15-nation UN Security Council had held a private meeting in connection with Myanmar late last month.India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti had later tweeted that in the Council, he said India welcomes the ASEAN initiative and Five-point consensus. He added that India will strengthen ASEAN's efforts; the Security Council and the UN “should support their efforts.” He had added that India continues to “insist on the release of detained leaders and end to violence” and that New Delhi's overall stand on the situation is consistent.The ASEAN Five-point consensus states that there shall be an immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar and all parties shall exercise utmost restraint; constructive dialogue among all parties concerned shall commence to seek a peaceful solution in the interests of the people.It also states that a special envoy of the ASEAN Chair shall facilitate mediation of the dialogue process, with the assistance of the Secretary-General of ASEAN; ASEAN shall provide humanitarian assistance through the AHA Centre (ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management) and the special envoy and delegation shall visit Myanmar to meet with all parties concerned.Schraner Burgener had told the Council in April that the regional security and economic consequences of the situation in Myanmar were getting worse and could deteriorate further.“The influx of refugees at the Indian and Thai borders and elsewhere is ominous and likely just the beginning,” she had said.

20-05-2021||New Delhi||At 23 degrees, Delhi records lowest temperature in May since 1951||A record 119.3 mm of rainfall pounded Delhi under the impact of cyclonic storm Tauktae and a western disturbance in 24 hours ending 8:30 am on Thursday, breaking all the previous records for May, the IMD said on Thursday.The city had also recorded a maximum temperature of 23.8 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, 16 notches below normal and the lowest in the month of May since 1951, it said."A record 119.3 mm rain fell in Delhi between 8:30 am on Wednesday and 8:30 am on Thursday, which is a new record for May. The capital had recorded 60 mm rainfall in a 24-hour period on May 24 in 1976," an Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of India Meteorological Department's regional forecasting Centre said.  The rainfall in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, northern Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Wednesday was a result of interaction between the remnant of cyclonic storm Tauktae and a western disturbance, the IMD said.  Rainfall recorded below 15 mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate, between 64.5 mm and 115.5 mm is heavy, between 115.6 and 204.4 is very heavy. Anything above 204.4 mm is considered extremely heavy rainfall. R K Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre, said, "May remains generally dry. Normally, Delhi gets maximum of 30 mm or 40 mm (24-hour rainfall) in this month. The rain lasts only an hour or less. But this is completely different system coming from Arabian Sea and meeting with a western disturbance. Because the feature is rarest, so this much rain is not a surprise."              The IMD said "rainfall activity is very likely to decrease" on Thursday and "scattered to fairly widespread" rainfall is forecast in the capital.The incessant rains brought the maximum temperature down to 23.8 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung on Wednesday. The minimum temperature on Thursday settled at 19.3 degrees Celsius, seven notches below normal."Safdarjung recorded a maximum temperature of 23.8 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. This is the lowest maximum temperature since 1951," Srivastava said.In between, a low of 24.8 degrees Celsius was recorded on May 13 1982, he said.According to the IMD, Delhi's maximum temperature on Wednesday was less than that of Srinagar (25.8 degrees Celsius) and Dharamshala (27.2 degrees Celsius) up in the north.

20-05-2021||New Delhi||Kit for rapid Covid-19 home-testing approved, ICMR advises against indiscriminate use||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday approved a home-based rapid antigen testing (RAT) kit for COVID-19, which it advised should be used only on symptomatic individuals and on immediate contacts of laboratory-confirmed positive cases.The country's apex health research body said that the home-based rapid antigen testing kit manufactured by Mylab Discovery Solutions Ltd, Pune, has been validated and approved.Only nasal swab will be required for this rapid antigen testing, it said, adding the process should be conducted as per the procedure described by the manufacturer in the user manual.In an advisory, the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) cautioned people against indiscriminate home testing using Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs), saying it should be used only on symptomatic individuals and on the immediate contacts of laboratory-confirmed positive cases. All individuals who test positive through the RAT kit may be considered as true positives and no-repeat testing is required, the Indian Council of Medical Research said in the advisory. "Home testing by RAT is advised only in symptomatic individuals and immediate contacts of laboratory-confirmed positive cases. Indiscriminate testing is not advised," the county's apex health research body said. "All symptomatic individuals who test negative by RAT should get themselves immediately tested by RT-PCR. This is especially important as the RATs are likely to miss few positive cases presenting with a low viral load."All RAT negative symptomatic individuals may be treated as suspect COVID-19 cases and are advised to follow the ICMR/Ministry of Health home isolation protocol while awaiting the RT-PCR test result," the advisory stated.The ICMR said the home testing mobile app is available in Google play store and Apple store and must be downloaded by all users. The mobile app is a comprehensive guide of the testing procedure and will provide a positive or negative test result to the patient.  All users are advised to click a picture of the test strip after completing the test procedure with the same mobile phone which has been used for downloading the mobile app and user registration. "Data in the app of your mobile phone will be centrally captured in a secure server which is connected with the ICMR COVID-19 testing portal, where all data will be eventually stored. Patient confidentiality will be fully maintained," the advisory underlined.Presently, CoviSelfTM(PathoCatch) COVID-19 OTC Antigen LF device manufactured by Mylab Discovery Solutions Ltd., Pune (Maharashtra), India has been validated and approved, the ICMR said.

Even as the western coast continued to reel under the impact of the rain and wind fury, the effect of Cyclone Tauktae was felt as far as northwest India, where its remnant today interacted with a western disturbance to bring “fairly widespread to widespread rains in the region”.Heavy to very heavy rains were experienced in Uttarakhand, UP, Himachal, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, northeast Rajasthan, and north Madhya Pradesh, the IMD said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-tauktae-yaas-brews-in-bay-of-bengal-255666

The CBI also moved a petition before the High Court to cancel altogether the bail granted to the four arrested politicians by the lower court and transfer the case to High Court.The dharna held by Mamata Banerjee in the CBI office on Monday to protest against the arrest of her Cabinet colleagues Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, Trinamool Congress MLA Madan Mitra and former TMC minister Sovan Chatterjee was played up in the court today by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to back his argument that pressure was mounted on the CBI court judge to grant bail to the four accused.Leaders to stay in jail as hearing put offMehta cited the presence of Bengal Law Minister Moloy Ghatak at the designated CBI court on Monday at the time of the virtual production of the four arrested politicians and argued that the minister went to the CBI court to put pressure on the judge.Mamata’s “dharna” inside the CBI office encouraged TMC supporters to assemble outside the premises. The supporters threw stones at the central forces deployed to guard the office. The accused could not be produced before the court on Monday physically because of the presence of a mob outside the CBI office and on the court premises, Mehta argued.

Always the helpful one, in his friends and family circle, he lapped up the opportunity as people reached out to him seeking help. “Being an actor, one has this connect with masses. I have been just trying in whichever way possible. Even over calls; people are distressed. I having gone through it and sharing experiences is sometimes enough. And that works wonderfully well, as that saves hospital beds for critical patients.”Doing his bitWith a lot more queries coming Gurmeet’s way, he has now set-up a team to assist as many people as possible. “It’s not always a victory. At times we lose lives before one can arrange for treatment, moments like that are very hard. But as we deal with the pandemic, every effort counts.”With a team of young, dedicated doctors he has also set up a 100-bed hospital called Astha at Nagpur. Gurmeet recently travelled to motivate them, despite his close ones warning him not to venture out in this situation. “This is the least I can do for the doctors and nurses who are working round-the-clock. If my being there boosts their morale, I am up for it.” He is also in the process of opening an ultra-modern 1000-bed hospital in Patna as well as Lucknow.Gurmeet has also recently tied up with an IAS coaching institute to take a batch free of cost, given that many are struggling financially. “Many don’t have the means to get coaching for this highly competitive exam, so I have joined hands with Empower IAS for it.”Know his idolsGurmeet has two figures as his idols – Karan from Mahabharata and former Indian President Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. “My father was in the Army and I grew up listening to stories of Karan from him. To put others before the self was something that really fascinated me.”He also admires practical solutions envisaged by Dr Kalam. “Making India corruption-free is important. People are not dying of disease, but because life saving drugs that cost a few thousands are sold for Rs 9 or 11 lakhs per injection. Dr Kalam wanted young people to take charge and now is the time.”For the futureHaving dabbled in multiple genres, Gurmeet is enjoying his Bollywood innings. Next on his to-do list are films that are socially relevant. “Bollywood has a huge following not just in our country, but even when I travel internationally; people connect India to Bollywood. I want to harness this power and do films on social issues, which can bring real change.”While he is keeping fit working out with a trainer online and eating healthy, he insists that we must use this time to prepare for post-Covid world. “Post-Covid era would present a new set of challenges.” He hopes we could all hold hands to navigate out of this. “While poor get provisions, it’s the middle class that suffers. It is not able to ask for either ration or financial help. If a few of us reach out and together adopt one family, and be their moral, financial, support, we would be able to tide through these tough times,” he says.mona@tribunemail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bollywood-actor-gurmeet-choudhary-is-helping-people-dealing-with-covid-19-in-a-special-way-255595

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of fertiliser prices.According to a statement by the PMO, a detailed presentation was given to him on the issue of fertiliser prices. “It was discussed that the price of fertilisers is undergoing an increase due to the rising prices of phosphoric acid, ammonia, etc., internationally. The PM stressed that farmers should get fertilisers at old rates despite the international rise in prices,” it said.The statement said the decision was taken to increase the subsidy for DAP fertiliser from Rs 500 per bag to Rs 1,200 per bag, despite the rise in international market prices of DAP. It has been decided to continue selling it at the older price of Rs 1,200 and the central government has decided to bear all the burden of price hike. The amount of subsidy per bag has never been increased so much at once, it added.Last year, the actual price of DAP was Rs 1,700 per bag. In which the Central government was giving a subsidy of Rs 500 per bag. So, the companies were selling fertiliser to farmers for Rs 1,200 per bag.“Recently, the international prices of phosphoric acid, ammonia, etc., used in DAP have gone up by 60 per cent to 70 per cent. Therefore, the actual price of a DAP bag is now Rs 2,400, which could be sold by fertiliser companies at Rs 1,900 after considering a subsidy of Rs 500. With today’s decision, farmers will continue to get a DAP bag for Rs 1,200,” the statement added.The PM said his government is committed to the welfare of farmers and will take all efforts to ensure that farmers do not have to face the brunt of price-rise. The Central Government spends about Rs 80,000 crore on subsidies for chemical fertilisers every year. With the increase in subsidy in DAP, the government will spend an additional Rs 14,775 crore as subsidy in Kharif season.This is the second major decision in the farmers’ interest, after directly transferring Rs 20,667 crore in Farmers’ account under PM-KISAN on the day of Akshay Tritiya.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/subsidy-on-dap-hiked-by-140-pc-farmers-to-get-fertiliser-at-old-rates-of-rs-1-200-255344

He was 72.Family sources told PTI that the retired IPS officer was admitted to the Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon on April 14 after his oxygen saturation started declining.“He passed away today at 3:30 pm after suffering a massive cardiac arrest,” one of them said.Dutt is survived by his wife, a son, who works in Noida, and a daughter, who is based in the US.JK or Jyoti Krishan Dutt was a 1971-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer of the West Bengal cadre.Sh Jyoti Krishan Dutt IPS ,former DG NSG ( Aug 2006- Feb 2009) passed away today on 19th May at Gurugram. NSG condoles the sad and untimely demise of former DG and remembers his distinguished service to the Nation . pic.twitter.com/qhBj4JnjwBHe served as the DG of the National Security Guard (NSG) from August 2006 to February 2009, after which he retired from service.He also worked in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and was once appointed as its officiating chief or director in 2005.Dutt also had a stint with the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).The NSG condoled his death through a message on Twitter.“NSG condoles the sad and untimely demise of (our) former DG and remembers his distinguished service to the Nation.“He will always be remembered for his leadership during Op Black Tornado (Mumbai 2008). May Almighty rest his noble soul in eternal peace and give strength to his family to bear the loss,” the NSG said.Dutt, along with about 200 ‘black cats’ commandos, had boarded an IL-76 aircraft of the Aviation Research Centre (ARC) to fly the first batch of the counter-terrorist strike force to Mumbai soon after the western metropolis reported multiple shootouts and public killings in the night of November 26, 2008.The elite force launched ‘Operation Black Tornado’ to kill the 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists who had sneaked into Mumbai through sea route and laid an over 60-hour siege killing 166 people and injuring 300 more, including foreigners.The NSG commandos had operated at two luxury hotels – Taj and Oberoi Trident – and the Jewish Chabad House to flush out and finally neutralise eight LeT terrorists.While Ajmal Kasab was caught alive by Mumbai Police personnel at a check post erected in Girgaum Chowpatty that night, another terrorist accompanying him was killed on the spot.The delay in securing an aircraft to rush the NSG commandos from Delhi to Mumbai that night in 2008 led to the creation of multiple hubs of the force later, and it was subsequently given powers to haul any aircraft in case of an exigency.The then Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil had also boarded this flight, and it was widely reported that after the time lag in getting the plane, the commando unit faced further delays due to VIP protocols.Dutt had told PTI in an interview conducted in 2009 that the force was under pressure to use tear gas during the 26/11 terror attacks but the idea was shot down for fear of a repeat of another Russian theatre disaster.“...But inside a hotel (Taj), when people are inside a room, if gas is let, how does one know that there are no heart patients, asthma patients and children inside.“I may be causing more casualties than the terrorists. In fact, if you surf the internet and look at one of the incidents that occurred in Russia... It had disastrous effects,” he had told the news agency at its office on Parliament Street in the national capital.The IPS officer was referring to the 2002 Moscow theatre hostage crisis, during which Russian forces had used an unknown chemical agent inside the crowded theatre, where about 40-50 armed Chechens were holding over 850 hostages.While the forces killed about 40 attackers, the toxic substance aimed at subduing the rebels led to the death of around 130 hostages.

20-05-2021||New Delhi||New vaccine policy: Covid infected to defer jab by 3 months; approval given for lactating mothers||India on Wednesday changed its Covid vaccine policy allowing jabs for lactating women and deciding to defer inoculations for all lab-confirmed Covid positive persons for three months after recovery.The health ministry accepted wide-ranging recommendations of the National Technical Advisory Group of Immunisation, which vetted the changes based on evidence, on Wednesday.At present, the protocol recommended is for Covid infected persons to defer shots for four to eight weeks after recovery. The period has now been definitively extended to 30 days after recovery.“As per new recommendations of National Expert Group on Vaccinations for Covid, Covid-19 vaccination is now to be deferred by 3 months after recovery from the illness. If infected with Covid after 1st dose, 2nd dose to be deferred by 3 months after clinical recovery from Covid-19 illness. Also Covid-19 vaccination has been recommended for all lactating women,” the government said. So far vaccination was not recommended for people with allergies, pregnant and lactating women.Vaccine contra-indications for pregnant women and allergic people still stand.“No screening of vaccine recipients by Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) is needed prior to Covid-19 vaccination,” said another of government decisions on Wednesday.The ministry said National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC)’s recommendations regarding Covid-19 vaccination are based on the evolving situation of the Covid-19 pandemic and emerging global scientific evidence and experience.“Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has accepted these recommendations,” the government said.Deferring the Covid-19 vaccination will happen in the following scenarios:—Individuals having lab test proven SARS-2 Covid-19 illness will defer COVID-19 vaccination by 3 months after recovery. —SARS-2 Covid-19 patients who have been given anti-SARS-2 monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma will defer Covid-19 vaccination by 3 months from the date of discharge from the hospital. —Individuals who have received at least the 1st dose and got Covid-19 infection before completion of the dosing schedule will defer the 2nd dose by 3 months after clinical recovery from the illness.—Persons with any other serious general illness requiring hospitalisation or ICU care should also wait for 4-8 weeks before getting the Covid-19 vaccine.—An individual can donate blood after 14 days of either receipt of Covid-19 vaccine or testing RT-PCR negative, if suffering from Covid-19 disease.“Covid-19 vaccination is recommended for all lactating women. There is no requirement for screening of the vaccine recipients by Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) prior to Covid-19 vaccination. Regarding Covid-19 vaccination of pregnant women, the matter is under discussion and further deliberation by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI),” said the government.The Health Ministry has also written to States and UTs to direct the concerned officials to take note of these recommendations and undertake necessary action for their effective implementation.States have been advised to ensure effective dissemination of the information to service provides as well as the general public, through the use of all channels of information and communication in the local languages.States have also been advised to undertake the training of the vaccination staff at all levels.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-vaccine-policy-covid-infected-to-defer-jab-by-3-months-approval-given-for-lactating-mothers-255279
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone: Rescued workmen from barge recall horror in sea||Twenty six bodies have been found in the Arabian Sea and are of possibly of the persons who were on board the ill-fated barge ‘P305’ that sunk on the night intervening May 17 & May 18.Two more survivors have been found on Wednesday, taking the number of those rescued from the barge to 186. Still 49 persons are missing at sea and with hopes of finding survivors now would be miracle. A DNA match of the dead would reveal their identity. A DNA sample is collected, as part of protocol,  of those working on oil rigs and at Sea.The sunken barge was working at the Heera oil rig part of the Bombay High oil rigs 70 kms south-west of Mumbai. It was a part of six separate vessels which had been adrift at sea since Monday following the Cyclone Tauktae. All were connected with oil-drilling work or new projects at the Bombay high. The others are safe.Also the number of persons on board the ill-fated barge ‘P305’ has been down revised from the 273 announced earlier to 261, the latest number. The Navy had initially said 273 were on board the barge and this was based on the first SOS message. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission clarified that the number on board the barge was 261. The Navy has confirmed the figure and now it has been revised to 261 onboard before the accident.A massive search operation is on for the past 48 hours. The first lot of rescued men arrived at Mumbai onboard INS Kochi, the Indian Naval warship and a second lot of survivors would reach Mumbai tonight.Warships,  planes, and helicopters continue their search for those missing at sea.  INS Teg, INS Betwa, INS Beas are at the location. Maritime reconnaissance plane the P8I, fitted with sharp sensors, is scanning the area.  Helicopters with sensors are at the location. All the copters can land on decks of the available ships at sea."It was a horrific situation on the barge. I had not thought I would survive. But, I swam in the waters for seven to eight hours with the determination to stay alive and was rescued by the Navy," workman Manoj Gite told reporters here.Gite (19), a resident of Kolhapur, said as the barge started sinking, all workmen got worried and he along with others wore a life jacket and jumped into the waters.The workman, who had joined as a helper on the barge only last month, said said he lost all his documents and mobile phone in the cyclonic storm.Asked if he would return to the rig again, Gite said he is not keen to go back and is contented to be alive after the nightmarish experience.Another workman, who was injured in the incident, thanked the Indian Navy for saving his life."It is because of the Navy that we all are alive and safe today, otherwise we don't what would have happened to us," the workman said while fighting back his tears.One of the officials on the barge had claimed the cyclone was "not huge", another workman said."The official is now missing. We tried to search for him, but in vain," he said.Another rescued workman said as their barge started sinking, he jumped into the waters in the middle of the night and tried to stay afloat."I swam for about 12 hours before the Navy team rescued me," he said.Another personnel, who works as a fitter at the rig, said the sea waves were higher than the height of the barge and there were high-speed winds blowing around."Before the Navy ship arrived, we were not sure what was going to happen. As we saw the naval ship coming towards us for rescue, our confidence went up. I was sure they will save me, hence I jumped into the waters and started swimming," he said. Meanwhile, the tugs of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) are towing the drillship Sagar Bhushan and barge ‘Support Station 3’ to harbour. Food and drinking water has been being provided to the crew onboard these vessels by Indian Navy copters. They were both carrying 297 men onboard.Meanwhile, all the 137 personnel on barge GAL Constructor were rescued on Tuesday by the Navy and Coast Guard. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-rescued-workmen-from-barge-recall-horror-in-sea-255261
20-05-2021||New Delhi||IT Ministry directs WhatsApp to withdraw new privacy policy||The government has ordered WhatsApp to withdraw its controversial new privacy policy, saying the changes undermine the sacrosanct values of privacy, data security and harms rights and interests of Indian citizens.The Ministry of Electronics and IT shot off a letter to WhatsApp on May 18 on the issue, sources said and warned that necessary steps in accordance with law will be taken if a satisfactory response was not received within seven days.The ministry has taken a strong position on the matter, and made it clear that it is not just problematic but also “irresponsible” for the messaging platform to leverage its position to impose “unfair” terms and conditions on Indian users, when many depend on WhatsApp to communicate in everyday life, according to the sources.When contacted, a WhatsApp spokesperson said the company continues to engage with the government.“... we reaffirm what we said before that this update does not impact the privacy of personal messages for anyone... we’ll take every opportunity to explain how we protect people’s personal messages and private information,” the spokesperson added.In its letter dated May 18, the ministry has drawn attention of WhatsApp as to how its new privacy policy is a violation of several provisions of the existing Indian laws and rules.In fulfilment of its sovereign responsibility to protect the rights and interests of Indian citizens, the government will consider various options available to it under laws in India, the sources at the ministry said.A raging debate had ensued after WhatsApp had said it will update its terms of service and privacy policy around how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products.WhatsApp—which has 53 crore users in India as per government data—had faced severe backlash over user concerns that data was being shared with parent company Facebook.Earlier this week, WhatsApp told the Delhi High Court that while its new privacy policy has come into effect from May 15, it would not start deleting accounts of those users who have not accepted it and would try to encourage them to get on board.The platform had said there was no universal or uniform time limit after which it will start to delete accounts as each user would be dealt with on a case-to-case basis.The sources said the IT ministry believes that the changes to WhatsApp privacy policy and the manner of introducing the said changes undermines the sacrosanct values of informational privacy, data security and user choice while harming the rights and interests of Indian citizens.In its May 18 communication to WhatsApp, the ministry has once again told the messaging platform to withdraw its privacy policy 2021, and also flagged WhatsApp’s discriminatory treatment of Indian users vis-a-vis users in Europe.“As you are doubtlessly aware, many Indian citizens depend on WhatsApp to communicate in everyday life. It is not just problematic but also irresponsible for WhatsApp to leverage this position to impose unfair terms and conditions on Indian users, particularly those that discriminate against Indian users vis-a-vis users in Europe,” as per the communication.The sources noted that WhatsApp had earlier claimed that it officially deferred its new privacy policy beyond May 15, 2021. However, the ministry in its communication has asserted that deferral of the privacy policy beyond May 15 does not absolve WhatsApp from respecting the values of informational privacy, data security and user choice for Indian users.It has highlighted that the changes to the privacy policy and the manner of introducing the changes including by way of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) undermines the values of privacy, data security and user choice. The ministry has also taken the same stand in the Delhi High Court, where this matter is sub-judice, the sources pointed out.The WhatsApp spokesperson, in a statement, said the company’s goal is to provide information about new options it is building that people will have—to message a business on WhatsApp—in the future.“While the majority of users who have received the new terms of service have accepted them, we appreciate some people haven’t had the chance to do so yet. No accounts were deleted on May 15 because of this update and no one in India lost functionality of WhatsApp either,” the spokesperson added.The spokesperson also said WhatsApp will follow up with reminders to people over the next several weeks.In January this year, WhatsApp had informed users about the changes in its terms of service and public policy through an in-app notification. Users were initially given time till February 8 to agree to the new terms in order to continue using the platform.According to WhatsApp, the key updates include more information about its service and how it processes user data; how businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats; and how WhatsApp partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the company products.WhatsApp also insisted that the acceptance of the privacy policy update does not expand its ability to share user data with Facebook.  However, widespread criticism over WhatsApp’s alleged sharing of user information with Facebook had forced the messaging platform to postpone the February deadline to May 15.WhatsApp, in the past, has said it is open to answering any questions from the government on privacy and that it will continue to explain to users that their messages are end-to-end encrypted.Raj Ramachandran, Partner at J Sagar Associates, said that with the directive for withdrawal of the new privacy policy that came into effect from May 15, the matter seems to be taking an unusual turn.“It remains to be seen how the directive will be responded to within the prescribed timeline, given the diametrically opposite position being taken by both sides on the revised policy and its compliance with applicable laws. The option apparently given to users in other jurisdictions to opt out of the revised policy will also need to be explained,” Ramachandran said.A convincing response to implement the revised policy in line with other jurisdictions could augur well to help resolve the matter, he added.

20-05-2021||New Delhi||Toolkit controversy: BJP presents 'proof' of Rajeev Gowda's involvement, he calls it 'fake'||Amid the raging pandemic, the BJP continued its attack against the Congress party on the alleged "toolkit" to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi, presenting "evidence" of its involvement which the Opposition party trashed as "fake".BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra presented what he termed as "proof/evidence" of the Congress' "direct involvement" with the "toolkit", authored by "Saumya Varma" who he claimed was associated with Congress leader Rajeev Gowda."Friends yesterday Congress wanted to know who’s the Author of the toolkit.Please check the properties of the Paper.Author is Saumya Varma,Who’s Saumya Varma ...The evidences speak for themselves:Will Sonia Gandhi & Rahul Gandhi reply?"Gowda, however, said:"Let’s be clear We made a research note on Central Vista for the party It’s genuine & fact-based. I tweeted yesterday that “COVID19 toolkit" is FORGED & is a MADE in BJP product. Patra is showing metadata/author of a real document & attributing it to a fake"BJP Generel Secretary (Organisation) BL Santhosh said: "The more @INCIndia tries to salvage the wreckages the more it sinks . Tax payers money to IIM , IITs are for nation building . But here his entire team’s energies are for Breaking India under Rahul Gandhi"Attacking the Congress over a wide range of issues including services carried out by its youth wing, the BJP on Tuesday alleged that the Opposition party was trying to tarnish the country’s image through a “toolkit”.Patra claimed that Congress’ move to extend help to Covid patients was "more of a public relations exercise with the help of friendly journalists and influencers than a soulful endeavour.”Patra alleged that the Congress had created a "toolkit", wherein it named the coronavirus variant found in India as the “Modi variant” and thereby attempted to defame the PM.A document circulating on social media—with Congress' symbols and markings on it—was shared and cited by BJP leaders as an alleged call to arms by the party to its supporters.The document allegedly asked its readers to tarnish the PM's image and “erode his popularity”; suggested using phrases such as “Indian strain” and “Modi strain” for the variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and cited briefing foreign journalists over India’s mismanagement of the second wave of the coronavirus disease.The Congress has called the documents "concocted," and slammed the BJP, calling it “Bikul Jhooth Party”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toolkit-controversy-bjp-presents-proof-of-rajeev-gowdas-involvement-he-calls-it-fake-255231

20-05-2021||New Delhi||Cyclone Yaas to hit West Bengal-Odisha coast by May 26, says IMD||As a remnant of ‘Tauktae’ entered North India, bringing widespread rains to many parts of the region on Wednesday, a low-pressure area is likely to form in the Bay of Bengal around May 22 that will develop into a cyclonic storm on May 25 to reach the West Bengal-Odisha coasts around May 26 evening. Experts say tropical cyclones are becoming fiercer, quicker, and frequent due to climate change. Even as the western coast continued to reel under the impact of the fury of rains and winds, the effect of ‘Tuaktae’ was felt as far as northwest India where its remnant interacted with a western disturbance on Wednesday to bring “fairly widespread to widespread rains in the region”.Heavy to very heavy rains were experienced in Uttarakhand along with Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, northeast Rajasthan, and north Madhya Pradesh, the IMD said. It will move further into Uttar Pradesh before dissipating in the next 48 hours.Meanwhile, the southwest monsoon is expected to advance over the south Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal around May 21 in association with the strengthening and deepening of south-westerly winds over the region.Other atmospheric and oceanic conditions like conducive environment for convection, sea surface temperatures are also favourable, IMD says.Hence, low-pressure area (LPA) is very likely to form over the north Andaman Sea and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal around May 22. This LPA is “very likely” to intensify into a cyclonic storm in the subsequent 72 hours and move north-westwards and reach West Bengal-Odisha coasts around May 26 evening. Sea conditions will be rough to very rough and an advisory has been issued to fishermen. The IMD says winds will gain speed becoming “gale wind speed during May 24 and 26 over major parts of central Bay of Bengal, north Bay of Bengal and along and off Odisha-West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts between May 25 and 27.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-yaas-to-hit-west-bengal-odisha-coast-by-may-26-says-imd-255210
20-05-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Kejriwal doesn’t speak for India, says EAM after Singapore envoy objects to remarks||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19Singapore reserved the right to prosecute Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over his “unfounded assertions” on Facebook and Twitter, Singapore High Commissioner Simon Wong said here on Wednesday.“We reserve the right to invoke the ‘Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act’ (POFMA) on some of the comments and assertions made by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal,” Wong told journalists when asked about the lack of apology from Kejriwal and Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia claiming that the Singapore Education Minister had warned of a Covid strain particularly impacting children.The Singapore envoy appreciated the “crystal clear” clarifications by the Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar and MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi and said it was time to turn the page. He noted that Jaishankar had conveyed that Singapore and India are solid partners in the fight against Covid, that the Delhi CM does not speak for India and the comments made are irresponsible.Kejriwal’s statement that a very dangerous “Singapore strain” of Covid could most affect children had from Tuesday night morphed into a unique diplomatic battle in which the Indian and Singapore Foreign Ministries vied to put down his claim.The MEA, in an admission that is rare, acknowledged publicly that its envoy was summoned for a demarche by the Singapore Foreign Office.Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan also took to the social media to state that there is “no truth whatsoever in the assertions". There is no truth in the assertion that there is a new COVID strain in Singapore. Phylogenetic testing has shown that the B.1.617.2 variant is the prevalent strain in many of the COVID cases, including in children, in recent weeks in Singapore.https://t.co/uz0mNPNxlE https://t.co/Vyj7gyyzvJ  Minutes later, Jaishankar appreciated Singapore’s role as a logistics hub and oxygen supplier but took on Kejriwal for “irresponsible comments from those who should know better.’’Also read: Pointing out that such comments can damage long-standing partnerships, Jaishankar said “the Delhi CM does not speak for India”.Balakrishnan responded by thanking Jaishankar and calling upon all sides to “focus on resolving the situation in our respective countries and helping one another”.There was no talk, however, on assessing whether the strain was actually that dangerous as claimed by Kejriwal to merit a shutdown of flights between the two countries, as suggested by him. Singapore has stuck to an official line that says the dominant strain of Covid is of B.1.617.2 which came from India. However, irresponsible comments from those who should know better can damage long-standing partnerships. So, let me clarify- Delhi CM does not speak for India.  However, it emerges that the Singapore Ministry of Health had called the B.1.617.2 as an “Indian variant”. In a press release on May 4, it had spoken of identifying 60 new cases in Singapore of which there were “seven local cases with B.1.617.2 (Indian) variant”. It is not known whether the Indian mission in Singapore had pushed back against the Singapore Ministry of Health terming the strain as an Indian variant.Almost the entire western media has termed B.1.617.2 as an “Indian strain” though the political leadership such as the UK Health Minister Matt Hancock or US Secretary of State Joe Biden has never linked this variant to India.There is heightened sensitivity among governments about linking any strain of the Covid virus to their nations after Beijing aggressively pushed back against attempts to brand Covid as the “Chinese virus”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kejriwal-doesnt-speak-for-india-says-eam-after-singapore-envoy-objects-to-remarks-255207
