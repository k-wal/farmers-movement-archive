The BKS's statement is to be understood in this background, where because of the ongoing widespread farmers' movement, it is finding that its support base is eroding rapidly,” SKM claimed. The SKM also asked the BKS to appeal to the government to fulfill the farmers' demands, “instead of proving itself as the anti-farmer government ever in independent India”. The umbrella body of farmers unions said that the movement is “running on truth and non-violence and will complete six months of its historical struggle tomorrow” and urged all Indians to celebrate and mark Buddha Poornima tomorrow, “so that truth and non-violence find a strong place back in our community, at the time when attempts are being made to erode these basic values in our society”.“The repeated attempts of the BJP government(s) to portray the movement as violent have failed again and again. Farmers have only strengthened themselves with peace and non-violence throughout this struggle,” it said. The BKS had claimed that the “real intent of those sitting at Delhi’s borders in the name of farmers was demonstrated when they spread fear and terror in the most undemocratic way on January 26”. BKS general secretary Badri Narayan Choudhary said the entire farming community is “feeling angry and questioning that who gave these people the right to defame farmers in such a way”.“Ever since the inception of this so-called farmer’ agitation, genuine farmers are ashamed of the undemocratic, anti-people way of these so-called farmer leaders who are being financed by anti-India agencies outside India and terrorising people with the help of terrorist elements”, said the leader of the farmers’ organisation associated with the Sangh.Choudhary said that the BKS had objected to the “presence of anti-social, anarchic elements in this agitation from day one itself” and that “after January 26, it was confirmed that the so-called farmers' agitation has been completely hijacked by anti-social, anti-democracy and anarchic people”.“Last month, a farmer’s young daughter from WB was gang-raped at the agitation site and pushed to death. The so-called farmer's leaders tried to destroy evidence. Perhaps now to divert and silence the investigation, these pressure tactics are being adopted. This is a usual practice among ultra-left and anti-democratic activists,” he alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/skm-slams-rss-affiliate-bhartiya-kisan-sangh-for-baseless-allegations-against-protesting-farmers-258292
25-05-2021||---||SC stays Allahabad HC order granting anticipatory bail over Covid death fear||New Delhi, May 25 The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed "sweeping" directions issued by Allahabad High Court, which had granted anticipatory bail to an accused in a cheating case observing that apprehension of death due to Covid-19 infection can be a valid ground for granting the relief.A Vacation Bench headed by Justice Vineet Sharan said courts shall not consider the directions issued by the high court on May 10 for grant of anticipatory bail to accused in other cases. "Sweeping directions have been made, we therefore direct the same to be stayed and the courts shall not consider the directions to grant anticipatory bail to accused in other cases and must consider merits of each case," the top court said.It appointed senior advocate V Giri as amicus curiae to assist it to decide if Covidcan be a ground for grant of anticipatory bail.The top court passed the order on an appeal filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the May 10 order of the Allahabad High Court after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that accused Prateek Jain -- given anticipatory bail till January 2022 -- had 130 cases pending against him. It also issued notice to Jain.The HC order had been relied on in many other cases and several other accused had been seeking anticipatory bail on the same ground, Mehta pointed out.The top court also stayed a Rajasthan High Court's controversial order restraining the police from arresting accused charged under offence punishable with a maximum sentence of up to three years till July 17 and not to list pre-arrest bail applications before the High Court as well as Sessions Court.In a rare move, the Rajasthan High Court itself approached the Supreme Court against its own single judge's order to the DGP not to arrest such accused.The high court challenged the order on the ground that the direction will "create a situation of lawlessness" and that it ignored the settled principle of law that Chief Justice is the "Master of Roster" of the HC.The single judge "erroneously violated" the principle of law, rulings and conventions by "interfering into the exclusive administrative jurisdiction of the Chief Justice", the Rajasthan High Court submitted through its Registrar General.The Rajasthan government supported the high court's submissions and said the order needed to be stayed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-allahabad-hc-order-granting-anticipatory-bail-over-covid-death-fear-258288

It is fixed on the basis of variety of experiments, tests and discussions by experts,” the Bench said.The Bench also said that it was not going to direct the Niti Aayog and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to consider the representations made to them by the petitioners as officials of both were busy dealing with Covid-19 and black fungus.“On every whimsical idea of petitioners, we cannot direct the respondents (Centre, ICMR and Niti Aayog) to decide representations, unless the facts of the case warrant the same,” it said.The court said that if the instant petition was allowed, everyone would come to court with suggestions regarding medicines and their dosage to be provided to patients across the country.It said the instant plea was not a PIL, rather it was a publicity interest litigation and directed the petitioners to deposit the cost of Rs 25,000 within four weeks.

The parties shall also have liberty to raise such contentions before the high court," the top court said, clarifying that "We are not passing any order on merits."The high court had on May 21 ordered the shifting of two ministers, a TMC MLA and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee to house arrest from jail.Initially, a special CBI court had granted them interim bail on May 17 within hours of their arrest but it was stayed by the High Court after 10 pm.Later, a Division Bench of Calcutta High court Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijeet Banerjee delivered a split verdict on the issue of recalling the stay on bail to the four accused. The matter was then referred to a five-judge Bench."A Special Bench is assigned to protect liberty. This is for the first time that a Special Bench was assigned to take away liberty," Justice Gavai noted.West Bengal Transport Minister Firhad Hakim, Panchayat Minister Subrata Mukherjee, TMC MLA Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee were arrested by the CBI on May 17 in connection with the Narada sting tape case that is being investigated by the agency on a 2017 order of the high court.The CBI had sought a transfer of the case from the present court dealing with it, citing a threat to the probe agency on the ground that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, TMC ministers, leaders and workers sat on a dharna outside the probe agency’s office at Nizam palace in Kolkata and caused creating an atmosphere of fear.The CBI accused the state law minister and his supporters of barging into the special court complex where the bail pleas of the four arrested TMC leaders were heard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narada-scam-cbi-withdraws-from-sc-its-plea-against-allowing-tmc-leaders-house-arrest-258249
25-05-2021||New Delhi||74th World Health Assembly: India bats for implementation of independent Covid-19 panel’s recommendations||Days after the independent panel on Covid-19 said the WHO could have sounded the alarm on the pandemic sooner, India late on Monday noted that future decision making on the issue should be informed by the guidance of the panel and of other high-level review mechanisms established over the past year to review global response to Covid.Chairing the 74th session of the World Health Assembly virtually, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who is head of the WHO executive board, said, “The Executive Board stressed that the findings of the three review mechanisms – Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, Chair of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations 2005 during Covid-19 Response, and Chair of the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme and decided that these should  inform future decision-making and member states needed to play a pivotal role in guiding the secretariat’s translation of those findings into policy action.”The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) formed last May unveiled its findings on May 12 and said the pandemic was preventable and the WHO could have sounded the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) alarm sooner.The panel recommended establishment of a new global system for surveillance, based on full transparency by all parties and for the World Health Assembly to give the WHO explicit authority to publish information about outbreaks with pandemic potential without requiring the prior approval of national governments. The independent panel also said that legally binding International Health regulations (2005) served to constrain rather than facilitate rapid action, the definition of a new suspected outbreak with pandemic potential needs to be refined. Besides, it asked WTO and WHO to convene major vaccine-producing countries and manufacturers to agree to voluntary licensing and technology transfer for Covid-19 vaccines and establish a high-level Global Health Threats Council led by government heads.Vardhan on Tuesday also emphasised health emergencies saying the WHO executive board engaged in wide-ranging and in-depth discussions on Covid-19 impact on global health and noted the importance of guaranteeing equitable access for all to Covid-19 medicines and vaccines to ensure that they are considered as global public goods.“The Board recommended that the 74th World Health Assembly must consider the report on mental health preparedness and response for the Covid-19 pandemic and endorse the updated comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan for the period of 2013 to 2030,” Vardhan said.The WHO board has further recommended that the 74th World Health Assembly adopt a decision to present an implementation road map for the global action plan for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases during the period 2013 to 2030 and draft a global strategy to tackle oral diseases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/74th%C2%A0world-health-assembly-india-bats-for-implementation-of-independent-covid-19-panels-recommendations-258246
25-05-2021||New Delhi||Don't panic by colour of fungus, look for causes, risks: Experts advise as mucormycosis cases rise||Amid rising mucormycosis cases among Covid patients and those who have recovered from it, epidemiologists Tuesday advised people to not get panicked by the colour of the fungus causing it, and underlined the importance of analysing the kind of infection, its causes and associated risk-factors.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said on Monday that 18 states have reported 5,424 cases of mucormycosis, a life-threatening infection, prevalent among Covid-19 patients and those who recovered from the viral disease.Beside Black Fungus cases, White and Yellow fungus infections too were reported from different parts of the country recently, which scientists say are also mucormycosis.Dr Samiran Panda, the Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the use of "terms like black, green or yellow fungus" is making people scared and apprehensive.Also, black fungus getting synonymous with existing mucormycosis is complicating things, he said. "For common people," he told PTI, "I will say not to be driven by panic by colour—black, yellow, white. Let us find what kind of fungal infection is the person infected with as most fungal infections that cause fatal or severe disease are invasive fungal infection so that can occur when there is reduction or compromise in immunity. "So basic underlying phenomenon is immunity or the ability to fight the fungal infection," he said.In Ghaziabad, a person was detected with three variants of the fungus—Black, White and Yellow—on May 24, claimed a doctor of a private hospital who is treating the 59-year-old patient in the NCR city in Uttar Pradesh.Yellow Fungus has been observed in reptiles, such as lizards, but not in human beings, claimed Dr B P Tyagi, an ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) specialist at Harsh Hospital in city's Raj Nagar area."The patient had come to me with conditions of extreme weakness, giddiness, fever and nasal discharge. The Yellow Fungus was detected during the endoscopy," the doctor told PTI."This is the first case of a person having three variants of the fungus—Black, White and Yellow," he claimed.He said the patient, a lawyer by profession, had Covid-19 but was in home isolation and approached the hospital after enduring these problems for eight to 10 days. "He is under treatment now. There is nothing to worry and the fungus would be removed. Had he come to me after one or two days' only, his problem would have been resolved by now," Tyagi said.He said fungi attack people with compromised immunity and in this particular case, his patient is a diabetic. Asked about the Yellow Fungus case, ICMR's Dr Panda said the specimen has to be studied to ensure it indeed was yellow fungus which is seen in reptiles.Professor Dr. Giridhara R Babu, the head of Life-course Epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, said it is important to identify the cause and risk-factors associated with fungal infections."When a disease such as mucormycosis exists in a community, what kind of investigations are we doing? As an epidemiologist, I am interested in identifying the particular cause of it, then what is the set of causes that will result in a condition like this, the reason it was not seen in the first wave, and it has been seen in the second wave only," he said. Babu also said it needs to be understood why some people are more prone to the fungal infection and what is the reason behind rising cases."In the second wave, there are some unusual things happening which were not there in the first wave such as the use of industrial oxygen. There are also variants of coronavirus in the second wave," he said.He said viral and fungal infections are always around, but most people don't get impacted because of their good immunity or less infective nature of the virus or the fungus."...but if that changes,and they become more infective or our immunity reduces then we are at a higher risk. What I will definitely call for is one can buy tons of antifungal agents, but if you don't find what is the cause and risk-factors leading to this, then we will not be able to solve it. I think that is where we should focus as a country," he said.AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria has also said that it is better to identify mucormycosis by its name rather than by the colour."Labelling the same fungus with names of different colors can create confusion. Mucormycosis is not a communicable disease, unlike Covid-19. About 90-95 per cent of patients getting infected with mucormycosis are found to have been either diabetic and/or taking steroids. This infection is seen very rarely in those who are neither diabetic nor taking steroids," he had told reporters recently.He had said in general, there are various types of fungal infections such as candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Mucormycosis, candida and aspergillosis are the ones observed more in those with low immunity, he said. Guleria had also said no definite link of mucormycosis has been seen with oxygen therapy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-panic-by-colour-of-fungus-look-for-causes-risks-experts-advise-as-mucormycosis-cases-rise-258242

25-05-2021||New Delhi||Mild Covid-19 induces lasting antibody protection, study finds||Months after recovering from mild cases of Covid-19, people still have immune cells which produce antibodies against the novel coronavirus, according to a study.The researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, US, noted that such cells could persist for a lifetime, churning out antibodies all the while.The study, published on Monday in the journal Nature, suggests that mild cases of Covid-19 leave those infected with lasting antibody protection and that repeated bouts of illness are likely to be uncommon."Last fall, there were reports that antibodies wane quickly after infection with the virus that causes Covid-19, and mainstream media interpreted that to mean that immunity was not long-lived," said senior author of the study Ali Ellebedy, an associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine."But that's a misinterpretation of the data. It's normal for antibody levels to go down after acute infection, but they don't go down to zero; they plateau," Ellebedy said.The researchers found antibody-producing cells in people 11 months after first symptoms.These cells will live and produce antibodies for the rest of people's lives, and that's strong evidence for long-lasting immunity, they said.During a viral infection, antibody-producing immune cells rapidly multiply and circulate in the blood, driving antibody levels sky-high.Once the infection is resolved, most such cells die off, and blood antibody levels drop.A small population of antibody-producing cells, called long-lived plasma cells, migrate to the bone marrow and settle in, the researchers said.In the bone marrow, these cells continually secrete low levels of antibodies into the bloodstream to help guard against another encounter with the virus, they said.Ellebedy and colleagues were already working on a project to track antibody levels in blood samples from Covid-19 survivors.The team had enrolled 77 participants who were giving blood samples at three-month intervals starting about a month after initial infection.Most participants had had mild cases of Covid-19, only six had been hospitalised.The researchers obtained bone marrow from 18 of the participants seven or eight months after their initial infections.Five of them came back four months later and provided a second bone marrow sample.For comparison, the scientists also obtained bone marrow from 11 people who had never had Covid-19.They found that antibody levels in the blood of the Covid-19 participants dropped quickly in the first few months after infection and then mostly levelled off, with some antibodies detectable even 11 months after infection.Fifteen of the 19 bone marrow samples from people who had Covid-19 contained antibody-producing cells specifically targeting the virus that causes Covid-19, the researchers said.Such cells could still be found four months later in the five people who came back to provide a second bone-marrow sample, they said.According to the researchers, none of the 11 people who had never had Covid-19 had such antibody-producing cells in their bone marrow."People with mild cases of Covid-19 clear the virus from their bodies two to three weeks after infection, so there would be no virus driving an active immune response seven or 11 months after infection," Ellebedy said."These cells are not dividing.

These notices were served around 8-9 days ago based on a complaint received from Congress. They were asked to join the probe so that it could help us in carrying the investigation forward,” the officer said.A preliminary inquiry into the complaint is still being carried out by the Delhi Police’s Special Cell team and no FIR has been registered in the matter yet, officials said.On Monday, the Delhi Police’s Special Cell sent a notice to Twitter India in connection with the probe into a complaint about the alleged “Covid toolkit”, asking it to share information based on which it had classified a related tweet by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra as “manipulated media”, officials had said.Delhi Police teams descend on two Twitter offices as notice issued in connection with 'Covid toolkit' probeThe police teams also descended on the microblogging site’s offices in Lado Sarai in Delhi and in Gurgaon Monday evening. “The Delhi police team went to the Twitter office to serve a notice to Twitter as a part of routine process. This was necessitated as we wanted to ascertain who is the right person to serve a notice, as replies by Twitter India MD have been very ambiguous,” Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal had said.Curious case of the toolkit The BJP has accused the Congress of creating a “toolkit” on how to tarnish the image of the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the Congress has denied the allegation and claimed that the BJP is propagating a fake “toolkit” to defame it.Last week, Twitter labelled as “manipulated media” a tweet by Patra on the alleged “toolkit”. Twitter says it “may label Tweets that include media (videos, audio, and images) that have been deceptively altered or fabricated”.Biswal said the Delhi Police is inquiring into a complaint in the toolkit matter. “It appears that Twitter has some information which is not known to us and on the basis of which they have classified it (Patra’s tweet) as such. This information is relevant to the inquiry. The Special Cell, which is conducting the inquiry, wants to find out the truth. Twitter, which has claimed to know the underlying truth, should clarify,” he said.The government had earlier asked Twitter to remove the “manipulated media” tag as the matter is pending before law enforcement agency, and made it clear that the social media platform cannot pass judgment when the issue is under investigation.BJP leaders, including Patra, have posted numerous tweets to attack the Congress over the purported “toolkit”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-congress-leaders-get-delhi-police-notices-to-join-probe-in-covid-toolkit-case-258237

The introduction of the Goonda Act at a place like the island, where the crime rate is relatively low and harassing people by using it to take action against those people who protested during the CAA and NRC. Also the way the quarantine rules was imposed there also led to spread of Covid. Also the act of deleting beef from the menu and the revoking of prohibition rules have all caused unrest and these things should not happen," said Chandy.Meanwhile the new Leader of Opposition in Kerala Assembly VD Satheesan on Tuesday wrote a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah demanding that Patel be called back as he his acts have badly affected the islanders.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-are-aware-of-whats-happening-in-lakshadweep-kerala-hc-258236

URCs of those units that are likely to be affected by rotational movements should be exempted from the merger, a letter issued by the Quartermaster General's Branch at Army Headquarters to the establishments of all three services on May 24 states.Based on the recommendations by a board of officers (BOO) comprising all stakeholders, formation commanders, local military authorities and station commanders will have the leeway to nominate the merged URC, which should be centrally located so that it is convenient for all to commute, the letter adds. Station Canteens for ex-servicemen can continue in accordance with the BOO’s recommendations.The letter also states that all URCs in suspended animation shall retain their names and URC Codes, but the supporting CSD depots shall not process any demands received from such URCs. Pro-rata portion of profit will be shared with the units of URCs kept in suspended animation under supervision of the headquarters concerned.Last year the Minister of State for Defence, Shripad Naik, had stated in Parliament that while the government has not given any orders for closure of URCs. merger of URCs is a periodic process based on the number of beneficiaries in the area, proximity to other URCs and organisational efficiency. All efforts are made to ensure that there is no inconvenience to the clientele, including ex-servicemen, he had further stated.Solely owned by the Ministry of Defence, CSD is the most profitable retail chain in India, selling a wide variety of products like groceries, household appliances, liquor, vehicles, cosmetic and sports equipment at subsidized rates to serving and retired armed forces personnel and civilians employed in defence establishments.It has 34 depots and 3,809 URCs located across India and an inventory of over 4,000 products sourced from 436 companies. A significant amount of profit is generated by CSD out of which 50 per cent is deposited into the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI). For the 2019-20 fiscal, the amount deposited in CFI was 384.5 crore.  Last year the sale of directly imported items, including liquor, in CSD canteens was stopped. As many as 422 such items were taken off the CSD’s inventory in a bid to promote indigenously manufactured products.More recently, CSD has started online purchase for ‘Against Firm Demand (AFD)’ items, that include items such as vehicles and high end appliances. All purchases of AFD items are now being made through CSD’s online portal.CSD has also had its share of functional problems such as inadequate budgetary support, non-availability of certain products, pilferage of goods and delays in processing demands from clientele.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-to-merge-csd-canteens-of-static-units-located-in-same-station-258224

We are very cognizant of the sentiments of the Tamil people and Tamil culture and have nothing but the utmost love and respect towards our Tamil people," the filmmaker duo said.Nidimoru and DK insisted that they have presented a "sensitive, balanced, and riveting story", which they are hopeful the audience will appreciate."We have put in years of hard work into this show, and we have taken great pains to bring to our audiences a sensitive, balanced, and riveting story—much like we did in season one of the show."We request everyone to wait and watch the show when it releases. We know you'll appreciate it once you watch it," they added.Thangaraj, in his letter to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday, claimed the show "intentionally undermined" the historical struggle of the Eelam Tamils."A serial loaded with insults and insinuations against the glorious Tamil culture could never be considered as the one having any broadcasting value."Branding Tamil speaking actress Samantha as a terrorist in the serial is directly an attack on the pride of Tamils living around the world and no one will tolerate this kind of motivated and mischievous campaign," he said.Earlier, Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) Founder Seeman has also demanded a ban on the show for portraying Tamils in negative light. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-utmost-respect-towards-tamil-people-the-family-man-2-directors-amid-boycott-calls-in-tn-258213

Chandra and Special Secretary in MHA, VSK Kaumudi -- were discussed in the meeting.The CBI had got an acting Director in the form of Praveen Sinha after the term of R.K. Shukla ended on February 3 this year.After the DoPT chooses the names of at least three or four officers for the CBI Director's post, they are sent to the selection committee comprising the Prime Minister, the CJI and the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, which decides the final pick for a fixed term of two years.

The Delhi Police's Special Cell on Monday sent a notice to Twitter India in connection with the probe into a complaint about the alleged 'Covid toolkit', asking it to share information based on which it had classified a related tweet by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra as "manipulated media", officials said.The BJP had accused the Congress of creating a 'toolkit' that seeks to tarnish the image of the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the handling of the Covid pandemic.However, the Congress denied the allegation and claimed that the BJP is propagating a fake 'toolkit' to defame it.Last week, Twitter labelled as "manipulated media" a tweet by Patra on the alleged 'toolkit'.Twitter says it "may label Tweets that include media (videos, audio, and images) that have been deceptively altered or fabricated".

25-05-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp won't limit functionality for users, assures 'privacy remains highest priority'||WhatsApp on Monday said it will not limit the functionality for users not agreeing to its new privacy policy but will continue to remind users about the update, and “maintain this approach” till the forthcoming data protection law comes into effect.Days after the government directed the messaging platform to withdraw its new privacy policy, a WhatsApp spokesperson said the company has responded to the letter and has “assured” that the privacy of users remains the highest priority for the Facebook-owned entity.The spokesperson, in an emailed statement, said the company will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works in the coming weeks.“Instead, we will continue to remind users from time to time about the update...We hope this approach reinforces the choice that all users have whether or not they want to interact with a business. We will maintain this approach until at least the forthcoming PDP (Personal Data Protection) law comes into effect,” the spokesperson added.The spokesperson reiterated that the recent update does not change the privacy of people's personal messages.“Its purpose is to provide additional information about how people can interact with businesses if they choose to do so,” the spokesperson added.On May 18, the government had ordered WhatsApp to withdraw its controversial privacy policy update, saying the changes undermine the sacrosanct values of privacy, data security and harms the rights and interests of Indian citizens.According to sources, WhatsApp had been warned that necessary steps in accordance with the law will be taken if a satisfactory response was not received within seven days.A person privy to the development said WhatsApp had responded to the government's letter on May 22. In its letter, the IT Ministry had drawn attention to WhatsApp as to how its new privacy policy was a violation of several provisions of the existing Indian laws and rules.A raging debate had ensued earlier this year after WhatsApp said it will update its terms of service and privacy policy around how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant's products.WhatsApp—which has 53 crore users in India as per the government data—had faced severe backlash over user concerns that data was being shared with parent company, Facebook.Last week, WhatsApp had told the Delhi High Court that while its new privacy policy has come into effect from May 15, it would not start deleting accounts of those users who have not accepted it and would try to encourage them to get on board.The platform had said there was no universal or uniform time limit after which it will start to delete accounts as each user would be dealt with on a case-to-case basis.In its May 18 communication to WhatsApp, the ministry had told the messaging platform to withdraw its privacy policy 2021 and also flagged WhatsApp's 'discriminatory treatment' of Indian users vis-a-vis users in Europe.It has highlighted that the changes to the privacy policy and the manner of introducing the changes including by way of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) undermine the values of privacy, data security, and user choice.In January this year, WhatsApp had informed users about the changes in its terms of service and public policy through an in-app notification. Users were initially given time till February 8 to agree to the new terms in order to continue using the platform.WhatsApp has insisted that the acceptance of the privacy policy update does not expand its ability to share user data with Facebook.However, widespread criticism over WhatsApp's alleged sharing of user information with Facebook had forced the messaging platform to postpone the February deadline to May 15.WhatsApp, in the past, has said it is open to answer any questions from the government on privacy and that it will continue to explain to users that their messages are end-to-end encrypted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whatsapp-wont-limit-functionality-for-users-assures-privacy-remains-highest-priority-258196

25-05-2021||New Delhi||Now, walk-in vaccines for everyone over 18||On-site registration and appointment have now been enabled for the 18-44 years age group on the CoWin platform for Covid-19 vaccination, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday.However, this feature is being enabled only for government Covid Vaccination Centers (CVCs) at present, it said.This feature will not be available for private CVCs and they will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments.This feature will be used only upon the decision of respective states and UT governments.States and UT must decide on the opening of onsite registrations/facilitated cohorts' registration and appointments for 18-44 years age group based on the local context just as an additional measure to minimize vaccine wastage and for facilitating vaccination of eligible beneficiaries in the age group of 18-44 years, the ministry said in its statement.The coverage of vaccination was expanded to people in the age group of 18 to 44 years on May 1 with the implementation of the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy.The facility of only online appointment mode initially to people in the age group of 18 to 44 years helped to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres, the statement.Based on various representations given by states and inputs received by ministry for the vaccination of 18-44 years age group, the Union government has now decided to provide facility of on-site registration/facilitated cohort registration on CoWIN digital platform for 18-44 years age group considering that in case of sessions exclusively organised with online slots, towards the end of the day, some doses may still be left unutilised in case the online appointee beneficiaries do not turn up on day of vaccination.In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimise the vaccine wastage, the statement said. Even though CoWIN provides for features such as registration of up to 4 beneficiaries with a mobile number, facilitated registration and appointments through applications, such as Arogya Setu and Umang and through the Common Service Centres etc., people requiring facilitated cohort's facility and those without access to internet or smart phones or mobile phones may still have limited access for vaccination."Therefore, the feature for on-site registration and appointment is now being enabled for the 18-44 years age group on CoWIN."However, this feature is being enabled only for Government Covid Vaccination Centers (CVCs), at the present moment in time," the ministry said.The Union Health Ministry has advised the states and UTs to issue clear instructions to all District Immunization Officers to strictly adhere to the decision of the respective state and UT Government regarding the extent and manner of using the on-site registration and appointment feature for 18 to 44 years age group, the statement said.Fully reserved sessions can also be organised for providing vaccination services to beneficiaries belonging to facilitated cohorts. Wherever such fully reserved sessions are organized, all efforts must also be made to mobilize such beneficiaries in sufficient numbers.The ministry has further advised states and UTs that abundant caution should be exercised and extreme due care should be taken while opening up on-site registration and appointment for 18-44 years age group, in order to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres, the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-walk-in-vaccines-for-everyone-over-18-258189

What we look like, how we dress, what we eat and how we live makes us no less Indian."We are proud to be a state in the Union of India where even in the interior most we greet each other with a 'Jai Hind' and primary school children even in the border villages sing 'Saare Jahaan se Achha, Hindustan Hamara' with pride, he said in his official twitter handle."The deputy CM sought an unconditional apology from the YouTuber for his remarks."I strongly condemn this racist and arrogant act of Mr Paras Singh (Bunty). Every Arunachalee and every right thinking Indian must condemn such prejudiced views. He must apologise unconditionally to the people of Arunachal Pradesh.@PemaKhanduBJP @KirenRijiju @ninong_erring," Mein added.Singh had apparently made the comments while reacting to a letter written by Ering to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wherein he had sought a ban on the relaunch of PUBG Mobile as Battlegrounds Mobile India.The Pasighat East MLA, when contacted, said he would soon file a case against Singh.Meanwhile, the All Arunachal Pradesh Students' Union (AAPSU) issued a statement to say that the people of the state are "greatly hurt" by the remarks."Such incidents are not isolated ones and have been happening time and again in various parts of the country."It is really distressing that even after over 70 years of the country's independence, people from the state and the northeast region in general still face humiliation in other parts of the country, whenever they go there for work or study," the joint statement by AAPSU president Hawa Bagang and general secretary Tabom Dai said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-pubg-gamer-booked-for-using-racial-slur-to-address-arunachal-mla-on-youtube-258188

The Bench said registration of unorganised workers should be completed as early as possible and there should be a common national database for all organised workers situated in different states. The process initiated by the Ministry of Labour and Employment for creating a national database for unorganised workers should be completed with collaboration and coordination of the states, which may serve registration for extending different schemes by states and the Centre.The top court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to file a detailed affidavit with regard to all these issues in two weeks. “We are further of the view that there should be suitable mechanisms to monitor and supervise whether the benefits of the welfare schemes reach the beneficiaries which may be from grassroots levels to the higher authorities with names and places of beneficiaries so that the purposes for such schemes are achieved,” the court said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-frowns-on-slow-registration-of-migrants-257962

BJP president JP Nadda, RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale and UP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal were present too.Sources said concerns were raised over the criticism faced by the BJP and the PM-CM duo over “ill-preparedness” during the second wave. A possible expansion in the state Cabinet and a role for former IAS officer Arvind Sharma is also learnt to have been discussed.Another suggestion was “building on the spirit of nationalism” by expanding on the successes under PM Modi such as the manufacture of two vaccines, DRDO drug and Covid home-testing kit, said sources.It was also advised that the BJP leaders should stay away from controversies and offer condolences to those who had lost their loved ones. It seems the leaders felt that if the party went to the polls in the current situation, it may suffer losses.Hundreds of people, including BJP leaders and their relatives, have lost their lives in the past over a month.

Chronic fatigue symptoms are also common. All this will require symptomatic treatment,” Guleria said.Referring to brain fog after Covid recovery — a condition marked by lack of concentration, insomnia and depression — the AIIMS chief said rehabilitation of Covid survivors was important.After a Ghaziabad patient was detected with “yellow fungus”, Guleria appealed to people not to identify fungal diseases by colour as it was creating confusion. He said the disease should be called by its name such as mucormycosis (better known as black fungus).Guleria said 95 per cent patients of mucormycosis had diabetes and were on steroids. He said people with high blood sugar and steroid use at homes were also getting mucormycosis. “So oxygen use linkage is not necessary for the disease,” the expert added, noting that Candida was another fungal infection affecting people and could spread to blood causing serious complications.“It is better to use direct names rather than colours for fungal infections. Also mucormycosis is not communicable. A majority of the people getting mucormycosis at AIIMS were in an early stage of Covid,” Guleria said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/watch-out-for-post-covid-signs-aiims-chief-to-docs-257972

It depends on the population density, history, geography and the boundaries,” she said.The CM said Shah, on hearing her argument, stated that “scientific views were taken into consideration” before arriving at such decisions.Mamata said about 10 lakh people were being shifted to safe locations in view of the cyclone, expected to hit the coastal states on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didi-alleges-bias-in-cyclone-relief-257968

25-05-2021||Saurabh Malik||191 cases pending against sitting, former MPs, MLAs||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 24Just about three months after the Punjab and Haryana High Court made clear its intent to speed up cases involving sitting and former parliamentarians and legislators of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, it was today told that no less than 191 cases were pending in the two states and the union territory.Out of the total, 163 cases were pending against sitting and former MPs and MLAs in Punjab. In Haryana, 21 cases, including eight against ex-MLAs of the state and two against ex-MLAs of Himachal Pradesh, are under trial. Three cases registered in Haryana had been transferred to the CBI, Chandigarh. As many as 15 out of the total were pending before the trial courts. Another six cases are pending before the appellate/revisional courts.Affidavits giving details of the cases were placed before the high court during the hearing of a suo motu case, “In Re: Special Courts for MPs/MLAs”, for monitoring the progress of cases pending against MPs and MLAs.Taking on record the affidavits, the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh made it clear to the subordinate courts in the two states and the UT that the hearing in these cases would not be adjourned without assigning reasons.The Bench observed the high court was monitoring the progress in cases of MPs and MLAs pending in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh after registering a suo motu case following the Supreme Court directions in the Ashwani Kumar Upadhyay case. Among other things, it said adjournment would not be granted except in exceptional circumstances and for reasons to be recorded.“Needless to observe that all courts in the three states shall comply with the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the Ashwani Kumar Upadhyay case (supra) in letter and spirit,” the Bench added.Before parting with the case, the Bench also questioned the UT on the reasons for delay in completing the investigation in the cases. The query came after the Bench was told that the seven pending cases were under investigation. Responding to the query, UT Senior Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Chahal submitted that investigation was slightly delayed due to the Covid-19 situation and an effort would be made to conclude the same at the earliest.The Bench has already appointed senior advocate Rupinder Khosla as the amicus curiae. The suggestion to set up special courts flows from recommendations of the Vohra committee set up in 1993 by the Central government. The committee was constituted under the chairmanship of the then Union Home Secretary, NN Vohra, to take stock of all available information about activities of crime syndicates/mafia organisations, which were allegedly being permitted by government functionaries and political personalities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/191-cases-pending-against-sitting-former-mps-mlas-257996

The order books of both Pfizer and Moderna are already full. So, it will depend on their surplus stocks as to how much they will provide to India. They will get back to the Government of India,” Joint Secretary, Health, Lav Agarwal said in response to Delhi and Punjab governments announcing that the two firms had refused to deal directly with the states saying they would engage only with the Centre.The Delhi Government today shut 400 inoculation sites meant for 18 to 44-year-olds saying vaccines were unavailable and talks with Moderna and Pfizer had failed.“Pfizer and Moderna have refused to sell directly to the Delhi Government and have said they are engaged with the Centre. Anticipating stock shortages, some countries even pre-booked the vaccines when these were still in the trial stage, but India did not take any such steps. I urge the Centre not to make the Covid vaccine programme a joke. Approve Pfizer and Moderna at war footing rather than asking states to approach these companies directly," Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said.Delhi also closed down centres administering Covaxin to people aged 45 and above after stocks were exhausted.The Ministry of Health, meanwhile, shifted the onus of planning on states saying Covishield and Covaxin shots produced today took eight days to be supplied to states and states must plan as per supply schedules shared by the Centre daily.“Covishield production is roughly 6.5 crore a month and Covaxin averages about 1.5 crore a month. But the 8 crore vaccine doses are not immediately available for further distribution to states. Stability studies are done, which takes a week. Then the stocks are tested at the Central Drug Laboratory, Kasauli, which takes a day. What is produced today will take eight days to become available. The states must micro-plan vaccination sites,” Agarwal said.So far, 19.60 crore doses have been administered in India, 15.29 crore of these as first dose. Of all, 14.56 crore have been given to 45-plus and 1.06 crore to 18 to 44-year-olds. India has not yet reached even the targeted 30 crore coverage for health, frontline, 60-plus people and 45 to 59-year-olds with comorbidities.Meanwhile, a record 4,454 daily deaths were seen today with the toll crossing 3 lakh to settle at 3,03,720, though daily cases (2,22,315) were the lowest in 40 days and recovery rate improved to 87.7 per cent from a low of 81.7 per cent on May 3. For 11 days, recoveries have been exceeding new cases and active cases have reduced from the May 10 peak of 37,45,237 to 27,20,716 today.Vaccine pushJaishankar in US on five-day visitNew Delhi, May 24External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar arrived in New York on Sunday for a five-day visit.

It is felt that these authorised vaccines will be mandatory in future for air travel between countries.The MEA has clarified that countries have their own requirements for approval, which in most cases involves travel by carrying a negative RT-PCR report.

Bharat Biotech informed the officials that it is in regular touch with regulatory authorities in these countries and are confident about the robustness of their dossier, as they have data for much longer duration – for antibody persistence after six months as well as eight months.

He is at present the director-general of police in Uttar Pradesh.Chandra, a 1985-batch IPS officer of the Bihar cadre, is at present posted as the director general of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), while Kaumudi, a 1986-batch IPS officer of the Andhra Pradesh cadre, is posted as the special secretary for internal security in the Home Ministry.The meeting of the high-powered committee, comprising Prime Minister Modi, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, started around 6:30 pm at the 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, the official residence of the Prime Minister, the sources said.During the 90-minute meeting, Chowdhury objected to the process of selection of officers for the coveted post of CBI director.“The way procedure was followed it was in conflict with the mandate of the committee. On 11th (May), I was given 109 names and today by 1 pm, 10 names were shortlisted and by 4 pm, six names were shortlisted.

25-05-2021|| Hyderabad||AP court sentences 11 notorious highway killers to death||Ongole District Court in Andhra Pradesh sentenced a notorious highway serial killer Munna and ten other gang members to death on Monday.  The gang used to stop vehicles on the highway posing as police officers and then killed the occupants. The district court found 18 people guilty for being involved in four such cases during 2018. Eleven have been sentenced to death and remaining to life and shorter jail terms. All the accused were found guilty of murdering seven persons in four cases in Ongole District. After killing lorry driver Ramasekhar and cleaner Perumal Subramani near Ulavapadu, the gang sold the 21.7 tons of iron in the lorry to a leading merchant in Guntur.The bodies of the driver and cleaner from Tamil Nadu were packed in gunny bags and buried on the banks of Inumanamelluru Gundlakammavagu in Kukki Maddipadu Mandal near Parkasham in Andhra Pradesh. After a complaint was lodged on October 17, 2008, by Veerappan Kuppuswamy, the lorry owner, whose 21.7 tons of iron was looted, the police swung into action, initially thinking that the driver and cleaner had stolen the goods. The police started on an investigative trail from Durgapur in West Bengal and, in the process, discovered that it was around Ongole that one gang of Syed Abdul Samad alias Munna gang was operative.During the trial, the police told the court that Munna tried to make preparations to flee the country. However, before he could do so, the police arrested him in the farmhouse of a former MLA in Karnataka and brought him to Ongole. The police investigation found that the Munna gang, disguised as policemen, used to stop vehicles on the highway under the pretext of checking. All accused gang members confessed to various acts of crime and after the trial, the court sentenced 11 people to death for murder and looted on the highway. The court had found all gang members guilty, but based on the charge sheet Munna and ten others were sentenced to death, life sentence has been given to four and seven years each to remaining.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ap-court-sentences-11-notorious-highway-killers-to-death-257765

This was necessitated as we wanted to ascertain who is the right person to serve a notice, as replies by Twitter India MD have been very ambiguous," Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal said.Earlier, official sources said that two teams of Special Cell had raided the Twitter India offices located in Delhi's Lado Sarai and in Gurgaon, on the outskirts of the national capital, in connection with the probe into the 'toolkit' matter.The Special Cell has sought a clarification from the microblogging site for classifying a related tweet by BJP leader Sambit Patra as "manipulated", an official said.It appears that Twitter has some information that is not known to the police. This information is relevant to the inquiry, Biswal said.Earlier, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had written to Twitter and objected to its act of tagging some of the posts on an alleged Congress “toolkit” against the Modi government, as “manipulated media”. It had asked Twitter to remove the tag as the matter is pending investigation before a law enforcement agency.“Twitter unilaterally chose to go ahead and designate certain tweets as ‘Manipulated’, pending investigation by the law enforcement agency. This action not only dilutes the credibility of Twitter as a neutral and unbiased platform facilitating the exchange of views by the users but also puts a question mark on the status of Twitter as an ‘intermediary’,” the Ministry said in its communication.BJP had on May 18 slammed Congress for its “toolkit on Covid-19 pandemic”. Addressing the media BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that the toolkit has instructions for social media volunteers of Congress to call the new Covid-19 mutant “Indian strain” or “Modi strain” against the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) instructions.The Congress on its part vehemently denied the allegations and wrote to Delhi Police Commissioner seeking registration of FIR against BJP President JP Nadda, Union Minister Smriti Irani, party spokesperson Sambit Patra, party leader BL Santhosh and others alleging that they had shared “forged and fabricated documents with the intent to create communal disharmony and civil unrest” and to “divert attention from Modi government’s failure in providing necessary aid to people amidst the current pandemic”.— Agencies/TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-teams-descend-on-two-twitter-offices-as-notice-issued-in-connection-with-covid-toolkit-probe-257759

25-05-2021||New Delhi||HC asks drug controller to inquire into Gambhir, other politicians buying Covid medicines in bulk||The Delhi High court Monday directed the drug controller to inquire into the issue of politicians buying Covid-19 drugs in bulk amid shortages and observed that while BJP MP Gautam Gambhir must have been distributing the medicines to the best of his intention, the gesture unintentionally did a disservice.The high court also directed the Drug Controller of Delhi government to conduct a similar inquiry into the allegations of procuring and hoarding medical oxygen made against AAP MLAs Priti Tomar and Praveen Kumar and file a status report.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the Drug Controller shall examine how it is possible for someone to procure over 2,000 strips of a medicine, Fabiflu here, which is already in shortage and how the chemist was able to entertain such a prescription.“Mr Gautam Gambhir must have done it with best of intentions. We are not doubting his intentions. He has been a national player of our country. Our question is whether it is a responsible behaviour when you the medicine is in short supply.“We are not doubting his intentions but the way he has gone about it, he has actually done a disservice, unintentionally may be. This was not the way that you buy from the market so many strips, certainly not,” the bench said.The high court was hearing a PIL seeking lodging of an FIR on the allegations that politicians are able to procure in huge quantity and distribute Covid-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them.An application was also filed in the pending petition making allegations against MLAs Tomar and Kumar.The bench perused the status report of Delhi Police which said that Gambhir had purchased 2,628 strips of Fabiflu, used for treating Covid-19 patients, on the prescription of Dr Manish of Sanjay Garg Hospital and while 2,343 strips were distributed to patients, the remaining 285 strips were deposited with Delhi government's Director General of Health Services for distribution, given court's earlier order.“The aspect which needs to be examined is how such a large quantity of Fabiflu was authorized to be purchased in retail as the medicine was in grave short supply at the relevant time. We can take judicial notice of this fact as we have been hearing this matter for a considerable time now.“It also needs examination as to how these medicines were distributed to several patients or attendants by Dr Manish of Sanjay Garg hospital,” the bench said, noting that the payment for the medicines was made through cricketer-turned-politician Gambhir's foundation.The court noted that through the supporting documents have not been filed by the police, the concerned DCP stated they have collected them during the enquiry.“We would like you (Drug Controller) to tell us what enquiry you have done. Here there is a very clear case made out. Tell us under what provisions action is required to be taken and against whom. All this has to be done by the Drug Controller and not by the Delhi Police, as per the Supreme Court's order,” the bench said.It added once the allegations have come to the knowledge of the Drug Controller, it cannot shut its eyes and asked it to look into Gambhir's incident.It said since the violation falls in the realm of drug controller, let the material collected be placed before the Drug Controller of Delhi which shall undertake the necessary enquiry and file a status report.Noting the submissions of the counsel for the Drug Controller, the bench said it appeared the Drug Controller is presently not well versed with its statutory powers in relation to enquiry or investigation or prosecution of cases and directed the Law Department of Delhi government to ensure that necessary expertise is provided and listed the matter for further hearing on May 31.Regarding other allegations raised by the petitioner's counsel, the bench said they are unsubstantiated, and it would not go into it otherwise it would amount to witch-hunting.The court had earlier said political leaders have no business hoarding stocks of Covid-19 medicines that are already in shortage, and they are expected to surrender these drugs.It had also expressed dissatisfaction over a "vague and whitewashed enquiry" report filed by the Delhi Police over the allegations against politicians hoarding and distributing medicines in the National Capital. Petitioner Deepak Singh, the chairperson of Hruduya Foundation and a national level shooter, has questioned how politicians can procure large stocks of the medicine without having the requisite permission under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, when the normal public was not getting it.Advocate Virag Gupta, representing Singh, said strict action be taken against the politicians, who were allegedly indulging in black marketing, as they cannot procure it in the absence of a licence.He claimed that photographs clearly show Gambhir was himself distributing medicines to people outside his office and not the doctor.Gambhir was neither a doctor nor a chemist or an authorized person to distribute medicines to patients, Gupta said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-drug-controller-to-inquire-into-gambhir-other-politicians-buying-covid-medicines-in-bulk-257734

25-05-2021||New Delhi||Post Vardhan letter, Ramdev retracts anti-allopathy remarks||Yoga guru Ramdev on Sunday withdrew his controversial remarks against allopathic drugs after Health Minister Harsh Vardhan wrote to him on the issue.“I respect all forms of medical science; allopathy has saved lives,” he said. Earlier, in a letter, Vardhan told Ramdev that his remarks about allopathic drugs and doctors could potentially weaken India’s fight against Covid.Describing Ramdev’s clarification as inadequate, the minister said, “All you have said in your clarification is that you have nothing against modern medicine and doctors. This is not adequate. I hope you will seriously introspect and retract your unfortunate statements.”Vardhan reacted a day after Indian Medical Association demanded that Ramdev be booked under the Epidemic Act, 1897, for terming anti-Covid 19 drugs as “useless” and claiming that lakhs died due to these drugs.“Citizens are hurt by your statements on allopathic drugs and doctors. I have in the past also conveyed these feelings to you. For people fighting Covid, doctors are like gods. You have through your statements not just undermined frontline warriors, but also hurt the sentiments of people. Your clarification has not helped,” Vardhan said.Referring to Ramdev’s remarks that lakhs of Covid patients had died after consuming allopathic medicines as unfortunate, Vardhan said, “Doctors, nurses and sanitation workers are putting their lives on the line to save others. Your remark that the allopathic system is a sham is unfortunate. Today if the case fatality rate in India is 1.13 per cent and recovery rate is 88 per cent, it is because of allopathic doctors,” he said. — TNS/PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-vardhan-letter-ramdev-retracts-anti-allopathy-remarks-257553
