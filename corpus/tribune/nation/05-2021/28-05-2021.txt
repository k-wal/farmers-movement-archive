This reduction will come into effect from June 1, it said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/airlines-can-operate-only-50-of-pre-covid-domestic-flights-from-june-1-govt-259917

Her absence from the PM’s meeting is murder of constitutional ethos & the culture of cooperative federalism,” he tweeted.Modi visited Odisha and West Bengal and held review meetings in both the states on the post-cyclone situation.While Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik attended the meeting with Modi, Banerjee skipped the review meeting in her state.She, however, submitted a report to the prime minister on the damage caused by Cyclone Yaas in the state, and sought a Rs 20,000-crore package for redevelopment of the worst-affected areas.As the West Bengal chief minister, Banerjee’s relations with the central government and the BJP top brass have been far from smooth as she has often accused them of using central agencies and also the governor’s office to harass her government.The BJP has denied the charge and often claimed that she has used the state machinery to target its members and accused her of not adhering to constitutional properties in her dealings with the Centre.

It's a situation where we want to help, but we are helpless,” the Delhi High Court lamented on Friday while hearing pleas on the shortage of black fungus medicine and the problems being faced by the patients.While the Centre placed a report giving the steps taken by it to source the medicine and overcome shortages, the high court directed it to give further details on current status of its imports and when the stocks are expected.The court, which was hearing two pleas seeking medicine vials for two patients admitted here for black fungus infection, expressed helplessness over the situation and said it cannot pass any order that a particular patient should be given preference for treatment while denying it to others.The issue of shortage of the medicine for treating black fungus was raised by advocate Rakesh Malhotra who said the black fungus cases, affecting Covid-affected people, are rising.The court, which was informed that steps are being taken by the Centre to procure 2.30 lakh vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B from six countries, asked the government to explain the reason behind choosing this figure as the “today's requirement of the medicine is much more”.“The Union of India shall place a report giving the detailed current status of the said imports. It will be considered on Monday. It has to indicate how the figure of 2.30 lakh vials was arrived at and whether there is a greater availability of the drug which could be imported,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said, which heard for six hours the matter relating to various issues arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.The court asked the Centre to come back on May 31 with a definite statement as to what happened to these 2.30 lakh vials, where are they, what is the stage, when are they coming to India, has the order been placed or not.When one of the Centre's advocate said the order for the vials has been placed abroad, the bench said, “we are running against time. If you placed the order on May 24, today it should have been here”.“We are only expressing out anxiety because of the proportions this thing is assuming. Every hour is assuming a new proportion,” the bench said, adding that “the effort here is to save lives and every hour matters”.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma said as per the information updated on the portal, the number of patients under treatment for mucormycosis (black fungus) in India are 14,872 on May 28 (9 AM) and this includes 423 patients in Delhi.“Out of the sources that have been presently identified abroad, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on May 24 has called upon Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to take steps to procure 2,30,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B from Australia, Russia, Germany, Argentina, Belgium and China. "MEA has also been called upon to procure 50,000 tablets of Isavuconazole. Steps in this regard are being taken by the MEA,” said the Centre's report, filed through advocates Amit Mahajan, Kirtiman Singh and Nidhi Mohan Parashar.The Centre said domestic production capacity of Amphotericin B Liposomal Injection has progressed as while in April it was 62,000, in May it was 1,40,000 and in June it is expected to be 3,25,114.It said the main impediment in granting more licences for manufacture of Liposomal Amphotericin B is the shortage of the raw materials and excipients worldwide. It said the MEA has been working on ensuring supplies of key excipients from sources abroad for production of Liposomal Amphotericin B (Amphonex) in India and added that imports are being made by Mylan Labs from Gilead Inc. USA and the government is working to increase the imports and for early delivery.Regarding the medicine supplies made to Delhi, the Centre said 400 vials were allocated on May 24, 300 vials on May 26 and 1920 vials on May 27.It said as per the tentative estimation of joint monitoring committee under the Directorate General of Health Services, 20 per cent of the total active Covid-19 cases are moderate to severe and may require hospitalisation. From these 20 percent of moderate and severe cases, 1:500 to 1:1000 cases may develop mucormycosis.The court had earlier said the gap between demand and supply of Amphotericin B was “too wide to bridge” and drastic steps are required to be taken.According to the Union Health Ministry, people catch mucormycosis by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. It can also develop on the skin after the fungus enters the skin through a cut, scrape, burn, or other type of skin trauma.The disease is being detected among patients who are recovering or have recovered from Covid-19. Moreover, anyone who is diabetic and whose immune system is not functioning well needs to be on the guard against this, the ministry has said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-living-hell-we-are-helpless-says-high-court-on-black-fungus-drug-shortage-259895

The Class XII marks are also important for getting admission to undergraduate courses in institutions on the basis of merit.“Many countries are now looking for alternate ways to conduct exams so that the students are free from mental pressure,” Gautam said, urging the government to take action and get the examinations completed so that students can overcome the prevailing sense of insecurity.Rajeev Tiwari, co-founder of a company imparting online education to Class XII students, said the second wave of Covid-19 and confusion about exams has left everyone “clueless” about the next academic year.“Academic uncertainties to apprehensions over healthcare are also affecting students’ mental health. The unpredictability is also affecting parents, resulting in them putting more pressure on children. Understandably, parents are worried about their child’s future, safety and career. Parents and mentors should motivate and help students overcome their fears and concerns. They can have conversations with children to reduce their stress and perhaps consult a psychologist if required,” says Tiwari.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delay-in-class-xii-exams-resulting-in-insecurity-among-students-259888
28-05-2021||Chennai||Nothing against Ramdev, will consider withdrawing police plaints if he takes back remarks: IMA chief||The Indian Medical Association will consider taking back police complaints lodged against yoga guru Ramdev and also a defamation notice sent to him if he withdrew his remarks against Covid-19 vaccines and modern medicine, IMA national chief Dr J A Jayalal said on Friday.By targeting modern system of medicine vis-vis the pandemic and treatment for it, Ramdev was actually questioning the government, he said.“We have nothing against yoga guru Ramdev. His statements are against vaccination for Covid-19. We think his statements could confuse people, may divert them. This is our big concern as he has many followers,” Dr Jayalal said.On Ramdev already withdrawing his comment vis-a-vis modern medicine and Covid-19, he said it has to be done in its entirety.If the yoga guru came forward to withdraw such remarks in its entirety, the IMA will consider taking back complaints against him in police stations and also a defamation notice sent to him, Dr Jayalal told PTI.Days ago, the IMA had served a defamation notice on Ramdev for alleged disparaging remarks against modern medicine and its practitioners. The notice demanded an apology from him within 15 days, failing which it said would take appropriate action for Rs 1,000 crore compensation.Complaints have been filed against Ramdev in Delhi besides other places, the IMA chief said, adding the association has also requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take action against Ramdev.On Sunday, Ramdev was forced to withdraw a statement questioning some of the drugs used to treat coronavirus and alleged “lakhs have died from taking allopathic medicines for Covid-19”. Following the row, Ramdev had said that even their father cannot arrest him.Later, the yoga guru posed 25 questions to the IMA asking if modern medicine offered permanent relief for ailments such as hypertension.The IMA chief, who is Professor and Head, Department of Surgery, Government Kanyakumari Medical College Hospital in Tamil Nadu, said,”the yoga guru should advise his followers to get vaccinated and support the government in its fight against the pandemic.”Ramdev’s remarks, be it against the vaccination or modern medicine for Covid-19, in reality, questioned the government’s wisdom, he said answering a question.“This is because we only follow the protocol framed by the government for Covid-19. Hence, if somebody questions it,they actually question the government.” Dr Jayalal recalled that recently in Tamil Nadu, actor Mansoor Ali Khan was arrested after he raised doubts over the vaccine following the death of popular Tamil comedian Vivek, after he got the jab.And now, action is being taken by the IMA against Ramdev and it would be good if the government too acted against such people to strengthen the fight against Covid-19, he said.To a question, he said, “the Tamil Nadu government has recommended Kaba Sura Kudineer (Indian medicine) for boosting immunity. Have we ever questioned it? The point here is, after weighing all factors, the government recommends vaccination and drugs. It has to be followed.”   But if someone with a good number of followers is allowed to go on targeting modern medicine and hit out at hardworking doctors and paramedics, it is not acceptable, he said.“The most important thing here is we are fighting against a deadly pandemic. If prominent individuals are allowed to claim whatever they wish, it will divert people, confuse them and go against the efforts of both the government and medical fraternity to tackle the pandemic.”On some practitioners of modern medicine prescribing Indian systems of medicine for specific conditions, he said it must not be done.“A drug can be prescribed by a practitioner only if he or she is qualified and trained in that particular system of medicine. Mixing up is not allowed.”Asked about an allegation that he tried to convert people to Christianity, the surgeon dismissed it as false and motivated.“How does the question of religion even come here?This is purely a diversionary tactic by vested interests and nothing more. All my life I have served people without differentiating them on any basis and I would continue to serve them. I have done the most surgeries for HIV infectedpeople,” he said.Ramdev’s close aide Acharya Balkrishna took to Twitter, saying the yoga guru and Ayurveda were being ‘targeted’ by allopathic practitioners under the IMA as part of a conspiracy.“As part of the conspiracy to convert the entire country into #Christianity, #Yoga and #Ayurveda are being maligned by targeting @yogrishiramdev jee. Countrymen, wake up now from the deep slumber otherwise the generations to come will not forgive you,” Balkrishna claimed.

But neither NSA invoked nor their assets seized,” the PIL pointed out.“Thousands of EWS and BPL citizens died on streets, in vehicles, in hospitals compounds and their homes due to hoarding of hospital beds, adulterated Covid medicines, black marketing of medical equipment like oxygen cylinder and huge profiteering in the sale of life saving injections like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab etc.,” the PIL stated.Several people lost their family members due to hoarding of beds, profiteering, adulteration in medicines and black marketing, Upadhyay alleged while urging the court to rule that the punishment for offences for hoarding, profiteering, adulteration and black marketing and the sentence shall be consecutive, not concurrent.He demanded that the Centre should examine international laws relating to hoarding, profiteering, adulteration and black marketing and take appropriate steps to insert a Chapter for these offences in IPC.Upadhyay said the Law Commission should be asked to examine International Laws related to Hoarding, Adulteration, Profiteering and Black Marketing and prepare a Report within three months.Due to ineffective outdated vague laws, the government has totally failed to control hoarding of beds in hospitals, spurious medicine generation, profiteering, adulteration and black marketing, since this pandemic has started, he submitted.“District Administration has even failed to control manufacture and sale of fake sanitizers, masks, thermometer, oximeter, nebulizer, etc,” the petitioner said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leader-moves-sc-for-stricter-punishment-to-hoarders-demands-nsa-be-invoked-259875

So a decision has been taken to allow shops coming under the category of essential services to operate during the weekend from 7 am to 11 am," the minister added.Speaking on the Covid-19 situation here, Tope said the number of cases was declining, but the positivity rate (detections per 100 tests) continued to be higher than the state average at 11.9 per cent.The mortality rate of Pune district stood at 1.6 per cent, he said, adding that directives have been issued to health authorities to "track and trace" patients scientifically.He said the decision to not allow home isolation was taken to ensure patients get proper treatment at Covid care centres along with timely monitoring of oxygen levels and other vital parameters."However, if some patient in the city has a big house and space is not an issue, then he or she can opt for home isolation. However, it is not advisable for those living in small dwellings," the minister said.Speaking on Covid-19 treatment bills, he said auditors would check each and every bill."Earlier, bills above Rs 1.5 lakh were being checked.But it was noticed that hospitals were breaking up bills in three to four parts (to escape such checks). So, instructions have been issued that auditors will check each and every bill," Tope explained. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-weekend-relaxation-for-punes-essential-item-shops-259874

28-05-2021||Vijay Mohan||Bhakra water level plummets to 8 per cent; power generation cut by 20 per cent||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 28The available storage in the reservoir at Bhakra Dam, which is crucial for supply of water for drinking and irrigation in the region, as well as for power generation, has plummeted to just 8 per cent of its total capacity.Also read: Eye on elections, Punjab government cuts power tariff by up to Re 1 per unit for domestic consumersThe low water level has adversely impacted power generation as well as the release of water for irrigation to the beneficiary states in the region. Against a target of 1,337 million units for till date in the current fiscal, the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) has generated 1,080 million units, accounting for a reduction of about 20 per cent in production, sources said.Last year, the BBMB had generated 1,909 million units during this period.On Friday morning, the water level recorded in the reservoir at Bhakra Dam that lies on the Sutlej river, was 1,505.30 feet, as compared to 1561.16 feet on the same day last year. According to sources, the water level has fallen below this on only two occasions in the past 16 years, in 2009 and 2018.At Pong Dam, that lies on the Beas, the level recorded was 1,298.57 feet against 1,345.58 feet last year. The maximum permissible level at Bhakra and Pong is 1,680 feet and 1,390 feet, respectively. The level at Thein Dam, which lies on the Ravi and is controlled by the Punjab Irrigation Department, the level was 1,652.65 feet. Last year it was 1,679.88 feet.Data released by the Central Water Commission (CWC) on May 27 reveals that departure from the past 10-year average of water storage is minus 59 per cent for dams in Himachal Pradesh and minus 34 per cent for Punjab.The current storage in the reservoir at Bhakra is 0.524 billion cubic meters (BCM), which is 8 percent of its total capacity of 6.229 BCM. The storage was 22 per cent at this time last year.The current storage at Pong is 14 per cent as compared to 48 per cent last year while at Thein it is 34 per cent against 51 percent for the corresponding period last year, CWC data shows.Given the low availability of water, BBMB officials are in constant touch with the state governments of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi to assess their respective demands for water and work out daily releases so that in addition to drinking water, only urgent demands for irrigation are catered to.Deficient snow and rainfall during the preceding winters have been cited as the reason for low water storage. Further, unseasonal rain and snow in many parts of the Himalayas during May kept temperatures low, thereby reducing snow melt. Bhakra Dam, which lies on the Sutlej, is primarily snow-fed while the other two major dams in the region, Pong on the Beas and Thein on the Ravi are primarily rain-fed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhakra-water-level-plummets-to-8-per-cent-power-generation-cut-by-20-per-cent-259862

28-05-2021||---||Warning labels on junk food must to curb childhood obesity in India||New Delhi, May 28Strong regulations to cap salt, sugar and other harmful ingredients and simple to understand front of package labelling (FOPL) on junk food packets can help curb the alarming rise in childhood obesity in India, say public health experts and doctors, in a webinar organised by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh on Friday.Warning labels are critical to help consumers and parents understand how much empty calories and harmful nutrients are being consumed by children."Food labels should provide clear guidance... Simple to understand labels with evidence based nutrition cut-off is a need of the hour and will go a long way to address the crisis of childhood obesity in the country," said Umesh Kapil, Professor, Clinical Epidemiology, Indian Institute of Biliary Sciences.The experts also urged that India must rapidly adopt the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended limits and also introduce simple, smart and interpretative FOPL."There is enough scientific evidence and a globally agreed WHO SEARO framework for evidence-based cut-offs for anti-nutrients like sugar, salt and saturated fat present in packaged food," Kapil added.WHO has identified FOPL as "one of the policy tools that can support healthy diets, both in stimulating consumers to make informed healthier food choices and in driving manufacturers to reformulate products to avoid making unfavourable nutrient content disclosure."With more than 14.4 million obese children, India has the second-highest number of children with childhood obesity in the world. By 2025 this number is expected to reach a staggering 17 million. As is the trajectory in other developing nations, the proportion of packaged and ultra-processed foods is on the rise.There is growing evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic could potentially increase the risk of children becoming obese. School closures and lockdowns have already deprived millions of children of nutritional school meals, sports and adequate physical exercise."Being overweight or obese is directly associated with life-threatening non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Obesity is a result of imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended," said Rekha Harish, Chairperson, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, NCD Prevention.The only way to control this growing epidemic of obesity is by establishing scientific cut-off limits for harmful ingredients and FOPL on packaged products, the experts suggested."Children are particularly at risk. As doctors, we want to assert that the onus should not be on children or their families alone to prevent or fight this condition. It is the collective duty of policymakers, the food industry and us as doctors to safeguard children and enable a nutritious food system for them," said Manoj Kumar Gupta, Dean, AIIMS Rishikesh. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/warning-labels-on-junk-food-must-to-curb-childhood-obesity-in-india-259856
28-05-2021||New Delhi||RT-PCR test: NEERI develops simple, fast method of swab collection and processing||The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has developed a simple and fast method of swab collection and processing for RT-PCR coronavirus test which could be used in rural and tribal areas.The method is simple, fast, cost-effective, patient-friendly and comfortable, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) said.It is well-suited for rural and tribal areas, given minimal infrastructure requirements, it said.The Nagpur-based NEERI is a constituent laboratory of CSIR.Krishna Khairnar, senior scientist, Environmental Virology Cell at NEERI, said the swab collection method requires time. Moreover, since it is an invasive technique, it is a bit uncomfortable for patients. "Sometime, it is also lost in the transport of the sample to the collection centre. On the other hand, the Saline Gargle RT-PCR method is instant, comfortable and patient-friendly. Sampling is done instantly and results will be generated within three hours," he said.The method is non-invasive and so simple that a patient can collect the sample himself, said Khairnar. Collection methods like nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab collection require technical expertise and they are also time-consuming. In contrast, the Saline Gargle RT-PCR method uses a simple collection tube filled with saline solution, he said. The patient gargles the solution and rinses it inside the tube. This sample in the collection tube is taken to the laboratory where it is kept at room temperature, in a special buffer solution prepared by NEERI. An RNA template is produced when this solution is heated, which is further processed for Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). This particular method of collecting and processing the sample enables to save on the otherwise costly infrastructural requirement of RNA extraction. The method is environment-friendly as well, since waste generation is minimised, Khairnar said.The Nagpur Municipal Corporation has given permission to go ahead with the method, following which testing has begun at NEERI, the CSIR said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rt-pcr-test-neeri-develops-simple-fast-method-of-swab-collection-and-processing-259854

His job was to prevent the illegal activities but it appears that he himself became a part of illegal coal mafia. The allegations against him are very serious in nature,” the judge said and declined to accept the arguments of senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, who represented Mishra.ED’s Special Public Prosecutors Amit Mahajan and Nitesh Rana opposed the plea saying that the accused had received Rs 168 crore from Anoop Majee alias Lala which he was stated to have transferred to Delhi and Overseas.Majee is alleged to be the kingpin in the West Bengal coal scam cases.

These new fatalities pushed the death toll from Covid-19 here to 23,951.On Thursday, 1,072 cases and 117 deaths were recorded, while the positivity rate had dipped to 1.53 per cent. On Friday, the positivity rate stood at 1.59 per cent.The infection rate had reached 36 per cent in the last week of April, coming down to around 1.5 per cent now.On May 15, Kejriwal had said, "The virus is reducing in Delhi slowly and steadily, and I hope it diminishes completely and does not rise again. However, we are not going to become negligent in any way", while sounding a tone of caution.On Friday, he said it was time to start the unlock process, but warned that if the coronavirus cases start rising again, "we will have to stop to unlock exercise", and appealed to people not to step out unless it is absolutely necessary.Delhi has been reeling under a brutal second wave of the pandemic that is sweeping the country, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with the recent oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals, adding to the woes.Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling up, with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20; rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 2, the city registered a record 407 deaths, as per the official data.However, the number of cases have shown a downward trend and the positivity rate too has been shrinking in the last several days.The number of deaths reported on Thursday—117—was the lowest since April 15 when the national capital had reported 112 fatalities, while the positivity rate (1.52 per cent) was the lowest since March 23, when it had stood at 1.31 per cent, as per official data.The National Capital had recorded 1,491 cases and 130 fatalities on Wednesday, 1,568 cases and 156 deaths on Tuesday, 1,550 cases and 207 fatalities on Monday.The positivity rate on Monday was 2.52 per cent which has come down to 1.59 per cent on Friday.A total of 71,853 tests, including 47,917 RT-PCR tests and 23,936 rapid antigen tests, were conducted a day ago, according to the health bulletin on Friday.The number of cumulative cases on Friday stood at 14,23,690. Over 13.8 lakh patients have recovered from the virus.The number of active cases decreased to 14,581 on Friday from 16,378  a day before, as per the bulletin.The number of people under home isolation dipped to 7,111 from 8,247 on Thursday while the number of containment zones dropped to 22,701 from 34,354 a day before, the bulletin said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-records-1-141-new-covid-cases-139-more-deaths-somehow-gained-control-over-2nd-wave-says-cm-259851
28-05-2021||New Delhi||65-year-old man becomes 1st Covid patient to get antibody cocktail at Apollo in Delhi||A 65-year-old man from Delhi, having multiple co-morbidities, has become the first Covid-19 patient to receive monoclonal antibody therapy at the Apollo hospital here, the healthcare group said on Friday.The patient responded well to the infusion of the antibody cocktail and went home after an hour of observation on Thursday, hospital authorities said.As part of this single dose infusion-based treatment, patients with mild to moderate symptoms, are offered a cocktail of Casirivimab and Imdevimab, that is said to reduce their chance of hospitalisation by 70 per cent.In a statement, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, Delhi on Friday announced that "Roche India's antibody cocktail (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) distributed by Cipla Ltd. is available for administration to patients with mild and moderate Covid-19 infection" at its facility.The Antibody Cocktail was launched on May 24 in India by Roche India after receiving Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO), it said.The first patient to receive the therapy at Apollo hospital here is a 65-year-old Covid patient from Delhi who has multiple co-morbidities, including acute blood pressure, a spokesperson of the hospital said."We are glad to have launched a pan-India program to make available this advanced treatment comprising neutralising monoclonal antibodies for our patients with Covid-19," said Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director, Apollo Hospitals Group and seniors consultant, paediatric gastroenterology at the hospital.Monoclonal antibodies bind to and 'neutralise' the SARS-CoV-2 virus, he said, adding, "we are confident that this treatment option will significantly boost our efforts to bring the pandemic under control and will help prevent progression of the disease in those with mild to moderate Covid-19".The therapy is most suited for "high-risk Covid-19 patients" who are within the first ten days of symptom onset and meet any of the listed criteria, such as age being 65 years or above.Other criteria include, obesity with BMI (Body Mass Index) of more than 35; or type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus; or chronic kidney disease, including those on dialysis; or chronic liver disease; or currently receiving immunosuppressive treatment; or if aged above 55, having either heart disease, or hypertension, or chronic lung disease.Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior pulmonologist at Apollo hospital, said the reason why this therapy is termed as an anti-body cocktail is because it comprises a mixture of biological drugs (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) that mirror the human antibodies in the immune system which consequently help fight the infection, similar to the natural antibodies produced when one gets infected with Covid. Both these antibodies also strengthen the immune defence system, he said.This drug is said to restrict pathogens and virus from entering the patient's body, from where they otherwise would have derived nutrition and multiplied. This antibody cocktail will help prevent progression of the disease to a severe stage, he said.Mohabbat Singh, an 84-year-old Covid-positive man, was given monoclonal antibody therapy at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon on Tuesday and was sent home the same day, after being kept under observation, hospital authorities said on Wednesday, adding, Singh became the first patient to receive the therapy at Medanta.Fortis Escorts Heart Institute (FEHI) in south Delhi, after receiving doses on Wednesday has started offering the therapy from Thursday, FEHI Chairman Dr Ashok Seth earlier said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/65-year-old-man-becomes-1st-covid-patient-to-get-antibody-cocktail-at-apollo-in-delhi-259845

28-05-2021||Aligarh (UP)||11 die after consuming spurious liquor in UP’s Aligarh||Eleven people died on Friday and some more were taken ill after allegedly consuming spurious liquor sold by a licensed vendor here, a senior official said.The authorities have ordered a magisterial probe into the incident and suspend five excise officials, while four people, including the liquor vend owner, have been arrested.The inquiry will be conducted by an additional district magistrate-rank officer, DM Chandra Bhushan Singh told mediapersons.The administration is likely to invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against those found guilty, he said.Confirming the 11 deaths, the DM said information about other people who had consumed liquor bought from the same vendor is trickling in.DIG Dipak Kumar said the Lodha police station was informed in the morning about the death of two people after consuming country-made liquor bought from a vendor in Karsia.The victims were truck drivers who had gathered at a gas depot on the Aligarh-Tapaal highway for work, he said.However, when police and senior district officials reached the spot, they were told that six more people belonging to Karsia and adjoining villages had died, the DIG said, adding that the bodies were sent for a post-mortem examination.Some of those taken ill were rushed to the district hospital, from where they were shifted to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital at Aligarh Muslim University.                  The liquor shop has been sealed and samples have been collected for testing.           Four people, including the owner of the liquor vend at Andla, have been arrested, police said.Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kalanidhi Naithani said six police teams are combing villages to trace victims and and help people get medical assistance.“Among those arrested included an associate of the owner and two of his sales assistants. They are being interrogated,” the SSP said.Meanwhile, Additional Chief Secretary (Excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy said District Excise Officer Dheeraj Sharma; Excise Inspectors Rajesh Kumar Yadav and  Chandraprakash Yadav; Head Constable Ashok Kumar; and Constable Ram Raj Rana have been suspended with immediate effect.A departmental action has also been initiated against them, he added.According to locals, people had started falling sick on Thursday.Many others from neighbouring villages had also consumed the liquor, they added.Meanwhile, family members of the victims were seen crying at Karsia and Andla villages.Andla village head Om Dutt said apart from those who died, a large number of people were taken ill after consuming spurious liquor since Thursday afternoon.             He alleged that widespread reports suggested a racket behind spurious liquor.The vice-president of the Youth Congress in UP, Gorang Dev Chauhan, demanded that all liquor vends in the state be closed.Chauhan in a statement said that it is ironical that while shops and other vital commercial establishments remain closed during the coronavirus lockdown, liquor vends have been exempted.He said the tragic incident has been caused by “flawed priorities” of the state government and demanded a high-level probe into the “racket” of spurious liquor.

The state will manage the situation from its resources. We will assess the damage in seven days and later seek central assistance, Jena said.Union Minister Pratap Sarangi, who was present in the PMs review meeting said: The Centre is all along with Odisha. The state has not made immediate demanded, but sought permanent solution by setting of disaster resilient infrastructure in power sector and measures against the storm surge.Since the Prime Minister is now going on an aerial survey to see the damages done by Yaas, he will announce a relief package by this evening, Sarangi said.The state government, at the beginning of the review meeting, welcomed the Prime Minister to the state. A video film of 8-mimute duration and a PowerPoint presentation was made before the Prime Minister on how the state responded to the calamity.The Chief Minister categorically said that both the centre and the state should join hands to work for the protection from the danger of storm surge, which this time saw ingresses of saline water to over 120 villages in the coast districts, the SRC said.Patnaik also wanted long term solution to the problem of coastal erosion which adds to the danger from storms in the coastal belt. The Chief Minister also drew attention of the Prime Minister to the disaster resilient power system, the demand for which is being made for the last two years. This apart, the CM also empathetically demanded coastal storm surge protection mechanism, Jena said.Jena said there is every possibility that the height of storm surge in Oddisha coast may go up to 8 meters along the state coast. Therefore, robust planning is required. The state governments demand was to ensure a disaster resilient coastal infrastructure, he said.Cyclone Yaas, packing winds gusting to 145 kmph whip lashed parts of India's eastern coast on Wednesday, killing at least three people in Odisha and one in West Bengal and leaving behind a trail of damaged homes and flooded farmland, forcing more than 21 lakh people to be evacuated to safe shelters in the states of West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand.After the havoc caused by the cyclone, heavy post- cyclone rains on Thursday has seen river water levels rising above the danger mark, placing four districts of Odisha—Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapara and Keonjhar—on high alert. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-reviews-cyclone-yaas-damage-odisha-demands-long-term-solution-259817
28-05-2021||Sandeep Dkshit||India seeks next phase of studies on origin of Covid||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 28India has termed the global study on the origin of Covid convened by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as “an important first step” and said the next phase of studies should begin in order to reach robust conclusions.The stand mirrors that of the US which has also called for international experts to be allowed to evaluate the source of the coronavirus and the early days of the outbreak in a second phase of the WHO's investigation. The Biden administration has asked the US intelligence community to "redouble their efforts" to come to a conclusion on the origins of virus which invited a push back from Beijing.“The WHO convening global study on the origin of Covid is an important first step. It stressed the need for next phase studies as also for further data and studies to reach robust conclusions. The follow-up of the WHO report and further studies deserve the understanding and cooperation of all,’’ said a statement by the Ministry of External Affairs.A WHO team had spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February though China maintains that “introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway’’.Many media outlets in the US and Europe are highlighting the Wuhan lab-leak theory which is considered a controversial hypothesis. In order to lend credence to their hypothesis, media outlets have been quoting a US intelligence report that says three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory received treatment in a hospital in November 2019, before the virus began infecting the people in the city. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said a leak from the laboratory was “least likely” but this apprehension needed “further investigation”.China, on the other hand, wants the US to open its laboratories for “a comprehensive study of all early cases of Covid found worldwide and a thorough investigation into some secretive bases and biological laboratories all over the world”.The matter is unlikely to be decided soon. On Wednesday, senior WHO official Mike Ryan told the annual meeting of health ministers that consultations had been informally held with many member states to look at what happened in the next phase. “And we will continue to have those discussions in the coming weeks,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-seeks-next-phase-of-studies-on-origin-of-covid-259813

A team of Mumbai NCB apprehended him in the Telangana capital on May 26, the official added.He was arrested under the NDPS Act and produced before a local court which granted the NCB his `transit remand', allowing the agency to take him to Mumbai.Pithani was produced before a chief metropolitan magistrate in Mumbai on Friday who remanded him in the NCB custody till June 1 as requested, special public prosecutor Advait Sethna said. Also read:While seeking his custody, Sethna told the court that Pithani had admitted to his involvement in the crime.The NCB's remand application said that other arrested accused had also disclosed Pithani's "involvement in the procurement of contraband (ganja/weed/joint/charas)".Besides Rajput, he was in direct contact with Samuel Miranda, Deepesh Sawant and Showik and Rhea Chakraborty, therefore further probe into his "role and nexus" with other accused was needed, it told the court.Rajput's former girlfriend Rhea, her brother Showik, and the actor's staff members Miranda and Sawant were arrested in the drug case last year and later got bail.Pithani used to work with a graphic design agency as a creative director in 2017. He came in contact with Rajput through the actor's friend Ayush Sharma.In April 2019 Pithani came to Mumbai and since then he was staying with Rajput and working on the late actor's project 'Dreams 150'.After Rajput's alleged suicide, Pithani's statement was recorded by Mumbai Police, the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the NCB in related cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncb-arrests-sushants-flatmate-siddhartha-pithani-from-hyderabad-in-drug-case-259810

28-05-2021||Lucknow||After suggesting people to drink ‘cow urine’ to defeat Covid, UP BJP MLA now says 'some allopathic doctors are 'Rakshas'||Following in the footsteps of Yoga guru Ramdev, Surendra Singh, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Uttar Pradesh's Ballia district, has accused some allopathic doctors of turning 'rakshas' (demons), and earning money by showing dead patients as alive."I support Ramdev's arguments. He is not furthering his medical system, but instead promoting the ancient Ayurvedic medical system, so his arguments need to be supported," the legislator said.He further explained, "Relying on the Ayurvedic medical system will turn our country into 'Swasthya Bharat Samarth Bharat' (healthy India-capable India). After retiring from politics, the lone mission of my life will be to promote Yoga and Ayurveda to make India healthy and capable."Singh said: "I don't say that allopathic medicine is bad or good work has not been done in it. But in allopathic medicine, many doctors have turned 'rakshas' (demons) by showing dead patients as alive in Intensive Care Units just to earn money." "While I welcome and appreciate the services of allopathic doctors working honestly and sincerely for patient care, I also condemn greedy and corrupt allopathic doctors," he said.It is noteworthy that a few weeks back, Singh had appealed to people to drink 'gau mutra' (cow urine) to defeat Covid and had even put up a video showing him drinking cow urine to underline his point.Surendra Singh has been known for his controversial statements and deeds.He has used unparliamentary language against the Congress leadership and in October last year, he had openly defended a local party leader Dhirendra Pratap Singh, who had allegedly shot dead a 46-year-old man in Ballia, following a quarrel over the public allotment of ration shops.He had defended the BJP leader by saying that it was an act of self-defence.

28-05-2021||Noida||Farmers protest at Jewar toll plaza on Yamuna Expressway||A group of farmers protesting against the central farm laws on Friday staged a demonstration at the Jewar toll plaza here, partially disrupting traffic movement on the Yamuna Expressway, according to officials.The farmers belonging to the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) had reached Jewar in Gautam Buddh Nagar on Thursday with an objective to stage the demonstration as part of their plan to carry out similar protests at some other toll plazas in western Uttar Pradesh.According to police officials, some of the protestors, including a local leader of the group, were taken to the Jewar police station around midnight.“They were brought to the station for a dialogue. We had requested them to call off the protest and vacate the toll plaza but they were reluctant,” Jewar police station SHO Umesh Singh told PTI.The protestors went back from the police station after some time and carried on with their demonstration that continued on Friday morning also with them occupying two lanes of the Yamuna Expressway, according to officials.“The Jewar toll plaza is open for vehicular movement. Only two lanes are blocked because of the farmers' protest,” a Traffic Police official said.After observing 'Black Day' on May 26, the BKU, which has been demanding the repeal of the three new central farm laws since November 2020, has intensified its protest in parts of Uttar Pradesh since Thursday.“Members of the farmers’ union are staging protest at five toll plazas in western Uttar Pradesh. These toll plazas are located in Gautam Buddh Nagar, Meerut, Amroha, Moradabad and Muzaffarnagar,” BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said.Supporters of the BKU, led by Rakesh Tikait, have been camping at Ghazipur on the Delhi-UP border since November 2020 with a demand that the Centre repeal the three farm laws brought in last year. The farmers claim that these laws would hurt their livelihood and leave them at the mercy of corporations.The government, which has held multiple rounds of official dialogue with the protestors, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.

However, the global picture is far more concerning,” the statement said.Giving a call to action to equip Covax to deliver 2 billion doses in 2021, the statement said, “We are seeing the traumatic effects of the terrible surge of Covid in South Asia – a surge which has also severely impacted global vaccine supplies.”  It added that Covax has proven it works as the global mechanism for equitable access to Covid vaccines, having delivered over 70 million doses to 126 countries and economies around the world since February – from remote islands to conflict settings – managing the largest and most complex rollout of vaccines in history. Over 35 countries received their first Covid vaccine doses thanks to Covax.“However, the terrible surge of the virus in India has had a severe impact on Covax's supply in the second quarter of this year, to the point where, by the end of June we will face a shortfall of 190 million doses,” the joint statement said.It said even though Covax will have larger volumes available later in the year through the deals it has already secured with several manufacturers, it warned that “if we do not address the current, urgent shortfall, the consequences could be catastrophic.”It said the pandemic has just taken a frightening new turn, as a deadly surge of cases rages across South Asia and other hotspots.The global agencies called on nations to share doses “now”, saying the United States and Europe have collectively pledged to share 180 million doses.

After great effort, they have been able to speak to him for two minutes." The advocate said, "Choksi has narrated his horrifying experience which is an eye-opener and vindicates my stand that he would not have gone from Antigua voluntarily. Choksi has said that he was forced to get into a vessel from Jolly Harbor in Antigua and he was taken to Dominica."Agarwal also said that Choksi was kept there, and then on Monday he was taken to the police station. Since then, he's been there and this news to the world was broken only on Wednesday.He claimed that there are marks on Choksi's body of the force. "There is something fishing and I guess it was a strategy to take him to another so that there are chances of sending him back to India. So, I don't know what forces are operating. The time will tell," he said.Agarwal also said that legal team has filed habeas corpus petition in Dominica for Choksi and have also highlighted deprivation of access to him and deprivation of constitutional rights to legal assistance.On Wednesday, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne has said that the fugitive diamantaire "needs to return to India" where he can face the criminal charges levelled against him.Antigua News Room, a media outlet, quoted Browne as telling journalists in Antigua and Barbuda: "We asked them not to repatriate him to Antigua. He needs to return to India where he can face the criminal charges levelled against him."The Antigua Observer also said that Browne has reportedly told the media in India that he has asked Dominican government to detain Choksi for entering their country illegally. "Browne has asked that officials in Dominica make Choksi persona non grata and have him deported directly to India," the Antigua Observer reported.Choksi, an accused in the over Rs 13,500 crore PNB fraud case along with his nephew Nirav Modi, has been residing in Antigua and Berbuda since January 4, 2018.The CBI and ED, which have filed separate chargesheets in the case, are trying for the extradition of Choksi.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/choksi-was-taken-to-police-station-two-days-before-news-of-his-arrest-broke-lawyer-259780

After the ABVP and NSUI, the Students Islamic Organisation of India too has written to Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, pressing for the “open book” mode.Options proposed by the union governmentOpposing physical exams, the SIO had earlier sought that the board exams be cancelled and students be promoted on the basis of internal assessment and Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE).In another letter to Pokhriyal, SIO president Mohammad Salman Ahmad said: “Considering that cancellation of the board exams is not acceptable to most state governments, question papers and answer-sheets can be made available to students at their homes. The answer-sheets can then be sent back to the exam centres. Physical examination should not be allowed under any circumstances.”A majority of states favour short-duration, multiple-choice exams. However, Delhi, West Bengal and Punjab are opposed to the idea, arguing that the safety of students and teachers is a must and they must be vaccinated first. However, vaccinating all students may not be possible because of the scarcity of vaccines and the fact that a large number of students are below 18 years of age, say sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/student-organisations-for-open-book-exam-mode-259680

However, given the criticism being faced by the ruling party, a Cabinet reshuffle is believed to be among the options.Speculations are rife that the issue related to Sharma’s elevation and a possible Cabinet expansion was discussed on Sunday when top leaders of the BJP and the RSS met in Delhi to address concerns over the negative perception on Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath over the handling of the second Covid wave, sources say. Sharma is believed to have met the Prime Minister earlier, further fuelling the speculations, though leaders claim the meeting was regarding the Covid situation in Varanasi (PM’s Lok Sabha constituency). Modi had given the charge of Covid management in Varanasi to Sharma after the situation went out of control. Meanwhile, ground reports also suggest that Sharma did a “fairly good job” in the city reeling under the second wave.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bigger-role-likely-for-modi-aide-in-up-259684

The Delhi Police claimed the statement was “mendacious” and designed to “impede a lawful inquiry”. Twitter had marked several tweets by ruling BJP leaders, including Sambit Patra, on an alleged toolkit of opposition Congress to target the government over Covid as containing “manipulated media”, which prompted the police to visit its offices late on Monday. The government had asked Twitter to remove the “manipulated media” tag, a directive the social media giant didn’t comply with.Twitter said, “We will strive to comply with the applicable law in India. But just as we do around the world, we will continue to be strictly guided by principles of transparency, a commitment to empowering every voice on the service and protecting freedom of expression and privacy under the rule of law.”The government said protecting free speech was not the prerogative of a private, for-profit, foreign entity like Twitter. “The government respects the right of people to ask questions and also criticise on these social media platforms, including Twitter,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bid-to-defame-india-says-government-as-twitter-toolkit-row-escalates-259614

I mean these are people (in the government at the Centre) who perhaps are less from the English-speaking world, less connected to other global centres. So there is a difference.

We Indians are extremely confident about our democracy… India is a deeply pluralistic society,” he said in response to McMaster asking if Hindutva policies could undermine the secular nature of Indian democracy and whether India’s friends are right to be concerned about recent trends.“...there is a difference between the political imagery that has been concocted and actually the governance record out there,” he said.Jaishankar is in the US to hold talks on bilateral issues, but the top three in the State Department, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, are on overseas tours. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/political-effort-to-tarnish-image-of-government-external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-in-us-259624
28-05-2021||New Delhi||To spur imports, India waives local trials for foreign vaccines||Faced with acute Covid vaccine shortage, India on Thursday altogether waived the requirement of local trials for leading foreign vaccines to facilitate imports of Pfizer, Moderna and J&J jabs.Edit: Cover priority groupsThe decision comes after the April move whereby the government had said vaccines approved by the drug regulators of the US, UK, EU, Japan and those in the WHO emergency use listing would be granted approvals in India without the need for prior bridging trials.‘No word from WHO on vaccinating kids’Not off-the-shelf items, explains union GovtBuying vax internationally is not similar to buying ‘off-the-shelf’ items. Vaccines are in limited supply globally, and companies give preference to countries of origin. The CentreRamping up domestic productionBharat Biotech to enhance monthly manufacturing capacity from 90 lakh doses to 10 cr by OctoberContinue with Covid norms till June-end, states toldThese vaccines were, however, mandated to undergo post-approval parallel bridging clinical trials in India – a provision the government dropped today.None of the foreign firms has applied for licensure with the Indian regulator yet.VK Paul, chairman of the national Covid vaccine taskforce, said Pfizer vaccine import was likely from July and talks were underway after the firm indicated the availability of jabs for India. Admitting that Pfizer had sought indemnity from compensation in cases of serious adverse events among Indians, Paul said, “The matter is being examined. No decision has been taken yet.”The government also said foreign vaccines were not available in free supply.“Covid vaccines of Zydus Cadila, Biological E and Gennova are in the pipeline,” Paul said as India witnessed 3,847 deaths today, though the daily cases continued to fall for the 20th day – from 4,14,188 on May 7 to 2,11,298 today and active cases saw a 35% drop from the May 10 peak (37 lakh to 24.19 lakh).The government also released “myths and facts” about vaccines, ruling out compulsory licensing as an unattractive option.It rejected accusations of not helping the states and said the failure of states to procure directly from firms reaffirmed what the Centre had been saying all along – that vaccines were in short supply globally. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-spur-imports-india-waives-local-trials-for-foreign-vaccines-259635

28-05-2021||New Delhi||India witnessing downswing in second wave of Covid-19 cases: Govt||India is witnessing a downswing in the second wave of Covid-19 and hopefully it will be sustained even when restrictions are gently, systematically and cautiously relaxed, the government said on Thursday.Addressing a press conference, NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said the country continues to note stabilisation of second wave in most parts, both by the number of cases and positivity rate, and despite a sustained and high overall testing coverage which is “reassuring”.Read also: Centre orders continuation of Covid guidelines till June-end “We are achieving this in face of very significant restrictions in most states in addition to other tools and operations, including testing and COVID appropriate behaviour and vaccination efforts. Nonetheless, it is reassuring that we are on the downswing of second wave and we do hope and believe that it will be sustained even when restrictions are gently, systematically and cautiously opened up,” he said.Health ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said a steady decline in new Covid-19 cases has been recorded in India for the last 20 days, with 24 states witnessing a dip in active cases since the last week.He also said while Covid-19 testing has increased manifold, a steady decline in weekly Covid-19 positivity rate has been seen since the last three weeks.Paul said the vaccination pace should pick up in July.“We have a total of 51.6 crore doses, a large proportion of it is available and has to be used in an efficient manner even as we build our efforts to build our stockpile in the time to come. I would like to state that Bharat Biotech which started with 90 lakh capacity is ramping up and it is well within our expectation that it can reach ten times the production level to 10 crore per month in the next few months,” he said.Paul said similarly the Serum Institute of India is also ramping up vaccine production from 6.5 crore per month to 11 crore or even more in months to come. Other vaccines in the pipeline are also moving close to increase supplies such as Sputnik, Zydus and Genova vaccines so steady progress is being made.“We are also reaching out to international manufacturers, in particular Pfizer, for making vaccine available now that they have shown interest and indicated possibility of vaccine to be spared for India,” he said.The official said the government has been making significant efforts in reaching out to foreign manufacturers and also making intense relentless efforts to increase the production and supply of ‘make in India’ vaccines.He also noted that any significant adverse effect is unlikely if the second dose of a different Covid-19 vaccine is administered, but reaching a firm opinion on this will need more scrutiny and understanding.He, however, clarified that both doses administered to an individual should be of the same vaccine as per the existing protocol.On whether there is a need for antigen testing after getting vaccinated as tests on some people who have taken both the doses showed no antibodies in their bodies, Paul said there is no need for an antibody test after taking Covid-19 vaccine.“Antibody is just one measure of immunity. Perhaps in the medium to long term, it is cell mediated immune response which is more critical and important. Antibody presence is only one measure. Also antibodies decline by time and they also come up not just specific to vaccines but also based on individual predilections.“So when vaccines are administered on a large scale as a large public health response, an attempt is being made to create an overall situation so that as a community and individually we are protected. But individually we are not protected 100 per cent,” he said.Paul said in a vaccination campaign where “we want to immunise everyone against a particular disease, take two doses. If there is a need for a booster dose it will be told. There are studies that are going on...Covaxin trial is going on... whether it should be taken after six months or not”.On Pfizer seeking indemnity, Paul said, “Yes we are engaged with Pfizer and they have indicated the availability of a certain amount of vaccine in the coming months, possibly starting in July and we are looking at what their expectations from the government  are and they are looking at what our expectations from them are.“They have requested indemnity to all the nations, including the country of origin. We are examining this request and will take a decision in the larger interest of people and on merits. This is under discussion and there is no decision as of now,” Paul said.In response to a question, Paul said it has been observed that vaccines developed in other countries a large part of those vaccines were supplied to the same country.“So the US made vaccine went in a big way to the US and it is nothing surprising because when we look upon all vaccine manufacturers they also unhesitatingly offered the vaccines to our nation,” he said.Paul said clearly the countries of origin have been an important priority for producers of vaccines.

It is, therefore, important that containment measures may continue to be implemented strictly.Read also: Punjab extends Covid-19 restrictions till June 10“Any relaxation by states and UTs, may be considered at an appropriate time, in a graded manner, after assessing the local situation, requirements and resources,” Bhalla said in his order issued to chief secretaries of the states and union territories.He said the guidelines issued on April 29 for the month of May will continue till June 30.According to the guidelines, the home ministry told the states to take necessary action to ensure sufficient oxygen-supported beds, ICU beds, ventilators, ambulances, including creation of makeshift hospitals, oxygen, as needed, besides sufficient quarantine facilities.The home ministry, however, did not mention anything about the imposition of lockdown anywhere in the country in the fresh guidelines issued in view of the pandemic.The fresh guidelines for COVID-19 management came amid some decline in the daily count of the coronavirus cases and improvements in the situation of the availability of the beds, ICU and oxygen in some parts of the country like Delhi.India’s COVID-19 infection tally climbed to 2,73,69,093 as 2,11,298 more people tested positive for the disease in a day, while the country’s recovery went up to 90 per cent, according to the Union health ministry on Thursday.The death toll due to the disease rose to 3,15,235 with 3,847 fresh fatalities being reported in a span of 24 hours, the data updated at 8 am showed.

Regardless of the safety precautions proposed to be taken, such a large gathering of students, teachers and associated staff poses too many risks for the collective health and safety of not only every person involved in the process but also for the public at large,” he said.Earlier, Congress student wing National Students' Union of India (NSUI) said that physical exams will only put the lives of students at risk.“It is understandable that as important it is to save the studies of these students, but nothing is more important than their lives,” the NSUI said in its letter to the Education Minister. Meanwhile, RSS’ youth wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, had also written to Pokhriyal, asking him to consider novel modes of conducting the examinations like open-book format and remote mode.Notably, the majority of states have favoured holding short-duration, multiple-choice exams for Class XII boards, however, some like Delhi, West Bengal, and Punjab opposed, saying that students and teachers should be vaccinated for Covid-19 before any exams that require them to be present at the centres physically.However, vaccinating students may not be possible because of the scarcity of vaccines and the fact that a large majority of students are below 18 years of age, sources said. Earlier on Sunday, the centre proposed two options—multiple-choice/objective-type questions in a 90-minute examination in schools/institutions where students are enrolled or testing only for major subjects at designated centres in the existing format. For minor subjects, marks can be calculated as per the performance of major subjects, it was proposed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/students-bodies-not-in-favour-of-physical-class-xii-exams-urge-govt-to-explore-other-modes-259316

28-05-2021||Aditi Tandon||Trials on Covaxin booster underway: Govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 27The government on Thursday said people do not need to get antibody tests done after taking their Covid 19 shots to determine the level of protection they have acquired against the virus.The Ministry of Health further said that trials for a booster dose of Covaxin, India’s indigenous Covid vaccine were underway and once the need and the duration of booster shots for available Covid vaccines worldwide are known, related protocols on booster doses will also be made available.Read also: Foreign vaccines not in free supply, working for imports soon, says CentreSpeaking at a time when some people have questioned the level of antibody generation Covid vaccines produce, Member, Health, NITI Aayog VK Paul said, “You do not need any antibody test after vaccine doses. Antibody is just one measure of immunity but not the only one. The more important measure is the cell mediated immune response. That is more critical and that cannot be tested easily as the test is highly sophisticated.”Read also: Punjab extends Covid-19 restrictions till June 10Paul said the cell mediated response levels tell whether a person’s cells recognise the pathogen and can ward it off when it strikes. “Antibody presence is one measure and antibodies decline by time and come up not just specific to vaccines but also based on individual predelictions. When we administered vaccines in mass as a large public health response, there is a situation where we are trying to raise herd immunity. So we will have collective immunity after the vaccines and also individual immunity but some individuals may have lower immunity than the others but we are still protected as a community and as individuals,” the expert explained.He asked people to go by current protocols – take two doses of Covid vaccines and booster dose trials are underway for Covaxin.“When to get a booster will be known after worldwide studies conclude on the issue. Follow vaccine guidelines. You are safe after two shots and you do not get severe disease. The need and timing of boosters in relation to different vaccines will be known in time and when these are known, the protocols will be made available,” said Paul, Chairman of the National Taskforce on Covid 19 Vaccine Administration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trials-on-covaxin-booster-underway-govt-259295

They keep creating trends like Thug Ramdev, Mahathug Ramdev, Giraftar Ramdev and so on," he said responding to #Arrest Ramdev trends on social media."Arrest to khair unka baap bhi nahin kar sakta Swami Ramdev ko (even their father cannot arrest Swami Ramdev)," he is caught saying in the video.The yoga guru's latest video shows he is not apologetic at all about making "insensitive" comments about allopathy and allopathic practitioners, a doctor said in Dehradun."Ramdev's statement is full of arrogance. It shows that he considers himself above the law," he said reacting to the latest video of Ramdev.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that Ramdev be booked immediately under sedition charges for alleged misinformation campaign on coronavirus vaccination and challenging government protocols for its treatment.The apex medical body of modern doctors has also served a defamation notice on Ramdev for his alleged disparaging remarks against allopathy and allopathic practitioners, demanding an apology from him within 15 days, failing which it said it will demand a compensation of Rs 1,000 crore from the yoga guru.

28-05-2021||Aditi Tandon||Foreign vaccines not in free supply, working for imports soon: Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 27Amid vaccine shortages and repeated questioning by states about dithering supplies, the government on Thursday said foreign vaccines were not in free supply and efforts were afoot to import them soon.In a statement, ‘Myths and facts’ about Covid vaccines and the Indian response, the government said it was engaged with foreign manufacturers on imports and had done its best to ramp up domestic production and added that the failure of states to procure directly from foreign makers reaffirmed what the Centre had been saying all along – the vaccines are in short supply globally.The government rebuffed suggestions of child vaccination by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal saying these decisions had to be guided by science and could not be a function of what some politicians suggested.WHO has not recommended vaccination in children yet, the Centre said, adding that the compulsory licensing debate was redundant because the challenge was not acquiring the vaccine formula but technology to develop and use that vaccine.“The Centre has remained engaged with major international vaccine manufacturers from mid-2020. Multiple rounds of discussions have happened with Pfizer, J&J and Moderna and we have offered all assistance to them to supply or manufacture vaccines in India. However, it is not that their vaccines are available in free supply. Buying vaccines internationally is not similar to buying off-the-shelf items. Vaccines are in limited supply globally, and companies have their own priorities, game-plans and compulsions in allocating finite stocks. They also give preference to countries of their origin just as our own vaccine makers have done unhesitatingly for us,” a government statement said, again “requesting” international vaccine makers to come and make in India – for India and the world.The government said after Pfizer indicated vaccine availability, it was working with the firm for the earliest possible import and added that Sputnik vaccine tech-transfer to Indian companies had been concluded and manufacturing would start soon.The Centre said no application of any foreign manufacturer for approval was pending with the drugs controller.“We have eased entry of vaccines approved by US FDA, EMA, UK's MHRA and Japan's PMDA, and WHO's Emergency Use Listing into India in April. The provision has now been further amended to waive the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries,” the government said two days after Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the Centre had not approved Pfizer and Moderna.On local production of vaccines, the government said only one Indian company (Bharat Biotech) had intellectual property rights for Covaxin and the Centre had ensured that three other companies start production of Covaxin apart from enhancing Bharat Biotech’s own plants from one to four.“Covaxin production by Bharat Biotech is being increased from under 1 crore per month to 10 crore per month by October. Three PSUs will together aim to produce up to 4 crore doses by December. Serum Institute is ramping up Covishield production of 6.5 crore doses per month to 11 crore doses per month. Sputnik will be manufactured by six companies coordinated by Dr Reddy’s. Efforts of Zydus Cadila, BioE and Gennova are being backed for their respective indigenous vaccines through liberal funding under Covid Suraksha scheme and technical support at national laboratories,” said the government, assuring estimated production of over 200  crore doses by the Indian vaccine industry by the end of 2021.“How many countries can even dream of such an enormous capacity, and that too across conventional as well as cutting-edge DNA and mRNA platforms?” asked the Centre.On compulsory licensing, it said it is not an attractive option since it is not the ‘formula’ that matters, but active partnership, training of human resources, sourcing of raw materials and highest levels of bio-safety labs.“Tech transfer is the key and that remains in the hands of the company that has carried out R&D. We have gone one step ahead of Compulsory Licensing and are ensuring active partnership between Bharat Biotech and three entities to enhance production of Covaxin. Similar mechanism is being followed for Sputnik. Moderna had said in October 2020 that it would not sue any company which makes its vaccines, but still not one company has done it, which shows licensing is the least of the issues. If vaccine-making was so easy, why would even the developed world be so short of vaccine doses?” the Centre asked.The government also rejected accusations that it had abdicated its responsibility to the states and said the Central Government was doing all the heavy-lifting, from funding vaccine manufacturers to giving them quick approvals to ramping up production to bringing foreign vaccines to India.“The vaccine procured by the Centre is supplied wholly to the states for free administration to people. The states know this. The Government of India has merely enabled states to try procuring vaccines on their own, on their explicit requests. The states knew the production capacity in the country and the difficulties in procuring vaccines directly from abroad. The Government ran the entire vaccine programme from January to April and it was quite well-administrated compared to the situation in May. But states, who had not even achieved good coverage of health-care workers and frontline workers in three months wanted to open up the process of vaccination and wanted more decentralisation,” said the Centre, noting that health being a state subject, a liberalised vaccine policy was drafted after incessant requests by states to give states more power.“The fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirm what we have been telling the states from day one - vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice,” the Centre said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foreign-vaccines-not-in-free-supply-working-for-imports-soon-centre-259267
28-05-2021||New Delhi||Twitter breaks silence after police raid, alleges intimidation over 'manipulated media' tags||Twitter on Thursday called the visit by Delhi Police to its offices a form of "intimidation" and said it was concerned about its employees and the potential threat to freedom of expression.Twitter had marked several tweets by ruling BJP leaders on alleged strategy document of opposition to target the government over COVID as containing 'manipulated media', which prompted the police to visit its offices late on Monday. Opposition Congress has disputed the document, calling it fake.Also readNew rules designed to prevent misuse of social media; WhatsApp users have nothing to fear: PrasadNew digital rules: IT Ministry demands compliance report from social media companiesIn its first official statement after the Delhi Police visited the company's offices in Delhi and in Gurugram to serve notice to its country managing director about an investigation into the 'manipulated media' tag, Twitter said it will continue to be strictly guided by principles of transparency and protecting freedom of expression.The company said it will "strive" to comply with applicable law in India to keep its service available in the country but will "advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation.""Right now, we are concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve," Twitter said in a statement."We, alongside many in civil society in India and around the world, have concerns with regards to the use of intimidation tactics by the police in response to enforcement of our global Terms of Service, as well as with core elements of the new IT rules."            The social network reiterated its commitment to India as a vital market, but criticised new IT rules and regulations that it said "inhibit free, open public conversation."               In the new digital rules, social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter have been asked to identify within 36 hours the origin of a flagged message as well as conduct additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer."We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian government and believe it is critical to adopt a collaborative approach. It is the collective responsibility of elected officials, industry and civil society to safeguard the interests of the public," it said.The San Francisco-based company said it is deeply committed to India, and that its service has proven vital for public conversation and is a source of support during the pandemic.According to Twitter, the company is particularly concerned about the requirement to make an individual (the compliance officer) criminally liable for content on the platform, the requirements for proactive monitoring, and the blanket authority to seek information about its users.This, it said, represents dangerous overreach that is inconsistent with open, democratic principles.The microblogging platform said it was recently served with a non-compliance notice and has withheld a portion of the content identified in the blocking order under its ‘Country Withheld Content policy'.The content identified was originally reported to Twitter in the blocking orders issued since February 2021.Twitter maintained that the content reported in the original order constitutes protected, legitimate free speech, under Indian and international law, and that it has formally communicated this to the government.It added that the platform has not taken any action on verified accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists and politicians, in line with its principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression.Twitter argued that the escalated content constituted legitimate free speech and yet, the platform was compelled to withhold in response to a non-compliance notice as not doing so poses penal consequences with many risks for Twitter employees.The platform said it has been in regular dialogue with the IT Ministry to explain the nature of the content and why it should continue to be available on the service.The company has urged the Ministry of Electronics and IT to publish these standard operating protocols on procedural aspects of compliance for public consultation and has sought a minimum of three months extension in order to implement the rules.Twitter said it continues to accept grievances from users and law enforcement via its existing grievance redressal channel.

28-05-2021||New Delhi||January 26 violence: Police say mob aimed to turn Red Fort into farmers' protest site||The Delhi Police, in its charge sheet, has claimed that the violence at Red Fort on January 26 as part of the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws by the Centre was a "conspiracy to capture the place and convert it into a new protest site", sources said.The sources said the police charge sheet has also alleged that the violence was part of a “deep-rooted and premeditated conspiracy” and an occasion like Republic Day was chosen to tarnish the image of the Central government at home and abroad.To support its contention, the sources said, the Police have also provided the court data on the sudden increase in the number of purchases of the tractors and trolleys in Haryana and Punjab during a few days before the planned rally in Delhi by the agitating farmers.The Charge sheet in connection with the violence at Red Fort on Republic Day has named actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu and others as accused in the case. It was filed before a magistrate in Tis Hazari on May 17. The Court listed it for May 28 for further hearing and taking cognizance of the charges.On Republic Day, protestors allegedly did not follow the prearranged route and broke barricades to enter Delhi, clashed with police, and vandalised property in several parts of the national capital during the farmers’ tractor rally. They also entered the Red Fort and unfurled their flags from its ramparts.Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.A total of 43 different cases were registered with the Crime Branch, Special Cell, and local police stations and over 150 persons were arrested in connection with various cases relating to Republic Day violence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/january-26-violence-police-say-mob-aimed-to-turn-red-fort-into-farmers-protest-site-259241
28-05-2021||Saint John's (Antigua)/New Delhi||Dominica has agreed to Choksi's repatriation to India, Antigua will not accept him back: PM  Browne||Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne has said that fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi, who has been found in Dominica, will be repatriated to India and Indian authorities are in touch with those in Dominica.In an exclusive interview with ANI, Browne said Dominica had agreed to Choksi's repatriation and Antigua would not accept him back.Browne said he had requested PM Skerrit and law enforcement in Dominica not to return Choksi to Antigua where he had legal and constitutional protection as citizen."We've requested that he be detained and to make arrangements with Dominican government to have him returned to India," he said.Choksi is wanted by investigative agencies in India in the Rs 12,000 crore PNB scam on charges of fraud. He went missing on Sunday from Antigua and a manhunt was launched by the Antigua police."He was found in Dominica. He may have entered the island illegally, possibly by boats. Dominican government is cooperating with Antiguan and Indian governments. We have requested Dominican law-enforcement agencies not to return him to Antigua where he has legal and constitutional rights as a citizen. We specifically requested them to have Indian law-enforcement agencies to make necessary arrangements to have him returned directly to India," Browne told ANI."I am pretty sure. I am not aware that he is a citizen of Dominica and that he'd have enjoyed any constitutional protection, so on that basis it will be easy for Dominica to deport him," Browne said when asked if Choksi would be repatriated."Dominica has agreed (for Mehul Choksi's repatriation). We'll not accept him back. He made a monumental error by skipping island. Dominican government and law enforcement are cooperating and we have informed Indian government to have him repatriated to India," he said.Browne said Indian and Antiguan authorities are in touch with the Dominican government."We have asked the Dominican government to detain him for entering their country illegally, to make him persona non grata, and have him deported directly to India," he said.On late Wednesday, Choksi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal, confirmed his being found in Dominicia.
