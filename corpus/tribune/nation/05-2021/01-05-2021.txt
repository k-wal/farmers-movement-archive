The Congress has decided to withdraw our spokespersons from election debates.”Surjewala also said party leaders would otherwise be available for comment.“We may win, we may lose, but at a time when people are looking for oxygen, beds, medicines, ventilators; our duty tells us to stand by them, work with them to heal and help. In solidarity with India,” he said.All exit polls have predicted major losses for the Congress in tomorrow’s election cycle.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-to-skip-election-result-debates-on-sunday-246856
01-05-2021||New Delhi||World shaken by India’s COVID-19 situation; Modi govt focussed on imagery, brand-building: Rahul Gandhi||As India logged a world record of over four lakh coronavirus infections on Saturday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the entire world is shaken by what is happening here and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “dropping the ball and throwing it to states” after prematurely taking credit for having “won against COVID-19” when the second wave was already underway.“Rely on yourself is the motto. No one will come to help you. Definitely, not the prime minister,” Gandhi said, while alleging that the COVID-19 situation has gone completely out of control for the Modi government, and wondered whether it was their way of making the states and the citizens truly ‘Aatmanirbhar’.In an exclusive interview to PTI, the former Congress chief alleged that the government completely failed to understand or to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, right from the very beginning, despite repeated warnings including from scientists.Training his guns on the prime minister and Home Minister Amit Shah, Gandhi said India must be the only country in the world facing this massive pandemic without the guidance of an expert and empowered group that is charged with fighting the virus and protecting the people, with planning ahead, anticipating needs and taking the decisions that will result in swift action to save lives.“They continuously ignored rising cases and were busy instead with election campaigns. They encouraged super-spreader events. They even bragged about them. Our Prime Minister and Home Minister were not even wearing masks in public over the past few months. What sort of a message is that sending to citizens?” Gandhi said.He was referring to election rallies that were recently held for five assemblies for West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Leaders of all major parties including BJP and Congress participated in rallies, but decided to curtail the size of meetings and even cancelled some towards the end of the campaign for West Bengal when cases began rising more sharply.Gandhi, who was among the first to cancel his rallies and had also urged other political leaders to do so, noted that the second COVID-19 wave is a tsunami that has brought absolute devastation and has destroyed everything in its way.The former Congress chief termed the story of vaccine pricing in the country as one of “discount sales” and a “complete eyewash” alleging that the vaccine makers first marked up the prices and then reduced that while making a show of the entire exercise.Asked who is responsible for the current situation, Gandhi said, “The prime minister is at fault. He runs a highly centralised and personalised government machinery, is solely and substantially devoted to building his own brand, is utterly focused on imagery rather than substance.”         “The fact is that this government completely failed to understand or to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic—right from the very beginning, despite repeated warnings,” he alleged.Attacking the Modi Government over the handling of the situation, he alleged it is “plainly arrogant and focuses on perception over reality”.“Now that the situation is completely out of control, they have dropped the ball and thrown it to the states... The need of the hour is to hold hands, work together and heal our people,” Gandhi said.Gandhi alleged that the government declared victory against the virus too soon and that this was “absolute insanity” and demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of the nature of what this virus was.The only way to fight Corona is with humility and by realising that you are faced with a relentless opponent, who can adapt and is very resilient, he said, noting that the prime minister had an entire year to better prepare, to protect India, and to think through this crisis but did nothing.“The Modi Government was both grossly negligent and blindly overconfident. The BJP announced the end of the pandemic and congratulated the Prime Minister for his ‘success’ even as the second wave was just beginning. The Prime Minister himself is on record as having said that India had successfully fought the pandemic and won. In reality, there was no coherent strategy,” he said.The former Congress chief said the only solution we have is vaccination and India is supposed to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world.“And yet, India is desperately short of vaccines. We are making them, why were our people not the first in line to be vaccinated? If that is not a failure to plan and execute, what is?” Gandhi said since the start of the pandemic in 2020, he warned the government about the disaster ahead if urgent steps to prepare were not taken, but they attacked me and ridiculed me. “It’s not just me—anyone who tried to sound the alarm, the state callously and thoughtlessly ignored,” he said.He alleged that the Modi Government let this virus enter India through our airports in February and March of 2020 and then it panicked and without consultation or thought imposed the world’s harshest lockdown.Gandhi alleged that this is a government that wants to control everything. “When cases went down, they declared victory, and the Prime Minister took all the credit as he always does. Now that the situation is terrible, why are you blaming the states?” He said Congress is willing to support the government in this crisis, but the problem arises when the government doesn’t believe in consultation, in carrying everyone along, in tapping expertise it lacks.“This government seems to think that acknowledging help is needed is a sign of weakness. The hubris and pettiness of this government is unbelievable,” he said.On the Madras High Court recently accusing the Election Commission of being a super spreader, Gandhi said the Court was echoing a widely held view.In the past 7 years, like so many other institutions, the Election Commission of India has also crumbled and “The Court has said what it believes, I don’t want to make any further comment. Let your readers judge for themselves.” He said our institutions are a warning system—they give us feedback and information on how to respond to crisis but our institutions have been completely destroyed and taken over.“The press, judiciary, election commission, bureaucracy - none of them have played their role of guardian/watchdog. This means India today is like a ship in a storm, sailing without any information.“Corona is just part of the problem—the real problem is that India now doesn’t have the capacity to respond to any major crisis because of what has been done to its systems over the last six years,” he said.

01-05-2021||New Delhi||EC moves SC against Madras HC observations on surge in COVID-19 cases||The Election Commission (EC) moved the Supreme Court on Saturday, challenging the critical observations made by the Madras High Court holding it responsible for a surge in COVID-19 cases in the country, saying the remarks were “uncalled for, blatant and disparaging”.A bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah would hear the appeal of the poll panel against the orders of the high court on Monday.The high court had, on April 26, castigated the EC for the surge in COVID-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic, holding it “singularly” responsible for the spread of the viral disease, called it the “the most irresponsible institution” and even said its officials may be booked under murder charges.The poll panel allowing political parties to take out rallies and organise meetings had led to the surge in COVID cases, the court had observed.The EC’s appeal against these remarks was trashed by the division bench of the high court on April 30, leading the poll watchdog to approach the top court.“We have filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the high court orders,” EC’s counsel Amit Sharma told PTI.The EC, in its appeal in the apex court, said the high court’s remarks were “uncalled for, blatantly disparaging and derogatory”.The division bench of the high court, on April 26, made the stinging observation on a plea moved by Tamil Nadu’s Transport Minister MR Vijayabaskar, who was the AIADMK candidate from Karur in the April 6 Assembly polls, seeking a direction to the authorities concerned to ensure a fair counting of votes on May 2 in his constituency by taking effective steps and ensuring proper arrangements while following the COVID-19 protocols.Since a total of 77 candidates were in fray in Karur, it would be very difficult to accommodate their agents in the counting hall. It may affect the observance of the protocols, the petitioner had alleged.When the EC’s counsel told the judges that all necessary steps were being taken, the bench shot back, saying by allowing the political parties to take out rallies and organise meetings, it (commission) had paved the way for a resurgence of the deadly virus.Irked over the submission made by the EC’s counsel that all precautionary measures would be taken at the counting centres, the chief justice replied that the poll panel must be “singularly” held responsible for the sudden surge in the number of coronavirus cases in the country.The bench had even said that EC officials may be booked under murder charges.“Public health is of paramount importance and it is distressing that constitutional authorities have to be reminded in such regard. It is only when a citizen survives that he will be able to enjoy the rights that a democratic republic guarantees,” the bench had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-moves-sc-against-madras-hc-observations-on-surge-in-covid-19-cases-246852

01-05-2021||New Delhi||Enough is enough, says Delhi HC after 12 deaths in Batra Hospital||Taking note of 12 deaths at Batra Hospital in the national capital due to lack of oxygen supply, the Delhi High Court on Saturday directed the Centre to supply 490 MT of allocated oxygen to Delhi during the day itself by whatever means or face contempt of court action. “Water has gone over our head. Now we mean business. Enough is enough,” a visibly upset Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said.“We direct the Central Government to ensure that NCT of Delhi receives its allocated supply of 490 MT positively today, by whatever means,” the Bench ordered. As Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma requested deferment of the order till Monday or at least for 30 minutes, the Bench said “Do you mean we will shut our eyes to people dying in Delhi?”It said, “Considering the fact that Delhi is not an industrial state, and does not have availability of cryogenic tankers of its own which could be requisitioned under the Disaster Management Act—like other states have done, it falls upon the central government to arrange the tankers as well, so that the allocation made to Delhi could be fulfilled, lest it remains only a paper allocation.” “The central government shall ensure availability of cryogenic tankers as well for the said supply,” it said, posting the matter for further hearing on Monday.The high court noted that the allocation to Delhi, which was earlier of 480 MT (since April 20), and now was 490 MT has not been fulfilled even for a single day. “In case, this order is not implemented, the concerned officers of the central government viz. Mr. Piyush Goyal and Ms. Sunita Dawra shall remain present during the hearing on 03.05.2021. Looking at the situation, we make it clear that we may even consider initiating Contempt Proceedings in case of non-compliance,” the HC said. Earlier, senior counsel Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, submitted that while Delhi’s demand was 700MT, allocated oxygen was 490MT, out of which the suppliers had made a voluntary commitment of supply of 445MT. The quantity on Delhi border, for today, was 312 MT only, a shortfall of over 100 MT, he added.“Our tankers are not given priority. There is no timing or schedule given to us. We are dealing in SOS even today. My officers will have a mental breakdown”, he said.The HC also sought data on daily COVID-19 admissions and discharges from government and private hospitals in the capital since April 1.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enough-is-enough-says-delhi-hc-after-12-deaths-in-batra-hospital-246842
01-05-2021||Mumbai||On first day, 1,000 people in 18-44 group inoculated in Mumbai||The vaccination drive for the people in the age group of 18 to 44 years took off in Mumbai with limited access even as the city civic body stressed to have achieved the set target of inoculating 1,000 people on the first day on Saturday.A senior Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) official said the civic body has decided to increase the target of inoculating the individuals in the 18-44 age group to 2,500 on Sunday.“We have decided to vaccinate 200 people from the 18-44 age category today at each of all the five centres and we have fully achieved this target. Each centre was supposed to vaccinate 200 people,” Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani told PTI.The BMC has identified five centres for COVID-19 vaccination for the age group 18-44 at Nair Hospital, BKC Jumbo Facility, Cooper Hospital, Seven Hills Hospital and Rajawadi Hospital.The vaccination for the above age group was allowed only through prior registration and walk-ins at the centres are not allowed to avoid crowding.Kakani said the BMC has decided to increase the target to inoculate 500 individuals in the 18-44 age group at each centre on Sunday.“It means we will vaccinate 2,500 people from this category tomorrow (Sunday),” he said.Kakani said a separate drive for the above-45 age group will continue depending upon the supply of vaccines from the Centre.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said the vaccine doses for the 18-44 age group will be administered as per availability and people should not crowd vaccination centres.Vaccination for the citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 against COVID-19 is free at government hospitals, but citizens will have to pay for the jabs at private facilities.Mumbai’s COVID-19 caseload stood at 6,48,624 as of April 30 while the overall fatality count is 13,161, as per the civic data.Meanwhile, despite the appeal by the CM not to flock vaccination centres, a vaccination centre in suburban Andheri saw a huge crowd of people earlier in the day.“Many people came for vaccination without prior appointments at the Andheri centre which affected the overall procedure. As per new instructions, only those people having a prior appointment are allowed to be inoculated,” a BMC official said.He said people in general are excited about getting jabs even as the shortage of doses is causing panic due to the surge in COVID-19 infections as well as fatalities.“(In earlier phases) when people were hesitant to get themselves vaccinated and adequate supply of vaccines was available, we had decided to vaccinate every eligible person visiting the centre. We had even administered vaccine doses to those people who did not register themselves on Co-WIN application,” the official recalled.However, with a growing demand for vaccines by other states, the supply to Maharashtra is restricted, the official added.Mayor Kishori Pednekar has also appealed to the citizens not to crowd at vaccination centres, saying social distancing norms must be followed.Municipal Commissioner I S Chahal had said on Friday that the COVID-19 test positivity rate in Mumbai dropped below 10 per cent to 9.94 per cent as of April 29 despite conducting nearly 44,000 tests.

01-05-2021||New Delhi||Counting halls up by 200 pc due to COVID norms; nearly a lakh personnel to count votes on Sunday||Beginning 8 am on Sunday, the counting of votes for the 822 Assembly seats spread across West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry will take place at 2,364 counting halls following the COVID-19 protocols, the Election Commission (EC) said on Saturday.In 2016, the total number of counting halls was 1,002. The over-200-per cent increase is due to the distancing norms being followed by the poll panel to curb the spread of the coronavirus.West Bengal will have the maximum number of 1,113 counting halls, Kerala 633, Assam 331, Tamil Nadu 256 and Puducherry 31, the EC said.Another reason the commission has attributed to the increase in the number of counting halls is the jump in the figure of postal ballots used in the five Assembly polls.“The commission’s measures to extend the postal ballot facilities to the electors in the categories of senior citizens (those above 80 years), people with disablities and those affected by the coronavirus witnessed an increase of 400 per cent in the number of postal ballots (from 2.97 lakh in 2016 to 13.16 lakh in 2021) in the four states and a Union Territory,” it said.The commission has designated 822 returning officers and more than 7,000 assistant returning officers for the purpose of counting of votes in the four states and the Union Territory of Puducherry.Nearly 95,000 counting officials, including micro-observers, will perform the task of counting.No candidates or their agents will be allowed inside the counting halls without a negative coronavirus report, according to the latest result-day guidelines issued by the EC.According to the information received from the state chief electoral officers (CEOs), the contesting candidates have given the details of nearly 1.5 lakh counting agents (including substitutes) in the four states and the UT.More than 90 per cent of them have already undergone RTPCR or RAT tests. The remaining are being provided with the test facility by the district election officers on Saturday.Test reports from any authorised laboratory would also be accepted, the EC said.This is also being followed for the counting of votes in the bypolls held to Lok Sabha and Assembly seats across the country.The media authorised by the commission to cover the counting process is also being facilitated with coronavirus tests. Around 12,000 mediapersons have been given the authority to cover the counting.Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra reviewed the counting arrangements with senior EC officers and the CEOs of the four states and the UT at a virtual meeting on Saturday.He directed that all laid-down instructions of the EC must be adhered to. He also directed that the counting halls must be fully COVID guidelines compliant.The CEC complimented the CEOs for the successful completion of polling in the challenging situations of the pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/counting-halls-up-by-200-pc-due-to-covid-norms-nearly-a-lakh-personnel-to-count-votes-on-sunday-246834

01-05-2021||New Delhi||Crucial assembly election results on Sunday in shadow of raging COVID pandemic||Counting of votes will be held on Sunday in the high-stakes Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry assembly elections, overshadowed by the raging COVID pandemic, as the BJP seeks to consolidate its hold over more states and the Congress along with its allies attempts to regain lost turf.There will be 2,364 counting halls as compared to 1,002 halls in 2016 in 822 assemble constituencies, a more than 200 per cent increase, in view of the COVID guidelines, according to the Election Commission which had drawn flak from the courts over the conduct of polls during the pandemic.At least 15 rounds of sanitisation will be carried out at each polling centre, besides social distancing and other precautions, including a ban on gatherings, will be strictly followed, officials said.They said counting of votes will begin at 8 AM and continue late into the night.  As many as 1,100 counting observers will watch the process and candidates and agents will have to produce a negative COVID test report or double dose of vaccination certificate to get an entry.Exit polls have forecast a tight contest between the incumbent Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress and the BJP in the crucial West Bengal assembly polls and put the ruling saffron combine ahead in Assam while projecting that the Left alliance will retain Kerala, a feat unseen in four decades.For the Congress, the exit polls predicted that it may fall short in Assam and Kerala and lose in Puducherry to the opposition alliance of AINRC-BJP-AIADMK.The only good news for the Congress was from Tamil Nadu, where the exit polls predicted that the DMK-led opposition alliance, of which it is a part, will trounce the AIADMK-BJP coalition.The poll results in the four states and the UT are also likely to reflect how the handling of the COVID pandemic has played on the voters’ mind.Polling was held in eight phases in West Bengal between March 27 and April 29, in Assam in three stages on March 27, April 1 and 6, while votes were cast in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry in a single phase on April 6, when the COVID surge had begun in many of the states.Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal are among the 11 states that account for 78.22 per cent of the total active cases, according to the Health ministry.A three-tier security arrangement is in place in West Bengal’s 108 counting centres and at least 292 observers have been appointed and 256 companies of central forces deployed across 23 districts of the state that voted in a gruelling election marred by violence and vicious personal attacks.The result will decide whether Mamata Banerjee, who has been in power for 10 years and is arguably fighting the toughest poll of her political career, has been able to thwart the challenge by the battle-hardened election army of the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.The BJP, which had just three seats in the 294-member Assembly in the 2016 Assembly polls and went to win 18 out of 42 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, had pulled out all stops in the state in a determined bid to oust Banerjee, a vocal critic of Prime Minister Modi, and add another state to its tally of 17.The Left-Congress alliance is third main contestant in the state.In Tamil Nadu, both Dravidian parties—AIADMK and DMK—went into the election without their stalwarts, J Jayalalithaa and M Karunanidhi.Chief Minister K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam will cement their position as successors of Jayalalithaa if the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (AIADMK) retains power though it faces an uphill task especially after the rout in the 2019 Lok Sabha election when the DMK-led alliance won 38 out of 39 seats.The AIADMK had scored successive wins in 2011 and in 2016, when Jayalalithaa bucked the anti-incumbency trend—the first by anyone in nearly three decades in the state.After a narrow defeat in the last assembly election where several exit polls had predicted his party’s win, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief M K Stalin spearheaded a determined election campaign this time and vigorously toured the state to take on the ruling AIADMK.AIADMK ally BJP, which had not won any seat in the last polls, is contesting in 20 constituencies. Another AIADMK ally PMK is contesting from 23 constituencies.The Congress, an ally of the DMK, is in the fray in 25 Assembly segments.Actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam-led combine is also in the fray.There are 75 counting centres across the state and all arrangements are in place to smoothly conduct the exercise, which would be monitored by observers, authorities said.In Kerala, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is seeking to break the state’s four-decade-old trend of swinging between the communists and the Congress-led United Democratic Front.As many as 957 candidates, including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, 11 of his Cabinet colleagues, Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy, ‘Metroman’ E Sreedharan, former Union Minister K J Alphons and BJP State president K Surendran, among others, were in fray in the election to the 140 seats.The BJP,which had won one seat in 2016, is confident of garnering more seats this time           The poll is significant for Kerala Congress (M) chief Jose K Mani who recently snapped decades-long ties with the UDF and joined hands with the Left front.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had camped in the state for several days and taken part in dozens of corner meetings and rallies, with the party hoping that the state will herald a turn in its electoral fortunes after a series of disappointments in recent years.In Assam, the ruling BJP is facing a challenge from ‘Mahajoth’ or ‘Grand Alliance’ comprising the Congress, AIUDF, Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), CPI(M), CPI, CPI(ML) Liberation, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM).The BJP has an alliance with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) and the Gana Suraksha Party (GSP),         The saffron party had scripted history by winning the traditionally Congress-dominated state in 2016, after remaining on the fringes.In Puducherry, the AINRC-led NDA and the Congress-led Secular Democratic alliance are in a contest. While AINRC fielded candidates in 16 of the total 30 constituencies the BJP is contesting nine seats while the AIADMK is contesting five seats.The Congress-led government in the Union Territory had collapsed just before the elections.Counting will also be held in four Lok Sabha seats and 13 assembly seats across 13 states where bypolls were held.The EC has banned victory roadshows and vehicle rallies.India’s daily coronavirus tally crossed the grim milestone of four lakh on Saturday, while the death toll rose to 2,11,853 with 3,523 fresh fatalities.

Simultaneously, please advise the SPCCC for the site preparation,” he added.The Adviser in the PMO has also asked the MoH&FW official for organising necessary training for use of these ventilators and this could be done by the selected vendors.In view of the alarming number of COVID-19 positive cases in Delhi, the SPCCC was reopened on April 26 with 500 bed facilities but no arrangements were made for treating the critical patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pmo-directs-health-ministry-to-provide-150-ventilators-to-itbp-run-covid-facility-246820
01-05-2021||New Delhi||Reliance ramps up production of medical-grade oxygen to 1,000 tonnes a day||Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd has ramped up production of medical oxygen to 1,000 tonnes per day, making it India’s largest producer of medical-grade liquid oxygen from a single location.Reliance ramped up production from near-zero to 1,000 tonnes per day and now produces over 11 per cent of India’s total production of medical-grade liquid oxygen -- meeting the needs of nearly every one in ten patients, a company said in a statement.Ambani is personally supervising the scale-up of production and transportation at Jamnagar in Gujarat.In April, the firm supplied over 15,000 tonnes of medical-grade liquid oxygen free of cost. It airlifted 24 ISO containers for transporting oxygen from Saudi Arabia, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Thailand - creating an additional 500 tonnes of transportation capacity for India.Private firms are supplementing efforts to augment oxygen supplies as the country battles its worst health crisis. India posted a record daily rise of 4,01,993 new coronavirus cases after 10 consecutive days of over 3 lakh infections. Deaths from COVID-19 jumped by 3,523 over the past 24 hours, taking the total toll in India to 2,11,853.“As India grapples with an unprecedented new wave of the COVID pandemic, Reliance has risen to the occasion by making an all-out effort to save precious lives,” the statement said.A critical need of the hour is assured availability of medical-grade liquid oxygen for the treatment of severely ill patients across the country.“Traditionally, Reliance is not a manufacturer of medical-grade liquid oxygen. Yet, starting from nil before the pandemic, Reliance has now become India’s largest producer of this life-saving resource from a single location.“At its refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Jamnagar and other facilities, Reliance now produces over 1,000 tonnes of medical-grade liquid oxygen per day — or over 11 per cent of India’s total production – meeting the needs of nearly every one in ten patients,” it said.Under the personal supervision of Ambani, Reliance has adopted a two-pronged approach to strengthen the availability of medical oxygen in India - refocusing several industrial processes at Jamnagar and other facilities for rapid scale-up in production of medical-grade liquid oxygen, and augmenting loading and transportation capacities to ensure its swift and safe supply to the states and Union territories.The firm’s oil refineries and petrochemical plants produce industrial oxygen as part of processes. This was scrubbed to produce high-purity medical grade oxygen.Also, it converted nitrogen tankers into transport trucks to move medical grade oxygen.Commenting on these initiatives, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited, said: “For me and all of us at Reliance, nothing is more important than saving every life as India battles against a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an immediate need to maximise India’s production and transportation capacities for medical grade oxygen.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reliance-ramps-up-production-of-medical-grade-oxygen-to-1-000-tonnes-a-day-246819
01-05-2021||Vijay Mohan||Defence ministry asks retired Armed Forces doctors to join battle against COVID-19 through online platforms||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 1With the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelming the medical infrastructure in the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) today appealed to retired armed forces doctors to render their service through online platforms.“The country has been experiencing the second surge of COVID-19 pandemic since the past one month which needs an accelerated optimised time-bound synergic effort at a national level with the aim of reducing mortality and morbidity,” a memo issued today by the Directorate General Armed Forces Medical Services in the MoD states.Pointing out that the nation as a whole, including the Armed Forces, have been contributing their might in efforts to contain the pandemic and provide all possible assistance to the countrymen, the memo adds that the veterans constitute a large group of the Armed Forces family who have served the nation with honour and are motivated, highly trained professionals who still have a lot to offer for a national cause.“Hence all veterans officers of the Armed Forces Medical Services are requested to register themselves on e-Sehat portal wherein they can offer their guidance, counselling and advice to many of their fellow countrymen and help provide succour in this hour of need,” the memo states.According to reports, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, conveyed to the Prime Minister in a briefing earlier this week that Armed Forces doctors who retired and those who took pre-mature retirement in the last two years are also being recalled to serve in COVID-19 care facilities located in proximity of their residences. In addition, doctors on staff appointments at formation headquarters are being deployed in hospitals.e-Sehat is a cloud based platform for real time and live two-way interaction between a patient and a health-care professional, including specialists, using audio-visual telecommunications and auto-synchronizing medical diagnostic data through specialised IoT enabled medical diagnostic devices. With the spike in COVID-19 infections across the country creating unprecedented workload on hospitals, the armed forces augmented their medical facilities and assisted the civilian administration by opening their medical facilities to treat civilians, establishing and running quarantine and treatment centres and transporting essential supplies across the country.As part of augmenting the present capacity, the MoD recently extended the term of engagement of short service commissioned doctors serving in the Armed Forces till December 31, 2021. This implies that 238 doctors, who would have otherwise been released, will continue in service till the end of the year. In addition, additional doctors have also been hired by the Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-ministry-asks-retired-armed-forces-doctors-to-join%C2%A0battle-against-covid-19-through-online-platforms-246816
01-05-2021||New Delhi||Centre permits oxygen concentrator imports via post, courier for personal use under gift category||The government has allowed imports of oxygen concentrators for personal use through post, courier or e-commerce portals under the gift category amid increasing demand for oxygen due to rising COVID-19 cases, the commerce ministry said on Saturday.The exemption for oxygen concentrators is allowed only for a period till July 31, 2021, it said.Currently, all imported goods declared as gift with customs authorities attract customs duty and integrated GST.An oxygen concentrator is a medical device that concentrates oxygen from ambient air. It is in high demand due to increasing COVID-19 cases in the country. These concentrators capture and filter the air, unlike oxygen cylinders which can only store a fixed amount of oxygen.“The government has included the import of oxygen concentrators for personal use, through post, courier or e-commerce portals, in the list of exempted categories, where Customs clearance is sought as gifts,” the ministry said.Earlier, oxygen concentrators were not mentioned in the list. Now, it has been added on account of its high demand due to COVID-19 cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-permits-oxygen-concentrator-imports-via-post-courier-for-personal-use-under-gift-category-246813
01-05-2021||Washington||COVID crisis in India very serious, cases yet to peak: Biden Admn||The COVID-19 crisis in India is indeed very serious, the Biden Administration said on Friday, noting that the cases have not peaked yet.“I’m afraid that the crisis in India with the surge in the virus is indeed very, very serious.  India’s reporting an increasing number of cases almost every day.  The crisis has not peaked yet,” Gayle E Smith, the State Department Coordinator for Global COVID Response and Health Security told reporters at a news conference here.Smith explained that in a surge, there’s a lag time between when people are infected, when they become sick and when they may need care. “I think this is something that’s going to need urgent and persistent attention for some time. That’s why we have in the immediate sense been focused on key supplies like oxygen support, protective medical gear, vaccine manufacturing supplies, diagnostic tests and other things that are needed quite simply to respond to this immediate surge,” she said.The Biden Administration is looking at other things that can be done to build up supply chains within India so that there can be a more steady supply of all those things that are needed to manage this over time, Smith asserted.Smith said once the Administration received the request of items from India, the interagency quickly moved to get these approved. “There are a couple of outstanding things that agencies are working on. But again, we’ve rotated these goods in on a steady rhythm so far so I think it’s been a pretty prompt response,” Smith said. State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said the United States will continue to lead the world in confronting COVID-19. Smith also praised the role being played by the US corporate sector in this assistance effort towards India. “With the crisis in India, we have been very active on responding to that. Planes have landed with supplies. Our teams are closely engaged with the Government of India to see what else may be needed additionally,” she said.

01-05-2021||London||Nirav Modi moves UK High Court seeking permission to appeal decision against extradition||The fugitive diamond dealer Nirav Modi, who is wanted in India for allegedly defrauding Punjab National Bank (PNB) out of an estimated $2 billion, has filed a permission to appeal in the UK high court against his extradition to India.Modi, 50, who was arrested in March 2019 and has been held in the Wandsworth prison in south London ever since, was ordered to be extradited by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel on April 15.Westminster Magistrate's Court's judge Sam Goozee made a decision on February 25, finding Nirav Modi guilty on all the charges saying that the fugitive businessman had a case to answer for and should be returned to India.The Indian government alleges that Modi and his associates colluded with officials at the state-owned Punjab National Bank to defraud the bank out of more than USD 1.4 billion by using a credit facility known as Letters of Undertaking, a form of bank guarantee to facilitate international transactions.The court had been told that the proceeds of the fraud were then laundered through a series of shell companies manned by dummy directors and located in Dubai and Hong Kong. Modi is also charged with the destruction of evidence and intimidating witnesses.Modi, who had 14 days to appeal the decision, has approached the High Court of appeals on April 28 to appeal the decisions made by the lower court judge as well as home secretary Priti Patel.It will be decided by the court of appeals judge whether or not to grant the permission to appeal which is done on papers.Modi is likely to argue on the decision of his mental health issue which was dismissed by lower court judge Goozee saying he was not satisfied by evidence submitted by the defence about Modi's mental and emotional health and that he was satisfied that he was fit to plead once returned to India.If he is successful in obtaining the permission then the appeal will be heard by a single judge or division bench. Modi will need to demonstrate a strong reason to initiate the hearings for his appeal. The entire process can take a good few months given the Covid crisis around the world, especially in India where Modi is sought. If it’s rejected the UK will have 28 days to extradite him.

01-05-2021||Johannesburg||Indian-origin author, playwright Ronnie Govender dies of age-related illness in South Africa||Ronnie Govender, an internationally acclaimed Indian-origin author and playwright known for his books and theatre efforts reflecting the difficulties of the Indian and African communities under apartheid, has died of age-related illness. He was 87.Govender, who died in South Africa's city of Cape Town on Thursday, was the recipient of the Order of Ikhamanga, among the country's highest national orders, in 2008 for his contributions to democracy, peace and justice in the country through theatre.In the same year, the media did not miss the irony of his new book ‘In the Manure’ being launched in the beautiful sprawling gardens of the residence of Indian Consul General Navdeep Suri in Johannesburg.Govender's debut book, ‘Cato Manor Stories', won the 1997 Commonwealth Writers’ Prize for best first book in the Africa section.The book told tales of the Indian and African communities that lived side-by-side in the township in Durban before the minority white apartheid government uprooted them for forced resettlement in other separate ethnic townships.Govender's grandparents, who had arrived in South Africa as indentured labourers, had settled in Cato Manor, where they farmed on a small piece of land.Govender was also born there.Govender founded his own theatre company, the Shah Theatre Academy, because of the restrictions of the time not allowing participating in ‘white’ theatres.One of his plays, ‘The Lahnee's Pleasure', had the longest run across the country and received a lot of attention abroad.But in line with his firm resolve to support the anti-apartheid cultural boycott of South Africa, Govender steadfastly declined highly lucrative offers to tour abroad with the play.In 2014, Govender was honoured with a doctorate from the Durban University of Technology.His demise on Thursday was following a month-long age-related ailment, his family said.

01-05-2021||---||US epidemiologist Fauci suggests a few weeks' lockdown in India to break chain of coronavirus transmission||New Delhi, May 1Top US epidemiologist Anthony Fauci has suggested a lockdown for a few weeks in India as an immediate step to contain the spread of the coronavirus as its deadly second wave shows no signs of ebbing.Fauci, in an interview to The Indian Express, said another most important thing in the immediate is to get supplies of oxygen, medication, PPEs.He said looking at the magnitude of the crisis, India should look at putting together a crisis group that would meet and start getting things organised.Without naming any government, he said one of the things that should have been recognised that "victory was declared maybe too prematurely"."Well, one of the things you really need to do, to the extent that you can, is shut down temporarily the country, I think is important. If we want to time out and go back to what I said: there is the immediate, the intermediate, and the long range (measures to contain the virus).     "I think the most important thing in the immediate is to get oxygen, get supplies, get medication, get PPE, those kinds of things but also, one of the immediate things to do is to essentially call a shutdown of the country," said Fauci, who is the chief medical adviser to the Biden administration.He said when China had a big explosion of coronavirus cases a year ago, they completely shut down.Fauci said it is not necessary to shut down for six months, but it can be a temporary one to put an end to the cycle of transmission.So one of the things to be considered is to temporarily shut down, he said."Literally, lock down so that you wind up having less spread. No one likes to lock down the country. Well, that's a problem when you do it for six months," he said.But just for a few weeks of lockdown could have a significant impact on the dynamics of the outbreak.Some states have imposed a lockdown. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said lockdown should be the "last resort" to deal with the raging pandemic and asked states to convince migrant workers to stay put at their places of work with a guarantee for their lives and livelihood.Breaching it’s all previous records, India on Saturday hit a record daily high with over 4 lakh new infections, while the active cases crossed the 32-lakh mark.The second wave of the coronavirus has been wreaking havoc, infecting lakhs and killing thousands every day for the past few days. There have been cases where people have died due to lack of medical facilities, including oxygen. In many cases, families have to arrange oxygen for their patients as they are not able to get admission in hospitals."I heard from some of the people in the street bringing their mothers and their fathers and their sisters and their brothers searching for oxygen. They seem to think there really was not any organisation, any central organisation,” Fauci said.Underlining that vaccination plays a crucial role in handling the coronavirus situation, Fauci said if India, a country of 1.4 billion people, has fully vaccinated only two per cent of its total population, then it has a very long way to go."You've got to get supplies. You've got to make contractual arrangements with the various companies that are out there in the world. There are many companies that now have vaccines. I think you have to negotiate with them to try and get a commitment," he said."And also, India is the largest vaccine-producing country in the world. That's the thing — you should rev up your own capabilities to make vaccines,” he added.

01-05-2021||Washington||India pursued assertive foreign policy in 2020, says US Defence Intelligence Agency||India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pursued an assertive foreign policy in 2020 aimed at demonstrating the country's strength and its perception as a net provider of security in the strategically vital Indian Ocean Region, a top American intelligence agency has said.The Defence Intelligence Agency also told lawmakers adding that New Delhi also hardened its approach towards an aggressive China.“Throughout 2020, Narendra Modi's government pursued an assertive foreign policy aimed at demonstrating India's strength and its perception as a net provider of security in the Indian Ocean Region,” Scott Berrier, Gen Director of Defence Intelligence Agency told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during a Congressional hearing on worldwide threats.In the first months of the Covid pandemic, New Delhi played a leading role in delivering medical equipment to countries throughout South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, facilitating the evacuation of Indians and other South Asians from virus hotspots, he said on Friday.“India hardened its approach towards China following deterioration in bilateral relations that followed Chinese efforts to take Indian-claimed territory along the disputed Line of Actual Control border beginning in the summer of 2020,” Berrier said.In response to the June clash between Indian and Chinese troops, and the deaths of 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers, New Delhi responded by deploying an additional 40,000 troops, artillery, tanks, and aircraft to the disputed border, occupying strategic mountain passes in disputed territory, and sending Indian Navy ships to shadow Chinese ships in the Gulf of Aden, it said.India also implemented economic measures meant to signal its resolve against China, including banning Chinese mobile phone apps and taking steps to use trustworthy vendors of telecommunications, he told the lawmakers.According to Berrier, India also maintained an assertive approach on its border with Pakistan, refusing to engage in diplomatic dialogue in the absence of Pakistani action to end support to anti-India militant groups.Tensions remain high in the aftermath of the 2019 Pulwama terrorist attack and subsequent military reactions, and the Modi government's August 2019 action "to curtail Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy by revising the Indian Constitution".

We feel the impact of this devastating surge on our associates, families and friends across India, and it's important that we come together to support however we can,” Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart Inc, was quoted as saying in the statement.“We are working hard to combine Walmart's global capabilities and Flipkart's distribution network to ensure vital oxygen and supplies are made available to those who need them most. Our hearts are with everyone in India,” he added.According to the statement, the Walmart Foundation is donating USD 2 million to support various NGOs in India.A total of about USD 1 million will be allocated through the Walmart Foundation Disaster Relief Fund, a donor advised fund, to recommend support for Doctors for You to operate isolation centres and temporary hospitals, as well as provide personal protective equipment for frontline medical workers.The other USD 1 million will be allocated to GIVE Foundation Inc to support GiveIndia's Covid response fund, which will support physical infrastructure and equipment for the medical sector in India, prioritising the most impacted and vulnerable communities, it said.Walmart Canada will also support relief efforts through the Canadian Red Cross India Covid Response Appeal, funding ambulance and transport services for patients, quarantine isolation centres and other services, the media release said.Till Saturday, coronavirus cases in India hit a record daily high with over 4 lakh new infections being reported in the last 24 hours, while the active cases crossed the 32-lakh mark, according to data updated by the Union Health Ministry.The infection tally rose to 1,91,64,969 with 4,01,993 new cases, while the death toll increased to 2,11,853 with 3,523 daily new fatalities, the latest data showed.

01-05-2021||Washington||US to remain in communication with India on its needs to fight COVID-19: White House||The US will continue to maintain communication with India about its needs to address the COVID-19 crisis, the White House has said, as critical American aid supplies started arriving in the country.Two American military aircraft on Friday brought to India large amounts of emergency medical supplies as part of the Biden administration’s support to the country’s fight against a devastating wave of the coronavirus pandemic.The first consignment of the supplies was brought to Delhi in a C-5M Super Galaxy, one of the largest strategic airlift aircraft of the US Air Force, while the second shipment was delivered by a C-17 Globemaster.“We will continue to communicate with India about their needs,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday.The first military assistance flight that departed from Travis Air Force Base had cargo including 200 small oxygen cylinders, 223 large oxygen cylinders, regulators and pulse oximeters, she said.It also included approximately 1,84,000 rapid diagnostic tests and 84,000 N-95s masks. Psaki said that the Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his Indian counterpart External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to review ongoing US government efforts in support of the Indian government’s response.“He also noted the outpouring of support from US industries, our ongoing discussions, non-governmental institutions, and private citizens,” Psaki said.In all, the United States expects to deliver more than USD 100 million in medical supplies to India.The Pentagon said in the coming week, more oxygen cylinders will be sent, as will oxygen concentrators, oxygen generation units, additional personnel protective equipment, rapid diagnostic tests and therapeutics.“The US is also providing vaccine manufacturing supplies. In fact, the US has redirected its order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India, which will enable the country to make more than 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine,” said the Department of Defence.Meanwhile, top American Senator Elizabeth Warren in a letter to President Joe Biden urged him to leverage all tools and resources available to the United States to provide relief to India.“In light of this growing humanitarian crisis, I urge you to leverage all tools and resources available to the United States to provide relief to India,” Warren said in a letter to Biden.“While I am pleased by your commitment to providing transportation and logistics assistance as well as doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to India, there is a critical need for more to be done,” the top Democrat said.She also encouraged Biden to divert any excess supply of ventilators, PPE, oxygen, diagnostic equipment, as well as vaccines to India to help treat those in need and mitigate the spread of the virus.“India is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis that threatens its 1.4 billion citizens, and billions more around the world. I urge you to leverage all resources and explore all tools available to the United States to alleviate this crisis,” Warren said.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.

The friends and families of those in Australia are in extreme risk.”  Australia will also provide to India emergency medical supplies, including over 1,000 non-invasive ventilators.Apart from that, it has offered to supply a significant number of personal protective equipment (PPE), one million surgical masks, 100,000 surgical gowns, 100,000 goggles, 100,000 pairs of gloves and 20,000 face shields.

All the equipment inside, including the ventilators and the fridge used to store the medicines and also the beds, were turned to ashes," an eyewitness said.Some patients were charred beyond recognition and relatives found it difficult to identify their bodies.The blaring of the ambulances and fire tenders could be heard in the hospital's vicinity as dozens of such vehicles rushed to the hospital to douse the fire and also to shift the patients who survived the blaze to other hospitals.People were seen desperately trying to find out if their near and dear ones were safe inside the hospital.Along with the rescue teams, many residents were seen volunteering to rescue the patients and shift them to ambulances so that they could be taken to nearby hospitals.Several patients were shifted out on wheelchairs or by makeshift stretchers using cloth in absence of stretchers.Locals pitched in to help rescue the patients and take them to the ambulances and auto-rickshaws to shift them to other hospitals in time.Several vehicles of the district police also reached the spot to ensure that law and order remain under control.A relative of a patient who was shifted to the civil hospital here was seen searching for the case file in a heap of waste dumped after the fire.She said she was looking for the case file so that doctors at the hospital where he was taken could begin his treatment immediately.

01-05-2021||Washington||US exempts categories of students, academics, journalists from India travel ban||President Joe Biden has imposed restrictions on travel from India that stops most non-American citizens from entering the US for an indefinite period from May 4, citing the surging COVID-19 pandemic in the country.Biden issued a proclamation on Friday restricting travel from India starting on May 4.Certain categories of students, academics, journalists and individuals have been exempted from the ban, the US State Department said.US nationals, those having green cards, their non-citizen spouses and children below 21 years of age, are among the various categories exempted from the restrictions.The new travel restrictions have been imposed for an indefinite period and will require another presidential proclamation to end it.“I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as nonimmigrants, of non-citizens of the United States who were physically present within the Republic of India during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States,” says the proclamation signed by Biden on Friday.The decision has been taken at the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, which determined India is experiencing widespread, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.“The World Health Organization has reported that the Republic of India has had more than 18,375,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The magnitude and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic in India surging,” Biden said, adding that India accounts for over one-third of new global cases.The number of new cases in India is accelerating at a rapid rate, he said. Biden said there have been more than 3,00,000 average new daily cases in India over the past week.After reviewing the public health situation within India, the CDC has concluded that proactive measures are required to protect the nation’s public health from travellers entering the United States from that jurisdiction, he said.  “There is no question that it is a great tragedy, in terms of the loss of life, and as I have said before, and I will say again, we as a country have made a commitment to the people of India to support them,” Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters on Friday in Cincinnati, Ohio.According to the State Department, the travel ban exemption to certain categories is in line with a similar exemption that the US has granted to some categories of travellers from Brazil, China, Iran and or South Africa.“In keeping with the Department of State’s commitment to facilitate legitimate travel to the United States, Secretary (Antony) Blinken decided today to apply the same set of National Interest Exceptions to India that he had previously applied to all other regional travel restrictions currently in effect as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the State Department said.Students seeking to commence studies in the fall, academics, journalists and individuals who provide critical infrastructure support in countries affected by a geographic COVID-19 restriction may qualify for the exception, it said.This includes qualified applicants who have been present in India, Brazil, China, Iran, or South Africa, it added.The pandemic continues to limit the number of visas our embassies and consulates abroad are able to process, it said.As always, visa applicants should check the website of the nearest embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information about visa appointment availability, the State Department said.“As the global situation evolves, the Department continues to seek ways to process more visa applications, in line with science-based guidance from health authorities and with the health and safety of staff and applicants as our priority,” it said.In a national interest exemption issued by the State Department on April 26, which it said is good for India too, students with valid F-1 and M-1 visas intending to begin or continue an academic programme commencing August 1 or later do not need to contact an embassy or consulate to seek an individual exemption to travel.They may enter the United States no earlier than 30 days before the start of their academic studies.Students seeking to apply for new F-1 or M-1 visas should check the status of visa services at the nearest embassy or consulate.Those applicants who are found to be otherwise qualified for an F-1 or M-1 visa will automatically be considered for an NIE to travel, it said.The Department of State also continues to grant NIEs for qualified travellers seeking to enter the US for purposes related to humanitarian travel, public health response and national security.These travellers and any others who believe their travel to be in the United States’ national interest should also review the website of the nearest US embassy or consulate for instruction on how to contact them, it said.Meanwhile, the US embassy in New Delhi said: “We encourage US citizens who wish to depart India to take advantage of currently available commercial flights.“Airlines continue to operate dozens of direct flights weekly from India to the United States. Additional flight options remain available via transfers in Paris, Frankfurt, and Doha,” it said.Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers criticised President Biden for imposing restrictions on travel from India.“Restricting travel to our ally India while leaving our border open to Mexico is not rational,” Congressman Tim Burchett said in a tweet, soon after the White House announced Biden’s decision.Another Republican lawmaker Jodey Arrington also criticised Biden for this proclamation on travel.“Biden enacting an India travel ban while keeping the border open is like locking your front door, but leaving the back door wide open. I wonder if the Left will accuse him of being xenophobic and anti-Hindu,” Arrington asked.“As Biden bans flights from India, perhaps he should be reminded of a tweet he put out last year. Also, I thought travel bans were xenophobic,” Congresswoman Lauren Boebert said in a tweet.After former president Donald Trump imposed a travel ban from Europe, Biden, who was the Democratic presidential candidate at that time, had opposed it.

We want to make it very clear that if citizens communicate their grievances on social media and the Internet then it can’t be said it’s wrong information. We don’t want any clampdown on information,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said while hearing a suo motu PIL on Covid management.‘Why not buy 100% doses?’“We will treat it as a contempt of court if such grievances are considered for action,” said the Bench, which also included Justice LN Rao and Justice SR Bhat.Terming the second wave of the pandemic as a “national crisis”, it said, “There should be free flow of information… we should hear voices of citizens.”The UP Government had reportedly ordered strict action under the National Security Act against those allegedly creating panic by making “false appeals” for help for Covid patients on social media. However, the top court said, “Let a strong message go to all the states and their DGPs... clampdown on information is contrary to basic precepts.”Noting that the government should not leave vaccine pricing and distribution to manufacturers, the Bench sought to know why the Centre was not buying 100 per cent of the Covid vaccine doses as it was better placed to determine equity and disburse. It asked, “Why can’t the Centre follow the national immunisation programme policy with respect to Covid vaccines?”The top court — which had last week taken suo motu cognisance of the Covid management — will formally issue its order on Saturday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-take-coercive-action-over-sos-on-social-media-says-supreme-court-246499
01-05-2021||---||China reaches out amid surge, but India wary||New Delhi, April 30China on Friday made a major reachout to India through a letter from its President Xi Jinping to PM Narendra Modi followed by a telephonic conversation between Foreign Ministers Wang Yi and S Jaishankar. Following the delivery of relief from two aircraft, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken also spoke to Jaishankar to review the flow of equipment and material from America. The call came shortly after the Jaishankar-Wang conversation.Xi is the fourth major world leader this week to reach out to PM Modi after US President Joe Biden, Japan PM Yoshihide Suga and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In his letter, Xi Jinping expressed concern about the recent situation in India and said Beijing stood ready to strengthen cooperation in providing support and help in fighting the pandemic.The complexity of Sino-Indian ties came out in the conversation between Jaishankar and Wang. In terse social media posts, Jaishankar yielded little ground, refraining from thanking the Chinese side for the aid offers. Instead, Jaishankar highlighted the importance of “supply chains and air flights being kept open in these circumstances”, in an allusion to a Chinese air cargo company suspending its operations to India as well as to complaints from an Indian-American about Beijing blocking his purchases of Chinese equipment for dispatch to Delhi.

The government today tasked 14 regional centres of excellence, including AIIMS-New Delhi, PGI-Chandigarh, JIPMER-Puducherry and AIIMS-Bhubaneswar and Bhopal to conduct training of government, and private doctors across smaller towns and even villages in the management of Covid.The Centre also issued guidelines on the management of Covid in children with more and more infections being seen in those under 18 years. Guleria said it was crucial to reduce cases and appealed to people to launch “break the chain movement” by gifting masks to those who are not complying and also by preventing crowding.“Health infrastructure can work to a limit but if cases continue to rise like this, the situation will become very challenging,” the AIIMS chief warned.He said the second wave’s rate of rise had been too rapid for the health infrastructure to cope and the doubling rate of cases reduced drastically.“Going forward, proper management of Covid is the key. The pandemic is going to tier 2,3 cities. Training of doctors is needed to handle the disease. The ministry has formed 14 regional centres of excellence at 14 locations to conduct mentoring of doctors so that everyone is ready to manage the infection when it strikes,” Guleria said. He asked everyone to avoid misuse of drugs.Use steroids only in 2nd phase of Covid||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-spreading-to-tier-2-3-cities-aiims-246503
