"Like you found a cure for TB and chicken pox, look for treatments for liver ailments. After All, allopathy is now 200 years old." He further asked what non-surgical cure does the pharma industry have for heart blockage. "What treatment is there for cholesterol." "Does the pharma industry have treatment for migraine?" he asked.The yoga guru went on to list modern day ailments such as Parkinson's disease and wondered if allopathy had any painless cure to treat infertility as well as to reverse ageing and increase hemoglobin."Doctors should not fall ill at all if allopathy is all powerful and 'sarvagun sampanna' (having all good qualities)," he remarked.On Sunday, Ramdev was forced to withdraw a statement made in a viral video clip in which he is heard saying that "lakhs have died from taking allopathic medicines for COVID-19." He is also heard questioning some of the medicines being used to treat COVID-19.The remarks were met with vociferous protests from the doctors' association, following which Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan asked him to withdraw the "extremely unfortunate" statement.Vardhan further said allopathic medicines have saved lives of crores and comments that the drugs are responsible for death of lakhs is "extremely unfortunate".Regarding the video in question, Ramdev had earlier said he was actually reading out messages forwarded on WhatsApp. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/smarting-under-statement-withdrawal-ramdev-poses-25-questions-to-ima-257792

After January 26, it was confirmed that the so-called farmers’ agitation has been completely hijacked by anti-social, anti-democracy and anarchic people”.“Last month a farmer’s young daughter from West Bengal was gangraped at the agitation site and pushed to death. The so-called farmers’ leaders tried to destroy evidence. Perhaps now to divert and silence the investigation, these pressure tactics are being adopted. This is a usual practice among ultra-left and anti-democratic activists,” he alleged.Questioning whether “these unions are really agitating for farmers’ cause by not taking care of coronavirus guidelines, by running the risk of spreading the disease among thousands of people,” the BKS leader urged the Central and state governments to engage with “farmer’ organisations working for farmers’ uplift and address their real issues”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sangh-affiliate-bks-calls-farmers-unions-decision-to-observe-may-26-as-black-day-a-black-decision-257789
24-05-2021||New Delhi||Independent panel’s findings should inform future decisions on Covid: Vardhan at World Health Assembly||Days after the independent panel on Covid-19 said the WHO could have sounded the alarm on the pandemic sooner, India on Monday noted that future decision making on the issue should be informed by the guidance of the panel and of other high-level review mechanisms established over the past year to review global response to Covid.Chairing the 74th session of the World Health Assembly virtually today, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who is head of the WHO executive board, said, “The Executive Board stressed that the findings of the three review mechanisms – Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, Chair of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations 2005 during Covid-19 Response, and Chair of the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Program and decided that these should  inform future decision-making and member states needed to play a pivotal role in guiding the secretariat’s translation of those findings into policy action.”The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) formed last May unveiled its findings on May 12 and said the pandemic was preventable and the WHO could have sounded the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) alarm sooner.The panel recommended establishment of a new global system for surveillance, based on full transparency by all parties and for the World Health Assembly to give the WHO explicit authority to publish information about outbreaks with pandemic potential without requiring the prior approval of national governments.The independent panel also said that legally binding International Health regulations (2005) served to constrain rather than facilitate rapid action, the definition of a new suspected outbreak with pandemic potential needs to be refined.Besides, it asked WTO and WHO to convene major vaccine-producing countries and manufacturers to agree to voluntary licensing and technology transfer for Covid-19 vaccines and establish a high-level Global Health Threats Council led by government heads.Vardhan today also emphasised health emergencies saying the WHO executive board engaged in wide-ranging and in-depth discussions on Covid-19 impact on global health and noted the importance of guaranteeing equitable access for all to Covid-19 medicines and vaccines to ensure that they are considered as global public goods.“The board recommended that the 74th World Health Assembly must consider the report on mental health preparedness and response for the Covid-19 pandemic and endorse the updated comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan for the period of 2013 to 2030,” Vardhan said.The WHO board has further recommended that the 74th World Health Assembly adopt a decision to present an implementation road map for the global action plan for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases during the period 2013 to 2030 and draft a global strategy to tackle oral diseases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/independent-panels-findings-should-inform-future-decisions-on-covid-vardhan-at-world-health-assembly-257786
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||AFT upholds court of inquiry into Srinagar chopper fratricide case of 2019||The Armed Forces Tribunal has upheld the Court of Inquiry instituted by the Air Force into the incident in which a Mi-17 helicopter was shot down near Srinagar airfield in February 2019.Disposing off a petition by two IAF officers, the Tribunal’s Bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz on Monday held that the Court of Inquiry (COI) had been correctly convened by the competent authority as per the provisions of the relevant Air Force orders.The Bench observed that the terms of reference for the COI issued by the Director General (Inspection and Safety) was valid as the conduct of such investigations has been delegated to him.“The COI has been conducted as per the various statutory provisions applicable under Air Force law without any prejudice or mala fide and remains curable,” the Bench remarked.Group Captain SR Chowdhury, who was then posted as the Chief Operations Officer and Wing Commander Shyam Naithani then the Senior Air Traffic Controller at Srinagar Air Force Station, had contended that the terms of reference of the COI were contrary to relevant Air Force orders and the proceedings of the COI, its opinion and findings were contrary to the mandatory provisions of law.The COI had held the officers blameworthy for lapses on their part and had recommended action against them.Following a terrorist strike on a CRPF convoy that had killed 40 personnel in Pulwama on February 14, 2019, the IAF had carried out air strikes at terrorist camps near Balakote in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir on February 26, 2019.This had created a hostile situation, with both sides on a high state of operational preparedness. The next day, Pakistan too had dropped bombs near a brigade headquarters and an ammunition depot on the Indian side of the Line of Control.During the war like situation, which had witnessed significant air activity on both sides, an IAF Mi-17 helicopter was accidently shot down by an IAF missile as it was returning to the Srinagar airbase. Six personnel, including the two pilots were killed in the incident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aft-upholds-court-of-inquiry-into-srinagar-chopper-fratricide-case-of-2019-257783

24-05-2021||New Delhi||World has suffered as one but not equally, says Kailash Satyarthi at World Health Assembly||Nobel Peace Laureate Kailash Satyarthi addressed delegates on Monday at the opening of the 74th World Health Assembly virtually and called on countries to take urgent action for the millions of children living in extreme poverty, whose families are suffering devastating impacts of Covid-19.The event was attended by global leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres among others.This included support for COVAX and intellectual property waivers on vaccines, as well as targeted international and national action plans to protect children both directly and indirectly affected by the pandemic.Thanking healthcare and frontline professionals, and the World Health Organization for their tireless work, Satyarthi called the 74th World Health Assembly a “defining time in our society,” and described the current situation as “a crisis of justice, a crisis of civilisation, and a crisis of humanity.”Satyarthi’s comments come in the backdrop of his first-hand experience of the catastrophe that has befallen the poor and marginalised communities who have little or no access to healthcare or vaccinations. He said: “The world has suffered as one, but we have not suffered equally”. He cited the Fair Share for Children Report, which identified that just 0.13 pc—or USD 10 billion—of the global USD 8 trillion Covid-19 relief package went to multilateral efforts for the world’s poorest countries and highlighted that while the world has suffered as one, we have not suffered equally.“Two-third of the world’s largest companies made an additional profit of USD 109 billion in 2020,” he said, adding, that at least 140 million more children have been pushed into extreme poverty as a result of the pandemic, and the number of children being exploited in child labour is expected to increase for the first time in decades. Satyarthi spelt out four main demands in his address—multi-sectoral partnership for children; waiver of all intellectual property restrictions on Covid-19 vaccine; protection of children from imminent mutation of the virus and budgeted action plans and constitution of task forces to reach the poorest and most marginalized children through vaccination, pediatric facilities, and social protection floors.Incidentally, Kailash Satyarthi is one of almost 200 former heads of state and Nobel Laureates who called on President Joe Biden of the US to waive WTO intellectual property rules, coordinated by the People’s Vaccine coalition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-has-suffered-as-one-but-not-equally-says-kailash-satyarthi-at%C2%A0world-health-assembly-257780

24-05-2021||Barabanki||Vaccination drive in UP goes awry: Hesitancy, rumour push villagers into river||Despite a sustained campaign and widespread publicity, vaccine hesitancy continues to prevail in the rural hinterlands of Uttar Pradesh where the pandemic is spreading its tentacles.In Sisoda village in Barabanki—where a group of residents jumped into the Saryu river to evade vaccination on Sunday—the residents remain firm in their decision of not getting the jab.Shishupal, a local farmer, said: "People have died even after getting vaccinated. I know of those who have had to be hospitalised after the jab. Jab marna hi hai to vaccine kyon?" Shishupal, who has done matriculation, is convinced that the Covid vaccine is 'harmful' and spreads this 'information' among others."I have got this information from several of my friends who work in big cities. I am convinced as the local officials have not answered my queries. My own uncle, who worked in Delhi, died a month after having both vaccine shots. What more proof do I need," he asked.Mohd Ahsan, another resident, was also unwilling to take the jab."Is there a guarantee that we will not get infected after the vaccine? There are many in adjoining village who rushed to take the vaccine and then got infected. Why is the government pushing for vaccination-they should give it to those who want it," he stated.Besides this, rumours abound in the village that the vaccine causes 'impotence' and this is mainly responsible for driving the men away.On Sunday evening, a group of people in Sisoda village in Barabanki district had jumped into the Saryu river after seeing a team of health officials.The health team had gone to the village to give Covid vaccination to the local residents.Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Ramnagar tehsil, Rajiv Kumar Shukla, said about 200 people of the village ran away from the village because of the fear of vaccine and reached the Saryu shore. When the health team reached the river, these people jumped into  the river.Shukla said he made the villagers understand the importance and benefits of vaccination, and tried to dispel the myths, following which only 18 people in the village got the jabs.The villagers said they jumped into the river because some people had told them that this was not a vaccine, but a poisonous injection.It took a great deal of convincing to get people come out of the river.Sisoda is a village with a population of 1,500 people located in the Terai, 70 km from the district headquarters of Barabanki.Nodal Officer Rahul Tripathi said that they were continuing efforts to convince the local people about the benefits of vaccination and also dispel misconceptions.Chief Minister Adityanath has announced reward for Covid-free villages with 'Mera Gaon-Corona Mukt Gaon' campaign.—     IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccination-drive-in-up-goes-awry-hesitancy-rumour-push-villagers-into-river-257775

24-05-2021||Chennai||Full lockdown a bitter pill, but no other go: Tamil Nadu CM Stalin||A lockdown without any relaxation is a bitter pill but it is the only way out to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission and people should hence stay at home, Chief Minister M K Stalin said on Monday, the first day of a fresh week-long intense shutdown.Though some leeway was given during the first spell of lockdown from May 10, it was misused by some people for roaming around and it necessitated the imposition of a shutdown without relaxations, he said.In a video message posted on social media including his Twitter handle, Stalin said in order to break the coronavirus transmission chain, there is no other way but to impose a full lockdown as the virus spread happened only through humans.Another reason for implementing an intense lockdown is the number of people who have got infected in Tamil Nadu, which is ‘panicky,’ he said.The fresh daily infections have crossed the 35,000 mark and people stepping outside of their homes in large numbers, is a key reason for it, he added.The active cases crossed the three lakh mark on Monday and over 18.40 lakh people have tested positive so far.A two-week lockdown commenced on May 10 in Tamil Nadu with some relaxations and the government on Saturday announced extension of curbs for one more week from May 24.Also, the government brought in additional restrictions between May 24 and 31, including closure of vegetable shops and provision stores, which were allowed earlier to work between 6 AM and 10 AM.The Chief Minister said, “Though the spread of infection has come down to a small extent in view of lockdown with relaxations, it has not come under control.”The spread could be fully contained only by means of a shutdown without any relaxations.“A complete lockdown is a bitter medicine. But people have to drink it,” Stalin said.Imploring people to stay indoors complying with government stipulated norms to combat the virus, he said it would aid break the chain of virus transmission and help resumption of activities towards all round development of Tamil Nadu.“The spread of coronavirus will for sure come under control if people complied fully with the lockdown norms,” he said.People may come out of their homes only for medical requirements and complying with Covid-19 guidelines is the need of the hour, he said.The Rs 4,000 cash assistance plan for rice ration cardholders is among the measures being implemented by the government to help people who have been affected by the lockdown, he said.The government is working towards achieving two goals, containing the virus spread and saving those infected.He urged the people to eat healthy food like fruits and vegetables to increase immunity and get vaccinated since there was no other better weapon against the pathogen.Norms like wearing masks and getting tested (if needed and in case of flu-like symptoms) should also be followed, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/full-lockdown-a-bitter-pill-but-no-other-go-tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-257768
24-05-2021||Mumbai||Won’t arrest ex-CP till June 9 if he cooperates in Atrocities case probe: Maharashtra Government to HC||The Maharashtra Government on Monday said it would not arrest former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in a case registered against him under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act till June 9 provided he cooperates with the investigation into the case.Senior counsel Darius Khambata, appearing for the state government, made the statement before a vacation bench of Justices SS Shinde and NR Borkar, which was hearing a petition filed by Singh, seeking to quash the FIR registered against him on a complaint of police inspector Bhimrao Ghadge.Khambata, however, told the court that Singh should not seek any relief pertaining to this case in the petition filed by him in the Supreme Court.Singh last week filed a petition in the apex court, alleging that he is being hounded and continuously harassed with multiple cases instituted against him by the Maharashtra government as vendetta, after he complained to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray against former home minister Anil Deshmukh.He urged the Supreme Court to shift all the enquiries set up against him to another state and also sought for the FIRs registered against him to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Khambata on Monday told the HC that Singh “cannot ride two horses” at a time and seek reliefs from both the high court and the Supreme Court in the same case.The bench accepted the state government’s statement that it would not arrest Singh till June 9, and directed him to not seek reliefs pertaining to this particular case before the SC.Singh’s counsel Mahesh Jethmalani agreed to the directive.The court then posted the petition for further hearing on June 9.Ghadge’s advocate Satish Talekar opposed the interim protection from arrest granted to Singh.The court, however, noted that the case dates back to 2016.“The FIR has been filed after five years. You (complainant) waited for so long…nothing will happen if you wait for two more weeks. He (Singh) has not been arrested for all these years. What purpose will it serve if he is arrested now,” the court said.The bench also noted that Singh is still in service and is an officer of the government’s police force.The HC also expressed its displeasure with a statement of Singh in the petition filed by him in the SC that says he was constrained to approach the apex court as the high court was not hearing the matter.Khambata pointed out this statement to the bench on Monday and said on May 13, the high court had heard the matter and adjourned the hearing after the government made a statement that no coercive action would be taken.“We feel sad. How can you (Singh) say that matters are not heard?” Justice Shinde said.Jethmalani apologised and said the statement was incorrect.“We will withdraw the statement from the petition filed in the Supreme Court,” he said.The FIR against Singh is based on a complaint by police inspector Ghadge, now posted at Akola in Maharashtra.Ghadge made a series of allegations of corruption against Singh and other officers when Singh was posted in Thane.The FIR, which is now transferred from Akola to Thane, claimed Singh pressured Ghadge to drop the names of some persons from a case and when he refused, the IPS officer framed him up in false cases.The case has been registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the state CID is conducting a probe into it. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-arrest-ex-cp-till-june-9-if-he-cooperates-in-atrocities-case-probe-maharashtra-government-to-hc-257753
24-05-2021||New Delhi||Around 500 cases of black fungus in Delhi, injections in short supply: Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said there are around 500 cases of black fungus or mucormycosis in Delhi and the city has been grappling with a shortage of Amphotericin-B injection used in its treatment.“We have set up dedicated centres for the treatment of black fungus at Lok Nayak Hospital, GTB Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital but we do not have drugs.... We did not get the injections on Sunday,” he told reporters.Four to five injections per patient per day are used in the treatment of the fungal infection. There are around 500 cases of black fungus in Delhi at present, he said, adding Delhi has been receiving around 400 to 500 injections per day.The Central government has been distributing the injection among states. There is a severe shortage of this drug in the market and its production should be ramped up, the chief minister said.Mucormycosis or black fungus is more common among people whose immunity has lowered due to Covid, diabetes, kidney disease, liver or cardiac disorders, age-related issues, or those on medication for auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.If such patients are administered steroids, their immunity reduces further, allowing the fungus to thrive. And, steroids should be administered very judiciously after proper clinical examination by a doctor.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had on Saturday cautioned Covid-19 patients against taking steroids without doctor’s advice.“This is very dangerous. A patient’s immunity becomes zero when he/she takes steroids. Black fungus, which is found in soil or decaying matter inside homes, doesn’t affect healthy people. Chances of infection are more in those with low immunity,” he had said.It is imperative to control blood sugar levels. Any virus, fungus or bacteria multiplies rapidly when blood sugar level increases in the body, he had said.About 15 hospitals in the city are treating patients of mucormycosis.

24-05-2021||Beijing||China defends contentious CPEC, says it is economic initiative and has not affected its stand on Kashmir issue||China on Monday again defended its controversial USD 60 billion CPEC project with Pakistan, disregarding India’s protests as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, saying it is an economic initiative and has not affected its principled stand on the Kashmir issue.Leaders of China and Pakistan have praised the progress of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in recent days as the two close allies celebrated the establishment of 70 years of their diplomatic relations.India has protested to China over the CPEC, the flagship project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The massive infrastructure project connects China’s Xinjiang province with Gwadar port in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.China has been defending the CPEC, saying it is an economic project not aimed at any third country.Answering questions on the CPEC at a media briefing on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that the CPEC as one of the pioneering projects under the BRI has made important and major progress in infrastructure, energy, ports and industrial parks.He said the Belt and Road Initiative is an open international economic cooperation initiative with objectives of enhancing regional connectivity and achieving common development.“We are also extending the CPEC to regional countries, including Afghanistan. This will not only boost faster economic development in Pakistan, but also regional connectivity,” he said.Asked how China sees regional prosperity being furthered by the CPEC in view of India’s position that it passes through Indian territory illegally occupied by Pakistan, Zhao said the project has not affected China’s principled position on Kashmir.“China has stated its principled position on Kashmir many times. The CPEC is an economic initiative that targets no third country. It is not about territorial disputes and does not affect our principled position on the issue of Kashmir,” he said.On the CPEC’s extension to Afghanistan, he said, “on third party participation in the CPEC, China is having discussions with third parties, including Afghanistan”.“The two sides are having consultations through diplomatic channels. We notice that Afghanistan imports and exports goods through Gwadar and Karachi ports. High-speed highways are also being extended to Afghanistan,” he added.In a message to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi on Friday on the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the China-Pakistan diplomatic relations, President Xi Jinping said the CPEC has achieved remarkable results.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said at a high-level meeting in Islamabad that the CPEC will bring economic progress not only to Pakistan but the entire region.

Their parents were landless labourers. “My mother has died from coronavirus. We are three sisters and one brother. We had some foodgrains in the house but nothing is left now. We are now ‘bhagwan bharose’ (at God’s mercy),” Kajal told reporters at Dalanchhapra village in Ballia’s Bairia tehsil.Villagers say they have two elder sisters, who are married and not in a position to take care of them.“We have nothing with us now,” says Ruby.However, seven-year-old Ankush wants to study and join the police force when he grows up.“Didi cooks for us.  I want to study and join the police force,” says Ankush, who performed the last rites of his mother.In his innocence, Ankush says he will marry with the help of donations.Meanwhile, Bairia SDM Prashant Nayak says he is aware of their mother’s death and if any other member of their family takes their responsibility, monetary help will be provided for it till they assume the age of 18.Otherwise, the children will be sent to a shelter home, he says. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/four-siblings-left-to-fend-for-themselves-as-mother-dies-from-covid-257739

He, too, plans to export the tea to the UK and Germany," the entrepreneur noted.Currently, one kilogramme of 'bamboo leaf tea' is being sold for Rs 120, he said.Explaining the procedure for collection and production of the beverage, Jamatia said the planters have to be very careful while picking the leaves, as only the "young and tender ones" are used to make the tea.The brew can be made from 30 varieties of bamboo, but 'kanak kaich' is best suited for the purpose, he pointed out."The leaves are dried in the sun for at least seven days in a greenhouse and then hand-rolled to break them into pieces or are ground to dust," Jamatia explained, further adding that the tea tastes best with a hint of lemon and a spoonful of sugar. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tripura-tribal-man-brews-tea-from-bamboo-leaves-eyes-widespread-marketing-257737

24-05-2021||Mumbai||Won't arrest ex-CP till June 9 if he cooperates in Atrocities case probe: Maha Govt to HC||The Maharashtra government on Monday said it would not arrest former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in a case registered against him under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act till June 9 provided he cooperates with the investigation into the case.Senior counsel Darius Khambata, appearing for the state government, made the statement before a vacation bench of Justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar, which was hearing a petition filed by Singh, seeking to quash the FIR registered against him on a complaint of police inspector Bhimrao Ghadge.Khambata, however, told the court that Singh should not seek any relief pertaining to this case in the petition filed by him in the Supreme Court.Singh last week filed a petition in the apex court, alleging that he is being hounded and continuously harassed with multiple cases instituted against him by the Maharashtra government as vendetta, after he complained to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray against former home minister Anil Deshmukh.He urged the SC to shift all the enquiries set up against him to another state and also sought for the FIRs registered against him to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Khambata on Monday told the HC that Singh “cannot ride two horses” at a time and seek reliefs from both the high court and the Supreme Court in the same case.The bench accepted the state government's statement that it would not arrest Singh till June 9, and directed him to not seek reliefs pertaining to this particular case before the SC.Singh's counsel Mahesh Jethmalani agreed to the directive.The court then posted the petition for further hearing on June 9.Ghadge's advocate Satish Talekar opposed the interim protection from arrest granted to Singh.The court, however, noted that the case dates back to 2016.“The FIR has been filed after five years. You (complainant) waited for so long…nothing will happen if you wait for two more weeks. He (Singh) has not been arrested for all these years. What purpose will it serve if he is arrested now,” the court said.The bench also noted that Singh is still in service and is an officer of the government's police force.The HC also expressed its displeasure with a statement of Singh in the petition filed by him in the SC that says he was constrained to approach the apex court as the high court was not hearing the matter.Khambata pointed out this statement to the bench on Monday and said on May 13, the high court had heard the matter and adjourned the hearing after the government made a statement that no coercive action would be taken.“We feel sad. How can you (Singh) say that matters are not heard?” Justice Shinde said.Jethmalani apologised and said the statement was incorrect.“We will withdraw the statement from the petition filed in the Supreme Court,” he said.The FIR against Singh is based on a complaint by police inspector Ghadge, now posted at Akola in Maharashtra.Ghadge made a series of allegations of corruption against Singh and other officers when Singh was posted in Thane.The FIR, which is now transferred from Akola to Thane, claimed Singh pressured Ghadge to drop the names of some persons from a case and when he refused, the IPS officer framed him up in false cases.The case has been registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the state CID is conducting a probe into it.

These restrictions have been in place to control the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic which has gripped the state," the notification said."It is therefore requested that the honourable ministers avoid tours of their areas for reviews and inspections. If required, they may opt for video conferencing," the communication added.Lockdown was imposed in the state on May 5 for 11 days and, buoyed by the "positive outcome", the government extended it till May 25. During the period, a marked decline has been observed in the active caseload and positivity rate while the recovery rate has improved.The state had been relatively less severely affected by the viral outbreak when it first struck last year. However, the second wave has wrought devastation, infecting more than four lakh people in the last couple of months and claiming over 2,000 lives. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-ministers-asked-not-to-flout-lockdown-by-touring-constituencies-257717

24-05-2021||New Delhi||China develops UAV with plateau ops capabilities, to deploy at LAC||China has developed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with plateau operations capabilities and plans to deploy it at Line of Actual Control with India in Kailash mountain range, sources said.The UAV has been developed in Shaanxi and completed its first flying and control task at Gar Gunsa in Tibet Autonomous Region, the sources said.The flight was undertaken by the Hailan Aviation team. "The UAV took off from an elevation of 4,700 metre -- Baga Township -- and completed its task of patrolling, control and search operation in the Kailash mountain region," said the source.The Kailash mountain range originates from the southern bank of Pangong Tso and runs northwest to southeast for over 60 km. It had been contested by India and China after the border dispute started in May last year.The Kailash Ridge is characterised by rugged, broken terrain with heights varying between 4,000-5,500m. The ridge's key features include Gurung Hill, Spanggur Gap, Muggar Hill, Mukhpari, Helmet Top, Rezang La and Rechin La.It dominates Chushul Bowl -- an important communications centre.Last year, after the border dispute at the northern bank of Pangong Tso in Eastern Ladakh, China made an attempt to take over Kailash mountain range on the night of August 29 and August 30, 2020.Indian Army thwarted Chinese People's Liberation Army attempt and took control over most of the hills in the Kailash range.Indian troops pre-empted this PLA activity on the Southern Bank of Pangong Tso Lake, undertook measures to strengthen their positions and thwarted Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground, Indian Army had stated.This exposed Chinese deployment of its forces in Moldo.In February this year, India and China started disengagement at the southern and northern bank of the Pangong Lake at Line of Actual Control. The disengagement happened after several rounds of military and diplomatic talks.As per agreement, Indian troops vacated the mountain hills in Southern bank of Pangong Lake.China moved back to Finger 8 and Indian troops pulled back to the Dhan Singh Thapa post between Finger 2 and 3.The north bank of the lake is divided into 8 Fingers. The mountain spur jutting into the lake are referred to as Finger in military parlance.India claims Line of Actual Control at Finger 8 and had been holding on to the area till Finger 4 but in a clear alteration of status quo the Chinese have been camping at Finger 4 and have set up fortifications between Finger 5 and 8.Since then Indian and Chinese military have met twice to resolve border disputes at other friction areas like Hot Springs, Gogra and 900 square km Depsang plains.Amid this, China has again started enhancing troops, artillery and armour deployment in three sectors of Line of Actual Control -- western (Ladakh), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal).The Indian forces are keeping a close watch on Chinese activities at LAC.

What more proof do I need," he asked.Mohd Ahsan, another resident, was also unwilling to take the jab."Is there a guarantee that we will not get infected after the vaccine? There are many in adjoining village who rushed to take the vaccine and then got infected. Why is the government pushing for vaccination-they should give it to those who want it,"  he stated.Besides this, rumours abound in the village that the vaccine causes 'impotence' and this is mainly responsible for driving the men away.On Sunday evening, a group of people in Sisoda village in Barabanki district had jumped into the Saryu river after seeing a team of health officials.The health team had gone to the village to give Covid vaccination to the local residents.Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Ramnagar tehsil, Rajiv Kumar Shukla, said about 200 people of the village ran away from the village because of the fear of vaccine and reached the Saryu shore. When the health team reached the river, these people jumped into  the river.Shukla said he made the villagers understand the importance and benefits of vaccination, and tried to dispel the myths, following which only 18 people in the village got the jabs.The villagers said they jumped into the river because some people had told them that this was not a vaccine, but a poisonous injection.It took a great deal of convincing to get people to come out of the river.Sisoda is a village with a population of 1,500 people located in the Terai, 70 km from the district headquarters of Barabanki.Nodal Officer Rahul Tripathi said that they were continuing efforts to convince the local people about the benefits of vaccination and also dispel misconceptions.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has announced reward for Covid-free villages with 'Mera Gaon-Corona Mukt Gaon' campaign. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vax-drive-in-uttar-pradesh-goes-awry-hesitancy-rumour-push-villagers-into-river-257678

After questioning Sushil for around half-an-hour on the court premises, the Delhi Police sought his custody for 12 days for further interrogation. Metropolitan Magistrate Divya Malhotra, however, granted police Sushil’s custody for six days.Sushil, along with co-accused Ajay, was nabbed by the Delhi Police’s special cell team. Earlier, it had been reported that he was arrested late on Sunday night “near Jalandhar”. According to the Delhi Police, Sushil and his associates allegedly assaulted Dhankar and two of his friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, at Chhatrasal Stadium on the night of May 4.Dhankar later succumbed to his injuries, and a case was filed on May 5, naming Sushil and his accomplices for murder, criminal conspiracy and abduction. The police alleged that Sushil and a few other wrestlers beat up Dhankar, a Chhatrasal Stadium trainee, and his friends over a property dispute.Employed with the Indian Railways, Sushil is the chief administrator of Chhatrasal Stadium in his capacity as an Officer on Special Duty on deputation with the Delhi Government.Sushil had approached a Rohini court earlier this week to seek protection against his arrest. His bail plea was rejected because the allegations against him were deemed to be serious in nature. A court had also issued a non-bailable warrant against the wrestler.The police had been raiding various places in the Delhi-NCR and neighbouring states to arrest him. There were reports that he had travelled to Uttarakhand, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to evade arrest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wrestler-sushil-kumar-in-6-day-police-custody-257561

It also proposed two options: Conducting regular exams for 19 major subjects at notified centres or conducting shorter duration exams at respective schools where students were enrolled. Sources claimed majority states were in favour of the second option while some wanted a mix of both options.Pokhriyal said the states had been told to send detailed suggestions on the conduct of exams by May 25. He was speaking at a national consultation on the conduct of Class 12 and professional courses’ entrance exams. The meeting today was called to enable the central and state boards and other examination agencies to explore options available before them in the present circumstances.

Besides, the success of the rabi marketing season in Punjab and Haryana is a proof of the Centre’s intention and commitment towards farmers, they said. Tomar said the unions neither accepted the offer to put off the laws for 18 months nor proposed anything apart from the demand for repeal of the laws. “If the unions offer an alternative, we will talk,” Tomar said. Charuni said the unions would observe May 26 as “black day” to mark the completion of six months of their agitation. Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana are headed for Delhi for the protest.At least 12 Opposition parties, led by the Congress, have extended support to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. “We support the SKM’s call to hold nationwide protests on May 26,” said a statement signed by the Opposition leaders, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, JDS’ HD Deve Gowda, NCP’s Sharad Pawar, TMC’s Mamata Banerjee, Shiv Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray, DMK’s MK Stalin, JMM’s Hemant Soren, NC’s Farooq Abdullah, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav, RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, CPI’s D Raja and CPM’s Sitaram Yechury.The statement noted that on May 12, the Opposition leaders had written to PM Narendra Modi demanding repeal of the farm laws. The leaders also demanded legal entitlement to MSP as recommended by the MS Swaminathan Commission.“The Centre must stop being obdurate and immediately resume talks with the SKM on these lines,” the statement read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-face-off-punjab-haryana-farmers-head-to-delhi-border-to-mark-black-day-257541

In a statement, the ministry also refuted reports that the government had purportedly asked state-owned banks to withdraw funds from foreign currency accounts abroad in anticipation of the potential seizure of such accounts. While the government appointed a judge on the three-member arbitration panel and fully participated in the proceedings against India seeking Rs 10,247 crore in back taxes from Cairn, the ministry said the tribunal “improperly exercised jurisdiction over a national tax dispute that the Republic of India never offered and/or agreed to arbitrate”. India had seized and sold shares of Cairn in its erstwhile India unit, confiscated dividend due and withheld tax refunds to recover the tax demand it had levied two years after passing a law in 2012 that gave it powers to levy tax retrospectively. Cairn invoked arbitration under the India-UK bilateral investment treaty. In December last year, Cairn won an award that held the levy of taxes using the 2012 law unfair on the company and the tribunal asked the Indian Government to return $1.2 billion plus cost and interest. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-challenges-1-2-billion-cairn-arbitration-award-257409

I shall be most grateful if Didi pardons me and allows me to return to the TMC,” she said.Former TMC MLA Sonali Guha had on Saturday written to Banerjee expressing regret for quitting the party.Guha, four-time MLA from Satgachhia in South 24 Parganas, in a note to Banerjee wrote that just like a fish without water, she would not be able to live without “Didi”. Asking for Banerjee’s forgiveness, Guha wrote that she wanted to spend the rest of her life under Banerjee’s shadow.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh, when asked about the turncoats queuing up to return to TMC, said as of now Banerjee’s first priority was battling the Covid pandemic in the state and all other things would have to wait for the time being.“It is not just Guha or Murmu. Six to eight BJP MLAs and at least three BJP Lok Sabha members from West Bengal also want to join the TMC.

24-05-2021||Aditi Tandon||Not severe, but children showing Covid symptoms||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 23Top Indian pediatricians are starting to see adult-like symptoms in child patients of Covid 19 unlike the last time when the disease in children was largely asymptomatic.Leading pediatrician and PGI Chandigarh expert Meenu Singh says many children are presenting with respiratory symptoms in the second wave including fever, cough, runny nose, allergy, abdominal pain, fatigue and even interruptions in the food cycle.“We are seeing more patients than before at the pediatrics facility at PGI and are now starting to expand pediatric infrastructure in other areas as well. Even in my teleconsultations I am getting many more calls about children getting Covid positive than before. Previously we were seeing children nearing adolescence getting sick with Covid but now we are seeing even younger children getting the disease,” she told The Tribune on a day when the Indian Academy of Pediatricians clarified that the third wave of Covid would not impact children disproportionately as is being thought.In the last sero survey of Covid prevalence by ICMR, it was found that the rate of disease prevalence in 10 to 17 year olds was the same as in adults – 25 pc but with doctors seeing a growing number of children, it is unclear whether these trends will hold. “Many children are now reporting respiratory problems which was not the case in the previous wave when fever, rashes and Kawasaki disease were the common signs among Covid positive children. Now we are seeing respiratory distress like pneumonia (in children with Covid), which is an adult-like symptom,” Singh said, calling for policy interventions to create pediatric Covid response.The expert added that lack of severe disease in children was still a silver lining.“The recovery rate is also much better in children than in adults,” Singh said, adding that children were transmitting the virus to families.She advised masks for children aged 2 years and above and certainly for those aged 5 years and above.Singh also said children playing in groups was not advisable and social distancing was very important.Indoor play is better, the expert noted, adding that families must see clinicians if their wards complained of fever, cough, weakness and abdominal pain and if a child with no history of allergy reports allergy.“Pediatricians should also prepare themselves for treating children with Covid. Hospitals should be ready in time. As of today we have very few hospitals with pediatric facilities,” Meenu Singh said, adding that treatment principles in children were the same as in adults.“Mutants are also punishing children. We need to gear up to face the pediatric burden of Covid,” she said.The government has meanwhile readied a clinical protocol for Covid in children and has maintained that the disease in children is largely asymptomatic.But this could be changing, as ground experience of pediatricians shows.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-severe-but-children-showing-covid-symptoms-257422

I withdraw my statement, putting to rest the controversy over various medical practices... (jee aapaka patr praapt hua, uske sandarbh mein chikitsa paddatiyon ke sangharsh ke is poore vivaad ko khedapoorvak viraam dete hue main apna vaktavya vaapis leta hoon)," Ramdev tweeted from his personal Twitter handle, attaching his statement.Citing a video circulating on social media, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had on Saturday said Ramdev claimed that allopathy is a "stupid science". He also allegedly said medicines such as remdesivir, fabiflu and other drugs approved by the Drugs Controller General of India have failed to treat COVID-19 and "lakhs of patients have died after taking allopathic medicines."  The apex doctors' body urged the union health minister to take strict action against Ramdev for misleading people by making "unlearned" statements against allopathy. In a strongly-worded letter to Ramdev on Sunday, Harsh Vardhan said his remarks on allopathic medicine were "extremely unfortunate"."The statement disrespects the corona warriors and hurt the sentiments of the country. Your statement on allopathy can break the morale of healthcare workers and weaken our fight against COVID-19," he said.Vardhan further said allopathic medicines have saved lives of crores and comments that the drugs are responsible for death of lakhs is "extremely unfortunate". Replying to the minister's letter, Ramdev in his statement said he respects all forms of medical science and allopathy doctors have saved people during the pandemic by risking their own lives."I accept that allopathy has shown remarkable progress in life-saving system (jeevan raksha pranali) and surgery and has served humanity," he said. Regarding the video in question, Ramdev said he was actually reading out messages forwarded on WhatsApp."...if that has hurt sentiments of anyone, then I regret it," he added.  However, he also said traditional ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy have also controlled and provided permanent solution to several complex diseases like blood pressure, thyroid, sugar, arthritis, hepatitis and asthma.   "...the allopathic doctors should also not mock the Indian medical systems like ayurveda and yoga by calling it as 'pseudo-science' as it hurts crores of people...," he asserted. Earlier, the IMA said Ramdev's remarks should be "considered as hate speech" and he should be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act for misleading people by making "untutored and unlearned" statements."We demand an unconditional public apology from Ramdev to allopathy and its practitioners," IMA had said.

One of the suggestions is said to be a short-duration exam of 90 minutes instead of three hours with objective-type questions and an option of three subjects. Today’s discussions were held around two themes—board exams for Class XII by the Central Board of Secondary Education and other state boards and the all-India entrance examinations for various higher education institutions and professional courses. Various options regarding the methodology, process, duration and timings of the exams were discussed.Officials said the minister discussed the importance of the Class XII board exams and the all India entrance exams in “shaping the future and defining the careers of students”.“Keeping in view present circumstances it was decided to cancel the CBSE board examinations of Class X and evaluate through internal assessment, but Class XII examinations are very important to decide the future of a student,” the minister said. An “informed, collaborative decision” will remove the uncertainty among students’ and parents’ minds by informing them of the final decision at the earliest,” he added.Today’s meeting was called to enable central and state boards and other examination agencies to be able to examine various options available in the present challenging circumstances through a consultation process.  The minister expressed commitment towards the safety and security of children and called it the “first priority of the government”. The meeting was attended by Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Zubin Irani, I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar and Minister of State for Education Sanjay Dhotre.Secretary senior officials of the ministry, chief ministers, education ministers and officers associated with the education system participated in the much-anticipated meeting on which the fate of lakhs of students depended.Rajnath Singh said the ministry will consider all those suggestions and take a final decision soon and reiterated that the priority of the government to conduct all the examinations in a safe and secure environment.I thank all the Hon'ble Chief Ministers, Education Ministers, and officers associated with the world's largest education system for participating in the high-level meeting chaired by Hon'ble Minister of Defence Shri @rajnathsingh Ji. pic.twitter.com/i4e8p5lH90  A large number of students and parents have been demanding cancellation of the board exams. The hashtag “cancelboardexams” trended on Twitter as the meeting was underway.“It was proposed that the board can conduct exams in present format for major subjects and the marking for remaining subjects can be done on basis of performance in the papers for which offline exams will be conducted. The board said the exams can be conducted using this option and increasing the number of centres to ensure social distancing.“The other option that was proposed was changing the pattern of exam. If this option is chosen, the exams can be conducted in home schools of students, the duration can be reduced to 90 minutes rather than 3 hours and the questions can be objective type. The students can also be given an option to appear for any three of four subjects in this format,” a senior official said.Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said his government was not in favour of the options being explored by CBSE to conduct the exams and that going ahead with the process without vaccinating students would prove to be a big mistake.“Delhi government is not in favour of these options. We cannot play with the safety of students just to fulfil our stubborn wishes. Conducting the examination by toying with students’ safety will prove to be a big mistake. There are over 1.5 crore Class-12 students across the country and 95 per cent of them are above the age of seventeen-and-a-half years,” he said at a press conference post the meeting.“The Centre should talk to experts if they can be given the Covishield or Covaxin vaccines. The Centre should also talk to Pfizer to explore vaccination for the Class 12 students. It is a must to vaccinate students, especially with experts indicating that the third wave of the coronavirus will be more dangerous for children,” he added.The Tamil Nadu government proposed conducting the exams after the Covid-19 situation subsides in the state.“Like other states, Tamil Nadu also wanted to conduct the Class 12 board exams as it plays an important role in deciding students’ career,” School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi told reporters after meeting.Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar said it’s important to conduct Class 12 exams in the interest of students.The CBSE had on April 14 announced the cancellation of Class 10 exams and postponed Class 12 exams due to the surge in Covid-19 cases.

24-05-2021||Surat||Gujarat BJP MLA draws flak as video shows him filling syringe with Remdesivir for patient||A Gujarat BJP MLA has come under fire from the opposition Congress after a video went viral on Sunday that showed him filling a syringe with Remdesivir injection for a patient at a community COVID care centre at Sarthana in Surat.In the video of the incident that took place recently, V D Zalavadiya, who represents Kamrej Assembly constituency in Surat, is seen filling a syringe with a vial of Remdesivir before transferring it to a drip bottle, to be administered to a COVID-19 patient.  Congress spokesperson Jayrajsinh Parmar criticised him for the act, and said Gujarat Health Minister Nitin Patel should get inspiration from the MLA and open a centre to train BJP workers in administering injections, which would also address the issue of acute shortage of medical staff in state hospitals. Zalavadiya, however, said that he did not administer the dose to any patient, but only injected the vial contents into the drip bottle. He also said he apologised to those who felt he should not have done so.Parmar said, “It is sad to see how Kamrej MLA Shri Zalavadiya flaunts his skill. Taking inspiration from him, Nitin Patel (Deputy CM with health portfolio) should set up a training centre on how to dress a wound and administer injection under the leadership of Mr Zalavadiya.”  "At a time when the state is facing acute shortage of doctors, nurses, health workers and paramedical staff, the health minister should train the ‘page pramukhs' (in-charge for every page of the electoral roll) of the ruling party and deploy them in hospitals to treat patients. Even those parents should take inspiration from Zalavadiya who are unable to send their children to medical schools," the Congress leader added. Defending his action, Zalavadiya said he has been serving COVID-19 patients at Sarthana community care centre for the last 40 days, and more than 200 patients have recovered and went home from the facility.  "We have treated more than 200 patients and sent them home. There are still 10-12 patients at the COVID care centre. I am sorry if somebody thinks I should not have done the service of transferring Remdesivir injection in the drip bottle," he said. My aim is not to create any controversy. I have not administered an injection to any patient, but have only injected the (drip) bottle to mix Remdesivir injection before it is administered to the patient. There were 10-15 doctors at the centre, he said. Talking to reporters, he said that BJP party workers of Varachha and Kamrej Assembly constituencies were jointly working to serve the people (at the centre). “Congress has nothing better to do than create controversy and criticise good works done by others," Zalavadiya hit back.
