04-05-2021||New Delhi||India and the UK launch comprehensive partnership on migration and mobility||India and the UK on Tuesday launched a comprehensive partnership on migration and mobility that will provide for enhanced employment opportunities for around 3,000 Indian professionals annually, but those staying illegally may have to leave Britain.The pact was inked between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and UK Home Secretary Priti Patel ahead of a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Boris Johnson.At a media briefing, the Joint Secretary in the Europe West division of the Ministry of External Affairs, Sandeep Chakravorty, said Indian nationals who are undocumented or are in distress abroad and not being given nationality or residence permits have to be taken back.He was responding to a question on whether the UK has asked India to take back illegal migrants in return for increasing visas for young Indian professionals.A joint statement issued after the Modi-Johnson talks said the two leaders welcomed the signing of the migration and mobility partnership and expressed confidence in the benefits it will have in facilitating the legal movement of students and professionals, and combating illegal migration and “organised immigration crime”.In a document, the MEA mentioned that the partnership will create a new scheme for the exchange of young professionals under which up to 3000 young Indian professionals annually can avail employment opportunities in the UK for a period of two years without being subjected to labour market tests.Chakravorty said India is against illegal migration as it “prejudices legal migration”.“The migration and mobility partnership is a very comprehensive document. India never encourages illegal migration, we are against illegal migration because that prejudices legal migration.“So the migration and mobility partnership is a comprehensive document where we will take back Indian nationals,” he said.However, more than that it creates opportunities for legal migration, he asserted.“It is our solemn duty that Indian nationals who are undocumented or are in distress abroad, and are not being given nationality or resident permit, have to be taken back and I think we will do that,” he added.“I think this agreement systematises that, but more than that it creates opportunities for legal migration and I think that is the aspect we would like to focus on.“We would be very much keen to see that the numbers that have been offered by the UK are increased in the future and a large number of Indian professionals find opportunities in the UK,” the joint secretary added.

04-05-2021||New Delhi||Double mutant of coronavirus fast replacing dominant N440K variant in south India: Scientists||The B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus, also known as the double mutant, is fast replacing the N440K variant in south India, scientists at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) said on Tuesday.Former CCMB director Rakesh Mishra said the double mutant is now a dominant variant in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and now Telangana.After an exhaustive analysis of 5,000 variants earlier this year, the CCMB had found that N440K is spreading a lot more in the southern states compared to the other variants.But B.1.617 is fast replacing N440K, including in Kerala, Divya Tej Sowpati, a scientist with the CCMB, said.“Lineages with #N440K are NOT the dominant ones in the second wave of #Covid19inIndia. While N440K was indeed a mutation of concern in South India during and after the first wave, current data shows that it is essentially replaced by new VoCs such as #B1617 and #B117.“In KL, though not much data is available on GISAID, we can see from https://genescov2.genomes.in that B.1.1.7 is increasing at present, whereas N440K is present in <20% of the genomes.“Also, it is important to remember that just because a variant behaves a certain way in cell cultures (with no competition, and in controlled settings), it does not mean it will behave the same way in humans, or in a complicated pandemic scenario,” Sowpati tweeted.The B.1.617 variant harbours 15 lineage defining mutations. B.1.617, initially termed as the double mutant, has three new spike protein mutations.Two mutations—E484Q and L452R—are in the area important for antibody-based neutralisation. The third mutation, P681R, allows the virus to enter cells a little better.“When comparing the data from MH, in MH we can see that the increase in B.1.617 is seen in Feb rather than Mar 2021, and again we observe a reduction in proportion of lineages with N440K,” Sowpati tweeted.At a webinar last month, Sujeet Singh, the Director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said in Maharashtra, the B.1.617 variant was found in proportions of over 50 per cent in many cities, while the UK variant was found in 28 per cent samples in the second week of March.

04-05-2021||New Delhi||Lack of authentic info; create awareness on COVID-19 symptoms, treatment via videos, graphics: HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said there is complete lack of authentic information and asked the ICMR to create awareness among the public by releasing videos and graphics on COVID-19 symptoms, treatment, protocol and equipment.The high court said people are not aware of COVID-19 symptoms and how to use the equipment like oxygen cylinders and concentrators as people are using it in closed rooms.“On these aspects ICMR should step in. You should make video clips, graphics and circulate it on national media and WhatsApp groups. People will know what to believe and who not,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.Central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, representing Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), urged the bench to put these issues in its order and he will take instructions.The high court said ICMR needs to educate people what are the tests to be done after COVID-19 as after 7-8 days people are getting complications.While Justice Sanghi shared that one of his court staff lost his wife as she was unwell and did not get the COVID-19 test done and even did not take the required medication as nobody advised them.Justice Palli also shared a similar incident which happened in her family where her cousin lost her husband.“That’s why ICMR has to advice… You have to come up with a protocol on COVID-19 treatment. We have asked the state to come up with a portal with doctors who want to offer voluntary services. You need to share the protocol with doctors on how to proceed and this needs to be published properly,” it said.Ahluwalia said now medical students have been roped in and are being given duties as per their year of course as there is dearth of doctors.Meanwhile, the Centre suggested that Delhi government shall rope in mohalla clinics during the pandemic.Regarding this, Delhi government’s counsel said he will apprise the court in detail as to how mohalla clinics work and they have limited space with no waiting area and social distancing norms can’t be ensured.The court said, “If you have made this infrastructure, what worth is it for if it can’t be used for any purpose during the pandemic... COVID is not an affluent society ailment. It can happen to people who go there.” During the hearing, the amicus curiae said people of the city have been told not to sit over oxygen cylinders but such appeals rarely get reported in the media and everything irrelevant gets picked up and that media has to be responsible.To this, the bench said is there any appeal made from any political party and why leaders are not coming forward and making this appeal.Delhi government submitted that such an appeal would be made now.The court has been hearing various pleas relating to shortage of oxygen and other issues relating to COVID-19.The high court, on its own, revived a disposed of petition filed by advocate Rakesh Malhotra related to COVID-19 testings and infrastructure, noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity and “it is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.

04-05-2021||New Delhi||Strict lockdown should be clamped in areas with COVID positivity rate of over 10 pc: AIIMS director||A strict lockdown should be imposed in areas where the COVID-19 case positivity rate is over 10 per cent or the bed occupancy is above 60 per cent, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Tuesday, while stressing that clamping such restrictions all over the country cannot be a solution, keeping in mind people’s livelihood.He rejected the strategy of imposing night curfews and weekend lockdowns by some states to reduce the number of coronavirus cases, saying “these would not have much of an impact on the transmission cycle”.“There is a need to impose strict regional lockdowns in areas where the COVID-19 case positivity rate is over 10 per cent or the bed occupancy is above 60 per cent to break the chain of transmission. The COVID-19 task force has also been advising for the same.“It is there in the guidelines of the home ministry, but it is not being strictly implemented,” Guleria told PTI.He said there should be a gradual, graded unlocking in such areas once the positivity rate reduces.However, he stressed that there should be restrictions on people travelling from areas that have a high positivity rate to places with a low positivity rate to curb the spread of the infection.On his views about a nationwide lockdown, Guleria said, “A complete national lockdown cannot be a solution, keeping in mind people’s livelihoods and the impact it will have on daily wage labourers. Day-to-day activities in areas with a low positivity rate should be allowed with restrictions.”Aggressive containment measures have to be put in place for a sufficient period of time as no healthcare infrastructure can manage this kind of a caseload, he stated.Guleria’s remarks come in the backdrop of the country facing a serious COVID-19 crisis with a spike in the numbers of cases and deaths, and hospitals running out of oxygen and beds.India’s COVID-19 tally has crossed the grim milestone of two crore with over 50 lakh cases recorded in just 15 days.It has mounted to 2,02,82,833 with 3,57,229 fresh cases reported in a day, while the death toll due to the viral disease has climbed to 2,22,408 with 3,449 more people succumbing to it, the health ministry said on Tuesday.

You are a woman and the daughter of Bengal. Are these women who are being killed and raped not daughters of Bengal…. Do they deserve this,” he questioned.State leader Anirban Ganguly added that people who voted for the TMC should ask whether what is happening in Bengal is right.“Whatever the TMC is doing is very close to Nazi Germany’s fascism. This is a fascist government. Such incidents do not take place in a democratic government,” he said, also questioning the “silence” of leaders of other opposition parties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/comparing-tmc-with-nazis-bjp-dubs-mamata-banerjee-government-in-bengal-as-fascist-248140
04-05-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Prevented from entering village in Andhra, man dies of COVID||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, May 4In a tragic incident, a COVID-19 positive person died gasping for breath when villagers prevented him from entering the village in the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh. A video of the deceased's wife and daughter trying to offer some water before he collapsed has gone viral. The man has been identified as Asiri Naidu, a daily wage worker. The video shows a weeping daughter sprinkling water into her father’s mouth as her fearful mother is pulling her back fearing infection. In a heart-wrenching moment, the daughter holds the father fingers, but within seconds he stops moving. The wife looks at him, and says, “gone”, after which the man’s daughter breaks down into wails and sobs, inconsolable. Sources said the video was captured by onlookers at Koyyanapeta Village in Jagannathavalasa Gram Panchayat of G Sigadam Mandal in Andhra Pradesh. The deceased had reached his village from Vijayawada after testing positive. The villagers did not allow him into the village and asked the family to stay at the outskirts of the village. As Naidu’s condition worsened, none helped take him to hospital and he died soon thereafter. District Medical and Health Officer, Dr M Chenchaiah said he was unaware of the incident but would have it investigated. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Telangana, the pandemic has claimed 59 more lives, the highest single-day death toll in the state so far. The fresh fatalities pushed the cumulative death toll to 2,476. The state reported 6,876 new Covid cases during the 24-hour period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prevented-from-entering-village-in-andhra-man-dies-of-covid-248136
04-05-2021||New Delhi||Diesel doped with biodiesel made from used cooking oil rolled out||India on Tuesday began experimenting with doping diesel with a small portion of biodiesel extracted from leftover cooking oil in kitchens to cut reliance on imports as well as reducing carbon emissions.Diesel, India’s most used fuel, is made from crude oil, for which the nation is 85 per cent dependent on imports. Imports can be reduced if a portion of diesel extracted from fossil oil is supplemented by an equally combustible diesel.Bio-diesel that can be produced from vegetable oil, animal fat, tallow and waste cooking oil, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman S M Vaidya said at a function to launch diesel doped with used cooking oil (UCO).To start with, 7 per cent biodiesel extracted from UCO is being doped in diesel and the supply of such fuel was started on Tuesday.As much as 23 million tonnes of edible oil is consumed in the country annually. Out of this, 3 million tonnes of oil is discarded after use and is called used cooking oil, he said.“There is a potential to generate 222 crore litres of UCO annually but no structure exists for collection of waste cooking oil,” he said.To encourage this, the oil companies floated an expression of interest (EoI) seeking biodiesel made from UCO, offering a fixed price for five years and a guaranteed offtake for 10 years.As many as 30 LOIs have been issued at the industry level (by IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) which will give 26.62 crore litre of biodiesel in years to come, it was informed at the function.India consumed 72.7 million tonnes (about 8,000 crore litres) of diesel in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.The first lot of used cooking oil-based biodiesel blended diesel was flagged off by Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.“So far, IOC has also issued 23 LOIs for biodiesel plants with a total capacity of 22.95 crore litres. Under this initiative, IOC has received 51 kilolitres of UCO-Biodiesel at its Tikrikalan terminal in Delhi as of March 31,” the company said in a statement.Speaking on the occasion, Pradhan said, “This is a landmark in India’s pursuance of biofuels and will have a positive impact on the environment. This initiative will garner substantial economic benefits for the nation by shoring up indigenous Biodiesel supply, reducing import dependence, and generating rural employment.”Oil Secretary Tarun Kapoor said with this flag off, a new era of Bioenergy has been ushered in that will revolutionise the Indian petroleum sector.“Feedstock availability in Biodiesel is a challenge, and leveraging UCO can be a major breakthrough that will enable us to reach the target of 5 per cent biodiesel blending. It will also help divert the unhealthy used oil from the food chain to a more productive purpose,” he said.Vaidya said the initiative will retrieve the unhealthy used cooking oil. “We aspire to trace even the last drop of UCO and ensure its conversion to biodiesel, thereby contributing to a more energy secure, greener and healthier India.”IOC, he said, started constructing eight biodiesel plants across Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh.Biodiesel is an alternative fuel similar to conventional or ‘fossil’ diesel. It can be produced from vegetable oil, animal fats, tallow and waste cooking oil. A significant advantage of Biodiesel is its carbon-neutrality, i.e. the oilseed absorbs the same amount of CO2 as is released when the fuel is combusted in a vehicle. Also, Biodiesel is rapidly biodegradable and completely non-toxic. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/diesel-doped-with-biodiesel-made-from-used-cooking-oil-rolled-out-248133
04-05-2021||New Delhi||Use money to be spent for new PM residence to provide medical facilities to people: Congress||Questioning the government’s priorities during the COVID crisis, the Congress on Tuesday said it should deploy all resources in saving the lives of the people instead of building a new prime minister’s residence.The opposition party’s criticism came following reports that the prime minister’s residence would be completed by December 2022 as part of the central vista project.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the prime minister’s “ego is bigger than people’s lives” and asked why Rs 13,450 crore was being spent on the central vista project and not for fully vaccinating people or providing them oxygen or financial help during the pandemic.“Rs 13450 crores for Central Vista. Or, for fully vaccinating 45 crore Indians. Or, for 1 crore oxygen cylinders. Or, to give 2 crore families NYAY of Rs 6000. But, PM’s ego is bigger than people’s lives,” he said on Twitter.Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said at a press conference that while the people are gasping for life, “the Sultan is busy building his castle”.“At a time when the people of the country are struggling with a shortage of oxygen, vaccines, hospital beds, medicines, it would be better if the government deploys all resources in saving the lives of the people rather than building a new house for the PM at Rs 13,000 crore,” Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in a tweet in Hindi.“Such expenses send a message to the public that the government’s priorities are elsewhere,” the Congress general secretary said.Gohil urged the government to reconsider the decision and spend the money on improving health infrastructure to save people’s lives instead.“Today the priority should be to help save people’s lives, provide them with vaccine, oxygen, medicines and ICU beds,” the Congress leader said.“Thousands of people are falling prey to Corona every day and ‘Faqir’ is building a new house for himself? What more will the dreamer show the country,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi.Gohil, who is an MP from Gujarat, alleged that “even as chief minister, his (Modi’s) priority was to build a big palace for himself”.The Congress spokesperson said experts are now saying that only a lockdown can break this chain of the virus transmission and the government should follow their advice.But do provide for the poor by putting Rs 6,000 in their accounts, he said.Gohil said 14th century Delhi Sultan Mohammed bin Tughlaq had ruined the country’s economy by changing its currency “as Modi has done after demonetisation”.The Congress leader said the entire country is looking up to the government and its leader for saving their lives.He said the Congress party’s sympathies are with all those who have lost their loved ones. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/use-money-to-be-spent-for-new-pm-residence-to-provide-medical-facilities-to-people-congress-248132
04-05-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir’s plea challenging PEs can be decided by CAT: HC||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday said it was of the prima facie opinion that the petition filed by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh challenging the two preliminary enquiries (PEs) initiated against him by the Maharashtra government can be adjudicated by the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).A Division Bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale noted that the relief claimed in the petition is related to service matters and hence the jurisdiction lies with the CAT.Singh’s advocate Sunny Punamiya, however, requested that the petition be adjourned as senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Singh, was not available on Tuesday.“We are of the prima facie opinion that the reliefs claimed in the petition can be adjudicated by the Central Administrative Tribunal. However, the petitioner’s advocate wants an adjournment. We find no urgency in the matter and post it for hearing on June 9,” the Bench said.Maharashtra government counsel Darius Khambata told the HC that the petition became infructuous and does not survive as the state Director General of Police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey, who was asked to conduct the PEs against Singh, has recused himself given the allegations levelled against him in Singh’s plea.“The DGP has recused himself. Following this the state government has issued fresh orders setting up PEs against the petitioner. The government is also opposing the plea on maintainability as it is a service-related matter,” Khambata told the Bench.Senior counsel Navroz Seervai, appearing for Pandey, told the high court that the DGP recused from conducting the inquiries the day he was given a copy of the petition.“The petition has levelled totally false allegations against him (Pandey),” Seervai added.Both Khambata and Seervai requested the high court to dismiss the petition saying Singh would have to approach the CAT.The Bench, while adjourning the matter, said the pendency of this petition would not be an impediment to Singh to approach the tribunal.In his petition, Singh claimed that he was being targeted and harassed for highlighting the alleged “corrupt malpractices” of former state home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh.Singh also claimed that during his meeting with DGP Pandey on April 19, the latter “advised him” to withdraw his letter against Deshmukh which he had sent to the state government.Singh, who was in March this year shunted from the post of Mumbai police commissioner and posted as DG of Home Guards, had written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray claiming that Deshmukh had set a monthly collection target of Rs 100 crore to some police officers from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Deshmukh had denied the allegations. He resigned last month after the HC ordered the CBI to conduct a PE against him.Singh’s petition challenged the two orders passed by the Maharashtra government on April 1 and April 20 directing DGP Pandey to conduct the PEs against him.The first order was passed by Deshmukh, when he was home minister, for alleged violation of some All India Services (Conduct Rules) and the another order dated April 20 was passed by the present home minister (Dilip Walse Patil) over allegations of corruption levelled against Singh.

04-05-2021||---||Three-fold increase in Remdesivir production: Govt||New Delhi, May 4The government on Tuesday said there had been a three-fold increase in the production of the most sought after Remdesivir, as it also claimed that COVID-19 supplies received from the global community have effectively been allocated and medical infrastructure of 38 institutions across 31 States/UTs have been strengthened.The Minister of State (MoD) for Chemicals and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviaya said, the production of Remdesivir has gone up nearly three times to 1.05 crore vials per month as the government has been working hard to enhance the availability of the antiviral drug in the country.In a series of tweets the Minister said the production capacity of the drug has crossed “1.05 crore vials per month as on May 4, which is nearly a three-fold increase from 37 lakh vials per month on April 12 this year”. He went on to add that the antiviral drug is now being produced across 57 plants in the country compared to 20 facilities a month ago and “soon, we will be able to cater to increase in demand”.Mandaviya also noted that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government is trying hard to fight the CIVID-19 pandemic.Keeping in view the high demand for Remdesivir amid a massive spike in COVID infections, the government has already waived customs duty on the drug, its raw materials and other components used to make it.Meanwhile, the government also claimed that a streamlined and systematic mechanism for allocation of the COVID-19 support supplies received by India from the overseas donors has been put into place for effective distribution across the country.In an official statement it said, “The global community has extended a helping hand in supporting the efforts of the Government of India in this collective fight against the global COVID19 pandemic. Medical equipment, medicines, oxygen concentrators, ventilators etc., are being provided by many countries.”The customs department has been fast tracking clearances of COVID related imports including oxygen and oxygen related equipment and giving precedence to such items over other goods, as nodal officers at different checkpoints get alert on email for monitoring and clearance.“A cell was created under Additional Secretary in the ministry of health to coordinate the receipt and allocation of foreign COVID relief material as grants, aid and donations,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-fold-increase-in-remdesivir-production-govt-248130

There have been instances of heinous crimes including bombing of localities, murders, violations against the modesty of women, riotous looting, kidnapping, arson and destruction of public property.”Highlighting the instances of gang rape and physical assault against women who supported the BJP, the PIL alleged that due to the deliberate inaction of the state government, “miscreants have turned the state into a complete lawless zone, which demonstrates this was an organised and pre-meditated crime against a targeted group of people who exercised their political choice against the ruling party”.The PIL sought directions for immediate arrest of and prosecution against all individuals involved and/or responsible for the commission of heinous offences in the aftermath of the assembly elections.It said a special court should be established to deal with cases pertaining to prosecution of political miscreants and/or any individuals involved in the commission of heinous offences.The petitioner said the court’s intervention was needed “in view of the widespread violence and disruption of law and order that has erupted in the aftermath of the assembly election, and the failure of the state machinery in protecting the life and liberty of its citizens”.It said, “The state administration and the police authorities in the state have failed and/or neglected to clamp down on the unruly elements, thereby leading to institutionalised violence and destruction of the democratic fabric of the state.”Noting that the state administration has failed to restore peace and maintain law and order in the aftermath of the elections despite several pleas and numerous news reports, the PIL submitted that it was imperative that the top court intervened.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-poll-violence-in-west-bengal-pil-in-sc-seeks-deployment-of-central-forces-248123

04-05-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: Delhi HC dismayed over lawyer’s wrong statement, recalls order||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday took strong note of a wrong statement made by an advocate without any authority on the basis of which a judicial order was passed relating to a plea to provide COVID-19 medical facilities to lawyers.The high court cautioned the advocate about such conduct in the future and said it was dismayed that he appeared in the matter without any authority and made a statement.It recalled its order passed on Monday asking a non-operational private hospital here to the hand over its keys to the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) to inspect and make necessary arrangements for making it functional for providing COVID Care facilities to lawyers and their families.During the hearing yesterday, advocate Yashvardhan S Soam claimed that he was representing Rockland Hospital in Dwarka and offered to handover keys of the non-operational institute to Bar Council of Delhi to inspect and make necessary arrangements for making it functional for providing COVID Care facilities to lawyers and their families.However, on Tuesday, an application was filed on behalf of the hospital, which is now known as Medeor Hospital after being taken over by another entity in 2016, submitting that advocate Soam had no authority to appear on behalf of the hospital.Advocates Abhishek Singh and Prateek Singh, representing Medeor Hospital, said they are seeking modification of the May 3 order as the other lawyer had misrepresented the hospital and made a false statement on their behalf.Allowing the plea, the high court recalled its May 3 order to the extent that it asked the hospital to handover keys to BCD chairman and senior advocate Ramesh Gupta.“Advocate Soam who appeared for Rockland Hospital (on May 3) went on to say he had keys and will handover to BCD Chairman Ramesh Gupta. Now it has been transpired that he had no authority to state so or offer the keys to Gupta.“We are dismayed that without any authority lawyer appears and makes such a statement. We have cautioned him not to indulge in such conduct in future,”  a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.When Soam tried to explain his conduct, the court questioned him saying how can he make a statement without any authority and that he should not have done so.During the hearing, senior advocate Rahul Mehra for the Delhi government, said on Monday evening he got to know that this young lawyer had no authority to make the statement.He said people are just coming here in the hearing without authority and are making any statement.The court was hearing a petition by advocate Manoj Kumar Singh, represented through senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, seeking appropriate direction for setting up COVID health facility for exclusive use by advocates registered with BCD and their family members.He said he has again requested the Delhi government to attach the guest house, shortlisted by the lawyers, with a hospital having ICU hospitals.He said BCD has the arrangement of medical and paramedic staff, medicines, and ambulances and has also acquired 100 cylinders and they only require the Delhi government’s help in refilling oxygen in them.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on May 6. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-delhi-hc-dismayed-over-lawyers-wrong-statement-recalls-order-248118

As they were living closely it must have been spread among them,” Mishra told PTI.“Now we are developing a method to test the samples of their faeces. This method would be useful in future as every time it is not possible to collect saliva samples from wild animals,” he added.He further said the virus which is present in the lions at the Nehru Zoological Park here is not any new variant.“They have mild symptoms and they are eating well and they are fine,” he said.Replying to a query, he said there is every possibility of animals contracting the virus as they are also mammals like human beings.Mishra further said these animals must have got infected through zoo-keeping staff.A senior official of the zoo said they keep sending the samples of the animals to CCMB from time to time for analysis.As the lions started showing symptoms such as fever, the zoo officials collected the samples and sent them to CCMB.The official further said the samples from the wild animals will be collected either by ‘squeeze cage’ method or by tranquilising them.In the ‘squeeze cage’ method, the animal will be confined in a cage without any space so that it cannot move or resist while taking samples.In view of rapid spread of the coronavirus in the country, the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change, recently issued an advisory to close all zoological parks, national parks, tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries for visitors till further orders to control the spread of the pandemic.Accordingly, the zoo here, Kakatiya Zoological Park, Warangal, Kawal and Amrabad Tiger Reserves, all National Parks and wildlife sanctuaries in Telangana were closed from May 2, an official release had earlier said.

As the virus mutates and targets different age groups, our response to it must actively mutate as well," said Aditya Thackeray.As per latest health data of the Public Health Department, nearly two-thirds of the state's infections reported now are in age groups below 50, with the highest new cases reported in the 31-40 age (22.09 per cent), 41-50 years (18.15 per cent), 21-30 age (17.51 per cent).Children in the 0-10 years account for 3.04 per cent, and older children-and teens in the 10-20 years are more than double at 6.80 per cent, of the state's new cases, giving rise to huge concerns as the situation is vastly different from the 2020 first Covid-19 hit.The Pediatric Covid Care Ward is slated to come up at the NESCO Jumbo Covid Care Centre in Goregaon east suburb of Mumbai - and 700 beds are expected to be added.This would include 300 for a dedicated Pediatric Covid Care Ward comprising Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with a capacity of 25 beds each to cater to the infants who maybe hit.Apart from that, the BMC is planning to build four oxygen plants and maintain of adequate stock of medicines like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections, masks, PPE kits, etc."In the 2020 first wave mostly the adult and senior citizens were affected. In the current second wave (from February 2021) young men/women and children are also getting affected. We have to be alert for the third wave. Also, we have to account for the fact that the vaccination drive has not yet been opened for the under-18 age groups," a senior BMC official expressed his concerns, requesting anonymity.Besides wide-ranging consultations shall be held with the Covid-19 Task Force, medical experts and other stakeholders, on the strategies that need to be adopted for the third wave, likely to slam the state around July, as warned by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar recently.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-third-wave-may-hit-kids-248112

04-05-2021||London||James McAvoy urges fans to donate to India amid 'massive' COVID-19 crisis||Hollywood star James McAvoy has made an appeal to his fans and followers to send out donations to India as the country struggles with the "massive" shortage of oxygen during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.The actor, best known for films like the "X-Men" and "Unbreakable" series, shared a link to a crowdfunding campaign on Instagram on Monday "to help purchase oxygen concentrator machines and other medical supplies to help support India"."India needs help. You can help...donate what you can if you can. Link to just giving page in my Bio. @daivikfoundation," McAvoy wrote in the caption.Hospitals across India have been grappling with oxygen shortage. Week after week, several hospitals have sent out SOS messages about depleting oxygen supplies at their medical facilities and some hospitals had even lost COVID-19 patients due to the crisis situation.In his video message, the 42-year-old star said one of his friends is seeking to send help to India as quickly as possible."I think everyone is aware of the situation in India right now. And, it's really bad. There is a massive, massive crisis and there is not enough of oxygen. A doctor friend of mine is getting oxygen where it's needed as quickly as possible," he said."If you have money, brilliant. If you don't, tell someone else and spread the word, just your attention is appreciated. Hope the situation in India is better soon. All the best, hope you are healthy and well," McAvoy added.Recently, singers Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes also appealed to their social media fans to extend support to India in its fight against the virus.

04-05-2021||Washington||Diplomats from India, S Africa work together in US on TRIPS waiver to COVID-19 vaccines||Diplomats from India and South Africa are working together to convince American lawmakers and policymakers on the need to support their proposal before the WTO to temporary waive some of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) during the COVID-19 emergency.Running against time, because of the gravity of the situation in various countries across the world, including India, the diplomats from the two countries have been making daily rounds of the US Capitol and the corridors of power in Washington DC, mostly virtually, underscoring the point that this is one of the key elements of saving lives.In addition to the senior diplomats from the two countries, the two ambassadors – Taranjt Singh Sandhu from India and Nomaindiya Cathleen Mfeketo from South Africa – have been making coordinated efforts to reach out to both lawmakers at the Capitol Hill and policy makers in the Biden administration.On Monday, Sandhu had a virtual meeting with Kenyan Ambassador to the US Lazarus O Amayo."Discussed issues relating to cooperation in affordable COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics to ensure global public health and strengthen the fight against the pandemic," Sandhu tweeted.While the Trump administration is yet to make a call on this issue, its top officials have been making a series of intense consultations with various stakeholders including the major producers of COVID-19 vaccines, like Pfizer and Moderna, and heads of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and top business advocacy groups like US Chambers of Commerce.Readouts issued by the office of US Trade Representatives Katherine Tai over the past one month after her meetings with various stakeholders is a reflection of this.Tai on Monday virtually met with World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Director-General Daren Tang to discuss increasing vaccine production, the role of intellectual property in addressing pandemic issues, the latest USTR readout said.Tai and Tang “shared their views on the specific challenges confronting developing countries, and the proposed waiver to certain provisions of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for the COVID-19 pandemic,” USTR said.WTO is scheduled to hold a meeting on this issue on May 5. Though sympathetic and considerate to the issue raised by India and South Africa, the White House remains undecided whether to ease COVID-19 vaccine patent protections to help bolster production abroad.“There hasn't been a decision or recommendation that's come yet from USTR, one that's come to the President, nor has been a decision made. But, our overall objective is to provide as much supply to the global community and do that in a cost-effective manner.  And that's our consideration," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week.However, the massive outreach by India and South Africa has resulted in overwhelming support on the issue by Congressmen. Democrats, in particular, progressive lawmakers have been urging the Biden administration to weaken patent protection on COVID-19 vaccines globally.Last week, more than 100 Congressmen wrote a letter to President Joe Biden, stating that from a global public health perspective, this waiver is vital to ensuring sufficient volume of and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics around the world.The TRIPS waiver is also essential to ensure all global economies, including the US' economy, can recover from the pandemic and thrive. Simply put, we must make vaccines, testing, and treatments available everywhere if we are going to crush the virus anywhere, the letter said.In their letters to Biden, leadership of India Caucus in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate have called for TRIPS waiver on COVID-19 vaccines.At individual level, lawmakers like Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and Ro Khanna have been very vocal on this issue, as are powerful Democratic Senators like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.

04-05-2021||Washington||Fauci's advice to India: Clamp nationwide lockdown, go for massive vaccination drive||Expressing concern over surging coronavirus cases in India, America's top public health expert and White House Chief Medical Adviser Dr Anthony Fauci on Monday recommended a nationwide lockdown, massive vaccination drive and the construction of a large number of makeshift hospitals.“It is quite obvious to everyone that the situation in India is extremely serious," Dr Fauci, who is considered one of the world's top infectious disease specialists, told PTI in an interview.“When you have so many people getting infected…the lack of the capability to take adequate care of everyone; when you have shortages of hospital beds and oxygen and shortages of supplies, that really becomes a very desperate situation. Which is the reason why we feel it's important for the rest of the world to help out, to the extent they can,” Dr Fauci said.Keeping a close tab on developments in India, given that US President Joe Biden has geared up the administration to help India, The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said there are certain things that India can do immediately, mid-term and long-term basis.“First of all right now, they should start getting as many people vaccinated as they possibly can, with both the vaccines that they develop themselves in India as well as supplies of vaccines that they may be able to procure from other suppliers, be that the United States, be that Russia… whatever country is willing whenever companies are willing to supply vaccine,” Dr Fauci said.However, getting someone "vaccinated now" does not solve today's problem, he noted, adding that it helps prevent a problem several weeks from now. "But the solution immediately right now is, and I know India is already doing it, so I'm not telling you something that you are not already doing. A few days ago, I recommended and I believe at least parts of India are doing it, that you shut down the country in lockdown,” he said."Because other countries, including for example what China did last year, what Australia did when they had an outbreak, what New Zealand did, what other countries did is to completely lock down for a relatively limited period of time. You don't have to lock down for six months. You can lock down for a few weeks.                 Because when you walk down, it is well known, with the experience of other countries that locking down, definitely interferes with the dynamics of the viral outbreak and you could interfere with the continuity and the transmission of infection," Dr Fauci said.He also recommended taking the help of the armed forces to immediately build makeshift field hospitals."You will recall, last year when China had a very serious problem, they marshalled their resources to very, very rapidly build new hospitals, to be able to handle all the people who required hospitalisation," he said. Referring to media reports, he said there is a drastic shortage of hospital beds and people are being taken care of in makeshift arrangements."So, it would be possible, perhaps, with the help of your own military, to put up field hospitals as you would do as if in a war time setting, so that people who are sick and require a hospital bed, will have a hospital bed," he said.Perhaps, the Indian government is already doing that, he noted.Dr Fauci said the world can help by supplying India with materials and perhaps even personnel that they need to adequately address it.For example, the United States is supplying oxygen cylinders, concentrators and generation units, he said.Dr Fauci said India often helps other countries in emergency situations."Given the fact that India is under such terrible stress right now with the extent of the outbreak, the rest of the world should pitch in to help them, similar to what the United States is doing," he said. "We are very sorry that India is going through this very, very difficult time," he said.

They included Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnailk, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and others.There is good reason to believe that Mamata, having established herself as a formidable force against the BJP, may emerge as a rallying point for anti-BJP forces.Even when she was busy campaigning for the elections, Mamata had written to various national leaders underscoring the necessity for uniting against the BJP-led government at the Centre. In her statements at elections rallies, the TMC supremo had time and again said that her next target would be to take on the BJP government at the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didi-may-emerge-as-rallying-point-for-anti-bjp-forces-247801

The party lost the sole seat, Nemom, it had won for the first time in the southern state in 2016. CPM’s V Sivankutty defeated senior leader Kummanam Rajasekharan, who had resigned from the post of the Meghalaya Governor in March 2019 to give electoral politics a shot.Saffron Campaign fails to bear fruitDespite a high-decibel campaign revolving around Sabarimala Temple, religious sentiments, love jihad and gold smuggling scam, the BJP not only lost the vote share, but its top candidates, including state chief K Surendran and ‘Metro Man’ E Sreedharan, too failed to make a mark.Buoyed by Nemom, the party tried to amplify gains, playing up the controversy over the Sabrimala Temple. The 2021 elections saw top leaders repeatedly invoking traditional BJP issues of love jihad and the Sabarimala Temple to attack the ruling CPI(M).While BJP leaders blame “tactical voting by Muslims”, observers say CM Pinarayi Vijayam, along with his able Covid management, “corrected stance on Sabrimala” to pull off what no other party could do in Kerala for a long time. Meanwhile, a divided BJP house, it seems, further added to his benefit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sole-seat-lost-kerala-bjps-biggest-setback-247804
04-05-2021||New Delhi||Must engage chemical units to tap Oxygen generation: Expert||With Delhi hospitals gasping for medical oxygen, India’s leading field expert R Venugopal on Monday said the state must urgently engage chemical industries to explore options for oxygen generation and storage and plan for the future since oxygen would be needed till the number of Covid patients dropped below 100 in every state.Credited with turning Kerala, a high-Covid burden state from oxygen deficient to oxygen sufficient in a year, Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives at the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), a central body, said he began fast tracking medical oxygen production and distribution in the state in March 2020 when Europe was still reeling from the crisis.As PESO’s nodal officer for medical oxygen in Kerala and Lakshwadeep, Venugopal oversaw a multifold augmentation of oxygen for Covid patients in the state.“Between May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2021, Liquid Medical Oxygen supply in Kerala has risen from 34 metric ton to 121 MT (four times); oxygen supply through cylinders from 22 MT to 68.42 MT (over three times) and daily medical oxygen production from 189 MT to 219.77 (16 pc),” he told The Tribune in an interview on Monday.Asked how this was achieved he said an advisory was sent on March 23, 2020, to all oxygen filling stations, air separation unit (ASU) plants and manufacturing plants in Kerala to run facilities 24X7.“We held stakeholder meetings and three regular weekly reviews and found that 50 per cent of the ASU plants were not working to full capacity. This was ensured. Hospital supply chains were improved in discussion with oxygen filling plants. The main problem of power interruptions at ASU plants was fixed. Gaseous oxygen supply through cylinders was achieved and hospitals were hand held to rectify oxygen storage pipelines and plug leakages,” Venugopal explained.‘Every state must plan for future’R Venugopal, who turned Kerala from an oxygen deficient to an oxygen sufficient state in a year, says every state must plan for the future as O2 will be needed till the number of patients drops below 100 in each state.PESO in Kerala stopped nitrogen production at the local INOX India’s facility way back last year and augmented oxygen production of 149 MT a day to 159 MT a day.In a move, which all states could still replicate, Venugopal said he held meetings with chemical industries of the region -- BPCL Kochi Refinery, Kerala Minerals and Metals, Travancore Cochin Chemicals, Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore to explore more avenues of production of LMO and gaseous medical oxygen and got BPCL refinery to tap gaseous oxygen.“The challenge was non-availability of medical oxygen compressors, which we asked BPCL to import,” he says. Kerala also limited the production of industrial oxygen diverting it to medical oxygen last year and suspended it altogether recently amid Covid surge.Asked what Delhi and other states struggling with oxygen must do, the expert said gaseous oxygen production must be increased in ASU and fertiliser units.“This gaseous oxygen can be filled in cylinders and sent to all hospitals. States should cease all industrial oxygen cylinders, inert gas cylinders and convert them to medical oxygen cylinders as per the SOP PESO has provided,” he said.Asked whose responsibility it was to ensure smooth oxygen availability, the expert said the Kerala model had shown how the Centre (through PESO) and the state through Kerala Medical Service Corporation could work together in an atmosphere of meritocracy to ensure a system that works.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/must-engage-chemical-units-to-tap-oxygen-generation-expert-247806

In case lockdown measures were imposed, arrangements be made beforehand to cater to the needs of various communities, it said in its April 30 order that has been published now.The top court said the emergency stocks should be created in the next four days and replenished on a daily basis, in addition to the existing allocation of medical oxygen supply to states.It said such an arrangement was needed to ensure that supply lines continued to function even in unforeseen circumstances.The order assumes significance in view of recent incidents of deaths of Covid patients in Delhi and some other parts of the country on account of disruption of oxygen supply to hospitals.“The location of the emergency stocks shall be decentralised so as to be immediately available if the normal supply chain is disrupted to any hospital for any reason,” it said.The Bench said, “The replenishment of the emergency stocks will also be monitored on a real-time basis through the virtual control room in active consultation with each state/UT.

Terming the demand for restraining the media from reporting observations made during court proceedings as “too far-fetched”, the Bench advised the poll panel to take the high court’s remarks in the right spirit.Plea on media ‘too far-fetched’The Bench reserved its order on the EC’s plea challenging the April 30 order of Madras HC refusing to entertain its petition on the issue. The HC had rapped the poll panel for failing to ensure compliance of Covid protocol during the polls. “We have to make sure HC judges and chief justices are independent to take views. We have to make sure that the media reports everything that happens in court,” said the Bench. “The EC is a seasoned constitutional body meant to ensure free and fair elections. It has done a good job. It should not be rattled by the observations made,” it added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/take-remarks-in-right-spirit-supreme-court-tells-election-commission-247760

In an official statement, the Railways said, “While 120 tonnes of LMO in an ‘Oxygen Express’ with six tankers will be delivered to Delhi from Durgapur in West Bengal, 85 tonnes in four tankers will be delivered to the national capital from Hapa in Gujarat.” The Railways has so far delivered around 1,125 tonnes of LMO in 76 tankers to various states. Twenty ‘Oxygen Express’ trains have already completed their journey and seven more loaded with around 422 tonnes of LMO in 27 tankers are on way to their destinations, it said. TNS“There is no need for CT scan in mild Covid cases. Patches in lungs will appear even if the disease is mild. Research shows that in 30-40 per cent of asymptomatic Covid patients, patches in lungs appear but get resolved naturally. A CT scan equals 300-400 chest X-rays. The International Atomic Energy Commission has shown how CT scan in younger age lead to greater cancer risk in later life. We know of mild Covid patients repeating CT scan every three days. You are only exposing yourselves to harmful radiation,” Guleria said, advising people against needless blood biomarker tests unless medically advised.He said sometimes even a minor wound would show high levels of markers, which was due to normal body response to inflammation.“Steroids are needed only in moderate disease after five days of illness. We have seen people who took steroids early in the disease, enabling viral replication and severe infection. The timing of medicines is the key to treatment,” said the AIIMS chief, noting that the main therapy for Covid was oxygen, steroids and anticoagulants taken at the right time and experimental therapies like Remdesivir, plasma and Tocilizumab were used in extreme cases because they were not proven to reduce death rate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aiims-chief-ct-scan-not-needed-in-mild-cases-can-cause-cancer-247798

According to the CPWD, the Common Central Secretariat buildings will be constructed by May 2023.It informed that the Central Conference Centre, which is expected to be ready by December 2026, will cater to the conferencing needs and will also be connected by a people mover to the Delhi Metro.“Modern and secure residential facilities for the Vice President and the Prime Minister will be equipped with all necessary spaces and infrastructure, including the Special Protection Group; Environmental: Landscape/greenbelt development, traffic decongestion, provision of STP, OWC, safety aspects including fire-fighting system, maximum use of treated waste water, well-designed network of storm water drains, rain water harvesting system etc.,” the EAC noted.While giving its nod, the panel directed the CPWD to ensure that an area for greenery is provided according to the details in the project document, which say the area under plantation or greenery will be 81,220 square metres.“As proposed, at least 4,918 trees will be maintained within the project site during the operation phase of the project,” it said.It also directed the CPWD to install two continuous online ambient air quality (AAQ) monitoring stations in the project area in consultation with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) before the demolition work starts.“Online monitoring should cover parameters e.g. PM10, PM2.5 along with NOx, SOx, covering upwind and downwind directions during the construction period,” it said.The committee also directed the project developer to draw a detailed traffic management-and-decongestion plan to ensure that the service of the roads near the project site may not get adversely impacted during the implementation of the project.“The plan should stipulate, inter alia, the path and appropriate time for the movement of vehicles to and from site. The plan shall be vetted by a concerned agency in the state government,” it said.It directed the CPWD to ensure that noise barriers or acoustics of adequate efficiency are provided at each construction site during the construction phase and at least 50 anti-smog guns and an equal number of anti-smog towers are installed to curb air pollution during the construction phase. The anti-smog towers shall be installed during the operation phase as proposed, it said.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista—the power corridor of the country—envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a Common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.The CPWD, which is executing the project, had revised its estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.

04-05-2021||New Delhi||Some states showing very early signs of plateauing in daily new COVID-19 cases: Govt||As the second wave of coronavirus continues to engulf several parts of the country, the Centre on Monday said some states are showing very early signs of plateauing in daily new COVID-19 cases, while some remain a cause of concern.Addressing a news briefing, Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said 13 states, including Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Punjab, are showing early signs of plateauing, while states like Bihar, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and West Bengal are showing an increasing trend in daily cases.Amid a shortage of medical oxygen in the country, he said the government is exploring the feasibility of converting existing nitrogen plants to produce oxygen.“There are some early signs of plateauing or decrease in new COVID-19 cases in some states,” Agarwal said.Chhattisgarh, where 15,583 cases were reported on April 29, recorded 14,087 fresh cases on May 2. Similar was the case with Delhi, Daman and Diu, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.With regards to districts, Agarwal said Durg, Gariyaband, Raipur, Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh; Chhindwara, Guna, Shajapur in Madhya Pradesh, Leh in Ladakh; Nirmal in Telangana are showing signs of decline in cases in the last 15 days. Agarwal said 12 districts of Maharashtra are also showing signs of a decline since the last 15 days.“However, these are very early signals and this is too early to analyse the situation. It is important to have continued efforts of containment at district and state level so that we can preserve these gains and reduce cases further,” he said.“There are some causes of concern,” Agarwal cautioned.He said there are 12 states where active cases are more than a lakh. They are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.There are seven states where the active cases are in the range of 50,000 to 1 lakh cases and 17 states where the active cases are more than 50,000.There are 22 states where the positivity rate is more than 15 per cent and in nine states the positivity rate is between 5 to 15 per cent and five states it is less than five per cent.He said states and Union Territories like Andaman and Nicobar, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Odisha, Pudcherry, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and West Bengal are showing an increasing trend in daily cases.“Today, it is important to analyse the cases at micro-level and continue with the efforts in the areas from where the cases are being reported,” he said. On vaccine coverage, he said so far 12.07 crore (first dose for 10.53 crore people and second dose for 1.54 crore) above the age of 45 years have been vaccinated.AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria warned against rushing for CT scans in cases of mild COVID-19, saying there are side effects and it can end up doing more harm than good.“One CT scan is equivalent to 300 to 400 chest X-rays. According to data, repeated CT scans in younger age groups increases the risk of cancer in later life. Exposing yourself to radiation again and again may cause damage. So there is no point in doing CT scan in mild COVID-19 cases if oxygen saturation is normal,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/some-states-showing-very-early-signs-of-plateauing-in-daily-new-covid-19-cases-govt-247712

04-05-2021||Mumbai||File complaint about threats: Maharashtra govt to SII CEO Poonawalla||A Maharashtra minister on Monday said Serum Institute of India’s CEO Adar Poonawalla should lodge a police complaint in connection with the alleged threats that he has received, and assured the state government will conduct an in-depth probe into it.Poonawalla, who has been in the UK on extended stay to evade alleged threats in India over the ever-increasing demand for COVID-19 vaccines, has said he will return in a few days.In a recent interview to ‘The Times’, Poonawalla alleged that he had been receiving threats in India and that he and his family left the country for London after unprecedented “pressure and aggression” over the demand of COVID-19 vaccines.The Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is producing ‘Covishield’ — the Oxford/AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine.“Poonawalla should lodge a complaint giving details of threat and the phone number from where he got the call. We will conduct an in-depth probe into it,” Minister of State Home Shamburaje Desai told reporters.Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole urged Poonawalla to return to India and assured that his party will take the responsibility of his security.“People’s lives are important and the vaccine production should take place in India only. The Centre has already given him ‘Y’ category security. More (security) would be given if necessary,” he said.The Congress will also take the responsibility of protecting him, said Patole, whose party shares power in Maharashtra with the Shiv Sena and NCP.“No one will touch him. He should return and work on vaccine production,” the Congress leader said.However, NCP leader and state Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik claimed Poonawalla was responsible for the present situation he is in and that no one was defaming him.“First, he announces Rs 150 price (per dose of Covishield vaccine) for the Central government, Rs 400 for states and Rs 700 for private hospitals. Later, through a tweet he informed that he was reducing the price for states from Rs 400 to Rs 300,” Malik said.This has created suspicion and there are lot of questions in the minds of the people, the minister said.Earlier, NCP leader and Maharashtra Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said the country needs to know the truth behind the alleged threats to Poonawalla.

04-05-2021||New Delhi||Poonawalla says can’t ramp up vaccine production overnight||With states scrambling to secure vaccines, Adar Poonawalla—whose firm is the main supplier of COVID vaccine in India—on Monday said his firm cannot ramp up production overnight as vaccine making is a specialised process.Serum Institute of India (SII) has orders from the Government of India to supply 11 crore more doses over the next few months on top of 15 crore already supplied, he said in a statement.Another 11 crore doses will be supplied to states and private hospitals in the next few months, he said. Read also: Full advance of over Rs 1,700 cr released to SII for 11 cr doses of Covishield on April 28: GovtHe, however, did not give a timeline for supplying the vaccines.Pune-based SII can produce 6-7 crore doses a month and is reportedly planning to ramp up production to 10 crore by July.Facing the world’s fastest-growing coronavirus outbreak, India has seen a near collapse of its health care system in several parts as hospitals ran out of oxygen and did not have enough beds to admit new patients.To deal with the crisis, the government has among other measures, opened up vaccination for all above 18 years. But the procurement of vaccines for those between 18 and 44 years has been left to states and private hospitals.This has led to state after state rushing to SII, which can meet only a small part of the demand.Poonawalla, who had last week cited unprecedented “pressure and aggression” for him and his family temporarily leaving the country for the UK, said “everyone wants the vaccine to be available in the quickest possible time.”          “This is our endeavour too and we are making every effort to achieve that,” he said. “We shall work even harder and strengthen India’s fight against Covid-19.”Serum is licenced to manufacture COVID shots from AstraZeneca Plc and Novavax Inc. But so far, the government has approved only AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccine for use.The government has also approved the homegrown Covaxin vaccine of Bharat Biotech. Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine too has been approved for emergency use.Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in a statement said 11 crore doses of Covishield are to come from SII during May, June and July. Another 5 rore doses of Covaxin have been ordered from Bharat Biotech India Ltd for the same months.SII CEO Poonawalla, who is currently in London, said the population of India is huge and to produce enough doses for all adults is not an easy task.“I would like to clarify certain things since my comments may have been misinterpreted. First of all, vaccine manufacturing is a specialised process, it is therefore not possible to ramp up production overnight. We also need to understand that the population of India is huge and to produce enough doses for all adults is not an easy task,” he said.Even the most advanced countries and companies are struggling with relatively smaller populations, Poonawalla said, adding SII has been working closely with the government since April last year.“We have got all kinds of support, be it scientific, regulatory and financial. As of today, we received total orders of over 26 crore doses, of which we supplied more than 15 crore doses. We have also got 100 per cent advance of Rs 1,732.5 crore by the GOI for the next tranche of 11 crore doses in the next few months,” he said.The health ministry in the statement said 100 per cent advance of Rs 1,732.50 crore (after TDS Rs 1,699.50 crore) was released to SII on April 28 for 11 crore doses while Bharat Biotech was paid an advance of Rs 787.50 crore (after TDS Rs 772.50 crore) for 5 crore Covaxin doses.Separately, SII in a statement endorsed that statement.“We endorse this statement, and the authenticity of the information. We have been working closely with the Government of India for the past year & thank it for its support. We remain committed to ramping up our vaccine production to save every life we can,” SII said on Twitter.

Students will also be given at least one month of time after announcement of exam before it is conducted. This will make a large number of qualified doctors available for Covid duties,” the Health Ministry said.It was also decided to allow deployment of medical interns in Covid Management duties under the supervision of their faculty, as part of the Internship rotation.The government said states can use the services of final year MBBS students for providing services like teleconsultation and monitoring of mild Covid cases after due orientation by and under the supervision of faculty.“This will reduce the workload on existing doctors engaged in Covid duty and provide boost to efforts of triaging,” said the Centre.The services of final year PG students (broad as well as super specialities) as residents will continue to be utilized until fresh batches of PG Students have joined.B.Sc/General Nursing and Midwifery (GNM) qualified nurses can now be utilized in full-time Covid nursing duties under the supervision of senior doctors and nurses, the new orders said.Further, it was decided that the individuals providing services in Covid management will be given priority in forthcoming regular Government recruitments after they complete a minimum of 100 days of Covid duty.The medical students and professionals who sought to be engaged in Covid related work will be suitably vaccinated, said the government urging students to come forward.“All health professionals thus engaged will be covered under the Insurance Scheme of Government for health workers engaged in fighting Covid 19.All such professionals who sign up for a minimum of 100 days of Covid duty and complete it successfully will also be given the Prime Minister’s Distinguished Covid National Service Samman from the Government of India. Doctors, nurses and allied professionals form the backbone of covid management and are also the frontline personnel. Their presence in adequate strength is critical to address the needs of the patients well,” the government said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-postpones-neet-pg-till-aug-31-final-year-mbbs-students-can-monitor-mild-covid-cases-247686

The amount was received by them on April 28.            As on date against the last order of two crore doses for supplies of Covaxin vaccine, 0.8813 crore doses have been delivered till May 3, the ministry said."Hence, to say that fresh orders have not been placed by Government of India is not correct," it said.As of May 2, the Centre has provided more 16.54 crore vaccine doses to states and union territories free of cost. More than 78 lakh doses are still available with them to be administered, the ministry said."More than 56 lakh doses, in addition, will be received by states and UTs in the next three days," it stated.Under the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, Government of India would continue to procure its share of 50 per cent of the monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) cleared vaccines and would continue to make it available to the state governments totally free of cost as was being done earlier, the ministry stated.

04-05-2021||Bengaluru||24 die in Karnataka hospital due to ‘oxygen shortage’||As many as 24 patients, including 23 suffering from Covid, died in Karnataka's Chamarajanagar due to alleged oxygen shortage in the district hospital in the last 24 hours, officials said.A pall of gloom descended on the Chamarajanagar district hospital as the grieving kin of the deceased gathered after hearing the news.Family members of the dead also staged a demonstration at the hospital and alleged there was a shortage of oxygen and raised slogans.Chamarajanagar district in-charge minister S Suresh Kumar, who is also the Primary and Secondary Education Minister, said he had ordered a death audit report from the district administration into the incident.He, however, maintained that all the deaths did not occur due to oxygen shortage."It's not appropriate to say that all 24 deaths happened due to oxygen shortage.
