However, if they don’t increase the rates, plying would be difficult,” said Vipin Kumar of private ambulance welfare association, Gurugram.The district administration of Gurugram on Thursday issued an order to regulate the maximum amount of fare that can be charged by ambulances and other vehicles carrying patients/bodies in Gurugram.As per the order, Rs 500 per km will be charged for a distance of up to 3 km and after that it will be Rs 25 per km. Similarly, Rs 750 would be charged for a distance of 3 km to 7 km and after this Rs 25 per km. For more than 7 km, Rs 1,000 would be charged and after this Rs 25 per km.In this regard, DC Dr Yash Garg said strict action will be taken against those who charge more than the fixed rates from the Covid patients.“It has come to our notice that private ambulance drivers/service providers are charging exorbitantly from the citizens for transporting the patients within/outside the state. Due to this, additional financial burden is being borne by citizens during the crisis of COVID-19, which is a matter of serious concern.“In compliance of the directions received from the Mission Director, National Health Mission (NHM), Haryana, it is necessary to fix the rate of hiring charges of ambulance to be used by citizens for transporting the patients in district Gurugram,” read the order.According to the administration officials, the fare charges have been fixed to ease the problems faced by the Covid patients and their families due to unreasonable rates charged by ambulance drivers/owners during these precarious times.Meanwhile, the private ambulance welfare association has demanded Rs 3,500 up to 15 km and Rs 16 per km will be charged extra for small ambulance.For big vehicles like traveller, Rs 5,000 would be charged for a distance of 15 km and Rs 35 for extra one km and for ACLS Rs 5,500 up to 15 km and Rs 50 would be charged per km after this.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-ambulance-drivers-in-gurugram-call-of-strike-after-administration-hikes-fares-249036

Where are they? Who is benefitting from them? How are they allocated to states? Why no transparency? Any answers, GOI,” he had asked in a tweet.In another tweet, Gandhi alleged the Modi government has been a “complete failure” in handling the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccination and employment to people. “Neither vaccine, nor employment. People are facing the brunt of coronavirus. The Modi government has completely failed,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.Countering the questions and the allegations, Javadekar said “Yet another attempt by @RahulGandhi to deliberately mislead the people. Knowing fully well that the aid received has not only moved fast and delivered at many places, Mr. Gandhi cannot rise above his petulance even at such times.”In another tweet the Union Minister said, “Condemn the efforts to mislead, misinform and deliberately confuse people with falsehood on the distribution of COVID -19 supplies received from the Global Community.”Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) on its part took on the criticism in the international media about the government of India’s handling of COVID-19 related global aid.Using the official Twitter handle the MoHFW said, “Some global media reports have raised concerns regarding distribution of global aid being sent to India in its fight against #COVID19. However, the aid is being effectively & promptly allocated and dispatched to States and UTs by Govt of India.”Later in an official release the Ministry said, there has been “no pendency of Oxygen Concentrators with Indian Customs, as 3000 of it received in the Country as International Relief Aid and all are all delivered/dispatched”. It also asserted that the customs authorities are working “24×7 to fast track consignments of Oxygen concentrators”.It also said, “The effective allocation of COVID-19 materials received from the global community to the states and the UTs has led to resource augmentation on the ground.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-covid-aid-govt-counters-rahuls-no-transparency-jibe-249032

There is no clear diagnosis about the new mutant that is being called the Andhra Pradesh variant and coded as N440K mutant. In a conversation with the media at Amravati, the minister refuted former chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader N Chandrababu Naidu’s allegations about N440K variant virus having been detected in Kurnool and that it being more virulent was spreading fast.He said there was confirmation about the spread of the N440K virus and claimed that senior scientists had confirmed that there is no new mutant virus in the country except B.1.617.  Claiming that the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister had asked all hospitals to provide free treatment to all COVID-19 patients, he said the situation in the state was under control. So far 67,42,700 people have been vaccinated with all two doses across the state and to date out of the 73,49,960 doses of vaccine supplied by the Centre.  The state he said had the capacity to vaccinate 10 lakh people a day but the vaccine supplies were inadequate. In the state he said 2.04 crore people between the 18–45-year age group and 1.32 crore population falling above the 45-year age group and an additional 3.53 lakh frontline workers required vaccines. But for the availability of the vaccines the state was totally dependent upon the Centre. The states had increased beds for COVID-19 patients to 44542, and the supply of oxygen, vital medicines like Remdesivir are in place in all hospitals. Over three lakh people in every 10-lakh population have been tested so far standing with 7.12 per cent of Positive Rate, 85.16 per cent Recovery Rate and only 0.69 per cent Mortality rate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-ap-mutant-of-covid-says-andhra-minister-249018

06-05-2021||New Delhi||Govt to distribute over 20 lakh mini-seed kits to boost pulses output in kharif 2021||The government on Thursday said it will distribute over 20 lakh mini-kits of seeds worth Rs 82.01 crore as part of a strategy to boost pulses production in the kharif season of the 2021-22 crop year (July-June).Sowing in the kharif (summer) season begins with the onset of southwest monsoon from June, which the Met Department has forecast to be normal this year.Tur, moong and urad are the key pulses grown during the kharif season.In a statement, the Agriculture Ministry said a detailed plan has been chalked out in consultation with the state governments for both area expansion and productivity improvement of tur, moong and urad.“Under the strategy, utilising all the high yielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds that are available either with the Central Seed Agencies or in the states will be distributed free of cost to increase area through inter-cropping and sole crop,” the ministry said.For the coming Kharif 2021, it is proposed to distribute 20,27,318 (almost 10 times more seed mini kits than 2020-21) amounting to Rs 82.01 crores, it said.The total cost for these mini-kits will be borne by the central government to boost the production and productivity of tur, moong and urad.Further, these mini-kits used for inter-cropping and urad sole crop will cover an area of 4.05 lakh hectare in the Kharif 2021 season.In addition to this, the usual programme of inter-cropping and area expansion by the states will continue on a sharing basis between the Centre and state, it said.The mini kits will be supplied by the central agencies/ state agencies to the destination at the district level approved under the strategy by June 15, the statement added.India is still importing around 4 lakh tonnes of tur, 0.6 lakh tonnes of moong and around 3 lakh tonnes of urad for meeting its demand.“The special programme will increase the production and productivity of the three pulses of tur, moong and urad to a great extent and will play an important role in reducing the import burden and usher India to become Aatmanirbhar (self-reliance) in the production of pulses,” the ministry said.For effective implementation of the Kharif mini kit programme, the ministry said a massive outreach with the concerned district will be held both through a series of webinars by the central government and state governments concerned to ensure that there are no hiccups. From a meagre production of 14.76 million tonnes in the 2007-08 crop year, pulses production has now reached 24.42 million tonnes in the 2020-2021 crop year, which is a phenomenal increase of 65 per cent.This success is largely attributed to several significant interventions at the central level.The government has consistently been focussing on bringing new areas under pulses along with ensuring that productivity is also increased in the existing areas under cultivation, the ministry noted.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||NRAI proposes alternative delivery model ‘#Orderdirect’ to reduce dependency on aggregators||Pitching for ordering direct from restaurants, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) on Thursday proposed an alternative delivery model ‘#Orderdirect’ for the restaurants, stating that it will enable them to sell more, sell directly and efficiently, thereby reducing dependence on tech aggregators.In a statement, the association said it firmly believes that people consume the products created by the restaurants and technology platforms are just a more convenient means to place the order.“Unfortunately, the contours of the relationship between the consumer, the business and the platform have changed drastically over the last few years.“With massive dollar-dumpling, the tech aggregators have tried becoming digital landlords that control the entire ecosystem rather than just being a platform where buyers and sellers transact on their own terms,” NRAI said.The association strongly feels that it is imperative that businesses take larger control of their digital landscapes to protect their long-term interest, it added.“We are committed to taking better control of our business and our customer data and become digitally more self-reliant as an industry.“While NRAI has spearheaded this initiative, I firmly believe that this solution will benefit the entire F&B (food and beverage) fraternity at large, benefitting lakhs of small restaurants across the country,” NRAI president Anurag Katriar said.This humble beginning will give the restaurants an alternative to the current digital landlords, he added.“While we will continue to engage with the aggregators to achieve better terms of engagement, NRAI will continue to unveil more industry-friendly tech solutions in the coming days which will hopefully change the contours of this trade and benefit lakhs of business owners rather than a handful of digital giants,” Katriar said.In a similar vein, Food Matters Partner Gauri Devidayal said, “We recognise the positive aspects of what the aggregators are offering us at present and to our customers too, but this relationship is no longer a partnership but rather is one built on dependency.”         And, that’s what the company is working to change, she added.“So, if you’re a restaurant, don’t even think twice about setting up your own alternative platform. And, if you are a customer, and it is not too much trouble, next time #orderdirect,” she added.

06-05-2021||Kolkata||Central team arrives in West Bengal to probe post-poll violence||A four-member fact-finding team of the Union Home Ministry, tasked with looking into reasons for the post-poll violence in West Bengal, arrived in the state on Thursday.Led by an additional secretary of the ministry, the team visited the state secretariat and held a meeting with the home secretary and DGP, sources said.The team, which will also assess the ground situation in the state, is likely to visit several areas in the city as well as South 24 Parganas, Godkhali, Sunderbans and Jaggadal, they said.The ministry had on Wednesday sent a terse reminder to the West Bengal government to submit a detailed report on the post-poll violence and to take necessary measures to stop such incidents “without any loss of time”.It has also asked West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar to give a report on the law and order situation in the state, particularly the violence that took place following the election results on May 2.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said that 16 people have lost their lives in post-poll violence in the state.The BJP has alleged that TMC-backed goons have killed a number of its workers, attacked women members, vandalised houses and looted shops.Rejecting the charges, Banerjee had Wednesday said violence and clashes were taking place in those areas where BJP candidates emerged victorious in the assembly polls.Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress MLA Firhad Hakim hit out at the Centre for sending teams instead of COVID-19 vaccines.“They should send vaccines first, that’s the responsibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We are grieved that some people have died, and action will be taken against the culprits.“But, what will happen to the inoculation process which is stalled because of the vaccine crisis?” Hakim said.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||Current surge of virus may see a decline in middle to end of May: Vaccinologist Kang||The current surge in coronavirus cases may go down by the middle to the end of May, noted vaccinologist Gagandeep Kang has said.She said there could be one or two more peaks of coronavirus cases but they may not be as bad as the current one.Right now it’s doing a “world through” in areas it did not do last year, in the middle class population, in the rural areas and there is going to be “very little fuel” for the virus to continue to go through, she said. Allaying fears about vaccines, she said they are efficacious and emphasised the need to ramp the inoculation drive.   She also expressed concern over the declining number of coronavirus tests. The proportion of cases is actually much larger than the tests reveal but in absolute numbers in “what we track and count”, Kang said.“Best case estimates from a number of models are somewhere between the middle and the end of the month. Some models have it going into early June but based on what we are seeing, right now middle to end of May is a reasonable estimate,” she said in response to a question in a webinar organised by the Indian Women Press Corps.On forecasting waves of virus, she said one can definitely use the characteristics of the strain, characteristics of a pandemic in a particular place to predict what is going to happen in that location if the data is available at that level for mathematical modelling.She said there are few infectious disease modellers in the country.“And all the ones that exist will tell you that their models are as good as the data they have and the models are accurate up to two weeks. You cannot expect a prediction for three months or six months or two years from now as yet. We don’t know enough about the virus. We don’t know enough about how it is going to,” he said.On being asked about the prospects of coronavirus, she said this will become like “a really bad flu virus”.“This will become seasonal, like a really bad flu virus. It will be something like becoming more seasonal, that will settle down, that people will acquire a certain level of immunity because of repeated immunity and vaccinations,” she said.Kang added that people will acquire a certain level of immunity because of repeated infections and vaccinations.“It may be imperfect in immunity, so we may need boosters if we keep having enough virus replications to have new mutants that have immune escape, but I am pretty sure that we are not going to have in this situation that we are in today too many more times. At least, not with this virus,” she said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/current-surge-of-virus-may-see-a-decline-in-middle-to-end-of-may-vaccinologist-kang-248995

Hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients and no beds are available. In such a situation, doctors are forced to treat patients wherever they get space. While the corona epidemic wreaks havoc, a large number of patients in the rural areas are suffering from common cold, cough but are not getting tested for COVID-19. They are not even ready to go to the district headquarters for treatment. In such a situation, doctors and quacks working in rural areas have found novel ways to treat patients and earn whatever they could. In the rural areas of Agar Malwa district, patients are being treated in fields with glucose bottles hanging from tree branches, in complete disregard of medical rules. The agricultural fields look like hospital beds and trees have become glucose bottle stands. Health Officer Manish Kuril says that the action will be taken against doctors who are treating the patients like this. Tweeting a video of patients being treated in fields, Congress spokesperson Syed Jaffer said: "Agar Malwa is a district which has been under the charge of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for a long time. Now look at the pictures, what has he done for this district? Life is hanging through the tree. How bad can it get? The condition has deteriorated so much in 16 years. Now it is time for your government to hang up.

Yediyurappa's official residence Cauvery, here on Thursday.Even though the CMO officials made arrangements for a bed and an ambulance, the patient was reportedly declared brought dead by the hospital authorities.The deceased person has identified as Satish, a resident of Ramohalli on the outskirts of Bengaluru.According to sources in the CMO, Satish's wife came along with her ailing husband aged around 50 years, and staged a protest in front of the CM's residence seeking a bed for her husband."After testing positive for Covid-19, my husband was convalescing at home. But unfortunately his condition deteriorated, and we could not get him admitted to a hospital despite all our efforts," the wailing wife told mediapersons.According to her, the family members searched all around Ramohalli, which has about a dozen hospitals, but none were ready to admit her husband citing non-availability of beds."As the family was accompanied by a Covid patient, none were ready to evict them. After mediapersons intervened, the CMO officials within a short time arranged for a bed at the M.S. Ramaiah Hospital. An ambulance was also arranged, but the patient died on his way to the hospital," the source said.The woman complained that she ran from pillar to post in and around Ramohalli in search of a hospital bed for her husband, and even her continuous efforts to get in touch with the Covid control rooms also did not yield any result, as all the helpline numbers were busy for the last two days."I could not bear to see my husband's deteriorating health condition. Therefore, I came all the way from Ramohalli with great difficulty only to seek the CM's intervention to get a bed for my husband, or else let him die here (in front of CM's house),"  the source told IANS quoting the woman. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-patients-wife-pleads-for-bed-in-front-of-karnataka%C2%A0cms-house-man-dies-on-way-to-hospital-248993

06-05-2021||New Delhi||Moral fabric 'dismembered' to a great extent: HC on hoarding, black marketing during COVID||The Delhi High Court Thursday said the moral fabric of people has been "dismembered" to a great extent as instead of coming together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, they are engaging in hoarding and black marketing of oxygen cylinders, medicines and concentrators."We are still not understanding the gravity of the situation and that is why we are not coming together. Which is why we are seeing instances of hoarding and black marketing. Our moral fabric has been dismembered to a great extent," a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.The observation came in response to a suggestion by a senior lawyer that medical professionals who have retired as well as medical and nursing students can be tapped to assist in the prevailing situation when there is a shortage of personnel also not just medicines, equipment and beds. Senior advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan also suggested that a committee of experts in the field of health be constituted, like a public-private partnership, to assist the court.To this, the bench said people would have to be "incentivised" in the form of some comfort or some compensation to encourage them to venture out and expose themselves to the infection daily.Senior advocate and amicus curiae Rajshekhar Rao said having the infrastructure was not enough, we need to have personnel manning the infrastructure.He also said that presently a handful of people were taking all the decisions and there was a need to bring in more people at the ground level so that the burden on the handful who are making decisions is eased. Advocate Tarun Chandhiok, who recently recovered from COVID-19 said he faced immense difficulties in getting plasma from recovered patients and urged the court to make it mandatory to donate plasma once a patient recovers.He said that just like the State has a responsibility towards the welfare of the people, the citizens too have a responsibility.He said that once a person recovers from COVID with the help of government machinery, they have the obligation to help others by donating their plasma.Instead, people were charging huge amounts of money for their plasma, he told the court.Advocate Aditya Prasad, who has also filed a plea regarding various COVID-19 issues the city is grappling with, told the bench that even obtaining plasma from a blood bank of a hospital or from the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) is a cumbersome and time-consuming process.

CMERI’s aim is to help bring innovation to the common people for which the cooperation of MSMEs that have capabilities of low-cost manufacturing is required.The Gurgaon-based firm, SA Corporation, is working on the development of the prototypes and targeting production of 5,000 units per month, which may further be scaled up. The initial cost for developing the prototype is around Rs 40,000-45,000 due to the sudden surge in the cost of raw material, but is expected to come down on production at mass scale.The firm in Kota, C and I Calibrations Private Limited, is focusing on 5-litre capacity concentrators and at the moment is planning to manufacture 3,000 to 4,000 units of concentrators per month. The company, which has laboratories accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories, is conducting tests on more than 700 gadgets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-firm-among-two-to-manufacture-oxygen-concentrators-developed-by-csir-248954

They also say waiving patents would not instantly resolve the problem, with a lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity.Vaccine-making is also complicated, as evidenced by production problems of AstraZeneca, and would also require a transfer of technology, know-how and personnel.The United States said on Wednesday it supported the waiver, although trade chief Katherine Tai cautioned that negotiations would take time.Von der Leyen said that, in the short run, the European Union called upon all vaccine producing countries to allow exports and to avoid measures that disrupt supply chains.

It also directed him not to indulge in any illegal activities.Advocate Sandesh Patil, appearing for the CBI, the prosecuting agency, sought a stay of the order.However, the high court refused.Bhave was arrested along with advocate Sanjeev Punalekar on May 25, 2019 by the CBI, on the basis of a statement given by Kalaskar.Punalekar was granted bail by the sessions court in Pune in June 2019.Bhave approached the HC earlier this year, after a sessions court in Pune rejected his bail plea.It is the CBI's case that Punalekar had instructed Kalaskar to destroy the firearms used in the killing of Dabholkar.According to the probe agency, Bhave (who used to work as Punalekar's assistant) had accompanied Kalaskar and Andure for a recce of the crime scene and showed them the escape route.

06-05-2021||Melbourne||Australia’s travel ban on citizens returning home from Covid-hit India challenged in court||Australia’s controversial temporary ban on citizens returning home from coronavirus-hit India was challenged in the federal court in Sydney on Thursday by a 73-year-old Australian, who has been stranded in Bengaluru since March last year.The Australian government, for the first time in history, recently imposed a ban on its citizens from returning home, if they have spent time in India up to 14 days before flying back.The government threatened to prosecute them with a possibility of five years of jail term or a penalty of 66,000 Australian dollars (USD 50,899).Federal Court Chief Justice James Allsop on Thursday set the hearing of the case on Monday and it will be heard by Justice Thomas Thawley. The application was filed by Gary Newman from Melbourne, who has been stranded in Bengaluru since March last year.His application has sought to challenge an emergency declaration made by Health Minister Greg Hunt on April 30 under the Biosecurity Act on multiple grounds.Michael Bradley and Chris Ward, who are representing Newman, filed the application before Justice Stephen Burley on Wednesday afternoon.They are challenging the ban on multiple bases, including on constitutional grounds.As per the argument, the declaration fails to offer implied freedom of citizens to enter Australia.The hearing would also focus on the interpretation of the Biosecurity Act which would include if the ban and the sections of the law that are said to enable the ban in fact “abrogate a fundamental common law right of citizens to re-enter their country of citizenship” in circumstances where the law does not set out clearly the government’s power to take such a step.Lawyers for Newman will argue that the Biosecurity Act does not set this out clearly enough.The law also requires the Health Minister to be satisfied that the emergency measures are “no more restrictive or intrusive than is required in the circumstances”, a media report said.A defiant Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday stood firm on his decision to halt flights from India, saying positive cases have started to come down as a result of the pause.The move triggered a backlash with several lawmakers, doctors, civil societies and businessmen criticising the government for “abandoning” Australians in India and threatening the travellers with a hefty penalty and a jail term.“We’re already starting to see, as a result of the pause, the incidence of those cases at Howard Springs (quarantine facility) starting to come down. We’ve got a bit more distance to travel there,” Morrison said.The move has left over 9,000 return travellers stranded in India, and according to a peak business body, the Australia India Business Council (AIBC), it could damage the business relations.AIBC, in a statement, said that though it appreciates the gesture by the federal government providing relief material to India, it was concerned about the temporary border closure, imposition of fines and jail terms for those wanting to return from India.

06-05-2021||Colombo||Sri Lanka bans travellers from India with immediate effect||Sri Lanka on Thursday announced that all arrivals from India will be banned with immediate effect due to the record rise in COVID-19 cases in the neighbouring country.Several countries like the UK, the UAE, Australia and Singapore have already banned travellers from India as well as other South Asian countries.The Civil Aviation Authority on Thursday said that travellers from India will not be allowed to disembark in Sri Lanka. The decision has been taken as the coronavirus continues to spread rapidly in India.The Director General Civil aviation in a letter to the CEO of the national carrier Srilankan Airlines has said, "in accordance with instructions received from health authorities of Sri Lanka due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, it is hereby directed that passengers travelling from India will not be permitted to disembark in Sri Lanka with immediate effect." Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, nearly 2,000 new cases have been reported during each of the last 5 days up from average 200 per day up until mid April.Described as the New Year cluster coming from the traditional New Year festivities mid April, the current wave is from the fast spreading UK variant, the health authorities said.Sri Lanka had functioned as a transit hub for Indians visiting other destinations like West Asia and Singapore prior to which they needed to be quarantined for 14 days. This was an arrangement by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.The Sri Lankan tourism authorities were to continue receiving Indian tourists under a travel bubble for which special facilities were set up. This was despite the current difficult situation in India.However, Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga said that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has issued instructions to allow Sri Lankan migrant workers to return to the country.Last week the Sri Lankan Navy announced as a COVID containment measure that they had increased surveillance of north and northeastern seas to check the possibility of infected Indian fishermen crossing the international waters and making contacts with the locals.New coronavirus cases and deaths in India hit a record daily high with 4,12,262 new infections and 3,980 fatalities being reported, taking the total tally of COVID-19 cases to 2,10,77,410 and the death toll to 2,30,168, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||3,000 oxygen concentrators received as foreign aid dispatched, no pendency with Customs: Centre||The Union Health Ministry on Thursday said no oxygen concentrator, received as aid from abroad, is lying with the customs authorities at any port of import as these consignments are being cleared swiftly, the Union health ministry said on Thursday.In all, 3,000 oxygen concentrators have been received as global aid to support the Central government's efforts and that of the states and Union Territories in their collective fight against the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, it said in a statement.China has sent 1,000 oxygen concentrators, Ireland 700, the UK 669 in four consignments, Mauritius 200, Uzbekistan 151, Taiwan 150, Romania 80, Thailand 30, and Russia 20, the ministry said.Some news reports have claimed that oxygen concentrators are lying at Customs warehouses awaiting clearance."The news is totally incorrect, not based on facts and without any basis. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has clarified that there is no such pendency with Indian Customs. The Indian Customs is swiftly clearing all consignments and no such figure of pendency exists across any port of import," the health ministry said in the statement.The oxygen concentrators are either delivered to the identified tertiary care institutions or been dispatched for delivery. The relief material has been dispatched by road and air too, it said."There are no oxygen contractors lying in the warehouse of the Customs Department, it is clarified." The Indian Customs is sensitive to the need for availability of COVID-related imports including oxygen and oxygen-related equipment and are working round-the-clock to fast track and clear the goods on arrival expeditiously within hours, the statement said.  The goods are given high priority for clearance by the customs systems. While the nodal officers get alerts on email for monitoring and clearance, monitoring by senior officers for the pendency of COVID-related imports is also being undertaken, it said.Recently, the issue of 3,000 Oxygen concentrators reportedly lying with the customs authorities came up in the Delhi High Court and the same was clarified by the government counsel that presently no such consignment is pending.The Ministry of finance also clarified the matter through an official release on  May 3 in response to allegations on social media about 3,000 oxygen concentrators allegedly lying with the customs authorities.  It stated, "We have again checked with our field formations and there is no such consignment lying with the customs. However, since a photograph has also been put on Twitter, if anybody has information as to where it is lying, the same may be informed to us and we will take immediate action."

06-05-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh’s plea against FIR: Bombay HC adjourns hearing, refuses to pass interim order||The Bombay High Court on Thursday refused to pass any order on former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s request for interim protection from coercive action in connection with an FIR lodged against him by the CBI on corruption charges.A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to file its affidavit within a period of four weeks in response to the petition filed by Deshmukh seeking to quash the FIR.Senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Deshmukh, sought for an interim order granting protection from any coercive action to the NCP leader.“The CBI can file its affidavit to the petition, but till then the petitioner should be protected,” Desai said.CBI counsel Anil Singh, however, opposed it and said the agency was given a copy of the petition only on Wednesday and hence, it requires time to file its affidavit.The court then said the respondent (CBI) should be given an opportunity to respond to the petition.“We cannot pass any orders without hearing the parties concerned. If there is extreme urgency, then you (Deshmukh) can move the vacation bench of the HC. You (Deshmukh) have that liberty,” the court said.The bench said if Deshmukh moved the vacation bench, then he shall give 48-hour notice to the CBI.Deshmukh filed the petition in the HC on May 3, challenging the FIR lodged by the CBI on April 21 under section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, dealing with illegal gratification obtained by a public servant, and section 120(b)(criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.In the petition, Deshmukh claimed the FIR could not have been registered without the state government’s consent.The plea said the FIR was filed with a “biased, dubious and ulterior motive at the behest of those having political or other vendetta” against him.It further said the FIR makes vague allegations and there is no case made out for illegal gratification.The CBI had initiated a preliminary enquiry (PE) against Deshmukh on the HC’s order on April 5, based on petitions filed by advocate Jayshri Patil and former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who levelled allegations of corruption and malpractices against the NCP leader.Singh wrote a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in March, alleging that Deshmukh had asked API Sachin Vaxe to collect Rs 100 crore as bribe from bars and restaurants in Mumbai every month.Vaxe, currently under suspension, was arrested in March in connection with the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) probe into the case of recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in Mumbai and the subsequent murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.Param Bir Singh wrote the letter to the CM after he was shifted from the post of Mumbai police commissioner and appointed as the director general, home guards.The CBI had questioned Deshmukh and conducted searches at his premises. The probe agency had also questioned Singh and others.Deshmukh, who has rejected the allegations levelled against him, resigned as state home minister on April 5 after the HC ordered the preliminary enquiry against him.

06-05-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 46 held for taking out procession to ‘eradicate COVID-19’||Police have arrested 46 people   for taking out a religious procession at a village in Gandhinagar district to “eradicate coronavirus”, an official said on Thursday.This is the second such incident in Gujarat in the last few of days.All COVID-19 prevention norms were allegedly violated during the latest procession taken out in Raipur village of Gandhinagar on Wednesday, Deputy Superintendent of Police M K Rana said.In a video that went viral on social media platforms on Thursday, around 100 men and women, many without masks, were seen participating in a procession in the village.While women were carrying water pots on their heads, several men were leading the procession while beating drums.“After being alerted about the incident, we have arrested 46 men involved in taking out the procession,” Rana said.A section of people from the village believed coronavirus could be eradicated by pouring water on a local temple of their deity, he said.All the 46 accused were booked for violating police notification regarding gatherings under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act, the official said.On May 3, a similar incident took place at Navapura village in Ahmedabad where a large number of women carrying water pots on their heads took out a procession to a local temple, believing that pouring water on the temple would eradicate COVID-19.Police had arrested 23 people, including the village sarpanch, for organising the event.The Gujarat government has already imposed a ban on all kinds of gatherings in the state in the wake of a surge in coronavirus cases.On Wednesday, Gujarat reported 12,955 new coronavirus cases, raising its tally to 6,33,427, while 133 deaths pushed the toll to 7,912, as per the state health department.

06-05-2021||Washington||Second wave of COVID-19 has hit India 'like a tsunami': Kiran Mazumdar Shaw||The second wave of COVID-19 has hit India "like a tsunami", Biocon founder Kiran Mazumdar Shaw has said, attributing the unprecedented spike in coronavirus cases to the recent state elections and religious festivals in the country.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.“This time around the second wave has hit like a tsunami. And the unfortunate part is it has not spared any part of our country,” Mazumdar said during a virtual panel discussion on global vaccine equity organised by One Share World.“This time around both urban India and more frighteningly it is rural India that has also got infected because we did have a bunch of state elections and a number of religious festivals that have really, really added to this horrific surge,” she said.India had Assembly polls in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry in March and also there was a religious congregation in Haridwar during that time.Because of the surge of the infection and this virus, it has created an enormous demand on hospital infrastructure.“So hospital beds and oxygen, we don't have enough human resources to manage the kind of numbers we're seeing today. We don't have enough medicines to treat patients with. We don't have enough medical supplies of most types to deal with this pandemic,” she said.“Above all, we don't even have enough vaccines to vaccinate people fast enough,” she said adding that the enormity of the population makes it more challenging. She welcomed the global community coming forward to help India with COVID-19 assistance.Over 40 countries have committed to provide India urgently required medical supplies like oxygen-related equipment and critical medicines to help it deal with an unprecedented second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said in New Delhi last week.“If India is not safe, I can tell you the world is not safe,” Mazumdar said.GAVI chief Seth Berkley said that the India crisis has made it difficult for the availability of vaccines.“Part of the problem is with the India situation, India is one of our major suppliers. They wanted to make sure vaccines could focus on the needs in India. So right now we have a shortage of vaccines and one of the challenges is how do we get countries to now share,” he said.“What's interesting is the wealthy countries, because we didn't know at the beginning, whether any of these vaccines were going to work or which ones have bought a whole portfolio of vaccines like we have. What that means is that already it's estimated that there's more than 1.5 billion excess doses that will exist in high-income countries,” he said.Berkley said the challenge is can they get those high-income countries to donate those vaccines and make them available.India at the start of this year, felt so complacent and confident that it was in fact, even donating vaccines to certain parts of the world before this second wave hit the country, said Mazumdar.  “And now of course, we just need to ramp up vaccine production as much as we can to deal with this crisis,” she said.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that the global supply of vaccines is limited.“We have an ethical, epidemiological and economic imperative to deploy vaccines as equitably as possible. Vaccine nationalism will only problem the pandemic, the economic turmoil it causes the restrictions on travel and trade and increases the chances of a variant emerging that evades vaccines,” he said.New coronavirus cases and deaths in India hit a record daily high with 4,12,262 new infections and 3,980 fatalities being reported, taking the total tally of COVID-19 cases to 2,10,77,410 and the death toll to 2,30,168, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||UP Zila Panchayat poll results: SP, BSP spell new possibilities for 2022 Assembly elections||The results of the Zila panchayat elections are being seen as a barometer of the public mood in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Assembly elections.The Samajwadi Party emerging at the top, followed by the BJP and the BSP has thrown open exciting new possibilities of electoral combinations in the key state that goes to polls next year.The AAP too has managed to do well for itself in the rural bodies’ elections. According to its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, the party won 83 Zila panchayat seats with almost 40 lakh people voting in its favour in the three-tier elections for panchayats, blocks, and districts in the state.So far as the BJP is concerned, despite severe reverses, leaders are confident of getting their members elected as Zila panchayatchairpersons with the help of Independents who won in large numbers this time, more than 1245 of the 3,050 Zila panchayat seats, according to reports.The SP independently won around 790, followed around BJP (around 599), the BSP (around 350), and the Congress (60). Considering these elections were not fought on party symbols (though parties had supported and issued lists), figures may vary.While observers expect Independents and others to “eventually support the ruling BJP”, they say these elections are “a precursor to political mobilisation in poll-bound UP among ticket seekers of legislative assembly and leaders at the grassroots level and an indication of the public mood. The BJP may be able to have its way in getting its members elected as chairpersons but dissatisfaction against Yogi Adityanath Government on various fronts have come out in open”.Sources say a worried BJP is trying to ramp up numbers with Independents to take control of Zila panchayats. Party leaders claim that due to the Corona pandemic, many of their workers and leaders could not campaign effectively. Its state president Swatantra Dev Singh was quoted as saying that “the party got its footprints in rural interiors of the state and will continue to reach out to the poor and deprived sections of society and ensure that they get the benefits of government welfare schemes”.However, setbacks in Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mathura, the key centres of its Hindutva politics, indicate that the saffron party may have to come up with a better strategy and ideas than the traditional planks. The BJP also fared poorly in western UP, the epicentre of the farmers' agitation. The loss is expected to lead to a resurgence of the RLD, which had been relegated to the side-line after the Muzaffarnagar riots, in the Jat-dominated parts. The party contested these elections with the SP.Political observers say results from eastern and central parts indicate “dissatisfaction against the BJP” beyond western UP, which has been among the hot spots of ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three central farm laws. Apart from the permanent protest site led by BKU’s Rakesh Tikait at Ghazipur, the region witnessed a series of ‘mahapanchayats’ supported by rural communities across the board, including Muslims, and non-farm castes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-zila-panchayat-poll-results-sp-bsp-spell-new-possibilities-for-2022-assembly-elections-248923

We are grieved that some people have died, and action will be taken against the culprits.“But, what will happen to the inoculation process which is stalled because of the vaccine crisis?” Hakim said.

06-05-2021||Sydney||'Mystery Covid case' linked to India leads to restrictions in Australia's Sydney||Australian officials reinstated social distancing measures across greater Sydney on Thursday, as they scrambled to find missing transmission links in a COVID-19 case connected to an Indian variant of the virus.With many people expected to gather over the weekend for annual Mother's Day celebrations, the New South Wales state government restricted household gatherings to 20 guests and limited aged care facility visitors to two people per resident.Masks will be mandatory on public transport and at indoor venues. All the restrictions, which cover around 5.3 million people in the country's biggest metropolitan area, take effect at 5 p.m. local time and are scheduled to last until Monday morning."We believe this is a proportionate response to the risk we have ahead of us," NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.The measures, which also cover Sydney's neighbouring regions of Wollongong, the Central Coast and Blue Mountains, were spurred by the detection of COVID-19 in a 50-year-old man, who passed the infection to his wife.The case, the first local transmission in NSW in more than a month, baffled health officials given the man had no known links to high-risk jobs or people.Testing has determined the man was infected with a variant first detected in India and genomic sequencing had linked the case to a returned traveller from the United States, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said on Thursday, but there was no clear transmission path between the two people."We can't find any direct link between our case, so what we're concerned about is there is another person that is as yet unidentified that infected our case," Chant said.It appeared to be the first-time officials had reported the local transmission of an India virus variant in Australia.Tests on the infected man had showed a higher viral load than typically seen in infected people, potentially increasing the chance that the man has spread the disease, officials said.NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet entered self-isolation on Thursday after he visited a restaurant at the same time as the infected person, classifying him as a close contact, his office said. Perrottet, who attended a sitting of state parliament on Wednesday, has tested negative.Authorities also asked thousands of residents in the city's inner west to seek testing for any mild flu symptoms after fragments of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were detected in the sewerage network used by several suburbs.Speedy tracing systems, movement curbs and border restrictions have largely reined in the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, which has recorded 29,865 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began.India banThe federal government is currently under pressure to overturn a temporary travel ban on travellers, including its own citizens, from COVID-ravaged India.

06-05-2021||United Nations||Tragic COVID-19 situation in India should raise alarm bells for all of us: UNICEF||The “tragic" COVID-19 situation in India should raise the alarm bells for “all of us” and there will be reverberations across the region and the world in terms of virus-related deaths, virus mutations and supply delays unless the world steps up and helps the country now, the head of the UN children's agency has said.United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has sent additional critical lifesaving supplies to India, including 2 million face shields and 200,000 surgical masks.“The tragic situation in India should raise alarm bells for all of us,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said on Tuesday.“Unless the world steps up and helps India now, there will be reverberations across the region and the world in terms of virus-related deaths, virus mutations and supply delays." India is in the midst of a raging second wave of COVID-19 and is recording over 300,000 daily coronavirus infections and over 3,000 deaths.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India has a total of 20.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 226,000 deaths.Countries across the South Asia region are witnessing rises in infections, with India accounting for over 90 per cent of both cases and deaths in the region, according to the World Health Organisation.India also accounted for 46 per cent of global cases and 25 per cent of global deaths reported in the past week, WHO added.UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia George Laryea-Adjei said in a statement that urgent action and steadfast leadership are indispensable to stop the catastrophe.“Governments must do everything within their power to stop the devastation, and partners that can send assistance must do so immediately. The international community must step up without delay,” Laryea-Adjei said.“This is not just a moral imperative. The deadly new surge in South Asia threatens us all. It has the potential to reverse hard-earned global gains against the pandemic if not halted as soon as possible,” Laryea-Adjei added.UNICEF said the “scenes we are witnessing in South Asia” are unlike anything the region has seen before.“Family members of patients are pleading for help as the region reels under an acute shortage of medical-grade oxygen. Exhausted health workers are being pushed to the brink of collapse. We are faced with a real possibility that our health systems will be strained to a breaking point - leading to even more loss of life.” Laryea-Adjei said the very low levels of vaccination in South Asia magnify the likelihood of the virus spiralling even further out of control.In almost all countries in the region, except for the Maldives and Bhutan, fewer than 1 in 10 people have been vaccinated.“Now more than ever, we must ensure vaccines equitably reach all populations. Manufacturing must be ramped up, technology transferred, and doses equitably shared. None of us is safe until all of us are safe,” Laryea-Adjei said.Laryea-Adjei said the first wave of the pandemic caused drastic cuts in the availability and use of essential public health services in South Asia, costing the lives of an estimated 228,000 children and 11,000 mothers.“We simply cannot let this happen again. We must do everything within our power to keep essential health, immunization and nutrition services running - and make sure women and children everywhere feel safe to use them. Viruses know no borders. We must come together now as a global community to stop the devastation and protect our children.” The UN agency said it has provided oxygen concentrators and other critically needed emergency equipment to support the immediate response in the country, while also supporting resilience-building against recurrent shocks and stresses to the health system that leave children and their families at risk.UNICEF has supplied 85 COVID-19 testing machines, which form a crucial part of the Government of India's response to the pandemic.Additionally, UNICEF is supporting the procurement and installation of 25 oxygen plants for hospitals in the Northeast and Maharashtra, and the installation of more than 70 thermal scanners at various ports of entry countrywide.Since the start of the pandemic, UNICEF has also been working with the government and partners in India to help stop the spread of COVID-19, sharing information with more than 660 million people on how to stay safe from the coronavirus.It has consistently worked to counter misinformation and promote COVID-19 protective practices, including wearing masks, physical distancing, and handwashing.UNICEF said it needs USD 21 million for the urgent delivery of additional testing equipment, supplies and oxygen products in India, and more than USD 50 million for lifesaving COVID-19 interventions across sectors.UNICEF said end-to-end logistics support from DP World helped the equipment was dispatched from UNICEF's warehouse in Dubai to New Delhi to help India battle the deadly wave of COVID-19.DP World Group Chairman and CEO Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem said the company partnered with UNICEF because dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is “humanity's biggest logistics challenge in living memory." "This emergency shipment of medical supplies is just one of many operations DP World will be supporting worldwide. The UAE and India have strong ties, and we stand by India through this devastating pandemic,” he said.

In general, I support dialogue and diplomacy, and I encourage both Pakistan and India, neighbours, to resolve this dispute through peaceful means. This was the message I gave; it will be the same message if a question is asked when I’m in Pakistan,” Bozkir said.The UNGA president said he would be travelling to Bangladesh and Pakistan later this month on the invitation of the respective governments.He said he had also planned a visit to India during his trip to South Asia but postponed it due to an “unexpected situation”, referring to India’s Covid-19 crisis.On August 5, 2019, India revoked Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcating the state into two union territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for its decision to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcate the state into two UTs. — PTIThe 1972 agreementThe Simla Agreement, signed by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistan President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1972, is a bilateral agreement that rejects any third-party mediation on the Kashmir issue||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/resolve-k-issue-through-dialogue-unga-chief-248715

The RBI has also asked banks not to penalise till December 31 customers whose periodic KYC updating was due or pending. “The additional measures to fight the second wave are, above all, to help the common man who may be facing a sudden spike in health expenditure and requires a comprehensive targeted policy response,” said Das.The RBI will also provide Rs 10,000 crore for small financial banks (SFBs) in order to cater to small businesses and financial entities at the grassroots level. The RBI will raise some of the promised funds through an auction of Rs 35,000-crore worth securities on May 20.The RBI unveiled a loan restructuring plan for individual and small businesses. There are three options—for those who have not availed restructuring, up to two-year modification for those who have availed it and a one-time review of working capital sanctioned limits.Overdraft (OD) for states till September is being increased from 36 to 50 days and the number of consecutive days of OD from 14 to 21 days.

We should prepare for new waves. Previous infections and vaccines will cause adaptive pressures on the virus for new changes that try to escape and, therefore, we should prepare scientifically to detect that,” Raghavan said.Top scientists clarified that all available vaccines worked well on currently circulating B1.1.7 (UK strain) and B1.617 (the double mutant) variants, but added that going into newer waves, active surveillance would be needed along with vaccine updates to counter adaptive variants that could escape available vaccines. The expert said the current variants could be easily countered with masks and distancing. “These variants are transmitted in the same manner as the original strain. They don’t have new transmission properties like in the air,” Raghavan said, advising people to use masks and maintain social distancing.“We have to be prepared for alterations in vaccine strategy. Scientists are making a map in labs of all possible changes in the virus and how these can affect immune and vaccine evasion. We are going to be much better prepared to handle the variants now,” he said.Asked why India did not see the second wave coming, the expert said a second wave was expected, but the ferocity was not.“Such a ferocious second wave was not predicted. New opportunities for infection arose when we dropped our guard and when the standing level of immunity from the first wave was not enough to stop the virus,” he said.3 die in oxgen cylinder blastThree persons lost their lives and six were hurt when an oxygen cylinder exploded while it was being refilled in Lucknow on Wednesday.5 patients die in RoorkeeFive Covid patients died at a private hospital in Roorkee in Haridwar district allegedly due to disruption in oxygen supply.13 deaths in TN hospitalThirteen patients died at a government hospital in Chennai allegedly due to shortage of oxygen.

We are trying to work out with the UK health authorities about the level of exposure,” said the sources.“The travel plans of the delegation back to India will depend on exactly what the UK health authorities will say,” they added.

Vijay Raghavan, warned on Wednesday.Addressing the Union Health Ministry press conference, he said: "Third phase is inevitable given the amount of virus circulating. But it is difficult to predict the timeline. We should prepare for the new (third) wave". He also said that regular monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccines is needed to deal with the new strains.The Scientific Advisor also pointed out that variants are transmitted the same as the original strain."It doesn't have properties of new kinds of transmission. It infects humans in a manner that makes it more transmissible as it gains entry, makes more copies and goes on, same as original," he said.Vijay Raghavan also emphasised that vaccines currently available are effective against existing variants. He said that scientists in India and across the globe are working to anticipate new variants and act against them rapidly by early warning and developing modified tools.The Union Health Ministry, meanwhile, said that around 2.4 per cent day-on-day growth in COVID cases has been noticed in the country.Joint Secretary, Health, Luv Aggarwal said: "12 states have more than one lakh active cases, seven states have 50,000 to one lakh active cases and 17 states have less than 50,000 active cases. Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have more 1.5 lakh active cases." Aggarwal stated that 24 states and UTs have reported more than 15 per cent Covid positivity rate while 10 states have more than 25 per cent positivity rate. Maharashtra has a reported positivity rate of 24 per cent.Niti Aayog's Member, Health, Dr V.K. Paul urged physicians to come forward and provide teleconsultations to people and families at home who are infected with Covid.

06-05-2021||Satya Prakash||Delhi Oxygen Crisis: SC stays Delhi HC contempt notice to Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 5 The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Delhi High Court’s order asking the Centre to explain why contempt proceedings shouldn’t be initiated against it for failing to comply with the order to supply 700 MT oxygen daily to hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients.“We will not send anyone to jail,” a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.“We stay the operation of the contempt order of the Delhi High Court of the May 4. We clarify that the stay, which is being granted shall not operate as an order of restraint on High Court in continuing to monitor the allocation of oxygen in the proceedings before it,” it said.The top court asked the Centre to place a tabulated chart indicated the manner of compliance of 700 MT with sources of supply, provisions of transportation and other logistical arrangements necessary to ensure fulfilment of requirement.The Bench, however, said, “We are firmly of the view that order dated April 30 must be duly implemented. We are of the view that there is no requirement.”Piqued over shortage of oxygen in the national capital, the Delhi High Court had on Tuesday asked the Centre to explain why contempt proceedings shouldn’t be initiated against it for failing to comply with the order to supply 700 MT oxygen daily to hospitals for treating COVID19 patients.Coming down heavily on the Centre over inadequate oxygen supply to Delhi, a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli had said, “You (Centre) can put your head in sand like an ostrich, we will not…Are you living in ivory towers?"It had ordered two senior central government officers to remain present before it on Wednesday to respond to the contempt notice.The HC had rejected Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma’s submission that the top court had not directed supply of 700 MT of oxygen per day to Delhi.As Sharma said a compliance affidavit of April 30 order will be filed in the Supreme Court by Wednesday morning, the Bench said, “We fail to understand what good a compliance affidavit will do when as a matter of fact 700 MT of oxygen is not delivered to Delhi? Even the earlier allocated 490 MT and revised 590 MT is not delivered even for a single day.”The HC had said, “It pains us that the aspect of supply of oxygen for treatment of COVID-19 patients in Delhi should be viewed in the way it has been done by the Centre.”The April 30 order of the Supreme Court contained a direction to the Centre to provide 700 MT of oxygen per day to Delhi, not just 490 MT, it had pointed out.We had told you contempt is the last thing in our mind but it is certainly in our mind and doesn't drive us to that last point. We mean business now. Enough is enough. Be clear on this. We are not going to take a no for an answer. There is no way you won’t supply 700 MT…We would not hear anything except compliance,” the Bench told Sharma.Taking note of 12 deaths at Batra Hospital in the national capital due to lack of oxygen supply, the Delhi High Court had on May 1 directed the Centre to supply 490 MT of allocated oxygen to Delhi during the day itself by whatever means or face contempt of court action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-oxygen-crisis-sc-stays-delhi-hc-contempt-notice-to-centre-248517

There are three options – for those who have not availed restructuring, up to two-year modification for those who have availed it and a one-time review of working capital sanctioned limits.Overdraft (OD) for states till September is being increased from 36 to 50 days and the number of consecutive days of OD from 14 to 21 days. The RBI had already increased the Ways and Means Advance (WMA) limits of states on April 23.The RBI has also allowed V-CIP (video-based customer identification process) for certain new customers as well as conversion of accounts opened on the basis of Aadhaar e-KYC authentication to fully KYC-compliant accounts.“The RBI is now focusing on increasingly channelising its liquidity operations to support growth impulses, especially at the grassroots level,’’ said the RBI governor.In order to encourage banks to freely lend the Rs 50,000 crore, which includes patients for treatment, the RBI will provide such lending priority sector classification till March 31 next year. Also, banks will be able to earn 40 bps higher interest on parking surplus liquidity equal to this special loan book with the RBI.The Rs. 10,000 crore facility for SFBs announced by Das is for fresh lending of up to Rs 10 lakh per borrower till October 31.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||SC strikes down Maharashtra law on grant of quota to Marathas||The Supreme Court on Wednesday declared unconstitutional the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 that gave reservation to the Maratha community in government jobs and education, saying it breached the 50% ceiling fixed by a nine-judge Constitution Bench in the Mandal case.A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan held that there were no extraordinary circumstances to give reservation to the Maratha community beyond the 50% ceiling prescribed in the Indra Sawhney versus Union of India, popularly known as Mandal case."The 2018 Act as amended in 2019 granting reservation for Maratha community does not make out any exceptional circumstance to exceed the ceiling limit of 50% reservation," it said.Neither the Gaikwad Commission report nor the judgment of the Bombay High Court made out an extraordinary situation in the case of Marathas so as to exceed the ceiling of 50%, it noted.The Act violated the principles of equality and exceeding the ceiling limit of 50 per cent clearly violated Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution, said the Bench which also included Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat.Tye Bench refused to refer to a larger Bench the top court's verdict in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India that laid down the 50% ceiling on reservation, saying it was a good law that had been repeatedly followed by the top court and has received approved by at least four Constitution Benches.While upholding the reservation for OBCs, a nine-judge Constitution Bench had in its 1992 Mandal case verdict put a 50% ceiling on quota in government jobs and declared reservations in promotions unconstitutional. It had also made it mandatory to exclude the creamy layer among OBCs while giving the benefit of reservation to them.The top court had on September 9 stayed the implementation of the legislation and referred to a larger bench the batch of pleas challenging the validity of the law, but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits would not be disturbed.The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June 2019, had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and the quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions.The high court had said that the 50-per-cent cap on total reservations imposed by the Supreme Court could be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-strikes-down-maharashtra%C2%A0law-on-grant-of-quota-to-marathas-248479
06-05-2021||United Nations||UN General Assembly president says Kashmir status should not be changed, acknowledges Simla pact||General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir has said that the status of Jammu and Kashmir should not be changed while acknowledging the 1972 Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan making it a bilateral issue."I call on all parties to refrain from taking steps that could affect the status of Jammu and Kashmir," he said at a news conference here on Tuesday."I support dialogue and diplomacy, and I encourage both Pakistan and India, neighbours, to resolve this dispute through peaceful means," he said.While answering a reporter's question about Kashmir, he said that he would repeat the statement he made last August about it at a news conference when he visited Pakistan as the president-elect.He recalled that he had said, "The position of the United Nations on Jammu and Kashmir is governed by the UN Charter and applicable Security Council resolutions. And I also recall India and Pakistan's Simla Agreement of 1972, which states that the final status of Jammu and Kashmir is to be settled by peaceful means in accordance with the UN Charter."So there again, I mentioned that I call on all parties to refrain from taking steps that could affect the status of Jammu and Kashmir."In the Simla agreement signed in the aftermath of the Bangladesh War by Indira Gandhi, who was the prime minister of India, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who at that time held the post of president of Pakistan, they agreed that their  countries would resolve disputes bilaterally, thus ruling out third party intervention.The Security Council’s Resolution 47 adopted in 1948 requires that Pakistan withdraw its personnel and nationals from Kashmir.Bozkir did not mention either country but asked “all parties” to refrain from changing the status of Kashmir.While India abrogated in 2019 the Article 370 of the Indian Constitution giving Kashmir a special status, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced last year that he would make the Gilgit-Baltistan area of Jammu and Kashmir under its occupation a province of Pakistan.Bozkir said that he was postponing a visit to India that had been scheduled as part of his trip to South Asia because of "an unexpected situation" - reference to the Covid surge - and would visit Pakistan and Bangladesh as planned."But I will absolutely make sure that I'll go to India as well," he said.
