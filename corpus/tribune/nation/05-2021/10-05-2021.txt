10-05-2021||Kolkata||No political violence in West Bengal since May 9: state government to Calcutta HC||The West Bengal government on Monday told a Calcutta High Court bench that there has been no post-poll political violence in the state since May 9 and assured that all steps will be taken to ensure peace in the future.The five-judge bench directed that all steps be taken in this regard by May 17 and posted the PIL for hearing on May 18.The PIL filed by lawyer petitioner Anindya Sundar Das raised the issue of violence taking place in various parts of the state after the state assembly elections in which the Trinamool Congress trounced BJP.Appearing for the West Bengal government, Advocate General Kishore Dutta submitted before the court that no violence has been reported in the state from May 9 onwards.He assured the court that all possible steps will be taken by the state government so that there is no violence in the future as well.Additional Solicitor General of India Y J Dastoor appearing for the central government submitted that the issue regarding post-poll violence was highlighted not by one political party, but by all of them.He claimed that in a number of cases the complaints were not registered by the police stations concerned when approached and that there is no online mechanism available in West Bengal where a police complaint can be filed.He said that number of complaints on post poll violence in the state have been received by the National Human Rights Commission, West Bengal Human Rights Commission, the National Commission for Women and National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.Dutta argued that the allegation by the additional solicitor general that the complaints filed to the police were not entertained, is false.He said that he would seek instructions from the state government regarding availability of online mechanism for filing of complaints by any aggrieved person.The advocate general filed an affidavit before the court apprising it of the latest law and order situation in the state as per its earlier direction.A division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijit Banerjee on Friday had referred the PIL to the five-judge bench, which was constituted considering the importance of the complaint that life and liberty of the people in West Bengal is at stake.The five-judge bench comprises of Justices I P Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar, besides Justice Rajesh Bindal.The PIL has claimed that life and liberty of the people are in danger due to the alleged inaction by the police. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-political-violence-in-west-bengal-since-may-9-state-government-to-calcutta-hc-250847
10-05-2021||Satya Prakash||Covid-19 crisis: SC defers hearing to Thursday due to technical glitch||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 10The Supreme Court on Monday deferred to May 13 the hearing on COVID-19 crisis management due to technical glitch even as the Centre turned down the court’s suggestion for uniform vaccine pricing, saying states have already announced free vaccination for all.“Server is down today. We will go through the affidavits and keep the matter on Thursday,” said a Bench of Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice LN Rao and Justice SR Bhat s the proceedings got hit by technical glitches after the matter was taken up for hearing.Cautioning the court against judicial interference in the matter, in a late night affidavit the Centre asked it to trust the wisdom of the executive which needed the discretion to formulate policy in the larger interest.“In view of the unprecedented and peculiar circumstances under which vaccination drive is devised as an executive policy, the wisdom of the executive should be trusted,” the Centre said.“Any overzealous, though well-meaning judicial intervention may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences, in absence of any expert advice or administrative experience, leaving the doctors, scientists, experts and executive very little room to find innovative solutions on the go,” the affidavit submitted.The Centre also rejected the court’s suggestion to exercise its powers under the Patents Act—such as compulsory licensing or government authorization—over COVID19 vaccines and medicines, saying it would be counter-productive at this stage.The top court had earlier asked the Centre to reconsider its COVID19 vaccine pricing policy as it would prima facie result in a detriment to the right to public health. Describing vaccinations being provided to citizens as a “valuable public good”, it had said the current policy would prima facie result in a detriment to the right to public health—an integral element of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.However, defending its vaccination policy, the Centre said the price factor will not have any impact on the ultimate beneficiary namely, the eligible person getting the vaccine since all state governments have already declared their policy decision that each state will be administering the vaccine to its residents, free of cost.The policy was framed keeping in mind limited availability of vaccines, the vulnerability of age groups, and the fact that vaccinating the entire country was not possible in one go due to the suddenness of the pandemic, as the prime considerations, it submitted.The pricing of vaccine was not only reasonable but also uniform throughout India. “Due to consultations and “persuasion” by the Centre, both Bharat Biotech and SII have declared their respective prices which are uniform for all State Governments, it said, adding, the new ‘Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy would further ramp up the pace of COVID-19 vaccination.”Many other companies were in the late stages of clinical trials and expected to receive 50 necessary approval that would further increase the availability of vaccines, it added.“Sometimes, steps that are taken for immediate needs, to tide over an imminent crisis, may turn out to be imprudent in a long run. However, they need to be appreciated, understood and acknowledged, keeping in mind the complete strategy and policy and holistic picture of immediate-, medium- and long-term needs, while also retaining the capacity to remain dynamic to deal with an ever-mutating virus, whose exact graph cannot be predicted with accuracy and continuous up-gradation of knowledge pool with further experience and research,” the affidavit read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-crisis-sc-defers-hearing-to-thursday-due-to-technical-glitch-250843
10-05-2021||New Delhi||DBT of MSP in Punjab: No change is smooth, but this change has been beyond expectations, ‘smoother’, says Centre.||The Centre said on Monday that the switch-over to the Direct Benefit Transfer of MSP in Punjab has been “beyond expectations”, crediting the “smooth change” to state and central governments and their procurement agencies.  Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said of the total DBT of Rs 49,965 crore transferred directly into accounts of farmers across the country for procurement of wheat this Rabi Marketing Season, Rs 21,588 has been in Punjab and about Rs 11,784 crore in Haryana.Speaking to media persons, Pandey said both Punjab and Centre worked together to bring in the change. He also screened videos of “satisfied Punjab farmers” to make his point. Responding to a question on somewhat different “ground realities” and “pressure” on farmers due to strong ‘arthiyas’ links, Pandey said: “No change is very smooth, but this change has been much beyond our expectations, smoother. Both Punjab and Central governments worked together to ensure that. ‘Arthiyas’ also realised their commission is intact, and that the government is committed to providing it to them.“They (arthiyas) may be having arrangements with farmers but what the government is paying to farmers is going intact into their accounts. These are just a few videos, the FCI and state agencies have hundreds of them.  We have all the database (of Punjab farmers receiving DBT), which can be cross-checked”.According to the government data, as of May 9 Punjab procured 128.66 LMT and Haryana 80.76 LMT wheat. So far around 337.95 LMT has been procured, benefitting 34.07 lakh farmers against 28.15 lakh on the same date, last year, across the country. Haryana and Punjab switched from indirect payment of MSP to DBT after the Centre refused to give them any further concessions.Meanwhile, regarding the government’s long-term plans to deal with record grain production and procurement year after year, Pandey said answer can be found by taking recourse to crops where consumption is more than the production¬¬oilseeds and pulses. “India spends around Rs one lakh crore on import of oilseeds and pulses every year.  With the kind of agro-climatic conditions India has these can be easily produced within the country”, he said, adding that the government is working on long term solution to manage surplus (wheat and rice).On whether in future procurement of these commodities will be increased and that of wheat and rice reduced he said: “Land is limited, if we are importing Rs 1 lakh crore worth of commodities that can be easily produced within the country, it should be done by incentivising farmers and that is where discussion is happening among the ministries. Certainly, somewhere reduction will happen, and that choice will be exercised by the farmers who will see the benefit. These are ongoing discussions, definitely managing surplus is a priority for the government”.   Retail pricesCentre hopes retail prices of edible oils will soften following the release of imported stock stuck at portsAccording to government data, retail prices of edible oils have shot up by 55.55 percent in the past year, adding to the woes of consumers already reeling under the economic distress induced by Covid pandemic. Responding to a query on steps taken to contain the rise, Pandey said the government is monitoring edible oil prices closely. “The industry mentioned recently there was some holding of some stock at Kandla and Mundra ports because of clearances related to tests done by various agencies as part of the general risk analysis in view of the COVID situation. That problem has been addressed along with customs and FSSAI. With that stock getting released in the market, we hope to see the softening impact on the oil prices”.  Meanwhile India’s sugar exports are on a “good course” this year as traders have contracted over 50 lakh tonnes of  sweetener so far. Over 50 lakh tonnes of sugar have already been contracted and exports are on a good course, Pandey said. Besides exports, mills were also encouraged to divert to ethanol production. What the government says:—Over 1 lakh MT of food grains distributed to over 2 crore beneficiaries by 12 States/UTs in the First 10 days under PMGKAY-3—During the Covid-19 pandemic around 928.77 LMT of foodgrains, 363.89 LMT of wheat, and 564.88 LMT of rice issued from the central pool for distribution from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021.—Rs 49,965 crore transferred directly into farmers’ account across India (DBT)—18.3 crore portability transactions under ONORC during the Covid-19 period of April 2020 to April 2021 show increased use by working population on move and migrants.—34 States/UTs have lifted more than 15 Lakh MT of food grains from FCI depots for the month of May 2021 under PMGKAY-3||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dbt-of-msp-in-punjab-no-change-is-smooth-but-this-change-has-been-beyond-expectations-smoother-says-centre-250841

10-05-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Telangana restricts entry of COVID patients from Andhra||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, May 10 The Telangana Government has blocked all inroads to the state to prevent COVID-19 patients from arriving into the state and blocking hospital beds, thereby preventing state residents from getting hospital beds for treatment of COVID-19. Reports from various places said the main focus is blocking of states border with a view to preventing the entry of patients in ambulances from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. Such check posts have been set up at the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana borders. Sources in the government have denied any such restrictions, while ambulance drivers and attendants said only patients with admission certification from Hospitals in Hyderabad were allowed to proceed. “The idea is to ensure that no patient comes to the state and then is left out of the hospitals becoming a threat for others,” an official said.All this is being done after oral instructions and there is no government order in writing to block the entry of people from other states. Such checkpoints have been reported on the Telangana – Andhra Pradesh borders at Suryapet, Nalgonda, and other highways bordering Andhra. In a statement former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said, “COVID-19 patients from AP going for treatment to Telangana are being stopped by Telangana police at the border. At Pullur toll plaza, ambulance being stopped for two hours is painful. The governments of the two states should work together to ensure that the lives of people are not at risk.” In Hyderabad, while cine star NTR Junior has been reported COVID positive, another actor-journalist T Narasimha Reddy, popularly known as TNR, passed away on Monday due to COVID-19. He was just 45. Several Tollywood actors, directors, and producers have mourned his death.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-restricts-entry-of-covid-patients-from-andhra-250831

10-05-2021||Tirupati||Tablighis perform last rites of 560 Covid victims in Tirupati||When 26-year-old K. Damodar Reddy lost his battle to Covid-19 at SVIMS Hospital in this temple town, his blood relatives did not come forward to perform his funeral, but a group of Muslims ensured his last rites  as per Hindu traditions.When a church pastor Vetti Dasu died of Covid at Ruia Hospital, nobody from his relatives came to receive the body and again the Muslim group rushed to the hospital, received the body and arranged for his last rites as per Christian customs.Unfazed by the hateful propaganda carried out against Tablighi Jamaat last year, blaming it for spreading Covid-19, members of this Muslim religious organisation in this Andhra Pradesh town are conducting last rites of Covid victims, irrespective of their religion.Active under the banner of Covid-19 Joint Action Committee (JAC), 60 volunteers belonging to Tabligi Jamaat have cremated bodies of 560 Covid victims since the outbreak of the pandemic last year.They are performing the last rites of not only the unclaimed bodies but also of those whose families abandoned them for fear of contracting the infection.JAC president Shaik Imam Saheb told IANS that they perform the last rites of the bodies according to the religious beliefs of the deceased. “If the deceased is a Hindu or a Christian, we use services of their priests to conduct the last rites,” he said.Imam believes it is an opportunity to respond to those who maligned Jamaat out of their hatred. “We are responding to the their hate with our love, compassion and humanitarian service. We believe that Almighty Allah has given us  this opportunity,” said Imam, a practicing advocate at Andhra Pradesh High Court   He recalled how ‘false propaganda’ was carried out against Tabligi Jamaat last year after the congregation in Delhi. “They even dubbed Jamaat members as terrorists. Today, the same Jamaat members are conducting the last rites of Covid victims by risking their lives. There couldn’t have been a better answer to them,” he said.A group of Muslims had formed Tirupati United Muslim Association in 2014 to undertake relief works during natural calamities. Last year after the pandemic broke out, it formed the JAC and requested the local authorities to allow them to perform the last rites  of the victims according to the religious beliefs of the deceased.JAC works under the guidance of ulema or Muslim religious leaders of the town. Moulana Ibrahim Hashmi, Hafiz Ishaq Mohammed and Moulana Jaber are the key leaders of the group.“JAC received Rs.20 lakh as public donations. We bought a new ambulance. We now have two ambulances offering free service,” said Imam.He thanked Tirupati MLA Karunakar Reddy for extended all help to the JAC. The legislator belonging to state’s ruling YSR Congress Party also provided some monetary support.Despite testing Covid positive twice, the MLA personally participated in the last rites of some deceased along with JAC members. He also praised the services being rendered by the JAC.The JAC now plans to expand its activities by arranging free oxygen cylinders to Covid patients.Its activities have come in for praise from various sections of the society and authorities, who were worried over piling up of bodies in various hospitals.Tirupati has four major hospitals and it gets patients from the entire Rayalaseema region and also Nellore district. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tablighis-perform-last-rites-of-560-covid-victims-in-tirupati-250808
10-05-2021||Vibha Sharma||Himanta Biswa Sarma sworn in as Assam CM||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 10Himanta Biswa Sarma was on Monday sworn in as the new Chief Minister of Assam by Governor Jagdish Mukhi in the presence of BJP president J P Nadda and other leaders of the state.The oath of office was administered to 13 MLAs belonging to the BJP and its alliance partners, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the United People Party Liberal (UPPL).They include the state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, Chandra Mohan Patowary, Parimal Suklabaidya, Ronoj Pegu, Sanjay Kishan, Jogen Mohan, Ajanta Neog, Ashok Singhal, Pijush Hazarika, Bimal Bora (all from the BJP) Atul Bora and Keshav Mahanta from the AGP and Urkhao Gwra Brahma of the UPPL.Outgoing CM Sarbananda Sonowal, who had proposed the name of Sarma at the legislature party meeting yesterday, was not among them.By choosing Sarma the BJP may have avoided a possible rebellion at a time when it failed to win neigbouring West Bengal and the Narendra Modi government is on a backfoot over its handling of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country, the question over the road ahead for Sonowal, a popular tribal leader in his own right, remains.The leadership may have rewarded Sarma by giving him preference, it remains to be seen how it placates Sonowal—the face of the party in the last Assembly elections.Tribals have a significant presence in upper Assam districts of Jorhat, Golaghat, Sivsagar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Dhemaji and Lakhimpur. Observers say Sonowal and other tribal leaders gave the BJP a foothold in the region. Perceived largely as a ‘north Indian’ party, the BJP was able to garner the support of tribals, including the Kachari tribe to which Sonowal belongs.Over the past years, he has been able to successfully blend the ethnic tribal pride with BJP’s Hindutva character. There was no major anti-incumbency against him, rather he enjoyed a popular, clean image. Therefore, though he may have handed over the baton to Sarma “willingly”, sources say Sonowal is not exactly over the moon and is now expecting a “meaningful role in the State, not Centre”.Speculations are that given the BJP’s “one man, one post-policy”, he may be handed over the reins of NEDA. New CM Sarma is also the convenor of the all-important North East Democratic Front (NEDA).Keeping Assam’s sizable tribal population by his side may be one of the biggest challenges of the new CM. Observers believe that apart from the raging Covid pandemic, a possibly unhappy former CM, and his supporters may be Sarma’s other big challenges in the State.“Tribals may be unhappy with the exit of Sonowal. Sarma will also have to take care of tea garden workers, tackle unrest related to CAA and chart out the next step related to the NRC,” they say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/himanta-biswa-sarma-sworn-in-as-assam-cm-250805

10-05-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices at record highs; Petrol crosses Rs 100-mark in Maharashtra||Petrol and diesel prices on Monday hit record highs across the country after rates were increased for the fifth time in a week, following which Maharashtra joined Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in the league of states where petrol rates breached the Rs 100-a-litre mark.Petrol price was hiked by 26 paise a litre and diesel by 33 paise per litre, according to a price notification by state-owned fuel retailers.This was the fifth increase in prices since May 4, when the state-owned oil firms ended an 18-hiatus in rate revision during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.The increase took petrol and diesel prices to their highest-ever level. In Delhi, petrol now comes for Rs 91.53 per litre and diesel is priced at Rs 82.06 per litre.While petrol prices had crossed the Rs 100-mark in some places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh a few days back, Maharashtra's Parbhani joined the league on Monday. Petrol in Parbhani was priced at Rs 100.20 a litre, while in Bhopal it came for Rs 99.55 a litre.The fuel is sold at Rs 102.42 a litre in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan and at Rs 102.12 in Anuppur of Madhya Pradesh.This is the second time this year that rates in some parts have crossed the Rs 100-a litre mark.

Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh.In five increases in the last one week, petrol price has risen by Rs 1.14 per litre and diesel by Rs 1.33 - more than neutralising all of the reduction that came between March 24 and April 15.After raising petrol price by a record Rs 21.58 per litre and diesel by Rs 19.18 since the government raised excise duty to an all-time high in March last year, state-owned fuel retailers, IOC, BPCL and HPCL had reduced petrol price by 67 paise a litre and diesel by 74 paise per litre effected between March 24 and April 15.Oil companies, which have in recent months resorted to an unexplained freeze in rate revision, had hit a pause button after cutting prices marginally on April 15.

10-05-2021||Washington||Outpouring of support from US for India, COVID-19 help touches half a billion USD||Less than a fortnight after President Joe Biden in his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged his country's steadfast support for the people of India, America has responded with an unprecedented financial assistance worth nearly USD half a billion.Biden spoke at length with Modi last month and conveyed solidarity with India in its fight against the viral disease. He assured the prime minister that the US and India will work closely together in the fight against COVID-19.  "Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need," Biden had said in a tweet.Reflecting an overwhelming support for a "natural ally", the entire country not only the administration, but also the corporate sector which created a global task force, as well as Americans and Indian-Americans have opened their coffers for India.This half a billion dollars includes USD 100 million pledged by the Biden administration, USD 70 million by pharma major Pfizer and 450,000 Remdesivir doses, the governmental purchase price of each of which in the US is USD 390.Thousands of oxygen concentrators and plane loads of life saving drugs and health care equipment are flying off the United States for India almost every day.Several companies like Boeing and Mastercard have announced financial assistance worth USD 10 million each, Google has pledged USD 18 million, which the Global Task Force that comprises CEOs of top American companies have already pledged USD 30 million worth of life saving equipment.Describing it as a “Berlin Life Moment”, Mukesh Aghi of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), told PTI he expects the assistance to touch almost USD 1 billion by the end of the month. “It is emotional for the diaspora, almost everyone has someone who has been touched by COVID-19,” he said.Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council (USIBC) said, “The outpouring of support from the United States over the past two weeks was a spontaneous mass mobilisation of support for the Indian people from across the America government, business community and diaspora community and the American people.”                 “It is unprecedented, and it reflects both the deep bonds between our two countries and the gratitude that Americans feel for the role India played in supporting the United States when we were experiencing our COVID surge last year,” she said.However, given the “speed and severity” that have overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and local authorities, more assistance will be needed and for a sustained period of timescale of the pandemic, Biswal said.People of the country and the Diaspora too have come out in large numbers. Indian-American Vinod Khosla has committed USD 10 million, top corporate leader John T Chambers has promised USD 1 million.For the first time in its history, Sewa International has raised USD 15 million; American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) (USD 3.6 million), Indiaspora (USD 2.5) million and Jai Shetty has raised USD 4 million.“There has been overwhelming support and offers of assistance from the US Government, private sector, diaspora and the American public at large. In fact, in my interactions in recent days, the US interlocutors across the board ask me, ‘tell us what more we can do for India'”, India's ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI.“They recall with fondness the help India gave. These are reflective of strong partnership and close people to people ties between our both nations. We deeply appreciate these gestures. We will continue to engage with the US in our collective fight against the pandemic,” he said.Among other major financial contributions announced include Procter and Gamble (USD 6.7 million); Merck (USD 5 million), Walmart (USD 2 million), Salesforce (USD 2.4 million), and Caterpillar (USD 3.4 million). Companies like Deloittee have announced to 12,000 oxygen concentrators to India.While Microsoft is partnering with the US government in providing aid and oxygen, FedEx and UPS have taken up the mantle of taking care of the transportation of life saving health care equipment like oxygen cylinders, ventilators and oxygen concentrators to India.On Sunday, Indian-Americans from Tamil Nadu including eminent philanthropist M R Rangaswami, held a “Help Tamil Nadu Breathe” to raise USD 1.5 million in few hours. “This is an incredible outpouring of generosity, which people have come to expect from America. When the world has a crisis, beyond politics, beyond dispute America steps up,” Rangaswami said.“It is comforting to see US cargo jets with much needed medical supplies landing at the Delhi airport regularly,” said Karun Rishi, president of the USA-India Chambers of Commerce. Noting that the stakes are very high for the entire world, he said India's success or failure to come out of this once in a century crisis will have a direct impact throughout the world. Echoing Biswal, Rishi said that more needs to be done. “The scale of assistance to India needs to increase and speeded up. To make some reasonable impact to tide over this crisis, India may need between USD 25-USD 50 billion in assistance in the form of vaccines, technology transfer, increasing vaccines and therapeutics manufacturing capacity, medical equipment and public health measures,” he said.

The disease has been observed more in Covid-19 recovered patients with comorbidities like diabetes and cancer.“Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that mainly affects people who are on medication for other health problems that reduce their ability to fight environmental pathogens,” the ICMR explained. “If you have sinusitis, nasal discharge (black or bloody), pain on the cheek bone, one-sided facial pain, numbness or swelling, blackish discoloration over the bridge of nose, toothache, loosening of teeth, blurred or double vision with pain, fever, skin lesion, thrombosis, chest pain or worsening of respiratory symptoms, you should suspect mucormycosis and seek immediate help,” the advisory says.Top experts say the best way to manage the black fungus is to control diabetes, reduce steroid use, discontinue immunomodulating drugs in Covid positive people and resort to surgical interventions to remove nose or tooth ulcers, a sign of black fungus.

The case positivity rates continue to be more than 15 per cent in these states with Karnataka posting 29.9 per cent positivity, Bihar 18 and Punjab 17.5 per cent. Uttarakhand has been witnessing a spike in cases for a week now.Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh urged the PM to increase the state’s oxygen quota and ensure urgent supplies of vaccines.Capt Amarinder told the PM that Punjab was unable to initiate phase-III of the vaccination process for the 18-44 age group, but it would now begin in government hospitals from Monday following the delivery of one lakh doses. He also informed Modi that the state urgently required 300 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen.The PM, official sources said, advised the CMs to consider local micro-containment as advised by experts who have said all districts with more than 10 per cent positivity and more than 60 per cent oxygen and ICU bed capacity must be locked down for two weeks to ease the health systems and buy time to prepare and recoup.Delhi, meanwhile, went into the fourth lockdown today with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announcing stricter curbs, including suspension of Delhi Metro and ban on weddings in public places. Weddings with 20 people will be allowed only at home and courts and banquet hall and hotel owners would need to either return advance payments for bookings or adjust these for later times.Kejriwal said the lockdown had helped reduce Delhi’s case positivity rate from 35 per cent on April 26 to 23 per cent today, but cases were still too high to be managed.

10-05-2021||Vibha Sharma||Sarma outplays Sonowal, to be new Assam CM||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 9Himanta Biswa Sarma (52) was today unanimously elected as the leader of the BJP legislature party in the presence of central observers, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and general secretary Arun Singh.Tomar made the official announcement following the meeting in Guwahati. Tomar said no other name was proposed and that there was complete consensus on Sarma, who will now take the oath as the next Chief Minister of Assam tomorrow, 10 days after the party registered its one and only solo victory in the just-concluded elections to four states and a union territory.Had PM backingSources say Himanta Biswa Sarma was backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for all his troubleshooting, hard work and political acumen that helped the BJP expand in Assam and other parts of the Northeast.Sarma, who left the Congress after a run-in with senior leader Rahul Gandhi, is one of the rare leaders from outside to be given the top post usually reserved for those with connection with the RSS, the BJP’s ideological fountainhead. Sources say Sarma was backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for all his troubleshooting, hard work and political acumen that helped the BJP expand in Assam and other parts of the Northeast.Ending the NDA partnership with the Bodoland People’s Front and allying with the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), another Bodo outfit, helped the alliance make good gains in these elections.His selection is the recognition of his contribution to the party, say sources. The decision was finalised yesterday when incumbent Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and him were called over to Delhi by the central leadership. Meanwhile, sources add that the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC winning in the neighbouring West Bengal is one of the reasons for “a more politically deft” Sarma getting the top post in Assam. Apparently, the leadership felt Sarma will be able to “tackle Mamata better”. He has been highlighting the “plight of people forced to leave the state following purported post-poll violence and come to Assam” ever since TMC’s sweep.While Sarma has got what he has been aspiring for, all eyes are now on Sonowal, a popular state leader in his own right. Sources say the BJP is considering a couple of ideas, including accommodating him in a “well-deserved” position at the Centre via the Rajya Sabha, even though Sonowal says he is comfortable in state politics. Called ‘Jatiya Nayak’, Sonowal has emerged as a popular face with a clean image. He too is credited with helping the BJP retain Assam and containing anger against the Centre after the CAA.Observers, however, point that the party’s hesitancy in naming its chief minister’s face in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections were indicative of a change. It was certainly contrary to the party’s stated stance that the BJP always contests under the incumbent CM in the state it is in power.During the election campaign, Sonowal and Sarma both dismissed speculations of any “issues” between them and worked as a “team”. But Sarma, who was a Cabinet minister with important portfolios in the Sonowal government, had been dropping hints regarding the arrangement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sarma-outplays-sonowal-to-be-new-assam-cm-250524

10-05-2021||---||CWC meet today to review poll losses||New Delhi, May 9 The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will meet virtually on Monday to review recent election losses. Party president Sonia Gandhi earlier called for collectively drawing appropriate lessons from setbacks in “a spirit of humility and honesty”. The Congress drew a blank in West Bengal, failed to wrest Kerala and Assam from the incumbents LDF and BJP, and lost Puducherry to the NDA. In Kerala, a weak Congress-led UDF allowed Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to script history by not just repeating a government for the first time in four decades, but also winning the maximum ever seats for the Left since the constitution of the Kerala Assembly. In Assam, the BJP led by Sarbanand Sonowal became the first non-Congress government to return to power. Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were the principal party campaigners in the all states. The CWC is expected to chalk out the way forward for the party and also discuss the organisational election schedule which is expected to be concluded by June 30. The Congress leaders, including members of the G23 group such as Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and others, have been demanding meaningful elections from block to central level and elections to the CWC as well. It remains to be seen what stance the G23 members will take at the meeting tomorrow since they had been awaiting the May 2 results to reveal their next move.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cwc-meet-today-to-review-poll-losses-250528

Input tax credit is the refund that manufacturers can claim on tax paid on raw materials and services used to make their products, thus making it cheaper. Sitharaman said Covid-19 drugs and related items had already been exempted from import taxes and 70 per cent of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) went to states. Mamata wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, asking for tax waiver on the import of medicines and equipment needed to fight the pandemic. It was Mamata’s third letter to PM Modi since being sworn in for the third term on Wednesday on the Covid crisis in the country. On Friday, she had demanded an increase in share of medical oxygen produced in the state. West Bengal and other states have been affected by a vicious second Covid wave, which coincided with campaigning and voting for the 2021 Assembly election.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-on-vax-must-to-keep-costs-low-fm-responds-to-mamata-250529

In his letter to Yogi, he also flagged hoarding of oxygen cylinders by people in the area, triggering shortages. “I have come to know that there is a severe shortage of empty oxygen cylinders in Bareilly. The reason is hoarding...,” he wrote. He also complained against medical officers of the area, saying they did not answer their phones. “I have a suggestion which is also a complaint. It is about certain important officers associated with medical services in Bareilly who do not answer their phone. This is causing inconvenience to patients,” the minister wrote. Flagging delays in admissions, the minister pointed out that he had learnt of Covid patients being asked to get a referral from district hospitals when they reached a government hospital. “It has come to my notice that post referral when a patient reaches a government hospital, he/she is again asked to get a referral from the district hospital. The patients keep running helter-skelter. Their oxygen levels keep dropping. This is a matter of grave concern. The referral procedure must be streamlined to ensure Covid patients do not have to run here and there for treatment,” he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/medical-officers-dont-answer-their-phones-gangwar-to-yogi-250531

10-05-2021||New Delhi||Himanta Biswa Sarma is new chief minister of Assam||Himanta Biswa Sarma was on Sunday unanimously selected as the new chief minister of Assam.Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar made the announcement at the BJP legislature party meeting in Guwahati this afternoonTomar said no other name was proposed in the meeting and that there was complete consensus on the name of Sarma. Now that he has been officially announced as the chief minister, Sarma is expected to meet the Governor this evening and take oath as the new chief minister of Assam tomorrow.Regarding the outgoing chief minister, Sarbanand Sonowal, sources say that the BJP is toying with a couple of ideas to accommodate him. He may be brought to the Centre via the Rajya Sabha and accommodated in the Union Cabinet.So far, Sonowal has been saying that he was comfortable with state politics. Notably, the BJP had not named anyone before the elections this year. Home Minister Amit Shah is believed to be backing Sarma.It was a difficult choice nevertheless.While incumbent CM Sonowal can be credited with helping the BJP retain Assam on account of his work, popularity, and clean image, Sarma was seen as someone who helped the party gain strength ever since he joined in 2014.Observers say the party’s hesitancy in naming its chief minister’s face in the run-up to 2021 assembly elections was telling and indicative of a change.Not naming Sonowal the CM in itself was indicative of the predicament that the leadership was facing over the two strongmen in Assam, even though it was contrary to the party’s stated stance—that the BJP always contests under the incumbent CM in the state it is in power. Called ‘Jatiya Nayak’, Sonowal has emerged as a popular chief minister with a clean image and may be adjusted in a “well deserving” position at the Centre.He is also credited with containing anger against the Centre after the CAA. Meanwhile, Sarma, who is also the convenor of the all-important North East Democratic Front (NEDA), is a popular mass leader who led the party from the front in these elections. During the election campaign, Sonowal and Sarma both dismissed speculations of any “issues” between them and worked as a “team”.But Sarma, who was a Cabinet minister with important portfolios in the Sonowal government, had been dropping hints regarding the arrangement.At one point he is also believed to have told leaders that he was not interested in contesting assembly elections and that he should either be given charge of the state or brought to the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/himanta-biswa-sarma-is-new-chief-minister-of-assam-250327
10-05-2021||New Delhi||COVID-appropriate behaviour, vaccination main shields against all mutants, future waves: Experts||With the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the country and concerns being raised about a possible third wave, experts caution that the next wave could be less severe if people keep following COVID-appropriate behaviour and a large portion of the population is vaccinated.According to the Union Health Ministry data released on Sunday morning, India recorded 4,03,738 fresh COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the country’s cumulative tally to 2,22,96,414, while the death toll climbed to 2,42,362 with 4,092 daily deaths.   There has been a sharp surge in infections over the past couple of months, making the second wave much worse than the first one that began in early 2020 and peaked in the last quarter of that year before the tally hit a trough in the first quarter of 2021.Several experts believe that a casual approach that followed the trough of the first wave could be a possible reason for the pandemic raising its head again, though others are also putting the blame on the new mutants and variants of the virus being more virulent.K VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser, had said on Wednesday last week that the third wave was inevitable and it was necessary to be prepared for new waves, but clarified two days later that the “insidious asymptomatic transmission” can be stopped if prescribed guidelines about precautions, surveillance, containment, treatment and testing are followed. “If we take strong measures, the third wave may not happen in all places or indeed anywhere at all. It depends on much how effectively guidance is implemented at the local level in the states, districts and cities everywhere,” he said.According to experts, in a few months when the immunity people have developed naturally or with the help of vaccination fades, the virus strikes again and the only thing that can stop the virus from bouncing back is how people are guarding themselves.“Early this year, as the new cases receded, people started interacting as if there was no virus. The immunity had already started declining. They organised mass gatherings, they stopped wearing masks, giving the opportunity to the virus to strike again,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integral Biology, New Delhi.“While we anticipate a third wave, we cannot say when exactly it will come or how severe it will be. But if people keep following COVID-appropriate behaviour in coming months and we are able to vaccinate a large number of people, the third wave could be less severe,” Dr Agarwal added.While the sudden surge in the number of cases during the second wave has led to panic among people, what is adding to their fear is the constant threat of new mutants of the virus and how these mutants could potentially harm them.Some experts, however, believe that mutations are a common phenomenon, and the mutations do not generally affect the prevention, treatment, or vaccination.“Every virus, while replicating in the host’s body, mutates. The virus is a prolific multiplier, but its replication is error-prone and so every copy it makes of itself may not be its exact replica.“Any change, minor or major, that occurs in its structure is known as a mutation. A virus undergoes hundreds and thousands of such mutations,” said Dr Saumitra Das, Director, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG), Kalyani, and professor, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.Experts also said that every mutation cannot be a cause of concern and genome sequencing of a virus is done to keep a track of any mutation that can make a virus more dangerous.“What concerns us is whether a mutation is making it more transmissible, or virulent; whether a mutation has the potential to make the existing medicines or vaccines ineffective against the virus. If so, the mutant is classified as a variant of concern (VoC),” said Dr Das.Mutations shown so far in the novel coronavirus have not warranted any change in the required treatment or vaccines, but experts believe it is technologically possible to tweak the medicine or a vaccine quickly to fight a mutant that poses a threat to their efficacy.“But in the case of COVID-19, since its spread has been so rapid, it is not giving our scientists enough time to identify all the mutants. And so, the role of COVID-appropriate behaviour is as critical as ever in controlling its spread,” said Dr Arun Sharma, a community medicine expert and director of NIIRNCD (ICMR), Jodhpur.He said a virus mutant can escape the body’s immunity and undo the efforts to developing an effective vaccine or medicine against it, but chances of it escaping the shield called COVID-appropriate behaviour are low.“A three-ply mask, frequent hand washing or sanitising, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowd, especially indoors, are still most effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19 virus,” Dr Sharma added.He said any virus starts a chain of transmission by infecting the most vulnerable population and it keeps infecting till the time everyone susceptible is infected and then it starts dying out.“We treat the patients with antiviral drugs, and we protect the population through vaccination. These measures help us break the virus’s chain of transmission,” he added.

It has also made an appeal that maximum number of countries should help India in the fight against COVID-19. Bangladesh has sent 10,000 Remdesivir vials, while Bhutan has sent medical oxygen. Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka have also offered help to 'aatmanirbhar' India," the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana'."In clear terms, India is surviving on the system created by Nehru-Gandhi. Many poor countries are offering help to India. Earlier, countries like Pakistan, Rwanda and Congo used to get help from others. But due to the wrong policies of today's rulers, India is going through that situation now," it said.But while poor countries are helping India in their own way, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not ready to stop the ambitious project of Central Vista worth Rs 20,000 crore, the Sena added.The party expressed surprise that nobody feels regret that on the one hand, India accepts aid from countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, while on the other, Modi is not ready to stop work on the multi-crore Central Vista project for construction of a new Parliament building and the house of the prime minister.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista - the power corridor of the country - envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.The Sena said that even as the world is battling a second wave of COVID-19, experts have predicted that the third wave will be more severe. But the ruling BJP is doing all it can to corner Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal even today."A sensitive and a nationalist government would not have thought about the political pros and cons and set up a national panel of all main political parties to discuss ways to defeat the pandemic," the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has demanded that Union minister Nitin Gadkari be given the charge of the health ministry and this is a proof that the current union health ministry has been a complete failure, it added.India has reported the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the last 10 days. Globally, one out of the five active patients is in India. In the last ten days, 36,110 deaths have occurred. Every hour, there are 150 COVID-19 deaths in the country. We have left USA and Brazil behind in terms of deaths due to virus. The world fears India now, the Sena said.According to it, several countries have stopped their citizens from travelling to India and our country is bearing the economic brunt of the pandemic."The country is presently surviving thanks to the development works, projects set up by and the confidence given by the previous governments of PanditNehru, (Lal Bahadur) Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P V Narasimha Rao, Manmohan Singh," it said.The prime ministerwill have to do a lot of hard work andthink of non-political nationalismto help the country come out of the pandemic, it said.On Friday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had attacked the Union government over the Central Vista project, terming it a "criminal wastage" and asked the dispensation to focus on people's lives.
