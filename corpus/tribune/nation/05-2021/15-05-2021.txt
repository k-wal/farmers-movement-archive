We have received 5,000 injections to treat Mucormycosis and they are being distributed. More injections are being procured by the state government,” he added.Tope said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to meet 17 district collectors of Maharashtra on May 20 and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will take a review meet ahead of it to discuss health infrastructure and other issues related to the Covid-19 outbreak.He also said the condition of senior Congress leader Rajiv Satav, currently hospitalised in Pune for Covid-19 treatment, was critical. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/separate-wards-medical-teams-for-black-fungus-maharashtra-minister-253319

15-05-2021||Mumbai||Fadnavis writes to Sonia, slams Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s handling of COVID-19 pandemic||BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday about the COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra, and said she should rather advise the states where her party is in power about how to handle the pandemic.State Congress leaders hit back, alleging that the BJP-led Union government’s “arrogance and complacency” led to the present crisis.The former Maharashtra chief minister in his letter pointed out the high mortality rate in the state and alleged that the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government was neglecting Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra in the fight against the pandemic.Fadnavis’s letter follows Gandhi’s own missive some time ago to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about alleged slip- ups in the handling of the COVID-19 outbreak by the Centre.While criticising the Centre, Gandhi should also give advise to the states ruled by the Congress, Fadnavis said.Maharashtra accounts for as much as 22 per cent of coronavirus cases in the country, 31 per cent of deaths and 14 per cent of active patients at present, Fadnavis wrote.The overall situation in the country would improve if the Maharashtra government got its act together, he said.The BJP leader claimed that Maharashtra has received “maximum aid” from the Centre including “1.80 crore vaccine doses, over eight lakh Remdesivir vials, 1,750 metric tons of oxygen, ventilators, BiPAP and oxygen concentrators”.The “Mumbai model” of handling the pandemic, which has won praise from the courts as well as the Centre, was only “about doing more rapid antigen tests” (against RT-PCR tests) while reducing overall testing, he claimed.COVID-19 deaths in the metropolis are being “suppressed” as 40 per cent of fatalities are categorised as deaths caused by other reasons, Fadnavis alleged.“Of 4,000 deaths being reported on a daily basis in the country, 850 are from Maharashtra alone....There has been no focus on Vidarbha, Marathwada and north Maharashtra. It seems they are left to their fate,” he said.Responding to Fadnavis’ missive, the state Congress said it was an attempt to cover up the Centre’s failure.Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said the Modi government had turned the country into a “funeral yard”.“Fadnavis should show the guts to write to the Prime Minister,” he said in a statement.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s warning about the pandemic in February 2020 was not heeded and now there are more than four lakh active cases in the country, he said.“The Union government’s arrogance and complacency is responsible for this situation,” Patole said.Because of the poor performance of the Centre, the Supreme Court had to set up a national committee on allocation of oxygen to states, he said.When other countries were vaccinating their citizens at accelerated speed, “Modi was busy in election campaign”, Patole said.Despite difficulties, Maharashtra has managed to vaccinate 1.15 crore people, highest in the country, he said.State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said Fadnavis’s letter reflected his training in “hypocrisy and double speak”.The Centre gave 1.8 crore vaccine doses to Maharashtrabut this was minuscule considering the state’s population and the number of patients, Sawant said.He also disputed Fadnavis’s claim about the Centre giving 1,750 tons of oxygen, saying 1,250 metric tons is the “in-built capacity of the state”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fadnavis-writes-to-sonia-slams-maha-vikas-aghadi-governments-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic-253294

But, “we will not be scared. We shall stand like a rock”.“We have to stay positive and take precautions to keep ourselves COVID negative in the present situation,” he said.The RSS chief said that this is not an appropriate time to point fingers —remarks that come as the Bharatiya Janata Party’s government at the Centre under Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces rising criticism over its handling of the health crisis.Citing England’s situation in World War II when everything seemed going against it, Bhagwat said a quote was written on the then prime minister Winston Churchill’s desk that read, “There is no pessimism in this office. We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat. They don’t exist”.Similarly, he said, in this situation: “We can’t give up on courage. We need to also have steely resolve”. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-administration-public-all-dropped-guard-after-first-covid-wave-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-253291
15-05-2021||New Delhi||Medical oxygen: Centre relaxes certain norms to fast track approvals||The government on Saturday eases certain norms under Gas Cylinders Rules, 2016, to fast track approvals for imported cylinders and pressure vessels for storage and transportation of medical oxygen amid rising Covid cases.The relaxations would be valid for six months or till further orders of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), an official statement said.The department said that the certification of Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organization (PESO) will not be mandatory before importing consignment of oxygen cylinders, and containers.The certification of PESO will be required before use of the oxygen cylinders, which entails weight and hydro testing, it added.“The Indian missions should, however, ensure that the oxygen cylinders should comply with India or international standards before shipment,” it said.In case of filled cylinders, the agency exporting to India would have to certify that the oxygen filled in the cylinder is of such purity and concentration that is fit for medical use.The certification would be attested by the Indian mission in the exporting country and soon upon arrival in India, such filled cylinders will be inspected on sample basis by an empanelled agency of PESO.“All the filled cylinders must be verified for quality of gas filled therein under the supervision of medical/ Food and Drugs Controllers and if quality of gas conforms to their requirement of medical oxygen, cylinders may be sent directly to hospitals for use,” the department said.Regarding PSA (pressure swing adsorption) installations at hospitals with filling facilities or at COVID centres, it said PSA plants where generated oxygen is directly supplied to hospital and no filling of cylinders is taking place, in such cases the facilities do not need any permission or license under PESO rules.The department instructed that if the PSA is attached with a compressor and filling of oxygen cylinder is to take place, hospitals have to notify it to PESO with certain information like number of cylinders to be stored at site; and number of filling points.“Any COVID centre may utilise liquid cylinders on board with vaporizer for supplying of gaseous medical oxygen through pipeline or for filling cylinders in open places are permitted” subject to certain conditions, it said.Further, it said that in case if consignment of oxygen cylinders, ISO containers or PSA plants or its related equipment have already arrived in India, without taking import permission from PESO, due to an urgency, the filling permission for these cylinders will be issued based on relaxed rules. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/medical-oxygen-centre-relaxes-certain-norms-to-fast-track-approvals-253290
15-05-2021||Unnao||Ex-IAS officer booked for spreading misinformation: Police||A former IAS officer has been booked for allegedly spreading misinformation by tweeting a seven-year-old photograph of dead bodies floating in the Ganga in Unnao and claiming them to be recent ones spotted in the river in Ballia, police said on Saturday.In an FIR lodged at the Unnao Kotwali police station, the 1982-batch, UP-cadre officer Surya Pratap Singh has also been accused of claiming on social media that 67 bodies were buried on the Unnao riverbank using JCB and without performing any last rites.Kotwali police station’s SHO Dinesh Chandra Mishra said the case against Singh was lodged on May 13 on complaints by several city residents.The former outspoken officer had been booked on May 13 after he tweeted the picture of floating bodies and wrote in Hindi, “Tairati laashon aur ukharhtee saanso kaa UP model (The UP model of floating bodies and gasping breaths).”   SHO Mishra said the case against Singh has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Information Technology Act, the Disaster Management Act and the UP Public Health and Epidemic Diseases Control Ordinance, 2020.Quoting from the FIR lodged against the former IAS officer, Mishra said the case against Singh was registered on the complaint by various Unnao residents.He said the residents also accused Singh of falsely claiming on social media that 67 bodies were buried on the riverbank using JCB and without performing their last rites, in an insult to the Hindu religion.The SHO said the people also accused the former IAS officer of observing on social media that it was the Yogi model of the governance in Uttar Pradesh where the living ones fail to get the treatment and the dead ones their last rites.“Due to this tweet, the atmosphere of the district became tense. In the probe, the tweet was found to be misleading with old pictures of Unnao linked to Ballia,” Mishra said.About the authenticity of the floating bodies tweeted by Singh, Mishra said on being contacted, the Social Media Cell of the Unnao police found that the photograph tweeted by Singh dated back to January 13, 2014, in which around 100 bodies were seen floating on the Ganga in Unnao’s Pariyar Ghat.Mishra said the IAS officer, by tweeting an old picture of dead bodies floating in the Ganga in Unnao and claiming them to be those spotted in Ballia, has deliberately created a feeling of animosity among people belonging to different religions.Reacting to the registration of the criminal case against him, Singh, in a fresh tweet asked, “Were no bodies floating in Unnao? Will the truth change after registering a case against me?” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-ias-officer-booked-for-spreading-misinformation-police-253289

He also appealed to Congress workers to provide all assistance to those in need. “May 15 Cyclone Alert has been issued in Kerala, Maharashtra, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka.

It is very likely to move north-north-westwards and cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around the afternoon or evening of May 18.The IAF has kept 16 transport aircraft and 18 helicopters on operational readiness in peninsular India in preparation for CCyclone Tauktae which is expected to cause very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall along the western coast of India in the next few days.The IAF is also focusing on undertaking COVID-19 relief operations in these coastal areas during the coming days as bad weather is likely to affect air operations later. The cyclone relief operations are in addition to those underway for COVID relief.Till the morning of May 15, the IAF had undertaken a total of 778 domestic sorties across the country, logging 1,147 flying hours, to ferry COVId related stores and equipment. This includes 490 oxygen tankers weighing 8,343 metric tonnes and 209 metric tonnes of other equipment.Besides, 130 international sorties were carried out by the IAF to bring in 104 oxygen containers weighing 872 metric tonnes and other associated equipment weighing 352 metric tonnes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-airlifts-ndrf-men-and-equipment-from-punjab-to-gujarat-to-tackle-cyclone-tauktae-253277

The co-sponsors of the proposal have already requested the TRIPS Council chair Dagfinn Sorli to consider holding a meeting open to all members in the second half of May. The proposal can then be placed formally before the TRIPS Council meeting in early June.The waiver would ensure that patent, design and copyrights-related issues do not restrict the rapid scaling up of manufacturing and also do not hinder the equitable and affordable access for vaccines and treatments.In an interesting aside, Tai asked Ghebreyesus how the WHO declares the existence, and the end, of a pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-steps-up-effort-for-ipr-waiver-on-vaccines-253273
15-05-2021||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Yogi, Capt Amarinder spar over Punjab naming Malerkotla as district||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday hit out at the Punjab government for declaring Malerkotla as an independent revenue district of the state.In effect, the full spectrum of the past and present political circumstances leading up to announcement of Malerkotla as the 23rd district of Punjab, and the retaliatory retort from Adityanath is harbinger of the blowing gentle political winds of the forthcoming assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, which will be held during next spring season.मत और मजहब के आधार पर किसी प्रकार का विभेद भारत के संविधान की मूल भावना के विपरीत है।इस समय, मलेरकोटला (पंजाब) का गठन किया जाना कांग्रेस की विभाजनकारी नीति का परिचायक है।  The election in the two states along with Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa are simultaneously due in February-March next year.Taking exception to the declaration of Malerkotla as a separate district, Adityanath said any kind of discrimination based on ideology and religion is against the fundamental spirit of the Constitution.Slamming Yogi Adityanath over his "inflammatory" tweet on the declaration of Malerkotla as the 23rd district of Punjab, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh termed it an attempt to incite communal hatred in the peaceful state as part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s divisive policies.Contrasting the communal harmony in Punjab with the divisiveness being promoted by the Yogi Adiyanath government in Uttar Pradesh, Amarinder Singh asked the former to stay out of his state’s affairs, which are in much better shape than those in UP under the divisive and destructive BJP government, which has been actively promoting communal discord in the state for the past over four years.“What does he (Yogi Adityanath) know of Punjab’s ethos or the history of Malerkotla, whose relationship with Sikhism and its Gurus was known to every Punjabi? And what does he understand of the Indian Constitution, which is being brazenly trampled every day by his own government in UP?” asked the Chief Minister, in a strong reaction to his UP counterpart’s tweet, describing Malerkotla’s new status as a “sign of the divisive policies of the Congress.”Lambasting the ruling Congress in Punjab, Yogi said the creation of Malerkotla as a district at this juncture was testimony to Congress’ policy of divisive politics.“Ideological and religious driven discrimination of any kind is against the basic spirit of the Constitution,” Adityanath tweeted and added that creation of the district is testimony to the Congress policy of divisive politics.Creation of Malerkotla was an electoral promise of the Congress, made during the last Assembly election in Punjab.Malerkotla township and the assembly constituency are preponderated with Muslim population.Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh announced Malerkotla as a new district of the state on Friday on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr festival.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-capt-amarinder-spar-over-punjab-naming-malerkotla-as-district-253271

We will observe it as black day," Rajewal said.A large number of farmers reached Delhi's borders on November 26 after facing water cannons and police barriers as part of their "Delhi Chalo" march against the Centre's farm laws.Thousands of farmers from across the country joined the protest in the following months at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders around the national capital.Rajewal appealed to people to support the call for observing ‘black day' on May 26."We appeal to people of the country and also Punjab to hang black flags at their house, shops, trucks and other vehicles. We will also burn effigies of (PM) Narendra Modi as a form of protest," he added.He said that the government has not heard the farmers demands to repeal the three farm laws and "with increasing prices of fertilisers, diesel and petrol, the farming business is not possible".Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders since November 2020 demanding that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back, and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.However, the government, which has held multiple rounds of formal dialogue with the protestors, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samyukta-kisan-morcha-to-observe-may-26-as-black-day-marking-6-months-of-protest-against-farm-laws-253253

15-05-2021||New Delhi||India needs stricter action as WhatsApp privacy policy goes live||With the controversial WhatsApp privacy policy coming into effect from Saturday for its over 2 billion users including more than 400 million in India, industry experts emphasised that the government must implement stricter data privacy rules and restrain the Facebook-owned app as was done while banning Chinese apps to protect the sovereignty of the country.Giving an interim solace for those who do not accept the new policy, WhatsApp has said that its users will not immediately lose their accounts or face curtailed functionalities  on the platform on May 15, but they will have to eventually go through limited functions if they fail to accept the new norms in the due course of time.On Thursday, a senior Ministry of Electronics and IT official said during an Assocham event that the government is pro-actively looking at the best possible action over  the new WhatsApp privacy policy.MeitY Special Secretary and Financial Advisor Jyoti Arora stated that the ministry is aware about the fact that Germany has banned the privacy policy of WhatsApp."There is no judicial order in favour of WhatsApp. In view of the unlawful nature of this privacy policy, the government should restrain WhatsApp as was done while  banning Chinese apps to protect sovereignty of India," said Advocate Virag Gupta, who is arguing K.N. Govindacharya's matter before the Delhi High Court for disclosure of details of designated officers of social media companies.WhatsApp has said that after giving everyone time to review the privacy policy from May 15, after a period of several weeks, the reminder people receive will eventually  become persistent.After persistent reminders, the users will encounter limited functionality on WhatsApp until they accept the updates.The users won't be able to access chat list. After a few weeks of limited functionality, they won't be able to receive incoming calls or notifications and WhatsApp will stop sending messages and calls to their phones."WhatsApp's new terms requiring users to accept them by a cut-off date to continue to avail full functionality has brought click wrap contracts and their intended manner  of operation under the glare. Click wrap contracts require a user to click 'yes' or 'ok' to the terms, which constitutes legal consent for availing a service," said Raj Ramachandran, Partner, J Sagar Associates.Given the substantial user base and the apparent network effect, it literally leaves little room for users to make a choice."Germany has temporarily banned the update raising privacy concerns and EU may also looking into it closely. It is time for India too to implement effective data privacy  rules, which has been pending for quite some time now," Ramachandran said in a statement.In March this year, MeitY filed an affidavit that that new privacy policy of WhatsApp violates the Information Technology Rules of 2011."In January 2021, the ministry wrote a letter to WhatsApp exposing key objection of non-voluntary nature of the new privacy policy. The government also warned WhatsApp by quoting a Supreme Court of India judgment on privacy delivered in 2017," informed Gupta.It also said that data exchange between Facebook and WhatsApp is untenable because data collected from one service cannot be used in another service."Instead of justifying its privacy policy, WhatsApp in its affidavit has exposed many other Internet-based applications and websites with similar policies and that  some even collect more data. In light of this fact, the government must ensure physical presence of WhatsApp and other foreign Apps in India," Gupta reiterated. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-needs-stricter-action-as-whatsapp-privacy-policy-goes-live-253249

15-05-2021||New Delhi||Helping in life and death too, ‘ambulance couple' goes where relatives sometimes fear to tread||Profiles of humaneness in the time of Covid, Himanshu and Twinkle Kalia spend their days between helping the ill get a fighting chance at life and ensuring dignity in death for those who don't make it.As the second COVID-19 wave ravages large parts of India—including the national capital that has seen thousands scramble for oxygen, hospital beds and crematorium spots—the Kalias, Delhi's ‘ambulance couple', ferry the ill to hospital, fetch medicines, arrange funerals and sometimes step in to perform last rites too. Cloaked in PPE suits, face shields and masks, the Kalias go where even close relatives fear to tread, spending their days tending to people suffering from Covid or those who have died of it and making sure their fleet of 12 ambulances are road ready to tackle any emergency. "We don't put it in records but in the second wave of coronavirus we have been helping almost 20-25 patients daily reach hospitals. We have performed cremations of 80 people who have died of COVID-19 and helped over 1,000 people in arranging for cremations," Himanshu told PTI. It's all free of course, the 42-year-old hastened to add. A few days ago, they got a call from Mayur Vihar in east Delhi about a  patient who had died in an autorickshaw on the way to hospital, said Twinkle.The Kalias, who live in Pratap Nagar in north Delhi, reached there quickly, got the body verified by a doctor and helped in the last rites."We got a call from Sandeep Mitra whose wife Madhura had collapsed in an autorickshaw while he was taking her to a hospital. He was not getting any help from his society or elsewhere. We reached there, got a doctor to the spot and performed her cremation at the Sarai  Kale Khan crematorium," Twinkle said. The 39-year-old is a cancer survivor and the couple has two daughters, Japji (13) and Riddhi (7). But personal commitments don't come in the way of their zeal to help others in these days of India's most serious health crisis. At a time ambulances are in short supply and stories of ambulance drivers and owners fleecing those in need make the rounds, the Kalias have publicised the free services of their fleet. Himanshu's mobile number has been pasted at various places across the city.As a result, he said, distress calls come in from all over Delhi and also from Ghaziabad and Noida. The word has spread and some hospitals have also started reaching out. Some know him for not just services but also his skills behind the wheel, he said proudly."Due to my fast driving, even through traffic, many hospitals call me in emergency situations to save the lives of patients," he said.  And sometimes the ambulance has to do the job of a hearse.It's not an easy existence. There is a fleet of vehicles to maintain, a team of 18 people to support and a home to run. Both Himanshu and Twinkle work as insurance agents and said they spend their earnings in serving humanity. The ambulance service started in 2002 when his parents-in-law gifted him an ambulance, said Himanshu. It has built up steadily since with the Kalias adding vehicles over the years.Six of the ambulances are parked at their residence and six elsewhere.  The couple was doing charitable work even before the pandemic struck and has received several awards. In 2019, Twinkle was awarded the Nari Shakti Puruskar by President Ram Nath Kovind. Four years before that, in 2015, an organisation in Dubai honoured her as the ‘First Woman Ambulance Driver'. In 2016, Himanshu got the ‘Ambulance Man' award in Malaysia.Hoping to ramp up their work of facilitating hospital admissions, blood donations and arranging funerals, Himanshu and Twinkle said they have expanded their team. As millions of Indians battle infection and death, there are many more miles to go and hurdles to cross for this intrepid couple. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/helping-in-life-and-death-too-ambulance-couple-goes-where-relatives-sometimes-fear-to-tread-253241

15-05-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi reviews COVID situation, says localised containment strategies need of the hour||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called for augmenting healthcare resources in rural areas to focus on door-to-door testing and surveillance, and asserted that localised containment strategies are the need of the hour, especially in states with high positivity rate in districts.Chairing a high-level meeting, Modi said states should be encouraged to report their COVID-19 numbers transparently “without any pressure of high numbers showing adversely on their efforts”, remarks that come amid reports that many states have been under-reporting their case and fatality tallies.Modi also directed that a distribution plan for ensuring oxygen supply in rural areas should be worked out, including through provision of oxygen concentrators, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said.He said necessary training should be provided to health workers in the operation of such equipment, and power supply should be ensured for smooth operation of such medical devices, it said.Unlike the first wave of COVID-19 cases last year when rural India was not badly hit, the region has been seriously affected by the second wave in several states.Prime Minister Modi sought empowering ASHA and anganwadi workers with all necessary tools.Testing needs to be scaled up further, with use of both RT-PCR and rapid tests, especially in areas with high test positivity rates, he added.The PMO noted that testing has gone up rapidly in the country, from around 50 lakh tests per week in early March to around 1.3 crore tests per week now.Modi was briefed about the gradually decreasing test positivity rate and increasing recovery rate, it said, adding that cases had gone over four lakh per day and are now coming down as a result of the efforts of healthcare workers, state governments and the Central government.Officials gave a detailed presentation on the state and district level situation of COVID-19 testing, oxygen availability, healthcare infrastructure and vaccination roadmap.The prime minister also took serious note of some reports about ventilators lying unutilised in storage in some states and directed that an immediate audit of installation and operation of ventilators provided by the Central government be carried out.He added that refresher training for properly operating ventilators should be provided to healthcare workers if necessary, the PMO said.

It was never said with the intent to insult, intimidate, humiliate or hurt anyone's feelings. Because of my language barrier, I was genuinely misinformed about the meaning of the word,” she had said in a statement, which she also shared in Hindi. “Once I was made aware of its meaning, I immediately took the part down. I have the utmost respect for every single person from every caste, creed or gender and acknowledge their immense contribution to our society or nation,” she wrote.“I sincerely would like to apologize to every single person who has been unintentionally hurt by the usage of the word and I sincerely regret the same,” she added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-cops-book-taarak-mehta-ka-ooltah-chashmah-actor-munmun-dutta-for-making-alleged-casteist-slur-in-video-253219

The death toll stands at 2,62,317.India's COVID-19 tally crossed the 10 million mark on December 19 and in under six months it has doubled, surpassing the grim milestone of 20 million cases on May 4.Ghebreyesus pointed out that the emergency-like situation was not restricted to India.“Nepal, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Egypt are just some of the countries that are dealing with spikes in cases and hospitalisations,” he said adding that some countries in the Americas still have high numbers of cases and as a region, the Americas accounted for 40 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths last week.There are also spikes in some countries in Africa. “These countries are in heightened response mode and WHO will continue to provide support in all ways possible,” he said.Noting that COVID-19 has already cost more than 3.3 million lives across the world, Ghebreyesus said, "We're on track for the second year of this pandemic to be far more deadly than the first.” He lamented that vaccine supply remains a key challenge and that saving lives and livelihoods with a combination of public health measures and vaccination – not one or the other - is the only way out of the pandemic.

The cost will drop once domestic manufacturing of the vaccine begins. The vaccine will be made available at 35 centres from next week as part of the pilot test in India.Edit: Tardy vax driveAt the launch today, Dr Reddy’s said, “The first consignment of Sputnik V vaccine that landed in India on May 1 received regulatory clearance from the Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli, on May 13.”On May 1, 1.5 lakh doses of Sputniv V had arrived in India. Dr Reddy’s said further consignments were expected over the coming months and subsequently the supply of the vaccine will commence from Indian manufacturing partners as well.“The imported doses of the vaccine are currently priced at Rs 948 plus 5 per cent GST per dose with the possibility of a lower price point when local supply begins. The company is working closely with its six manufacturing partners in India to fulfill regulatory requirements to ensure smooth and timely supply,” Dr Reddy’s said, promising to work with the government and the private sector to ensure the widest possible reach of Sputnik V as part of the national inoculation effort.GV Prasad, co-chairman and managing director of Dr Reddy’s, said: “With the rising cases in India, vaccination is our most effective tool in the battle against Covid-19.

It will be sent to her hometown in Kerala from Delhi on Saturday itself.“The mortal remains of Ms Soumya Santhosh, who was killed in rocket attacks from Gaza, are being repatriated today from Israel to Kerala through Delhi. They will reach her native place tomorrow,” Muraleedharan said in a tweet.“I will personally be receiving the remains in Delhi. May her soul rest in peace,” he further said.Soumya, who hailed from Kerala’s Idukki district, worked as a caregiver attending to an old woman at a house in the southern Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon.She was talking to her husband Santhosh over a video call in the evening on Monday when a rocket fired from Gaza directly hit the house where she was working.The Indian caregiver was living and working in Israel for the last seven years. She has a nine-year-old son whom she had left with her husband in Kerala.Her 80-year-old elderly charge survived the direct hit on the house and was hospitalised.The rocket shelter was at least a minute’s run away from the woman’s home and the pair could not manage to reach it in time.The home lacked a fortified room of its own.Some media reports said that a technical glitch with an Iron Dome battery (an all-weather air defence system that intercepts and destroys short range rockets) during the massive rocket barrage towards the Israeli coastal city prevented some rockets from being intercepted and may have been responsible for the casualties and deaths.Ashkelon’s Mayor Tomer Glam said that some 25 per cent of the residents do not have access to a protected area when rockets are fired at the city.“It is impossible when normal life becomes a state of emergency within minutes,” Glam told Army Radio.“There are houses from the 1960s where there is no basic protection.

Mechanised country boats and speed boats have been deployed and patrolling has been stepped up in the river, particularly at Manikchak,” a senior official of Malda district is reported to have said, adding that local fishermen and boatmen have also been sensitised to inform the police and local authorities if they spot any corpse floating in the river.Local administration fished at least 70 bodies out of Ganga in Bihar’s Buxar district on Tuesday. Later, another 12 corpses were spotted in the same river upstream in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district, triggering probes in both states and speculation that the bodies belonged to Covid patients. More dead bodies have been found buried in the sand in Unnao.Authorities at the Farrakka Barrage, which lies around 22 km downstream from the spot where the river enters Bengal, have also been alerted, the officials informed.The Adityanath government in UP has issued a directive to the local authorities in the districts falling along the course of the Ganga river, asking them to impose fine on those who “try or actually” throw dead bodies in the river.“Teams of SDRF and PAC’s water Police have been deployed along the Ganges and other rivers of the state to conduct patrolling to ensure that dead bodies are not abandoned and thrown there,” said a spokesperson of the UP government.Directives have also been issued to district administrations to fix the cost of funerals (according to religious belief) and if bodies are found unclaimed then the administration should perform their “respectful disposal”, the spokesperson said.  Following the directive, Ghazipur District Magistrate MP Singh said, “We have capped the price of firewood at Rs 650/quintal and ‘dom raja’ would not take more than Rs 500 for cremating a body. We are setting up a control room at each crematorium, where police personnel and Lekhpal would be stationed.” He further said, if any person is unable to bear expenses of cremation and goes to any crematorium, “we will provide them with Rs 5000 immediately and bear all expenses of cremation”.In Bihar too similar directives have been issued by the state government, as DM of Buxar Aman Samir said, “As a preventive measure we have put a ‘mahajal (massive fishing net)’ across the river at the point where it enters Bihar to stop bodies from UP coming to our side. Proper lighting arrangements have been made on all the cremation ghats in the district, as police and other block-level officials have been deployed to ensure locals do not resort to burying dead bodies in the water. The cost of cremation has also been rationalised now.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dead-bodies-in-ganga-states-along-river-course-on-alert-to-avoid-repeat-of-such-incident-252857
15-05-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Richa Chadha calls DD journalist Ashok Shrivastav, BJP’s Kapil Mishra sexist after row over ad||Bollywood actor Richa Chadha called out Indian public broadcaster Doordharshan’s senior consulting editor Ashok Shrivastava and Bharatiya Janata Party’s ever-controversial leader Kapil Mishra for tweets that have criticised as being misogynistic.Shrivastava, a senior journalist, said in a since-deleted tweet in Hindi: “This is a good initiative @findabed_in, but maybe you should have chosen better brand ambassadors. Or, if nothing else, better photos”.To which, Chadha replied: “Shocked to find that such a misogynistic and evil person has been hired by the Doordarshan, India’s national public service broadcaster. At a time when everyone is doing literally all they can to help, he simply cannot help but out himself as a pervert”.Besides Chadha, the campaign also features actors Swara Bhaskar and Sunny Leone.   Mishra waded into this row by defending Shrivastava’s tweet and accusing the women of what he termed “cheap sexuality”.“Ashokji asked a question out of his duty as a journalist. An advertisement about hospital beds and deaths caused COVID-19 should be compassionate. This is an attempt to sell cheap sexuality,” he tweeted.To this, Chadha replied that BJP leader Suresh Prabhu, a former union minister, had also endorsed the campaign.“Perhaps you should ask that question to @iimunofficial who made the ad. Your colleague and minister @sureshpprabhu also endorsed the initiative,” she said.The find a bed initiative has been launched by India's International Movement to Unite Nations, a youth organisation that has its headquarters in Mumbai. Besides the three women and the minister, actors Vishal Singh, Sunny and Ranvijay Singh, and chef Ranveer Brar, have also lent their faces to the campaign. Shocked to find that such a misogynistic and evil person has been hired by the Doordarshan, India’s national public service broadcaster.

15-05-2021||Melbourne||Many Australians with COVID-19 to be left in India after testing positive before repatriation flight||Several Australians in India who were scheduled to return home by a repatriation flight initiated by the Australian government were grounded on Friday because either they were infected with COVID-19 or were considered a close contact of someone who was positive, a top Australian diplomat said.The repatriation flights facilitated by the Australian government for its stranded citizens in India resumed from Friday following a two weeks ban due to Covid health crisis in India.“Many passengers on the first flight on Friday were grounded due to COVID-19 positive test results,” Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O'Farrell was quoted as saying by the ABC News.About half of the 150 seats on the flight set to leave New Delhi on Friday night will be left empty after more than 40 people tested positive to the virus, meaning they and their close contacts — a total of about 70 people — cannot fly, the report said.O'Farrell said people who were signed to go on the flight were all put up in hotels, paid for by the state-run Qantas Airways, so that they could do the first round of pre-flight testing, and that the results of the second round had not come back yet.The high commissioner said all passengers were made aware of the increased testing rules required to fly back to Australia."Obviously, I'm disappointed, as are those Australians who will not be on today's flight," he said."My team has worked hard across India to get them bookings on this flight because they are vulnerable.O'Farrell said anyone who had tested positive would still be considered vulnerable and be given priority on future flights."Regrettably those people will have to return home and deal with the COVID that they have, or continue to isolate to prove that they don't have Covid," he said adding, until such time that they test negative they won't be able to fly on one of these facilitated flights." There are about 10,000 Australians, permanent residents seeking to return home from India.Almost 1,000 of those are considered vulnerable who have been given priority to board the repatriation flights.Australian foreign minister Marise Payne said the passengers would have to undergo a strict quarantine to make sure they are not carrying the variant of the coronavirus first identified in India.“These passengers will quarantine at the Centre for National Resilience at Howard Springs in the Northern Territory,” she said.The repatriation flight on Friday was the first flight after the Australian government imposed a temporary ban recently with a threat of criminal sanctions, including five years in jail and fines of up to 66,000 Australian dollars for people who try to return from India.Payne said this temporary pause had helped mitigate the risk of potentially higher rates of infection presenting on arrival in Australia and ensured the quarantine system was able to receive further flights.Friday's Australian flight brings the total number of government facilitated commercial flights from India to 39 – returning over 6,400 Australians since March 2020.Australia has delivered over 15 tonnes of medical supplies to India, including over 2,000 ventilators and more than 100 oxygen concentrators.Greg Hunt, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, said the Australian Government stood ready to offer further emergency medical supplies if requested by the Indian Government.“The Australian Government is committed to doing all it can to support the Indian Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Hunt said.Payne also praised the response of Australian businesses and everyday Australians and welcomed the support offered from state and territory governments.The Victorian Government has committed 1,000 ventilators, the Queensland Government has donated 2 million Australian dollars in relief funds to the Australian Red Cross and Western Australia has also donated 2 million Australian dollars in relief funds.Australia is also in close consultation with the New South Wales and South Australian governments on their proposed support to India to combat the pandemic.With 3,43,144 people testing positive for coronavirus in a day, India's COVID-19 tally of cases climbed to 2,40,46,809, while the death toll rose to 2,62,317 with 4,000 daily fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/many-australians-with-covid-19-to-be-left-in-india-after-testing-positive-before-repatriation-flight-252796

15-05-2021||New Delhi||Centre says it will provide assistance to all companies willing to manufacture vaccines||Amid a political war of words between the Centre and the Delhi government over the availability of sufficient vaccines to inoculate all adults in the national capital, the central government on Thursday said it will provide all possible assistance to all companies willing to manufacture the vaccine to ramp up the supply.It, however, flagged the non-availability of a sophisticated laboratory with most vaccine makers that is necessary to produce the indigenously developed Covaxin jab.The Centre also rejected Delhi government's claim that Covaxin maker Bharat Biotech has refused to provide "additional" vaccine doses to the Delhi government, saying the national capital has received over 15 lakh doses of the vaccine and its role is to facilitate the states.On Tuesday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had alleged the Covaxin manufacturer in a letter said it cannot provide the Delhi government vaccines due to unavailability, under instruction of government officials concerned."It means that the central government is controlling supply of the vaccine," Sisodia, who is a senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, had said.Addressing a briefing of the Union Health Ministry, Niti Aayog Member (Health), V K Paul said Government of India's role is to facilitate."We refute (the charge) that there is any pressure on anybody not to supply to any particular state," he said, adding that such charges affect the morale of vaccine manufacturers."It is because of them that we are in the position of not asking others (countries for vaccines)," Paul said.He said Bharat Biotech is also ramping up its capacity and has already roped in three public sector undertakings.Earlier, Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying the Centre should share the vaccine formula of Covaxin and Covishield with other capable pharmaceutical companies to scale up production in the country.On increasing production of Covaxin, Paul said Bharat Biotech has already welcomed the move of ramping up production of doses by involving other players."They also reached out and under this initiative, our PSUs have been connected to this process," he said.Last month, the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), under Mission COVID Suraksha, spelt out a plan to ramp up production of Covaxin and double it by May-June by roping in three public sector companies (PSUs).The PSUs are Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Mumbai, a PSU under the Maharashtra government; Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), Hyderabad, a facility under National Dairy Development Board; and Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Limited, Bulandshahr, a PSU of the Department of Biotechnology, to increase the capacity of vaccine production."The current production capacity of indigenously developed Covaxin will be doubled by May-June 2021 and then increased nearly 6-7 fold by July-August 2021, i.e. increasing the production from 1 crore vaccine doses in April 2021 to 6-7 crore vaccine dose/month in July–August. It is expected to reach nearly 10 crore doses per month by September 2021," the DBT had said.Reacting to this, Kejriwal on Thursday tweeted, "A very welcome step by central government. It will help in ramping up production."     "I also urge the Centre to directly procure vaccines from foreign companies rather than each state bidding against each other in international market," he tweeted.Giving details about Covaxin, Paul said that it is made by inactivating a live virus."This happens only in the BSL3 (Biosafety Laboratory-3) laboratory which is very sophisticated. Such laboratories are mostly not there in other companies. It is not something that every company has. Those companies who want to do this, we give an open invitation and we have already reached out from our side to make it together," he said."Still our request is, those who want to make this vaccine, the government will provide full assistance to ramp up the capacity," Paul said.During the briefing, Paul said that 75,000 Covaxin doses have been given to Delhi in May."In January-May, 13,91,000 Covaxin doses were received by Delhi. The state has procured 1 lakh doses, while private (institutions) have got 20,000 doses," he said.According to the vaccine bulletin issued by the Delhi government, the Centre has provided 13,91,000 doses of vaccine to the Delhi government and it has procured 1,50,000 doses from Bharat Biotech. So far, it has received 43,20,490 doses of Covishield and Covaxin. Following the allegations levelled by the Delhi government, Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry Lav Agarwal had denied that the Centre had any role to play in the purchase of vaccines by states.Bharat Biotech on Wednesday had said it is quite disheartening to listen to some states complaining about the company's intentions regarding supply of Covaxin.
