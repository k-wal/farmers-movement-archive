For this they are required to register on the NBE portal.On September 16, 2020, NBE announced that NEET was to be held January 10, 2021. Following this DGAFMS issued a letter on October 23, 2020, for selection of armed forces doctors for post-graduation, with directions that their application should reach it by November 30, 2020. On October 31, 2020, the NBE indefinitely postponed the NEET. The NBE also extended the date for online registration.“The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Indian Medical Commission and the National Board of Examination were reasonable and sensitive enough to repeatedly postpone not only the date of NEET exam but also the date for online registration due to the unprecedented situation, but DGAFMS struck to its original date unseasonably,” Col Indra Singh Sen (retd), counsel for some of the petitioners, said. “More so, another officer whose case for rejected on account of delay was later permitted,” he added.“The cut-off date of November 30, 2020, was relevant only when the NEET exam was to be held in January 2021. After it got postponed to September 2021, it was absolutely unreasonable and arbitrary to stick to the original cut-off date. Moreover, DGAFMS released its selection list only in April 2021,” Col Sen said.“We find the attitude of the respondents in dealing with the matter is not acceptable and is contrary to the law governing the principles of natural justice at this period of pandemic,” the Tribunal’s Bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz had observed in its interim order on December 1 while permitting the petitioners to participate in the counseling subject to the Tribunal’s final decision.When the case came up for hearing today, the Tribunal was informed that based on the aforementioned orders and observations, the competent authority had re-considered the entire issue and for the present, as a matter of principle, has decided that not only the applicants before the Tribunal, but also other similarly situated employees would be permitted to participate in the counseling.Four Army doctors, including two women, had moved the Tribunal over the issue. According to informed sources, about 20 similarly placed officers could be are affected by the Tribunal’s orders. Extension in registration date had been permitted for civilian candidates by the agencies concerned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/relief-for-armed-forces-doctors-as-aft-allows-them-to-attend-neet-counselling-for-pg-courses-345938

03-12-2021||Kolkata||Congress in 'deep freezer', Opposition forces want Mamata to lead: TMC fires fresh salvo at grand old party||Amid the ongoing war of words between the TMC and the Congress, the ruling camp in West Bengal on Friday launched a fresh attack on the Grand Old Party, stating that it has gone into a “deep freezer” with Opposition forces now looking up to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to fill the vacuum.The Congress leadership, which declined to attach much importance to the assertions of the TMC leaders, said it is “too early to predict” who would emerge as an alternative face.The TMC, which had been inducting disgruntled Congress leaders in its fold, iterated in its mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’ that it was committed to fight the BJP.Referring to Prashant Kishor’s latest tweet against the Congress, the article said it’s not just the poll strategist but also Congress leaders themselves who are criticising the party leadership.“The TMC has been saying this for a long time that the Congress is a spent force. They don’t have the zeal to fight the BJP. The party is so bogged down by infighting that it hardly has time or energy to build an opposition. The UPA does not exist,” the article titled ‘Congress in deep freezer’ said.“The country currently needs an alternative front and opposition parties have given that responsibility to Mamata Banerjee. They are looking up to her to fill the vacuum. She is presently the most popular opposition face in the country,” it said.Kishor, on Thursday, took to Twitter and said that Congress’ leadership is not the “divine right” of an individual, especially when the party has “lost more than 90% elections in last 10 years”, in an apparent dig at senior leader Rahul Gandhi.Banerjee during her recent visit to Mumbai had said that “UPA doesn’t exist”.Veteran Congress leader and MP Pradip Bhattacharya said it is for the opposition front allies to unanimously decide who will be their Leader.“It seems the TMC is more interested in fighting the Congress than the BJP. The Congress doesn’t need to assert its leadership as the party with a greater share of seats is the natural leader. The TMC, which is a regional party, has now entered into a tacit understanding with the BJP to undermine the Congress,” he said.Bhattacharya pointed out the history has shown that when a political alliance is formed, the partners have taken the decision unanimously on who will lead the alliance.In response, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said his party never spoke of an alliance without the Congress.“We have never said that we want an opposition front without the Congress. But at the same time it is true that Congress has failed to lead the opposition front in the last seven years,” he said.State BJP president Sukanta Majumdar mocked both the Congress and the TMC over their claims.“Look how these parties are fighting with each other. The people of this country want a strong leadership and would never vote for a chaotic alliance,” he said.The ruling camp of West Bengal, which is trying to expand its footprint nationally, has been up in arms against the grand old party over its alleged failure to counter the BJP.In a massive jolt to the opposition Congress in Meghalaya, 12 of its 17 MLAs, led by former chief minister Mukul Sangma, joined the TMC last week.The TMC, in its bid to enter Tripura’s political arena in a big way, recently engaged in a bitter battle with the BJP during the municipal elections there. It is also gearing up to contest the assembly elections in Goa to pitch Banerjee firmly as the foremost anti-BJP opposition voice.Earlier, the TMC, in its mouthpiece, had termed the Congress as an “incapable and incompetent” party, and maintained that the Mamata Banerjee-led camp cannot be blamed for Congress leaders jumping ship.The ties between the Congress and the TMC got further strained after ‘Jago Bangla’ recently claimed that party supremo Mamata Banerjee, and not Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, has emerged as the face of the opposition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Two cases of the new variant were reported in Karnataka on Thursday.On the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19, the ministry said given its characteristics, it is likely to spread to more countries, including India, but given the fast pace of vaccination in India and high exposure to delta variant as evidenced by high seropositivity, the severity of the disease is anticipated to be low.Omicron cases are increasingly being reported from countries outside of South Africa and given its characteristics, it is likely to spread to more countries, including India, the ministry said.“However, the scale and magnitude of the rise in cases and the severity of the disease are still not clear, it said.“Further, given the fast pace of vaccination in India and high exposure to delta variant as evidenced by high seropositivity, the severity of the disease is anticipated to be low. However, scientific evidence is still evolving,” the ministry said.From the list of FAQs, the ministry, answering to whether the existing vaccines work against the Omicron variant, said: “While, there is no evidence to suggest that existing vaccines do not work on Omicron, some of the mutations reported on spike gene may decrease the efficacy of existing vaccines”.                  However, vaccine protection is also by antibodies as well as by cellular immunity, which is expected to be relatively better preserved. Hence, vaccines are expected to still offer protection against severe disease and vaccination is crucial. If eligible one should get vaccinated, it said.To a question on can the currently used diagnostics methods detect Omicron, it said the most accepted and commonly used method of diagnosis for SARS-CoV2 is the RT-PCR method.“This method detects specific genes in the virus, such as Spike (S), Enveloped (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) etc to confirm the presence of the virus. However, in the case of Omicron, as the S gene is heavily mutated, some of the primers may lead to results indicating the absence of the S gene (called S gene drop out).“This particular S gene drop out along with the detection of other viral genes could be used as a diagnostic feature of Omicron. However, for final confirmation of the omicron variant genomic sequencing is required,” the ministry explained.It further said the WHO declares a variant as VoC after assessment when there is an increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in Covid-19 epidemiology or increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation or decrease in the effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics.“Omicron has been declared VoC based on the observed mutations, their predicted features of increased transmission and immune evasion and preliminary evidence of detrimental change in Covid-19 epidemiology such as increased reinfections. The definitive evidence for increased remission and immune evasion is awaited,” the ministry said.It stressed that the precautions and steps to be taken remain the same as before.“It’s essential to mask yourself properly, take both doses of vaccines (if not yet vaccinated), maintain social distancing and maintain good ventilation to the maximum possible.”          The Indian government is monitoring the situation closely and is issuing suitable guidelines from time to time. The scientific and medical community is geared up for developing and deploying diagnostics, carrying out genomic surveillance, generating evidence about viral and epidemiologic characteristics, and development of therapeutics, it said.The ministry said variants are a normal part of evolution and as long as the virus can infect, replicate and transmit, they will continue to evolve.“Further, not all variants are dangerous and most often than not, we don’t notice them. Only when they are more infectious or can reinfect people they gain prominence. The most important step to avoid the generation of variants is to reduce the number of infections,” it said.The new variant reported from South Africa on November 24 was called B.1.1.529 or Omicron based on Greek alphabets. It has shown a very large number of mutations, especially more than 30 on the viral spike protein which is the key target of an immune response, the ministry said.Given the collection of mutations in Omicron, which earlier individually have been associated with increased infectivity and/or immune evasion, and the sudden rise in the number of positive cases in South Africa, the World Health Organization has declared Omicron a ‘variant of concern’, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-issues-faqs-on-omicron-says-no-evidence-to-suggest-existing-vaccines-dont-work-on-it-345924

You have filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court. You are a student; otherwise, we would have imposed a huge cost for this kind of writ petition.

Women officers have been appointed on board almost all major warships,” the newly-appointed Navy chief said.Separately, officials said 28 women officers have been deployed so far in 15 major warships and the number is going to go up soon as more such appointments are coming up.Admiral Kumar said the modalities for downstream training of women as cadet entry at the National Defence Academy are being worked out.“The Navy is fully prepared in all aspects to induct and absorb women across the wide spectrum of roles and responsibilities,” the Navy Chief said.He also said that the induction of women officers into the information technology branch will commence from June next year.The officials cited above said women officers have been deployed on a number of stealth frigates, guided missiles destroyers and tankers.The Navy also plans to deploy women officers on board India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier Vikrant when it is commissioned in August next year.The 40,000-tonne warship, built at a cost of around Rs 23,000 crore, has over 2,300 compartments designed for a crew of around 1,700 people, including specialised cabins to accommodate women officers.In September last year, the Navy announced deploying two women officers to operate flying missions from warships.The Navy celebrates December 4 as Navy Day to commemorate its daring attack on Karachi harbour and its decisive victory in the 1971 Indo-Pak war.“This year, however, is special as we complete 50 years of this landmark event and are celebrating it as ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh’,” Admiral Kumar said.

This is unacceptable. The farmer supplied 24 bags of onion from his farm to commission agent's shop. And he earned only Rs 13 from it"."How will he repay the production cost, which includes preparation of soil for cultivation, procurement of onion seed, fertiliser, and harvesting charges? If onion prices had skyrocketed, the Union Government would have imported the produce from other countries on a war footing. However, now that the prices have crashed, government will ignore the farmer's plight,” Shetti alleged.Kavade earned enough to pay the transportation cost of Rs 1,512 to the service provider or else would have ended up paying this amount from his own pocket, Shetti further said.Commissioner agent Rudresh Patil, who procured the onions from Kavade, said. "I did buy onions at such a low rate, but it is mainly because of the poor quality of the produce. The onion was wet and damaged due to unseasonal rains in the last few days, which is why it attracted such a low rate."  Patil said good quality onions are fetching robust prices in the market due and termed Kavade's case as "unfortunate and exceptional". Kavade could not be contacted for comments. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/onions-bring-tears-to-maha-farmer-who-earns-just-rs-13-after-selling-over-1-1-ton-345914

India wants to ensure that the aid reaches the intended beneficiaries without being diverted and wants the distribution of the relief materials through a credible international agency.The FO statement said that the Indian government has been urged to take necessary steps to expeditiously undertake the delivery of the humanitarian assistance.It said that the decision demonstrates the commitment and seriousness of the Government of Pakistan to facilitate the proposed humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.Experts have warned that, if the weather is as poor as predicted this winter, millions of people including children are likely to face acute hunger and widespread famine in war-torn Afghanistan, which is now ruled by the Taliban. The hardline Islamists seized power in Kabul in mid-August.According to UN figures from early November, almost 24 million people in Afghanistan, around 60 per cent of the population, suffer from acute hunger.That includes 8.7 million living in near-famine. Increasing numbers of malnourished children have filled hospital wards.India has contributed to the humanitarian requirements of the Afghan people. This included providing more than 1 million metric tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan over the past decade.Last year too India assisted Afghanistan with 75,000 metric tonnes of wheat, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said at the United Nations High-Level Meeting on the Humanitarian situation in Afghanistan in September.However, Pakistan had blocked India’s efforts to provide wheat to the Afghan people, amidst the chill in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad over the Kashmir issue. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-agrees-to-let-india-transport-wheat-life-saving-drugs-to-afghanistan-on-afghan-trucks-foreign-office-345901
03-12-2021||Patna||BJP MLA alleges Nitish used ‘objectionable’ language to reprimand her||A BJP MLA in Bihar on Friday accused Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of having used objectionable language at a meeting of legislators of the ruling NDA held earlier this week.Nikki Hembrom, who represents Katoria assembly segment, and is the national secretary of BJP ST Morcha, said she was rebuked when she raised the issue of tribals getting adversely affected by the prohibition law.“I belong to the Scheduled Tribes and represent a constituency where people have traditionally been involved in brewing Mahua, which has now been outlawed under the prohibition law,” she told reporters.“It was my duty to raise the issue of their plight at the NDA legislators’ meeting on Monday. I was shocked by the way the CM spoke. I do not wish to repeat the words he used. I would, instead, prefer the issue raised by me at the meeting to be squarely addressed,” said Hembrom.The MLA also disclosed that she lodged a complaint “at the party forum and it is now for my party to take a call on the matter”.However, minister Lesi Singh, who belongs to the chief minister’s JD(U), said it was a “misunderstanding” and Kumar was just addressing Hembrom “like a guardian”.“I was present at the meeting. Words can be taken out of context and assigned a meaning different from the one intended,” she said.“What the chief minister intended to explain to the MLA was that he has always been sensitive to the needs and aspirations of women, at whose instance he had taken the decision to ban alcohol,” she added.Sale and consumption of alcohol was completely banned in Bihar in April 2016. The prohibition law, however, has come back to haunt the state government in the wake of recent hooch tragedies that claimed more than 40 lives in four north Bihar districts. A meeting chaired by the chief minister to review implementation of prohibition came out with warnings to police against laxity.The police have since gone in an overdrive, conducting searches at wedding parties and rounding up visitors from other states not aware of the prohibition law, triggering an outcry.The NDA legislators’ meeting, which was held on the inaugural day of the winter session, saw the CM making all the members take a pledge that they will not consume alcohol and dissuade others from doing so.A similar oath was taken by elected representatives and government officials across the state last week.However, the government was left with egg on its face when a number of empty liquor bottles were found inside the legislature premises on Tuesday. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-mla-alleges-nitish-used-objectionable-language-to-reprimand-her-345898
03-12-2021||New Delhi||Decision on booster dose, jabs for kids to be taken based on expert advice: Mandaviya||A decision on booster dose and Covid jabs for children will be taken on the basis of scientific guidance from experts, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Friday, even as the country stepped up surveillance for Omicron variant of the coronavirus.Also read: Consider booster dose for 40 and above, say India’s top genome scientistsReplying to an 11-hour-long debate on the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lok Sabha, Mandaviya said RT-PCR tests have been conducted on 16,000 passengers from “at-risk” countries, of whom 18 have tested positive for COVID-19.The minister said the swab samples of these 18 passengers have been sent for genome sequencing to screen for the Omicron variant of the virus.During the debate on Thursday, several members had flagged the issue of booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines and had expressed concern over the new variant of the virus, two cases of which were detected in the country.Mandaviya hit out at the opposition for making a political issue on the availability of ventilators, which were funded through the PM-CARES Fund, and hailed the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the testing times.He said orders were placed for the supply of 58,000 ventilators, mostly with public sector companies, and 50,200 breathing machines had been delivered to states and 48,000 have been installed at various hospitals.Besides ventilators, the government also ensured availability of Covid protocol medicines across the country to ensure that the states did not appear wanting in the fight against the pandemic.Mandaviya also slammed the opposition parties for creating doubts about homegrown vaccines which affected the vaccination drive.“Opposition-ruled states promised support during meetings with the prime minister, but went back on their words and tried to weaken the nation’s fight against COVID-19,” the minister said.To questions on the vaccination drive, the minister said the government was committed to fully vaccinate all the eligible beneficiaries. He said 85 per cent of the beneficiaries have received the first dose, while 50 per cent have been fully vaccinated.He dared Lok Sabha members to ensure 100 per cent vaccination in their respective constituencies to speed up the inoculation drive.“Twenty-two crore vaccine doses are already available with the states and the Centre will make available an additional 10 crore this month,” Mandaviya said, and added that the government had started ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ (knock on every door) campaign to speed up vaccination.Mandaviya said the Modi government had embarked on strengthening the health infrastructure across the country without blaming previous governments who had ignored the sector.“Government worked for results. In last two years, decisions under leadership of Prime Minister Modi show that this government works not with power, but with will power,” the minister said.

03-12-2021||New Delhi||Consider booster dose for 40 and above, say India’s top genome scientists||Amid demands for a booster vaccine dose against COVID-19, India’s top genome scientists have said that a booster dose “may be considered” for people above 40 years.“Vaccination of all remaining unvaccinated at-risk people and consideration of a booster dose for those 40 years of age and over, first targeting the most high-risk/high-exposure may be considered,” the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Sequencing Consortium (INSACOG) said in its weekly bulletin dated November 29.The INSACOG is a network of national testing labs set up by the government to monitor genomic variations of COVID-19.The recommendation came amid demands for a booster dose of Covid vaccines by lawmakers during a discussion in the Lok Sabha on the pandemic situation in the country.The INSACOG said genomic surveillance will be critical for early detection of the presence of this variant, to enable necessary public health measures.It also recommended monitoring travel to and from the known affected areas, and contact tracing of COVID-19 cases with an epidemiological link to the affected areas, that has been implemented along with increased testing.“Vaccination of all remaining unvaccinated at-risk people and consideration of a booster dose for those 40 years of age and over, first targeting the most high-risk / high-exposure may be considered, since low levels of neutralising antibodies from current vaccines are unlikely to be sufficient to neutralise Omicron, although risk of severe disease is still likely to be reduced,” the INSACOG bulletin said.It noted that genomic surveillance will be critical for early detection of the presence of this variant, to enable necessary public health measures.Monitoring travel to and from the known affected areas, and contact tracing of COVID-19 cases with an epidemiological link to the affected areas has been implemented along with increased testing – with sequencing of confirmed cases and possible SGTF based rapid screening, the INSACOG bulletin said.As of now, the US and Britain have recommended booster doses of vaccines for all adults, six months after the second dose.NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul had said despite new challenge of Omicron variant, vaccination remained the most critical tool against COVID-19.“We are fortunate that we have the tool (vaccination) in plenty and there is no doubt that coverage of vaccines has to increase. Look at the big picture, we have this tool and we must protect every eligible individual with this tool,” Paul had said on Thursday.“We are benefited by two doses and people should get the second dose as soon as possible. The decision on duration between doses is based on scientific data and local data in a systematic manner, and there is no change in the present duration,” Paul had said.

03-12-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws: Punjab government has compensated kin of 403 deceased farmers, so why cannot the PM: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday called the government “inhuman, insensitive and arrogant” for stating in Parliament that it had no record of farmers who died during the yearlong farm agitation and sought immediate compensation for the families of the 700 deceased.Noting that the details of deceased farmers were in the public domain and could be accessed by the PM, Rahul said the Congress-ruled Punjab government had provided Rs five lakh each to the kin of 403 deceased farmers and assured jobs to the family members of 152 with plans to expand the job coverage. “Frankly it is not our mistake that caused the death of 700 farmers. It is the PM’s mistake. The prime minister apologised. He said he made a mistake and because of that mistake, 700 farmers died. Why doesn’t the PM have the decency and the dignity to help their families?” Gandhi asked in a press conference adding that he would place the details of 700 deceased farmers on the table of Lok Sabha on Monday.Gandhi questioned the government for treating the deceased farmers and earlier people who died of Covid as nonexistent and said, “This is not the way a prime minister should behave. This is an unpleasant, immoral, and cowardly way to behave.”Gandhi expressed surprise that the government doesn’t want to accept people have died.“You did the same during Covid. You didn’t report deaths as Covid deaths. In Gujarat, you said some 10,000 people died of Covid. We sent our workers to every home and found there were lakhs who died,” said the former Congress chief.He said the arrogance of power was keeping the government from heeding to the suffering families of farmers.“You are so arrogant, you think you are in power and don’t need to listen to anyone. PM is thinking only about his image…The Punjab government is not responsible for the deaths of farmers but we have given support to their families but that’s not enough. The government should also compensate,” Gandhi added.He was speaking with reference to an answer by the agriculture ministry in Parliament.When asked whether the government planned to compensate the families of deceased farmers, the ministry said, “No record is available on the matter so the question does not arise.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-compensate-families-of-the-farmers-who-died-says-rahul-gandhi-345885

Protesters meanwhile said they were well within their right to protest, calling their agitation peaceful although chants of “Jai Shri Ram” rent the air.“Jai Shri Ram” is a Hindu holy chant that critics see increasingly as an intimidation tactic.A senior policeman claimed on the condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to speak that the group of protesters was led by a habitual troublemaker who has been detained before for similar actions.Police claimed there were even attempts to stop the weekly “jumma prayers” after several people parked their trucks and buses at the designated namaz site claiming there were “parking issues”.Namaz disruptions in Gurugram have become a weekly event, with protests leading the administration to even cancel explicit permission given for such public prayers in some sites. Protests have mostly been led by fringe Hindu organisations who have claimed public disruption of peace if Friday prayers were allowed in public places. Critics however have called these disruptions an attempt to demonise Muslims and fear the shrinkage of public spaces for Muslims as a consequence of such actions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/right-wingers-lead-namaz-disruption-in-gurugrams-sector-37-20-detained-345881

After seeing a noticeable dip from 26 cadets being boarded out in 2016 to 13 in 2017, the figure rose to 19 in 2018 and to 21 in 2019, the ministry’s data revealed.Of the 112 cadets boarded out for medical reasons from 2016 to 2020, the injuries sustained by 66 cadets were attributable to military service, while the injuries of 36 others were not attributable to military service.An analysis of the data showed that the quantum of disability of 52 cadets was assessed at 20 per cent and of 29 cadets at 30 per cent. The disability of 12 cadets was assessed at 50 per cent or more, while three cadets were assessed with 100 per cent disability.Government policy entitles ex-gratia disability award of Rs 16,200 plus dearness relief per month for 100 per cent disability, which is reduced proportionately. No disability award is payable in cases where the degree of disablement is less than 20 per cent.For 100 per cent disability, a constant attendance allowance of Rs 6,750 is also admissible. In addition, the Army Group Insurance Fund provides disability and ex-gratia benefits to cadets boarded out with disability. They are also entitled medical treatment at military hospitals.A Committee of Experts constituted by the then defence minister, Manohar Parrikar, in 2015 had recommended that cadets disabled with an attributable/aggravated disability due to military training and boarded out of defence academies should be granted disability pension.The cadets undergoing training do not get pay and allowances (salary) but are given a monthly stipend and hence the committee’s recommendations were not accepted by the government as the Sixth and Seventh Pay Commissions did not recommend the same due to technical requirements such as amendment of the Recruitment Rules and Pension Rules.Service Headquarters have again forwarded a fresh proposal for grant of disability pension to cadets medically boarded out from training on account of disability attributable to or aggravated by military training. It is under consideration at the Ministry of Defence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/number-of-cadets-boarded-out-from-military-academies-on-medical-grounds-sees-consistent-increase-over-past-4-years-345871

The Command is expected to unify and integrate assets of the Navy, Indian Air Force and Army and also the Coast Guard.Admiral Kumar said Navy is wholehearted in its support for reforms and enhancing tri-service synergy. “Joining and integration cannot happen in a short time. The thrust for joining is a complicated process, we have done a study. We are in the third stage of war-gaming. We are looking at lean command structure for the theatre commander and charter will be operational.”  On China, the Admiral said, “The ongoing situation on northern borders has added to security challenges. We were forward deployed during the crisis along the Line of Actual Control and we were ready if an escalation had come about. We are looking at a free, open and rules-based approach to regional security.”On the Indo-Pacific, he said, “We have some 200 billion dollars of trade passing through these waters. Our planning is not against any country; our planning is for our own maritime capability.”On new assets, he said, sea-going aircraft carrier Vikrant had completed two sorties of trials. The work of the Cochin Shipyard Limited is a shining example as it has 76 per cent indigenous content, he added.On having one more carrier after Vikrant, the Admiral said the carrier brings in a different capability.On the future size of the Navy, he said threat is being assessed and that would decide the number of ships the navy would have.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/confident-of-dealing-with-any-threat-in-indias-maritime-domain-navy-chief-345863

Forty such squads would monitor the implementation of measures suggested by it to deal with pollution, the panel said.Seventeen such flying squads have been constituted to ensure the implementation of various measures mandated by the court and the panel. The number would be raised to 40 within 24 hours, the affidavit said. Ban on entry of trucks, excluding those carrying essential goods and those running on cleaner fuel, would continue, it said.Taking a note of the measures, the bench ordered, "We have perused affidavit by the Centre and the Delhi government. We have taken into consideration the directions proposed. We direct the Centre and the government of National Capital Territory to implement the orders of December 2 and we keep the matter pending and will hear it on next Friday.”At the outset, the bench referred to certain news reports and said a message "intentionally or unintentionally" has been sent that the court is the "villain" and it is ordering the closure of schools."One thing which we observed is whether intentional or unintentional and some sections of media portrays us that we are the villains who want to close down the schools. You (Delhi government) on your own opened the schools. But, see the newspapers..," the chief justice said.Senior advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, referred to a news report and said that one English newspaper reported that the apex court threatened to take over the administration."You (Delhi government) can condemn all of this but where do we go? Where did we say that we will take up an administrative role...We cannot interfere with the freedom of speech and expression and a political party can hold a press conference but we cannot do so," the bench said.

He tested positive and has been shifted to the local medical college where he has been quarantined. His sample will undergo genome sequencing and we have a facility here for this purpose. However, it will also be sent to a lab in Bengaluru and only after that result would we come to know if he is infected with Omicron," he said."He is only Covid positive as of now," the minister added.Without divulging much details about the second case, he said the child along with its family had been admitted to the King's Institute here where the relevant tests are being conducted.Refuting social media claims that both the cases were Omicron variants, Subramanian said "we will be transparent in announcing the results" as it would only help in creating more public awareness against the pandemic and urged social media users to be careful about opining on the "sensitive issue".The co-passengers seated in the front and rear rows of the flights in which these two travelled and the flight crew had also been tested, he said.India's first Covid Omicron cases were detected on Thursday, when two fliers from South Africa to Bengaluru tested positive for the new variant. Various restrictions and measures at the airports, such as stringent surveillance and testing measures have been put in place by various state governments.

03-12-2021||Mumbai||Vigilance, genome sequencing, border surveillance and vaccination key things against Omicron: Expert||A member of the Maharashtra government's Covid task force has said that vigilance, genome sequencing, improving border surveillance and vaccination are some of the things that are necessary to tackle the new Omicron variant of coronavirus.The task force member, Dr Vasant Nagvekar, who is a consultant on infectious diseases at a city-based hospital, said in a statement on Thursday that although there is no need to panic, the Omicron variant is definitely a cause of concern."What we need is vigilance. This variant has accumulated 50 mutations and has caused a lot of concern. It could be more transmissible, and it could also be immune-evasive. But so far, there is no proof that it produces more severe infections. The early data from South Africa shows most patients are younger and the variant produces milder infections," he said.Dr Nagvekar said that for now the variant appears to be stable, with high transmissibility, but low virulence, which perhaps explains the lack of surge in hospitalisations and deaths where it was earlier reported."We need vigilance, improvement in border surveillance, genomic sequencing and vaccination cover," he said, urging people to keep wearing masks."Scientific data have proved that masks can reduce Covid transmission by 53 per cent...A booster dose of vaccine, even if it works, is just a temporary fix. We can't keep on taking boosters every six months and for every variant of concern that emerges. Masking is the need of the hour and there is no alternative for vaccination," he said.Apart from the restrictions, strict contact tracing, isolation and quarantine of close contacts are some very important things, he said.The Omicron strain, first detected in South Africa, has been classified as a 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organisation.

03-12-2021||Washington||Amid Covid challenges, historic milestones set in India-US ties: Ambassador Sandhu||Despite the challenges posed by Covid, there have been some historic milestones in the India-US relationship, New Delhi's top envoy here said."Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, there have been some historic milestones. We saw Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's landmark visit to the US in September for the in-person leader-level Summit with President (Joe) Biden, and the first in-person Quad Summit," Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in his address to the 5th edition of the India-US Forum on Thursday.This was preceded by the first ever leader-level Quad Virtual Summit, in March. The joint statements issued, after each of these summits, captured the depth and breadth of this bilateral engagement, he said.In 2021, Sandhu said the US administration, Congress, industry, diaspora, and the American people at large came out to support India, when the Covid second wave hit India in the summer. President Biden spoke to Prime Minister Modi, underlining that the US stands shoulder to shoulder with India, and recalled how India supported the US when the surge happened in the US last year."The overwhelming support received by us, from all across the US is a testament to close bonds that we share. Just before the second wave hit India, India had supplied vaccines to more than 90 countries across the globe, and it was touching to see our friends, and partners such as the United States, reciprocate the warmth to India in equal measure, in the hour of need,” Sandhu said.Also, the pandemic did not stop the two countries from going ahead with intense engagement. Prime Minister Modi participated in several Summits, hosted by President Biden - the virtual Leaders' Summit on Climate, in April; virtual Covid Summit in September; Global Supply Chain Summit, on the sidelines of G-20, in October in Rome; Summit on Build Back Better for the World on the sidelines of COP26, in Glasgow in November, he said."There have been several ministerial-level engagements: the Secretary of State and the External Affairs Minister have met on a regular basis. The Secretary of Defence visited India in March, as part of his first overseas tour. The Finance Minister visited the US in October. The USTR was recently in Delhi for the Trade Policy Forum, and the visit was an opportunity for a broader conversation on the economic partnership.

The authorities in India act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights,” said the MEA in response to questions on the UN body’s statement. Pakistan had also spoken against the arrest, but the MEA had opted not to react.The MEA said the OHCHR statement “betrays a complete lack of understanding” of the security challenges from cross-border terrorism and its impact on the “Right to Life” of citizens in J&K. Referring to proscribed terrorist organisations as “armed groups” demonstrates a clear bias on the part of OHCHR, it added.Parvez has been in custody for over a week.“We are unaware of the factual basis of the charges. He is known as a tireless advocate for families of the disappeared and has been targeted before for his human rights work,” admitted OHCHR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-hits-out-at-un-body-for-remark-on-activists-arrest-345705

The board has now apologised for it and called it “inappropriate”. It also promised strict action against those responsible.Meanwhile, Shaktisinh Gohil, Congress MP from Gujarat, said, “You cannot duck reality. Modi ji was the CM of Gujarat during the disturbance (in 2002). He asked for votes in the name of Lord Rama, but failed to save Ramsevaks (followers of Rama).”“The riots that followed destroyed Gujarat and innocent persons were killed. Then too it was Modi ji who was the Gujarat CM – this is reality. I do not understand what’s the big deal if someone sets a question around the fact,” Gohil asked.Asaduddin Owaisi, AIMIM leader and Lok Sabha member from Hyderabad, said, “This is a factual question. The CM who oversaw the pogrom in 2002 is PM now. Where’s the error? Thousands lost their lives in Gujarat. No person of conscience should ever forget such acts of mass violence.

It now needs to be ascertained whether these are integrated and how institutions of national security have changed over the years.Tewari said, “It is surprising that 20 years after Kargil, Chinese similarly intruded across a broad swathe of the frontier. How was it undetected? In Parliament there has not been one substantial discussion.” Though the pre-launch publicity of the book was dominated by Tewari’s observation that the UPA government should have explored kinetic options against Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks, the author pointed out that this was his personal observation.Tewari was, however, unimpressed by the government’s surgical strikes. Such strikes had been going on for a long time, but this was the first time the government took ownership for such a military action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shivshankar-menon-backs-tewaris-plea-on-intelligence-agencies-345702

Let opposition leadership be decided democratically,” Kishor tweeted, voicing the discomfort among parties like the NCP and TMC over acceptance of Rahul as the non-NDA block’s leader.The matter of UPA chairpersonship has also been debated for some time with some opposition leaders privately calling for NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s elevation in the wake of Congress president Sonia Gandhi flailing health.The Congress, however, maintained again today that it remained the principal opposition party nationally being in direct fight with the BJP in most states and that no anti-BJP alliance could succeed without it.Reacting to Kishor, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said, “The individual (read Rahul Gandhi) being discussed is pursuing his divine duty to struggle and save Indian democracy from the RSS. A professional without ideological commitment is free to advise parties and individuals on how to contest elections, but he cannot set the agenda of our politics.”The TMC, meanwhile, continued to aggressively posture as an opposition block parallel to the Congress with its parliamentary leaders skipping meetings hosted by Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha for evolving joint floor strategy in the wake of the suspension of 12 MPs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-leadership-not-right-of-one-individual-prashant-kishor-targets-rahul-gandhi-345695

We can’t infuse creativity in your bureaucracy. You’ve to come up with some steps. Bench“We are giving you 24 hours’ time. We want you to take a hard look at this and come up with a solution with seriousness…We will take this up tomorrow morning for 30 minutes. You update us about the steps, otherwise we will pass directions,” a Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.“In an emergency situation, you have to work in emergent ways. Suppose the temperature goes up in fever, then what can be done to control it?” the CJI said, hinting at setting up a task force if the government failed to come up with concrete measures. “Please let me respond tomorrow and let me speak with the minister. We are not averse to this and highest functionaries are equally worried,” Mehta said.“You cannot fire bullets from our shoulders, you have to take steps. We can’t infuse creativity in your bureaucracy…You have to come up with some steps,” said the Bench, which has been very critical of the bureaucracy for its “inaction and lack of planning and imagination” to deal with the emergency air pollution.The top court pulled up the Delhi Government for reopening schools and exposing children to high levels of air pollution. “You have implemented work from home for adults. So, parents work from home and children have to go to school. What’s this?” the CJI asked. Soon after the court hearing, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai announced that physical classes in schools would remain suspended from Friday till further orders. On behalf of the Delhi Government, senior advocate AM Singhvi told the court that it was taking all necessary measures to check air pollution and more than 1,500 old polluting vehicles were impounded in November.Wondering as to what the Commission for Air Quality Management was doing, it said that even the sources of the pollution had not been identified properly.

03-12-2021||---||Two Omicron cases detected in Karnataka, one has left country||New Delhi, December 2This is a worrying sign for the health surveillance system of the country. Of the first two cases of Covid-19 Omicron variant reported today, both in Karnataka, one has left India and the other was discharged from hospital in three days.The Bengaluru’s municipal corporation admitted in a statement today that the 66- year-old South African national who arrived in India on November 20 with a negative report and later tested positive when screened at Karnataka International Airport left for Dubai on November 27.Before leaving, he got a private lab report that showed his status as “negative”, even after the government screening showed him “positive”.The Bengaluru MC said that as the foreigner exhibited no symptoms after testing positive at the airport, he was advised self-isolation at a local hotel. “On November 22, his samples were taken for genome sequencing. The patient went in for self-investigation at a private lab on November 23 and the report was negative. There were 24 primary and 240 secondary contacts, all tested negative when screened. The person checked out of the hotel on November 27 midnight and took a cab to the airport. He left for Dubai,” the MC said hours after the Union Health Ministry stated that positive persons were being tracked.About the second Omicron-positive person, a 46-year-old doctor with no travel history, the Bengaluru MC said he developed fever and body ache on November 21, underwent RT-PCR test on November 22 and was found positive.He was at home from November 22 to 24, got hospitalised on November 25 and got discharged on November 27. “Three primary and two secondary contacts of this person were found positive. All are in isolation,” the MC said, revealing loopholes in the system and the fact that both patients continue to be out of institutional quarantine.Although the Health Ministry’s new travel guidelines for foreign nationals from at-risk nations (South Africa is among them) came into force from December 1, Omicron was declared a Variant of Concern by the WHO on November 26. The Health Ministry, meanwhile, said there was no cause for panic. “Covid-appropriate behaviour, use of masks, hand hygiene, shunning mass gatherings will help break the chain of transmission of Omicron. Increased vaccine uptake is the need of the hour. Both doses must be ensured for everyone,” ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said today.Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal cited a US study that shows the new Variant of Concern could possibly be 500 per cent more infectious.Don’t panic, says govtHealth Ministry advises stringent Covid-appropriate behaviour, masking, distancing, ventilation, hand hygiene and vaccinationMaharashtra amends normsIn changed rules, Maharashtra has made 7-day institutional quarantine must for fliers only from S Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe125-cr dose milestone||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-omicron-cases-detected-in-karnataka-one-has-left-country-345681
03-12-2021||Bengaluru||India?s first Omicron cases: One is South African, second a local doctor with no travel history||Out of two cases of the new Omicron variant of coronavirus that have been detected in the state, one is a South African national who has left the country after testing negative, while the other is a local person, a Doctor with no travel history, the Karnataka government said on Thursday.Five contacts of the Doctor have also tested positive and their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing.According to officials, both the persons who have tested positive for Omicron in Bengaluru city were vaccinated with two doses of Covid vaccine.“We were waiting for the report for the last two-three days. Today the Centre has officially said the samples we had sent for genomic sequencing are confirmed for the new variant. So two cases of Omicron in the country have been detected in Karnataka. This proves that our aggressive testing has helped in faster identification,” Health Minister K Sudhakar said.Speaking to reporters here, he said there is no need to worry, and appealed to people to compulsorily wear masks, get two doses of vaccines at the earliest, and avoid attending big events especially indoors, unnecessarily.“How it (Omicron) spreads, we can’t say as of now, but there is no need to worry as all the six cases identified so far don’t have any major health issues. We have seen the Delta variant, it had intensity, more issues like breathing, such things have not been noticed so far.Symptoms here are mild,” he added.Earlier, sharing details of the Omicron variant cases, BBMP (city corporation) Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said, the first is a 66-year-old male, who is a South African national.“He had come here (Bengaluru) on November 20, his samples were collected at the airport and subsequently he tested positive. His samples were sent for genome sequencing the reports of which have come today confirming he was infected by Omicron,” he said.Further noting that the person was isolated in a hotel, and he subsequently underwent test separately (self-investigation) at another laboratory (private lab on November 23), during which his reports came negative, the Commissioner said he then left the country for Dubai on November 27.All his 24 primary contacts and 240 secondary contacts have tested negative, he said. “But they are still kept under watch.” The second person is a 46-year-old male practicing medical doctor working at a government hospital. On developing tiredness, weakness and fever he got tested on November 22, following which he tested positive.As his sample had low cycle threshold (Ct) value it was sent to NCBS lab, and the report has come today as positive, Gupta said. “He was initially kept under home isolation and was subsequently shifted to hospital. He is a local person without any travel history.”His 13 primary contacts and 205 secondary contacts have been tested, he said. “Three primary and two secondary contacts have tested positive.They have been kept under isolation and samples have been sent for sequencing.”The Health Minister said the doctor and his five contacts have been isolated and admitted to a government hospital in Bengaluru and are being monitored. “There are no major issues, they have mild symptoms, which is a matter of comfort.”Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is in Delhi today, is likely to chair a high level meeting on Friday to decide on the next course of action and precautionary measures that need to be taken.“The Chief Minister will chair a meeting with senior Ministers, officials and experts, the government is seized of the matter and is on top of the measures that need to be taken, no need to worry or have unnecessary confusions or speculations,” the Minister said.Testing and tracing have to be increased, he said. “I have spoken to the Chief Minister, who is in Delhi, in this regard. There is a need to intensify screening at airports.”Responding to a question, the BBMP commissioner said that samples of all international travellers who have tested positive, and positive cases with low Ct value are being sent for genome sequencing and their results would be known about a week’s time.City’s Bowring Hospital has been identified for treating Omicron cases, he said. “Very less is known about this virus, according to South African doctors, it is easily transmissible, but may be milder...Please note that the second person who tested positive has no travel history, so there may be chances of more people having the infection. There is a need to be vigilant.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-first-omicron-cases-one-is-south-african-second-a-local-doctor-with-no-travel-history-345519
03-12-2021||New Delhi/Bengaluru||India's first two Omicron cases detected in Karnataka||Two cases of the new Omicron variant of coronavirus have been detected in Karnataka, the Union government said on Thursday while asking people not to panic but follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated without delay.Both the patients had mild symptoms. Severe symptoms have not been noted, said Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary in the Union Health Ministry.Of the two cases, one was a 66-year-old South African man who came to Bengaluru on November 20 and left India after testing negative, the city’s civic agency officials said.They said the other was a 46-year-old man who is said to be a doctor—an anaesthetist—at a hospital in Bengaluru. He tested positive on November 22 and has no travel history to South Africa or any other country, the officials said.Both the persons were inoculated with two doses of Covid vaccine, they said.At a press conference in Delhi, Agarwal said following the detection of the two Omicron cases through the INSACOG network, all their primary and secondary contacts were traced in time and were being tested.“We need not panic about the Omicron detection but awareness is absolutely essential. Follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and avoid mass gatherings,” ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava said, adding that increased Covid-19 vaccine uptake was the need of the hour.“Do not delay in getting fully vaccinated,” he stressed.Bengaluru civic agency officials said the South African national came to Bengaluru on November 20 and his samples were collected at the airport.After he tested Covid positive, his samples were sent for genomic sequencing. The reports have come today confirming that the Covid infection was caused by the Omicron variant,” BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said on Thursday.He said the person was isolated in a hotel and underwent Covid test at another laboratory. “This time, his reports came negative and he left for Dubai on November 27 as scheduled,” Gupta said.About the other patient, the BBMP chief commissioner said that since the 46-year-old man’s sample had a low cycle threshold (Ct) value it was sent for genomic sequencing and the report came positive for Omicron on Thursday.“He was initially kept in home isolation and later shifted to a hospital. He is a local person without any travel history. He is stable and is recovering. There is nothing to be concerned about, he is under watch,” Gupta said.According to the joint secretary in the health ministry, 37 flights landed in India from December 1 midnight till 8 am on Thursday.As many as 7,976 passengers arrived from ‘at-risk’ countries during the period and underwent RT-PCR tests at the airports. Of them, 10 passengers were found Covid-19 positive and their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing, Agarwal said.The ‘at-risk’ nations (as updated on November 30) are countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.“It is too early to assess whether Omicron causes more severe infection or less compared to other variants, including Delta,” Agarwal said quoting the World Health Organisation (WHO) which has designated the latest variant as a ‘variant of concern’.About the possibility of clamping a lockdown given the detection of the Omicron variant in India, NITI Aayog member (health) Dr V K Paul said, “Under the current situation, there is no need for it.”“Pandemic situation is under control. This is a new challenge which we will address and we have tools to tackle it. We will not panic or fear.“We have the responsibility of wearing masks, staying in well-ventilated areas and not crowd spaces. Mask is the universal vaccine,” Paul said.Besides the cases detected in India, 373 cases of Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in 29 nations so far, according to the government.Referring to the WHO data on the global Covid scenario, Agarwal said Europe contributed to 70 per cent of the total cases in the last week.On the other hand, the South East Asian region, including India, has only 3.1 per cent of the world’s COVID-19 cases in the last one week, the press conference was informed.About vaccine coverage, Agarwal said 84.3 per cent of the adult population in India got the first dose while 49 per cent got the second dose.Kerala and Maharashtra have over 10,000 active Covid cases while nine states and Union Territories have active cases between 1,000 and 10,000. The weekly Covid positivity rate was over 10 per cent in 15 districts and between 5 and 10 per cent in 18 districts, he said.To a question if flights would be banned, Paul said, “The most important question in Omicron context is that its characteristics, effect and impact is still under study not just in India but all across the world.”“We are closely observing the scientific studies. It is an ongoing work... and as scientific details come more decisions would be taken,” he said.NCDC Director Sujeet Singh said INSACOG has tested 883 samples since November 26. In the whole month, genomic sequencing of 6,400 samples were done.On the detection of the Omicron variant in India, Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the regional director of WHO South-East Asia in a statement said, “It was not unexpected given the interconnected world that we live in.”“This emphasises the need for all countries to step up surveillance, be on alert, rapidly detect any importation and take measures to curtail further spread of the virus,” she added.
