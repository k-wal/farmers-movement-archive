28-12-2021||Lucknow||Kumar Mangat Pathak to make ‘Raid 2’ on perfume trader Piyush Jain||Producer Kumar Mangat Pathak on Tuesday announced the sequel to his 2018 film “Raid” and said the follow-up will be based on the real-life story of multiple raids at the houses and factory of perfume trader Piyush Jain in Kanpur and Kannauj.The filmmaker was speaking at a panel discussion of the first edition of the Kashi Film Festival in Varanasi.Pathak, known for backing films like “Drishyam” and “Khuda Haafiz”, said he had made up his mind to make “Raid-2” which will also show money coming out of the walls like it happened at Jain’s house.Jain was arrested on Sunday after raids at his residence in Kanpur and residence and factory in Kannauj by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) led to the recovery of about Rs 257 crore in cash, 25 kg of gold and 250 kg of silver.The Finance Ministry on Monday had said it was the “biggest ever seizure of cash” by an enforcement agency.The trader was produced in metropolitan court number 10 amid tight security and the court remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days.Starring Ajay Devgn, Saurabh Shukla and Ileana D’Cruz, “Raid” is based on the real life income-tax raid conducted by the officers of the Income Tax Department on Sardar Inder Singh in the 1980s.The raid distinguished itself from others for being the longest raid in Indian history, lasting three days and two nights.Directed by Raj Kumar Gupta, the 2018 film was produced by Abhishek Pathak, Kumar Mangat Pathak, Bhushan Kumar, Gaurav Nanda and Krishan Kumar Dua. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kumar-mangat-pathak-to-make-raid-2-on-perfume-trader-piyush-jain-355524
28-12-2021||---||BJP got its own businessman raided by mistake: Akhilesh on perfume trader’s arrest||Unnao (UP), December 28Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav categorically denied any link between his party and Kanpur-based perfume trader Piyush Jain on Tuesday, and mockingly said the BJP got “its own businessman” raided “by mistake”.He also wondered that “when all the resources are with the BJP today, who else can have such a huge amount of cash” and claimed that the CDR (call detail record) of the businessman’s phone would reveal the names of several leaders of the saffron party, “who were in touch with him”.The details of cash withdrawal from banks would bring out the truth, the Samajwadi Party (SP) president said.“By mistake, the BJP got its own businessman raided. Instead of SP leader Pushpraj Jain, it got Piyush Jain raided,” Yadav told reporters before the start of the “Samajwadi Rath Yatra” here.He also claimed that Samajwadi Attar (perfume) was launched by SP MLC Pushpraj Jain and not Piyush Jain. Taking a swipe at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said, “Due to the mistake of Digital India, it got its own businessman raided.”            The Union finance ministry on Monday said the recent seizure of more than Rs 177 crore unaccounted cash from the perfume trader’s Kanpur house was the “biggest ever seizure of cash” by an enforcement agency.Piyush Jain was sent to judicial custody for 14 days on a Kanpur court order on Monday.With months to go for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, BJP leaders have been attacking the SP over Jain’s arrest, claiming that the perfume trader had links with Yadav’s party.The SP, however, has been denying any link with Piyush Jain.“Even television channels that were flashing the news that the house of an SP man has been raided when the raids started realised by afternoon that it was not true and hence, stopped saying it,” Yadav said.He added that the seizure of the huge amount of cash from the Kanpur-based businessman proved that demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have failed.Addressing a rally at the GIC ground here, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said Unnao is the land of Hasrat Mohani, who had given the call for “inquilab” (revolution) during the freedom struggle.“The entire state is witnessing a similar situation today.... Inquilab will happen again and there will be a change of government in the state in 2022,” Yadav, who has been crisscrossing Uttar Pradesh as part of his party’s “rath yatra” ahead of the crucial Assembly polls, said.Taking a swipe at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said a “yogi” (seer) never lies.“Tell us how many people have been given jobs by you. How many youngsters have received tablet computers and smartphones?” Yadav asked.He accused the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh of gross mismanagement during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and referred to bodies floating in the Ganga during the period.The former chief minister said if the SP returns to power in the state, it would give a compensation of Rs 5 lakh in the event of the death of a bicycle rider in an accident.Bicycle is the poll symbol of the SP.Yadav also claimed that Kanpur Metro is a contribution of the SP, which had launched the project when it was in power in Uttar Pradesh.He said the future SP government would extend the Kanpur Metro project to Unnao. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-got-its-own-businessman-raided-by-mistake-akhilesh-on-perfume-traders-arrest-355515

28-12-2021||New Delhi||Play Indian music in flights, airports: Aviation Ministry||The Ministry of Civil Aviation on Tuesday asked all airlines and airports to consider playing Indian music in their flights and terminal premises. The Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR) had on December 23 requested Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia to promote Indian music in flights operated by Indian carriers.Therefore, the ministry wrote a letter to all airlines and airports on Monday stating that music played by most of the airlines across the globe was in quintessential of the country to which the airline belongs, for example, Jazz in an American airline or Mozart in an Austrian airline and Arab music in an airline from the Middle East.“But, Indian airlines seldom play Indian music in the flight, whereas, our music has a rich heritage and culture and it has one of the many things every Indian has a reason to feel truly proud of it,” the ministry noted.India has a rich diversity of traditional music, it noted.“Owing to India’s vastness and diversity, Indian music encompasses numerous genres in multiple varieties and forms, which include classical music, folk, light vocal, instrumental music, etc,” it mentioned.India has a history spanning several millennia and developed over several geo-locations spanning the sub-continent, it said.Music in India began as an integral part of the socio-religious life, it noted.The ministry said it is in receipt of request from ICCR for playing Indian music in the aircraft being operated in India and also at airports.“It is, therefore, requested to kindly consider playing Indian music in the aircraft being operated in India and at airports following the regulatory requisites,” the ministry stated.Scindia had on December 23 visited the headquarters of the ICCR here and met its president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe.The ICCR, which works under the Ministry of External Affairs, had said on Twitter that various suggestions were made during the meeting “including promotion of Indian music in flights operated by the Indian air companies”.Eminent artists and musicians, including Malini Awasthi, Anu Malik, Kaushal S Inamdar, Shounak Abhisheki, Manjusha Patil K, Sanjeev Abhyankar, Rita Ganguly and Wasifuddin Dagar were also present during the meeting, it added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/play-indian-music-in-flights-airports-aviation-ministry-355509
28-12-2021||New Delhi||8 vaccines, 4 treatments in India’s Covid-19 arsenal||The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has granted restricted emergency use authorisation to two new vaccines and a drug for Covid-19, taking to 12 the number of preventives and treatments available in India.Corbevax, Covovax, Molnupiravir approved for restricted emergency use against Covid-19   Here is the list1. Covishield: Co-developed by the University of Oxford and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, the vaccine is manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) as Covishield in India. The two-dose vaccine uses adenoviruses that infect chimpanzees to carry the gene responsible for the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. The virus uses the spike protein to enter and infect the human cells.Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause mild cold- or flu-like illness.2. Covaxin: The indigenous two-dose vaccine, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology, uses an inactivated virus developed by chemically treating novel coronavirus samples to make them incapable of reproduction.3. Sputnik V: Developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, the two-dose Sputnik V is a vector vaccine produced using a combination of two adenoviruses called Ad5 and Ad26. Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause mild cold- or flu-like illness.4. ZyCoV-D: The DNA vaccine produced by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila is a three-dose vaccine. Instead of using regular syringes, the vaccine will be administered by a needle-free applicator. The DNA-based vaccinations operate by transferring a genetically modified blueprint of viral genes into small molecules of DNA or genetic material for injection into persons being vaccinated.5. Moderna: Developed by US-based company Moderna, the two-dose vaccine uses genetic code of messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce the viral protein to train the immune system for a future encounter with the infectious coronavirus. RNA acts as a genetic material in many viruses and mRNA is used in making proteins in a cell.6. Johnson and Johnson: The single-dose adenovirus vector vaccine is developed by the American company Johnson and Johnson. It contains a piece of a modified virus that is not the virus that causes Covid-19. This modified virus is called the vector virus. The vector virus cannot reproduce itself, so it is harmless. This vector virus gives instructions to cells in the body to create an immune response.7. Corbevax: Made by Hyderabad-based firm Biological-E, the vaccine consists of a version of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which the virus uses to enter and infect the cells.  It will be administered intramuscularly in two doses. It has been designed using a similar technology used for developing Hepatitis B vaccines.8.  Covovax: Developed by American biotechnology company Novavax and manufactured under license by SII, Covovax is a two-dose subunit vaccine that contains purified parts of the virus necessary to elicit a protective immune response.Treatments9.  American company Merck’s Molnupiravir is an antiviral medication that inhibits the reproduction of certain viruses. The drug will be manufactured in India by 13 companies. It has been approved under emergency use authorisation for treating adults with COVID-19 “who have high risk of progression to disease”. 10. Tocilizumab: Developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, tocilizumab is an immunosuppressant primarily used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and has been repurposed to fight lung infection in Covid-19 patients. It is imported and distributed by Cipla in India, and may be considered for use in the presence of severe disease.11. 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG): Developed by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), 2-DG is an oral drug administered in India only on prescription. The virus depends upon glycolysis or breakdown of glucose for energy. The drug hinders the process of glycolysis and prevents the growth of the virus.12.  REGEN-COV2 antibody cocktail: Developed by Roche, it is a combination of monoclonal antibodies Casirivimab and Imdevimab that are administered together for treating mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. Monoclonal antibodies are artificial antibodies created in the lab that mimic the activity of our immune system. Casirivimab and imdevimab are specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and are designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/8-vaccines-4-treatments-in-indias-covid-19-arsenal-355508
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||DRDO hands over technology to make extreme cold weather clothing to five Indian firms||The technology to manufacture indigenous extreme cold weather clothing system (ECWS) was on Monday handed over by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to five Indian companies for commercial production.ECWS is required by the Indian Army for its sustained operations in high-altitude areas and glaciers in the Himalayas. The Army, till recently has been importing extreme cold weather clothing and several Special Clothing and Mountaineering Equipment (SCME) items for the troops deployed in high altitude regions.The DRDO designed ECWCS is ergonomically designed modular technical clothing with improved thermal insulation and physiological comfort based on the insulation required at various ambient climatic conditions in Himalayan regions during different levels of physical activity, an official statement said.The ECWCS embodies physiological concepts related to a reduction in respiratory heat and water loss, unhindered range of motions, and rapid absorption of sweat while providing waterproof, windproof features with adequate breathability and enhanced insulation as well as strength features required for high altitude operations. The three-layered ECWCS is designed to suitably provide thermal insulation over a temperature range of 15 to minus 50 degrees Celsius with different combinations of layers and intensity of physical work.Considering the widely fluctuating weather conditions in the Himalayan peaks, the clothing provides an advantage of fewer combinations to meet the required insulation for the prevailing climatic conditions, thereby providing a viable import alternative for the Indian Army. Speaking on the occasion, Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Chairman DRDO, emphasised the need for developing an indigenous industrial base for different items, not only to cater to the existing requirements of the Army but also to tap its potential for export.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-hands-over-technology-to-make%C2%A0extreme-cold-weather-clothing-to-five-indian-firms-355504

28-12-2021||Mumbai||Malegaon blast: Witness claims he was 'forced' to take names of Adityanath, RSS leaders; becomes 15th hostile witness||A witness in the 2008 Malegoan blast case, whose statement had been recorded by Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad, claimed in a court on Tuesday that the ATS had threatened him to take the names of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath and four other RSS leaders.Notably, former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, currently facing multiple cases of extortion, was posted as additional commissioner of the ATS, when it probed the Malegaon blast case. The witness deposed before the special NIA court on Tuesday.His statement had been recorded by the ATS when it probed the case before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the case. During his deposition, the witness told the court that the then senior ATS officer Param Bir Singh and another officer had threatened him to take the names of Adityanath, the present UP CM, and four other Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders, including Indresh Kumar.He claimed the ATS tortured him and made him sit (in the ATS office) illegally.After his deposition, the court declared the witness hostile for making allegations against the ATS and denying that he made any statement before the anti-terror agency.As many as 220 witnesses have been examined in the case till now and 15 of them have turned hostile.On September 29, 2008, six people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Nashik's Malegaon town, located about 200 km from Mumbai.The accused in the case include Lok Sabha member Pragya Singh Thakur, Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, Shudakar Diwedi, Major Ramesh Upadhyay (retired), Ajay Rahirkar, Sudhakar Dwivedi, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, and Sameer Kulkarni, all of whom are out on bail.They are facing trial under provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/malegaon-blast-witness-claims-he-was-forced-to-take-names-of-adityanath-rss-leaders-becomes-15th-hostile-witness-355499
28-12-2021||New Delhi||60-plus population with co-morbidity will not require doctor certificate for precaution dose: Centre||People aged 60 years and above with co-morbidity will not be required to produce or submit any certificate from doctor at the time of administration of precaution dose of Covid-19 vaccine, the Centre told states and Union Territories on Tuesday.Such persons are expected to obtain the advice of their doctor before deciding to avail of the precaution dose or third dose.In a letter to states and UTs, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said personnel to be deployed in election duty in the poll-bound states will be included in the category of frontline workers.Eligibility of such beneficiaries for the precaution dose will be based on the date of administration of 2nd dose as recorded in the Co-WIN system—completion of nine months i.e. 39 weeks from the date of administration of second dose—Bhushan said.He informed that CoWIN will send reminder messages to all those eligible for precaution dose, which will be reflected in digital vaccination certificates.Bhushan chaired a workshop through video conference on Tuesday with all states and UTs to review the roll-out of vaccination for the age group 15-18 and precautionary third dose for vulnerable categories—healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and those in the 60-plus age group with co-morbidity.He said only Covaxin is to be administered in the age group 15-18 years and that additional doses of the vaccine will be sent to all states and UTs.The Union Government will share the supply schedule of Covaxin with all the states and UTs in the next few days, he said.Potential beneficiaries can either register themselves on Co-WIN from January 1 or avail of a walk-in registration when vaccination commences from January 3. Those with a birth year of 2007 or before will be eligible for vaccination under this category, he said.All established protocols regarding vaccination are to be followed for the 15-18 years age group, beneficiaries are to wait for half-an-hour when they will be monitored for AEFI and will be eligible for the 2nd dose only after 28 days, according to a Health Ministry statement.States were informed that they have the option to designate some Covid Vaccination Centre for vaccination of the 15-18 age group exclusively which can also be reflected on Co-WIN. Dedicated CVCs would ensure that there is no confusion in administering the vaccines.For CVCs that are intended to serve all, the states were requested to ensure separate queues and vaccination teams for the 15-18 age group.With regards to the administration of the precautionary dose, the Union Health Secretary highlighted that nine months must have elapsed since the administration of the second dose to make the beneficiary eligible.Drawing attention to the misinformation being propagated through various media regarding the requirement of a doctor’s certificate to establish co-morbidity, he categorically emphasised that the Union government has not issued any directions on the matter and prescriptions/certificates are not mandated to be produced at the vaccination centre for administration of the precaution dose.States and UTs were further advised to ensure the orientation of vaccinators and vaccination team members for vaccination of the 15-18 age group. States were exhorted to undertake proper planning in advance for distribution of Covaxin to identified session sites. To avoid the mixing-up of vaccines during administration, separate CVCs, separate session sites, separate queue and separate vaccination team are to be strived for.All citizens irrespective of their income status are entitled to free Covid-19 vaccination at government vaccination centres, Bhushan said in a letter.Those who have the ability to pay are encouraged to use private hospitals’ vaccination centres. The previously declared price for each vaccine at private centre will remain applicable for these group of beneficiaries, Bhushan said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/60-plus-population-with-co-morbidity-will-not-require-doctor-certificate-for-precaution-dose-centre-355494
28-12-2021||New Delhi||Dara Shikoh was ‘deliberately’ not given due importance by certain governments: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi||Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Tuesday “prejudiced politics” created misconception on the legacy of Dara Shikoh.He also said that governments of so-called “champions of secularism” deliberately did not give due importance, recognition to works done by Dara Shikoh like many other great people.Dara Shikoh was the eldest son of Shah Jahan, and a thinker, a poet and a scholar, who was killed by his younger brother Aurangzeb in a war of succession.According to a statement issued by his office, Naqvi made these remarks at an international conference on Dara Shikoh held here.The conference on ‘Why Dara Shikoh Matters Today: Remembering His Works and Personality’ was organised by Aligarh Muslim University.Naqvi said that harmony, tolerance, “sarva dharma sambhav” is the soul of India and “unity in diversity” is the strength of the country.Dara Shikoh remained the torchbearer of social harmony and religious unity his entire life, he said according to the statement.Naqvi, who is also Deputy Leader of Rajya Sabha, said while on one hand, the believers of almost all religions of the world live in India, on the other, a large number of atheists also exist in the country with equal constitutional and social rights.“This strength of unity in diversity makes India ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’,” he said.Naqvi said India is the only country in the world where festivals and other joyous occasions of all the religions are celebrated together.“We need to keep this shared cultural heritage and legacy of co-existence strengthened. Any attempt to disturb this fabric of unity and harmony will hurt the soul of India,” he felt.The minister noted that India is the world’s largest centre of spiritual-religious knowledge and also the source of inspiration for “sarva dharma sambhav” and “vasudhaiva kutumbakam”.“It is our collective national responsibility to ensure that India’s culture of tolerance and commitment of co-existence is not allowed to get weaken under any circumstances,” he said.Many obstacles came in the way of inclusive development, but our strength of unity in diversity has ensured the country moves forward on the path of prosperity, he said.The governments of so-called “Champions of Secularism” deliberately did not give due importance, recognition to works done by Dara Shikoh like many other great people.

They inflame passions, instill fear and spread animosity. The finest traditions of our parliamentary democracy are being deliberately damaged,” the Congress president said.“Let there be no doubt on our steadfast resolve. We have never and we will never compromise on our fundamental beliefs that are part of our glorious legacy,” she said.“Electoral ups and downs are inevitable but what is enduring and lasting is our commitment to the service of all people of our diverse society,” Gandhi said, adding that the party would make every possible sacrifice to counter these “anti-people conspiracies”.

They have spread the ‘itr’ of corruption,” he said, referring to the ‘Samajwadi itr’, a perfume launched by Pushpraj Jain alias Pampi Jain a couple of days backModi inaugurated the Kanpur metro by taking a ride amid claims by the Samajwadi Party that the ambitious project was started by Akhilesh Yadav. Earlier, Yadav had also claimed that the Kashi Viswanath Dham Corridor project was started by him. The Prime Minister said the people of Uttar Pradesh know the truth and are watching every incident minutely. “The people of Kanpur understand business and trade well. Before 2017, the perfume of corruption that they had sprinkled all over Uttar Pradesh is there for everyone to see. “But now, they are sitting with their mouths shut. They are not coming forward to take credit for the mountain of currency notes seen by the entire country. This is their achievement and their reality,” he said. Shah and Nadda too mounted scathing attacks against the BJP’s main rival from other locations in the poll-bound state.Shah claimed that for the Samajwadi Party, ‘ABCD’ meant ‘A’ for ‘apradh’, ‘B’ for ‘bhai-bhatija’, ‘C’ for corruption and ‘D’ for ‘danga’. “The BJP has wiped off this ABCD. When Piyush Jain was raided, it was Akhilesh Yadav who felt uneasy, he said in Hardoi.Akhilesh Yadav, meanwhile, retaliated, calling the raids a “sign of BJP’s weak position in UP”.Denying any links with Piyush Jain, he mockingly said the BJP got “its own businessman” raided “by mistake”. He also said that call detail records of his phone will reveal the names of several BJP leaders who were in touch with him. “By mistake, the BJP got its own businessman raided. Instead of SP leader Pushpraj Jain, it got Piyush Jain raided,” Yadav saidHe also claimed that Samajwadi Attar (perfume) was launched by SP MLC Pushpraj Jain and not Piyush Jain., “In a digital mistake, it got its own businessman raided,” he said.Credit warEarlier, Yadav had also claimed that the Sri Kashi Viswanath Corridor project was started by him.Tweeting a picture from October 2016, the SP said the then CM Akhilesh Yadav laid the foundation stone of the project in presence of then Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu and the then Kanpur BJP MP Murli Manohar Joshi.Interestingly, even then there was a credit war with the BJP attributing the project to Joshi.Meanwhile, the BJP hit back saying Yadav has a habit of laying claim over every project “The construction of the project started under the tenure of CM Yogi Adityanath on November 15, 2019, and the 9-km-long first leg of the project was completed in a record tenure," it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-top-brass-in-up-pm-modi-amit-shah-and-jp-nadda-to-pitch-for-party-in-upcoming-assembly-elections-in-key-state-355455

It has also urged the apex court to direct the local body elections to be deferred for four months with a mandate to the state government to come out with the report of the commission and directing the SEC to hold the elections accordingly.It has requested the top court to suspend the election process as an interim measure. The Centre has also sought impleadment in the matter in which the apex court had passed the order on December 17.On December 17, the top court had referred to the Constitution Bench verdict of 2010 which had mentioned the triple condition, including setting up a dedicated commission to conduct a contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness qua local bodies within the state, which is required to be followed before provisioning such reservation for the OBC category. It had also said later, a three-judge bench had reiterated the same.“The issues raised in the present petition are of great public importance and has a pan-India ramification on the issue of implementation of OBC reservations in the elections all throughout the country,” the Centre has said in its application seeking impleadment in the matter.In its application seeking recall of the December 17 order, the government has said that inadequate representation or non-representation of the OBCs has a two-fold adverse impact. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/recall-obc-quota-order-or-defer-mp-civic-elections-centre-in-sc-355192

The MHA said the organisation itself had sent a request to the SBI for freezing its accounts.“The registration (under FCRA) was valid up to October 31, 2021. The validity was subsequently extended up to December 31, 2021, along with other FCRA associations whose renewal application were pending renewal. However, while considering the MoC’s renewal application, some adverse inputs were noticed. In consideration of these inputs on record, the renewal application of the MoC was not approved,” the Home Ministry statement stated.“The MHA did not freeze any accounts of the MoC. The State Bank of India has informed that MoC itself sent a request to the SBI to freeze its accounts,” the release added.Earlier, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee alleged that all bank accounts of the MoC had been frozen by the Centre. Shocked to hear that on Christmas, Union Ministry froze all bank accounts of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity in India! Their 22,000 patients and employees have been left without food and medicines,” she said in a tweet on Monday afternoon. The MoC, however, has not spoken on the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mother-teresa-charitys-plea-on-foreign-funds-turned-down-355189

Party leader Manish Sisodia too claimed that the people of Punjab “have decided to give a chance to Kejriwal this time”.It’s Mandate for honest politicsThe victory of AAP in Chandigarh MC is a sign of ensuing change in Punjab. People of Chandigarh have chosen honest politics of AAP, rejecting corrupt politics. —Arvind KejriwalHowever, political analysts say infighting in the Congress and anti-incumbency against the BJP favoured AAP in the UT. They feel the result may not be an indicator of the party’s performance in the Punjab Assembly elections.The analysts say AAP’s claims are far-fetched. The UT poll results may not help AAP beyond boosting the morale of its cadre and building a perception in a limited way, they say.Chandigarh-based political observer Dr Pramod Kumar says the UT results are a clear mandate against the BJP. The Congress despite getting the highest vote share lost because of its internal rift. “A large section of Congress workers joined AAP, which built the party in Chandigarh,” he says. The party, however, is unlikely to repeat the same feat in Punjab, he claims.Echoing similar views, political commentator Jagtar Singh says AAP won mainly in urban pockets of Chandigarh. “This clearly shows their style of politics is unlikely to find favour in a large part of Punjab,” he claims.Besides, the experts say the politics in Punjab is completely different than in Chandigarh. Cautioning the Congress in Punjab, Dr Kumar says, “The party must acknowledge that its Chandigarh unit messed up the election due to internal conflict and the Punjab unit is going the same way. More than AAP winning this election, it is about the Congress losing it.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/win-in-chandigarh-mc-signals-change-in-punjab-kejriwal-355180

In other words, “all those whose birth year is 2007” or before, shall be eligible.An additional provision has been made on CoWIN through which students can register for vaccination on the portal using their student identity cards as some may not have Aadhaar or other ID cards, Sharma said.The beneficiaries (aged 15-18 years) can register themselves online through an existing account on Co-WIN or by creating a new account through a unique mobile number. This facility is available for all eligible citizens presently.Such beneficiaries can also be registered at the vaccination sites by the verifier or the vaccinator in the facilitated registration mode and appointments can be booked online or on-site (walk-in), the guidelines stated.In a televised address to the nation on Saturday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that vaccination against COVID-19 for children aged between 15 and 18 years will start from January 3, while a “precaution dose” for the healthcare and frontline workers would be administered from January 10 -- decisions that came amid a rising number of coronavirus cases linked to its Omicron variant.Modi said the precaution dose will also be available for citizens above 60 years of age and with comorbidities on the advice of their doctors from January 10.Zydus Cadila’s anti-Covid vaccine ZyCoV-D is yet to be introduced in the country’s inoculation programme even for adults, though it received the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the drug regulator on August 20, making it the first vaccine to be administered in the age group of 12-18 years in the country.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) granted the EUA to indigenously-developed Covaxin for children above 12 years with certain conditions on Friday.

28-12-2021||New Delhi||Kerala best state on health parameters, Uttar Pradesh worst||Kerala has again emerged as the top performer in terms of overall health performance among larger states, while Uttar Pradesh is the worst, according to the fourth Health Index launched by Niti Aayog.The fourth round of the Health Index took into account the period 2019-20 (reference year).The report by the government think tank said Tamil Nadu and Telangana have emerged as the second and third best performers, respectively, on health parameters.Bihar and Madhya Pradesh were the second and third worst performers, respectively, on health parameters.The report, however, added that Uttar Pradesh topped in terms of incremental performance by registering the highest incremental change from the base year (2018-19) to reference year (2019-20).Among the smaller states, Mizoram emerged as the best performer in overall performance as well as incremental performance, while among UTs, Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir ranked among the bottom UTs in terms of overall performance but emerged as the leading performer in terms of incremental performance.The report pointed out that for the fourth consecutive round Kerala emerged as the best performer in terms of overall performance.According to the report, Kerala and Tamil Nadu were top two performers in terms of overall performance with the highest reference year (2019-20) index scores but ranked twelfth and eighth respectively in terms of incremental performance.Telangana performed well both in terms of overall performance as well as incremental performance and secured the third position in both instances.It pointed out that Rajasthan was the weakest performer both in terms of overall performance and incremental performance.In the case of smaller states, Mizoram and Tripura registered strong overall performance, and at the same time showed improvements in incremental performance, the report added.As per the report, the health index is a weighted composite score incorporating 24 indicators covering key aspects of health performance.It said health index comprises select indicators in three domains—health outcomes, governance and information, and key inputs and processes.Releasing the report, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said: “States are beginning to take cognizance of indices such as the State Health Index and use them in their policymaking and resource allocation.”        This report is an example of both competitive and cooperative federalism, Kumar added.The report has been prepared in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) with technical assistance from the World Bank.According to an official statement, the importance of this annual tool was re-emphasized by MoHFW’s decision to link the index to incentives under the National Health Mission.This has been instrumental in shifting the focus from budget spending and inputs to outputs and outcomes, it added.
