19-12-2021||Gorakhpur (UP)||‘Mahatma Gandhi would be happy to see Kashi today’: Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said Mahatma Gandhi would have been happy to see the “beauty” of Kashi (Varanasi) today, highlighting the city’s makeover under Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project.“When in 1916 Mahatma Gandhi came to Kashi and went to have ‘darshan’ of Kashi Vishwanath temple, he made sharp comment on the dirt and narrow lanes around the temple.“But now PM Modi has changed the entire situation and Mahatma Gandhi would have been very happy after seeing the beauty of Kashi,” Adityanath said.Addressing a programme of RSS-affiliated ABVP here, he said in 1980 when Ramjanmbhoomi movement started it was hard for people to believe that the temple will one day become a reality.He also alleged that the Article 370 — now abrogated — was implemented against the wish of BR Ambedkar and the then-Jansangh leader Shyama Prasad Mookerji.“Article 370 was introduced silently. Babasaheb opposed it, but his voice was suppressed. Shyama Prasad Mookarji too protested against the article and raised his voice for one nation, one symbol. And he sacrificed himself to end permit raj in Kashmir,” he said.He accused the opposition parties of dividing society in the name of “caste, language, and place”.Adityanath lauded the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) for “bringing people of Northeast into the mainstream”, saying what could not be done by previous governments, was done by the student organisation.“Today BJP has government in Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh. I can say now that ABVP is doing a good job,” he said.Talking about his meeting with 22 BTech students, the CM said 16 of them wanted to launch startups but were not aware of government schemes about it.He asked the ABVP to create awareness about welfare schemes of the government so that people could be benefited.The CM claimed that with start of ODOP (One District, One Product) scheme, UP has become an export hub.He said terracotta artists earned Rs 8 lakh in Lucknow and people bought locally-made idols of Lakshmi-Ganesh during Diwali instead of those made in China.Adityanath lauded PM Modi also for his “management” of Covid pandemic.He said more people died in the US of coronavirus than India despite the latter’s weaker health infrastructure and higher population.Earlier at another event in the city, the CM laid foundation of or inaugurated 334 development schemes worth Rs 955 crore.During the programme, he also distributed “equipment” among 1261 children with disability. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mahatma-gandhi-would-be-happy-to-see-kashi-today-adityanath-352164
19-12-2021||Pune||Centre will strengthen cooperative sector, aims to bring transparent system for agri finance: Amit Shah||Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said the Centre will come up with various measures to strengthen the cooperative movement in the country aiming to set up a transparent system for agriculture finance.Speaking at the convocation ceremony of Vaikunth Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management (VAMNICOM) here, Shah said the government will amend the multi-state Cooperative Act and try to plug all loopholes besides taking other measures.He also said that a new cooperative policy will be brought soon.On the occasion, Shah said the Centre will soon set up a national university for cooperative management courses.He said that the cooperative movement in the country has weakened in the last several years.“We will have to once again strengthen the cooperative sector and make it the biggest contributor in the country’s GDP, and for that, all you have to work with dedication in your respective fields,” Shah told the students.He said that to strengthen the cooperative movement in the country, the Narendra Modi government is bringing many measures.“We will amend the multi-state Cooperative Act and we will try to plug all loopholes. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), which are the soul of the cooperative movement, will be connected to district cooperative banks. The DCCs will be connected to state cooperative banks, and state cooperative banks will be linked to NABARD,” said Shah, adding that by doing this, the government wants to bring a transparent system for agriculture finance.He added that if PACS function transparently, then the country’s economic wheel will gather pace, and a lot of the schemes from different departments will get percolated down through the cooperative sector.In his address, Shah said there are several opportunities in the cooperative sector available for students stepping out of these institutes with degrees.“...Today, you are also stepping out of this institute. VAMNICOM is not a university and there is no atmosphere (possibility) that it will become so. But it has associated itself with various state-level institutes from 24 states in a short period,” he said.“We will very soon set up a university for cooperative management courses...It will be a national university and several colleges from states will affiliate themselves with this university,” Shah added.He said India scripted several success stories in the cooperative sector and when India wants to stand ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) in front of the world, the cooperative sector will play an important role.One meaning of becoming ‘aatmanirbhar’ is to manufacture all the necessary things in India while the other meaning is to make 130 crore people of the country self-reliant, Shah said.“If we want to make 130 crore people ‘aatmanirbhar’ and bring about equal development, cooperative is the only sector which will offer all-round development, equal development and opportunity to these 130 crore people and help them become self-reliant,” he said.Shah also said that many farmers in the country are adopting the organic farming model. However, they are not getting the right price for their produce, he said.“There is no system for soil and product certification. We have decided to bring in a system in which global valid certificates will be issued for products of farmers engaged in organic farming. They will receive a higher price for their products. We will rope in entities like Amul, which has several success stories to its credit in the cooperative sector, in this endeavour,” he said.Shah further said that the Centre wants to expand the scope of the cooperative sector in the country.“If we want to increase the scope of the cooperative sector, we will have to bring a cooperative policy through which implementation can be done for the next 25 years,” he said.Speaking at a function related to the cooperative sector in Ahmednagar district on Saturday, Shah had said that some state governments were not giving bank guarantees to sugar mills whose management is politically linked to opposition parties.He had said that he was not going to be a mute spectator in this sector.

19-12-2021||New Delhi||Rohini FSL deploys new tech to identify meat samples, to help expedite slaughter cases probe||Cases related to illegal slaughter of animals, including cow, may now be solved expeditiously in Delhi with the forensic laboratory at Rohini using a new technology to identify the animal that has been butchered.The Rohini FSL started using the Mitochondrial DNA technology in August this year, and has helped solve 22 cases of animal slaughter since then. According to officials, this is the first lab in north India to deploy the technique to identify the animal that has been slaughtered and ascertain its sex.The laboratory has deployed an automated DNA extraction instrument and a Real-Time PCR instrument based on mitochondrial DNA technology—Mitochondrial DNA is the physical embodiment of genetic information encoded in mitochondrion—to identify the animal and its sex.According to Delhi Police officials, the facility will help them solve cases of illegal slaughter expeditiously as they have to wait for long duration when they send the samples outside the city.They said slaughter of certain animals hurts the religious feelings of people so police need to take expeditious action in such cases to avoid any tension. There has been cases where people accused of illegal cow slaughter were lynched to death by mobs. During the probe of animal slaughter, even though a case is registered, the police depend on forensic evidence to first identify the species through the meat recovered, and then to determine its sex, according to senior FSL senior scientific officer Naresh Kumar.“When someone is caught and claims he was transporting buff, yet it is an illegal act of slaughter which also comes under the Animal Slaughtering Act,” he told PTI.He said apart from cow and buffalo meat, the lab now can also identify chicken meat. “We started getting queries in one-two cases where the client being strictly vegetarian wanted to know if they were delivered non-vegetarian food. So, that is a new species added to the facility for identification.”      A senior Delhi police officer explained how the facility helps them solve animal slaughter cases expeditiously.When the identity of the animal is very clear right at the scene of crime, one need not take the help of forensic experts, he said. “But in cases where one gets only remains, blood samples or flesh, the forensic report helps ascertain the identity of the species.”       The testing facility also helps in curbing the serious issue of meat adulteration, FSL officials said.A senior FSL official said they recently tackled a case where a suspected mixture of two meats was being illegally transported in a car. “All we got was the blood samples of the mixed meat from the vehicle. So, in that case based on the blood samples, we identified it had both cow and buffalo meat,” he said.Elaborating the procedure followed during the identification of the sample sent by the police for determination, the senior officials at the FSL said once the sample is collected by the police, it gets preserved under -20 degrees Celsius temperature.           It is important that in the absence of the FSL team at the scene of crime, the police are trained to preserve the lifted sample by applying dry salt on it and preserve it in an air-tight plastic or glass containers, he said.Explaining the details of testing, the official said, “Generally, pieces of meat or bones are extracted, then using the mitochondrial DNA technology and a special kit composed of chemical mixture with a base of a particular species is applied against it.“If the sample gets amplified, it means the meat is of a cow. If not, we use another kit consisting the base of a buffalo, and if the DNA extracted sample does not get amplified, it means it is not buffalo meat. So, this way, the identification of the species is done,” he said.Later, the sex determination is also carried out and the report is submitted to the police.According to officials, well-preserved samples bring out the best results.FSL director Deepa Verma said, “If it gets deteriorated, it is not that we would not get the results at all. In such cases, our experts will try multiple times but there are also chances that we may not get the best results but in comparison to good quality preservation, it results in 95 per cent confirmation.”She said it is the first time that mitochondrial DNA technology is being used in north India in analysing and determining the sex of the animal samples.After they started probing wildlife-related crimes using the technology in August this year, the Delhi Police has approached them with 35 cases of suspected cow or buffalo slaughter out of which 22 cases have already been solved, officials said.“As per our analysis, maximum of these cases are related to cow slaughtering,” said Kumar, the FSL senior scientific officer.

We have seen unthinkable advances in every sphere of our lives and learning. Unfortunately, new vices have also made their way into the lives of youth.”The CJI said, “I am alarmed at the reports of increased number of youth falling prey to intoxicants. I would urge the youth of today, to disassociate themselves from substance abuse. Your mental and physical health is in your hands. A vibrant nation is built upon the health and energy of its youth.”Maintaining that students cannot afford to be disillusioned, the CJI said, ‘It’s imperative for you to be a part of current debates. Do not stop at just raising questions. Also ask yourself what the remedy can be. Being the future of the nation, you must have a clear vision.“Being the guardians of freedom, justice, equality and ethics, you cannot allow narrow and partisan views to dominate the nation’s thought. Students are known for their readiness to fight for all the right causes because their thoughts are pure and honest,” Justice Ramana told the law students.Asking them to be in the forefront to question injustice, he said, “We need leaders for tomorrow to rise from these grounds.”The CJI said, “I find that very few students who graduate from National Law Schools are interested in joining litigation or taking up public causes, let alone practice at the district level.”Noting that “there is a fascination to only practice before the Supreme Court andHigh Court while completely ignoring the importance of trial courts,” he said, “To succeed at trial advocacy, one requires a separate skill set, wherein the requirement of presence of mind and intellectual inputs is immense.“Moreover, considering the highest pendency before the trial courts, there is both a demand and the need for specialized lawyers. I urge you all to consider gaining experience at trial court level before moving on to practice at higher forums such as High Courts and the Supreme Court,” the CJI said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-alarmed-at-increased-number-of-youth-falling-prey-to-drugs-352157

If they are not like Hema Malini’s cheeks, then I will resign,” the water supply and sanitation minister said, apparently targeting former BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who was an MLA from Jalgaon for several years.However, Rupali Chakankar, the chairperson of the Maharashtra State Commission for Women, took cognisance of the remarks and warned the minister of legal action if he did not tender a public apology.“The commission has taken note of the comment.

This life itself is not forever. We don’t know how long we will be here in such a situation, these posts and positions are also not forever. I am aware of this fact every moment,” he said.In an expression of gratitude to the people of his constituency, Bommai said he is only ‘Basavaraj’ for them and not the Chief Minister.The CM was addressing people after inaugurating the statue of Kittur Rani Chennamma, the 19th Century queen of Kittur in Belagavi district, who fought against the British.“I have always been saying that outside this place (Shiggaon) I was Home Minister and Irrigation Minister in the past, but once I was in, I remained just ‘Basavaraj’ for you all.Today as a Chief Minister I am saying that once I come to Shiggaon, I may be Chief Minister outside but amongst  you, I will remain as the same Basavaraj Bommai because the name Basavaraj is permanent and not the posts”, he said.There have been rumours in some quarters that Bommai is likely to be replaced.The CM is reportedly suffering from knee related problem, and may undergo treatment abroad but there was no official word on this.The Chief Minister who turned emotional twice recalled how affectionately he was fed ‘Rotti’ (Jowar Roti) and ‘Navane’ (foxtail millet) rice every time he came to his constituency as Basavaraj.“I don’t have great things to say.

I believe that no power is bigger than your love and trust.I try my best not to talk to you in an emotional way but sentiments overwhelm me after seeing you all,” Bommai said in a choking manner.Noting that there was a huge responsibility on his shoulders to plan a comprehensive development of the state and to respond to the demands and requests of every community.The Chief Minister said, “he always kept his conscience awake every moment and in his every deed”.Bommai took over as Chief Minister on July 28 after B S Yediyurappa resigned on the day he completed two years in office.

19-12-2021||Panaji||Goa would have been liberated earlier had Sardar Patel lived longer: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said Goa would have been liberated from Portuguese rule much earlier had Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel lived for some more time.Modi was speaking at an event to celebrate Goa Liberation Day, observed on December 19 every year to mark the day Indian armed forces freed the coastal state from Portuguese rule in 1961.Had Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel been alive for a little more time, Goa would have been liberated earlier, Modi said.Patel, deputy PM in the Nehru cabinet, died on December 15, 1950. He is credited with the liberation of Marathwada region in Maharashtra from erstwhile Nizam’s rule.On his recent visit to Rome, Modi said, “Some time ago, I went to Italy and the Vatican City. There I also had the opportunity to meet Pope Francis. I invited him to visit India, to which Pope Francis said, “This is the greatest gift you have given me. This is his love for India’s diversity, our radiant democracy.”Modi lauded freedom fighters, including those from outside Goa, who fought for the state’s freedom. When India got Independence, they still continued the fight to liberate Goa, he added.“They ensured that the struggle to liberate Goa did not end after India’s independence,” he said.Modi also congratulated the Goa government for topping in various parameters of good governance.The state has topped on parameters like per capita income, exclusive toilet facility for girls in schools, tap water in every household, door to door waste collection, and food security, he said.Modi remembered former Goa chief minister late Manohar Parrikar, saying he had understood the potential of the state and nurtured it for welfare of the people.Parrikar, who was the defence minister during the first term of the Narendra Modi government, died on March 17, 2019 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.During the Liberation Day event, Modi felicitated freedom fighters and veterans of Operation Vijay operation undertaken by the Indian military to liberate Goa.Modi said Goa came under Portugal rule when a major part of the country was ruled by Mughals, but centuries later, neither has Goa forgotten its Indianness, nor has India forgotten Goa.The PM, who reached here this afternoon to participate in the celebrations marking 60 years of the coastal state’s liberation from Portuguese rule, also witnessed a fly past and sail parade at Miramar.Modi inaugurated multiple development projects, including the renovated Fort Aguada jail museum, super specialty block at the Goa Medical College and new South Goa district hospital.The super specialty block at the Goa Medical College and Hospital has been constructed at a cost of over Rs 380 crore under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana’ scheme.The new South Goa district hospital, built at a cost of around Rs 220 crore, is equipped with modern medical infrastructure, including OPD services in 33 specialties, latest diagnostic and laboratory facilities and services like physiotherapy and audiometry.The re-development of the Aguada Fort jail museum as a heritage tourism destination under the ‘Swadesh Darshan Scheme’ has been done at a cost of over Rs 28 crore. Before Goa’s liberation, the Aguada Fort was used to incarcerate and torture freedom fighters.The museum will highlight the contributions and sacrifices made by prominent freedom fighters who fought for the liberation of Goa and will be a befitting tribute to them.Modi also inaugurated an aviation skill development centre at the Mopa airport and a gas insulated substation at Dabolim-Navelim in Margao. He laid the foundation stone for the India International University of Legal Education and Research of the Bar Council of India Trust at Goa.He also released a Special Cover and Special Cancellation to mark the commemoration of Indian armed forces freeing Goa from Portuguese rule.Modi’s visit to the coastal state came ahead of Goa Assembly elections scheduled early next year and the ruling BJP’s attempts to ward off challenge by new entrant TMC and other parties.

This ‘anupyogi’ chief minister himself listens to the recordings of some people every evening,” Yadav alleged.He also asked reporters to “remain alert, if you are speaking to me”. The entire country knows that whenever the BJP is about to lose an election in any state, the frequency of the misuse of various enforcement agencies by the BJP rises, alleged UP’s former Chief Minister Yadav.“The BJP is following the Congress’ way. Like the Congress, it is rearing to use the central agencies to instil fear (rival among political parties),” said Yadav.“Seeing the atmosphere in the state, I can say that the Yogi government will not last. The people have made up their mind for a ‘yogya’ (able) government,” said Yadav.“No government could be more ‘anupyogi’ (useless) than this government, It has ruined Uttar Pradesh,” he asserted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-getting-my-telephones-tapped-akhilesh-yadav-352136

The committee would like CBI to state its opinion regarding the same,” said the report tabled in parliament on December 10.The assertion was made by the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice, headed by BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, in its report titled 'Action taken on one-hundred sixth report of the Committee on demands for grants (2021-22) pertaining to the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions'.The panel, had in its earlier report, said that the CBI was in grave need of cadre restructuring and recommended to the government to undertake it at the earliest.In its action taken report, the personnel ministry informed that approved cadre strength of CBI in all ranks is 7,273 and the strength of this bureau has been increased at various occasions, but overall re-structuring in a holistic manner has never taken place. “With regard to increase in manpower in CBI is concerned, it is mentioned that a proposal for cadre review/restructuring of CBI is already under consideration in consultation with CBI for creation of 734 additional posts in different ranks,” it said.It stated that departmental CBI officers play a very important role in investigations, but at the same time, officers on deputation from states/central police organisations/central armed police forces/banks, among others, at various levels bring fresh and new ideas based on their experience in different fields. The ministry pointed out that the deputation reserve has been reduced at various levels. “In case, only direct recruitment quota is prescribed for various technical posts of CBI, it will affect career progression of staff due to limited number of posts available in hierarchy,” the report said.To which, the panel observed that the CBI has apprised it that there are as many as 822 vacancies in executive ranks, 88 vacancies for law officer, 97 vacancies for technical officer, as on January 31, 2021. “The committee recommends CBI to prepare a roadmap as to how and by when it plans to fill up such a large number of vacancies. The Committee also hopes that cadre restructuring exercise is initiated soon,” the report said.  Referring to its earlier report, the panel had recommended the Personnel Ministry to provide adequate funds to CVC for strengthening surveillance capabilities and for setting up a centralized surveillance database as it believed that increased surveillance would lead to better vigilance. The ministry said additional requirement of funds, if any, to cater to the needs of CVC, will be taken up with the Finance Ministry at the supplementary/ revised estimates 2021-22 stage.“The committee notes the reply of the ministry and hopes that adequate funds should be provided to CVC for strengthening surveillance capabilities and for setting up a centralised surveillance database,” the report added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-panel-seeks-cbis-view-on-need-for-new-law-to-define-its-mandate-vest-more-powers-352111
19-12-2021||New Delhi||Electoral bonds: CIC dismisses appeal seeking disclosure of reports submitted by SBI to Centre, RBI||Central Information Commission dismissed an appeal seeking disclosure of reports submitted by State Bank of India to the Centre and Reserve Bank of India, regarding sale and encashment of electoral bonds in 2018 which are withheld by SBI on grounds of personal information held in fiduciary capacity. Nearly, three years after an appeal was filed with the Central Information Commission (CIC), the highest adjudicator of RTI matters, Information Commissioner Suresh Chandra noted that there appears to be “no public interest” in further prolonging the matter as there is no substance in the appeal calling for intervention by the Commission.“The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case, hearing both the parties and perusal of records, feels that due information has been given to the appellant,” he said.The case pertains to an RTI application filed by activist Venkatesh Nayak seeking denomination-wise details of electoral bonds sold by State Bank of India (SBI) in March and April 2018, total number of buyers, application forms submitted for buying the bonds, reports submitted by SBI to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government on sale and encashment of bonds, in his eight pointer application.The SBI provided the data on electoral bonds sale through various branches, but did not give details on application forms submitted for purchase of the bonds and the reports submitted by the bank to RBI and the government, citing two exemption clauses—information being held in fiduciary capacity and information being personal in nature—to deny the information.Nayak approached the CIC in 2018 with his appeal against the SBI’s denial of information.He argued that the Electoral Bonds Scheme, 2018, was not a legislation duly enacted by Parliament or any state legislature.It was merely an instrument brought into existence by the Government of India in exercise of the powers conferred on it by subsection(3) of Section 31 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934), he said.He cited the reply of the SBI on his query on the methodology applied by the bank to ascertain whether or not a political party redeeming electoral bonds with any of authorised branches had secured at least one per cent of the votes polled during the last round of general elections, as required under the electoral bond scheme.The SBI had said it referred to Election Commission of India (ECI) website to prepare the list based on votes polled for the party in last election.Nayak, in between, had also filed another RTI application before ECI which said they do not compile such information.He alleged that the reply given by the SBI was misleading.“The appellant (Nayak) reiterated that there were sufficient public interest grounds to require the disclosure of the information, to ensure transparency of action in order to make the government and its instrumentalities  accountable to the governed,” Chandra noted in his order.After three hearings, Information Commissioner Chandra agreed with the SBI, saying the bank emphasised that the Supreme Court had already seized of the matter relating to the electoral bond scheme and had refused to stay the said scheme vide their order dated March 26, 2021, and since there were no specific directions to make the information public, the said scheme continued to be valid and continued to cast an obligation and duty on the respondent to maintain confidentiality and not to disclose information with respect to contested points of the application.“The authorities have claimed exemption by virtue of the provisions under section 8(1)(e) (fiduciary) and (j) (personal) of the RTI Act. The claim of the respondent has been buttressed by the law laid down by the Supreme Court in K S Puttaswamy case,” Chandra said while dismissing the appeal.

The proceeds from the show were supposed to be donated to late Kannada star Puneeth Rajkumar's charitable organisation.Faruqui also claimed that 12 of his shows were called off in the last two months because of the threats to the venue and audiences."My name is Munawar Faruqui. And that's been my time, you guys were (a) wonderful audience. Good bye, I'm done," he had tweeted.A few days later, stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra, a vocal critic of the government, also said his shows, scheduled to be held in Bengaluru, were cancelled after the organisers received threats.Earlier this year, Faruqui had spent a month in jail at Indore after a BJP MLA's son lodged an FIR in January accusing the comedian of hurting religious sentiments through his show. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/munawar-faruqui-announces-new-show-to-perform-in-kolkata-352108

19-12-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata MC polls: Sporadic violence mars polls, voter turnout 63.63 pc||Sporadic incidents of violence, including hurling of bombs at two booths and skirmishes between political workers, marred an otherwise humdrum polling to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) as 63.63 per cent of the nearly 40.5 lakh voters exercised their franchise till 5 pm on Sunday, when voting ended.While the State Election Commission and the police described the elections as “peaceful”, the opposition BJP demanded cancellation of the “violence-marred polls”.Two incidents of hurling of crude bombs were reported in Kolkata’s Sealdah and Khanna areas. Police contingents were rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control.“A total of 63.63 per cent of total votes were polled till 5 pm. Polling has by and large been peaceful barring a few incidents,” State Election Commissioner Sourav Das said.The final voter turnout will be available on Monday as there were still people in queue to vote at 5 pm when the polls ended, SEC officials said.Although the SEC claimed that only one person was injured, police said three people were injured in the bomb attacks, one of them losing a leg.Police said that 72 people had been arrested for disturbing the peace during the polling period.Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said if any ruling party leader was found involved in violence during the polls, strict action would be taken “within 24 hours”.“We don’t support any form of violence, and strict action will be taken within 24 hours if any TMC leader is found to be stopping the process of free and fair polls. I would request the media to come out with related footage and evidence (if available),” he told reporters after casting his vote.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed her happiness over people taking part in the “festival of democracy.”“People are voting as if a festival is going on. In a democracy, an election is a mass festival. So people are voting, we are happy about it,” she said.Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said that his security personnel stayed outside the booth when he went to cast his vote during the polls in adherence to an order of the state election commissioner.He said peaceful polling with no fear in voters’ minds and the absence of interference of the state apparatus is at the heart of any election process.“My security personnel adhered to the order issued on Saturday night… State Election Commissioner Sourav Das allowed the facility to only two persons—Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee,” he said.“I had called Sourav Das twice and tried to impress upon him that polling should be held peacefully and without fear, and the administration should not interfere in any manner in this,” Dhankhar said.The opposition BJP and the CPI(M) alleged that the TMC has forcibly stopped opposition booth agents from entering polling centres in several wards, a charge that the ruling party termed as “baseless”.CPI(M) activists staged a road blockade in Bagha Jatin area, alleging that their polling agents were not allowed inside the booths.The BJP state leadership announced that it would conduct peaceful demonstrations against “violence and malpractices” in the polls.Leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari who led a delegation of BJP MLAs to meet Governor Dhankar, demanded “cancellation of the entire poll process” as the election has been turned into a farce by the ruling dispensation.Former Kolkata mayor and senior TMC leader Firhad Hakim dismissed the allegations as “baseless and politically motivated”.“The BJP knows they will face defeat in the elections. So, they are now making such excuses. The elections have been very peaceful, barring few small incidents,” he said.Before this, high drama was witnessed outside a Salt Lake area residence where Adhikari was holding a meeting with party MLAs, after the Bidhannagar city police cordoned off the entire area and stopped him from leaving for Raj Bhawan, where he was scheduled to meet the Governor.“The police of this TMC government didn’t allow me to leave. We were illegally kept under house arrest. I condemn it. Later they allowed,” he said.Reacting to allegations, Hakim said, “none of these leaders are residents of Kolkata. So they will not be allowed in the city as per the rules on a polling day.”He said the BJP is falsely claiming the opposition leader, and 20 others are under house arrest. Some BJP MLAs also claimed that the gates of the MLA hostel in Kolkata were locked.“We will stage peaceful sit-in demonstrations across the state against the ongoing violence (in the KMC polls). The way looting of votes took place with the active help of state administration is shameful for our democracy. This is the reason we had asked for central forces to ensure free and fair polls,” BJP state spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said.Echoing the BJP’s allegations on violence, Left Front Chairman Biman Bose said the Left would organize a two-day long demonstration across the state from Monday.In ward no. 22, BJP’s sitting councillor and former deputy mayor of Kolkata, Mina Devi Purohit, alleged that she was attacked by TMC activists, which the ruling party denied.In ward no. 45, Congress alleged the TMC has brought in fake voters and a scuffle ensued between workers of both the parties.The grand old party alleged that Amitabha Chakraborti, the election agent of Congress councillor Santosh Pathak, was beaten up by TMC activists inside the booth.In the Jain School booth of the ward, clashes were reported between TMC and Congress activists inside the booth. The police later brought the situation under control.The TMC, during the run-up to the KMC polls, had warned party candidates against using force during the civic polls and said that those found to be involved in violence would be thrown out of the party.Meanwhile, In an attack on a section of state BJP leadership, party’s Rajya Sabha MP Rupa Ganguly on Sunday said there could be some truth behind rival charges that “money changed hands” while fielding some candidates from her own party for the Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls.Voting began at 7 AM in 4,949 polling centres, strictly adhering to COVID-19 protocols amid tight security. A total of 40,48,357 voters are eligible to exercise their franchise to seal the fate of 950 candidates in the fray.The SEC has declared 1,139 of the 4,949 polling centres as “sensitive”.A total of 23,500 Kolkata Police personnel have been deployed across the city, and route marches and area domination exercises were conducted in various parts of the metropolis, an officer of the force said.He said that more than 200 police pickets have also been set up at crucial points across the city.The ruling Trinamool Congress is fighting to retain the civic board for the third consecutive term, while the BJP will contest CPI(M) to secure the second position. The TMC had swept all the 16 assembly segments in the metropolis in this year’s assembly elections.The counting of votes will take place on December 21.

You taught me politics when I first won from Amethi in the 2004 elections. I went to the Lok Sabha because you showered your love on me. Our relationship is one of family, one of truth and will never end,” Gandhi said. He was accompanied by sister and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who also addressed the people of the area.At an anti-inflation rally, Rahul said the Congress ensured several development workers in Amethi, including a road network and bringing factories like HAL, BHEL, Rafale unit and IIT.You’re my familyYou are my family. I went to the LS because you showered your love on me. Our relationship is one of family, one of truth and will never end. Rahul Gandhi, Congress leaderRepeating his Hindu versus Hindutvavadi narrative, he attacked PM Narendra Modi and accused him of lying to the people on various issues.“The PM comes here and makes false promises. That is because he had a political relationship with you. I do not need to lie because we have family ties. A Hindu is one who walks the path of truth like Mahatma Gandhi. A Hindu is one who is never scared. On the other hand, a Hindutvavadi like Nathuram Godse is afraid to suffer,” he said.“Modi said he would ensure jobs for the youth. Was that a lie or a truth? So is the PM a HIndu or Hindutvavadi? The PM asked everyone to clang utensils. Did Covid end after that? So, was he lying or telling the truth? He said three farm laws were beneficial for the farmers, but farmers stood united against him saying the laws were black. Was the PM lying or speaking the truth? Hindu or Hindutvavadi?” he said.He also recalled the days when, as a child, he would accompany his father Rajiv Gandhi to Amethi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ties-with-amethi-will-never-end-says-rahul-gandhi-351905

World Health Organisation“Countries can and must prevent the spread of Omicron with the proven health and social measures. Our focus must continue to be to protect the least protected and those at high risk,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region.The overall threat posed by Omicron largely depends on three key questions — its transmissibility; how well the vaccines and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection protect against it, and how virulent the variant is as compared to other variants.“From what we know so far, Omicron appears to spread faster than the Delta variant which has been attributed to the surge in cases across the world in the last several months,” she said.Emerging data from South Africa suggests increased risk of re-infection with Omicron, she said, adding that there was still limited data on the clinical severity associated with Omicron. “Further information is needed to fully understand the variant. It should not be dismissed as mild,” she said, adding that even if it does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm health systems.Variant tally 126||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scale-up-health-social-measures-to-prevent-spread-of-omicron-world-health-organisation-351901

The accused, Bharat Bhushan Kataria (47), was arrested on Friday, the police said.According to Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana, Kataria, a senior scientist at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), entered the court premises at 9.33 am on the day of the incident with two bags and left one of those behind inside courtroom number 102. The accused left the court premises at 10.35 am.Kataria had planted the IED in a tiffin box and left the bag containing the tiffin box inside the courtroom as he wanted to kill his neighbour, who is a lawyer, police said.“Both the parties had lodged several cases against each other. They live in the same building. Prima facie, it seems that Kataria had a grudge against the lawyer,” a senior police officer said.The lawyer lives on the ground floor of the building while the accused lives on the third floor. Five civil cases were filed by Kataria against the lawyer, while the latter had filed seven civil cases against the accused, the police said. Teams from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) and the National Security Guard (NSG) had visited the site of the explosion and it was found that the materials used in making the IED were easily available in the market.

Since Election Commission of India (ECI) has the necessary expertise and mandate regarding electoral rolls and in the light of the previous letters of the CEC addressed to the Law Minister, the Secretary (Legislative Department) thought it appropriate to invite officials of the commission to this meeting,” the statement read.The letter by the Legislative Department was addressed to the Secretary and the final operative paragraph of the letter also requested secretary, ECI, to attend the meeting, it added.“After receipt of the letter by the ECI, the CEC spoke to the secretary, Legislative Department, expressing his displeasure over the expression in the middle part of the letter, which gave an impression that it was expected of the CEC to attend the meeting. The Secretary, Legislative Department, clarified that the letter was for secretary or a representative of the CEC familiar with the subject to attend the meeting,” the statement further read.The November 16 meeting was to finalise the Cabinet note on some of the reforms and it was held virtually, it added.“The subsequent interaction with the CEC and two Election Commissioners was an informal one and meant for ironing out two or three aspects for the final proposal,” the ministry said.However, for the past two days, the Opposition has been hitting out at the government, claiming that by “summoning” the CEC to the PMO, the government had “undermined the autonomy of the poll panel”. The Congress is likely to move a notice on Monday for adjournment of proceedings in the Lok Sabha over the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/row-over-meet-letter-was-not-for-chief-election-commissioner-clarifies-govt-351896

The agenda of the OIC meet is aid for Afghanistan.The New Delhi meeting of the Central Asian Foreign Ministers with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as the host will cover a wider palette. It will also firm up the invitation to the leaders of the five countries as Guests of Honour for the Republic Day parade.On Afghanistan, they are likely to pick up the threads of the November 10 meeting of NSAs hosted by Ajit Doval which was attended by his counterparts from all five Central Asian countries, Iran and Russia. The focus would be more on the terror overspill and drug trafficking from Afghanistan.A US report on terrorism released on Friday corroborated India’s apprehensions of terrorism from Af-Pak territory. It noted that many terrorist groups with regional or transnational ambitions continued to operate freely from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, whose diaspora extends into Afghanistan, are unhappy with the rough treatment given to Afghan leaders sharing their ethnicity. Their interest in having a representative government intersects with that of India.They will also discuss connectivity which is of vital interest to them as most of these countries are double-landlocked. Also, India wants to expand cooperation with the energy-rich Central Asian nations that have oil, gas and uranium reserves and other rare metals.All Foreign Ministers — Mukhtar Tileuberdi (Kazakhstan), Sirojiddin Muhriddin (Tajikistan), Ruslan Kazakbaev (Kyrgyzstan), Abdulaziz Kamilov (Uzbekistan) and Rashid Meredov (Turkmenistan) — have arrived for the third edition of India’s dialogue with the five Central Asian countries.

Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterReferring to regional geopolitical developments, he said God had given India some neighbours who did not feel good seeing its growth and that the one born out of Partition was becoming weak worrying about India’s development.In an address at the annual convention of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), he said most of the countries in the world, including the US, Russia and France, were friends of India.In this context, he said India, at the same time, made it clear to them that the military hardware required by the Indian armed forces would have to be produced in the country. “We have told every friendly country that we want to produce the military platforms, weapons and ammunition in India itself keeping in mind the security of the country,” he said. “We have conveyed this message to the US, Russia, France and others as well and we do not hesitate to communicate this message,” he added. The Defence Minister said the message to the countries producing military equipment has been that “Come make in India, come make for India and come make for the world”.He said the government’s vision was to make India a global defence manufacturing hub. “India cannot depend on other countries for defence technologies due to its stature, geographical location and the security challenges it faces,” he said.“Our aim is not to attack anyone, but prepare our armed forces to be ready at all times to give a befitting reply to the country’s enemies,” he said.

These are part of the larger military history project of “Stories from the battlefield”.This brings alive some of the most important battles on the 1971 campaign. It is perhaps the first time that stories from the Army, Navy and the Air Force are being brought together and narrated by officers who commanded squadrons or companies. They drove the tanks, flew jets and helicopters and did hand-to-hand combat.The ‘Brains Trust India’, in association with the British High Commission, has produced these dozen videos, which are in a documentary format. Each video takes up a specific battle, says Subroto Chattopadhyay, Chairman of the Peninsula Studios.“I am not a military historian and these episodes narrated by the officers are minus the rhetoric and hyperbole and are simple war stories embellished with maps, pictures and information. Only facts, no edges,” Chattopadhyay said.The series covers the entire spectrum of conflict. It narrates how the 20 Squadron of the Indian Air Force — then based at Pathankot — and commanded by Wing Commander Cecil Parker carried out audacious raids deep inside west Pakistan, including one over Peshawar.One of his pilots was a naval aviator on an exchange programme with the IAF, who later rose to be the Naval Chief Admiral Arun Prakash. He narrates his experience of the 20 Squadron IAF 1971.On the Eastern flank is the role of the 28 Squadron, led by Wing Commander BK Bishnoi, and how it cratered the airfield at Dhaka.Lt Gen SS Mehta dwells on the larger issues of the war, humanism over barbarism, liberation over occupation, democracy over military rule, manoeuver over attrition in his episode of ‘Just and Unjust Wars’. Great commanders like Lt Gen Sagat Singh, Major Gen Ben Gonsalves, Group Capt Chandan Singh and several others we tend forget come to life through these stories.Another documentary touches on the crossing the River Meghna in eastern flank of Bangladesh, narrated by Major Chandarkant. The special heliborne operations across the Meghna have been narrated by Air Commodore R M Sridharan of 110 helicopter unit.Rear Admiral SK Gupta narrates the operations of the INS Vikrant in the Bay Of Bengal, he commanded the 300 squadron flying Sea Hawkes. Vice Admiral Anup Singh narrates the Indian Navy's Finest hour, on both fronts.Capture of Fortress at Sylhet by 8 Mountain Division is narrated by Lt Gen Mohinder Puri. Colonel Ashok Tara narrates how the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman was rescued. Maj Gen Ian Cardozo narrates multiple stories – India’s last khukri attack; Param Vir Chakra winners and Indian Naval Battles.Lt. Gen. Satish Nambiar narrates the Battle of Jamalpur coming down from Tura as a part of 101 Comms Zone. Finally Ambassador Asoke Mukerji India’s former Permanent Representative to the UN takes us into the UNSC where the diplomats navigated a minefield to ensure a UN mandated ceasefire did not trip up Indian military’s objectives. Interestingly there are 3 episodes on military strategy by General Sir Nick Carter the former CDS of the UK and Admiral Tony Radakin the current incumbent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/battles-of-1971-come-alive-in-documentaries-350859
