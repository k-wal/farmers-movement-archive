Legal guarantee of MSP, withdrawal of Electricity Amendments Bill, removal of the clause of penalty on the farmers from the air pollution bill...withdrawal of fake cases imposed on farmers and rehabilitation of martyr families, and issues like martyr memorial etc. remain unresolved. These issues will influence Mission UP and Uttarakhand,” it said in the statement.The SKM added that farm organisations across the country celebrated the Maha Parinirvana Diwas of Babasaheb Ambedkar and took an oath to protect the Constitution.It also thanked the people residing near the borders of Delhi, who have continuously supported the farm movement since November 26, 2020.On November 29, a Bill was passed in Parliament to repeal the three contentious farm laws, one of the main demands of the protesting farmers.But the stalemate continues with the protesters demanding that the government fulfil their other demands too. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yet-to-receive-any-communication-from-govt-future-course-of-action-to-be-decided-on-tuesday-skm-347039

It was brought to Delhi, some years after Independence, according to railway experts.The vintage locomotive was removed from the Rail Bhawan premises in the early hours. During day time, many passers-by were caught by surprise, to see the old steam beauty gone from the site.           A spokesperson of the Indian Railways said the heritage locomotive in Rail Bhawan premises was removed in the early hour and shifted to the National Rail Museum in Chanakyapuri, in order to “make it more accessible” to the general public.“Very few people could see it here at the Rail Bhawan, because entry is restricted. At the National Rail Museum, it will be accessible to more people. That was the idea behind the decision. It will be replaced by a replica that will represent the Vande Bharat train,” the spokesperson said.The replica model will symbolically showcase Vande Bharat, India’s first indigenously-made train.Sources, however, indicate that the move is a way to show the robust growth of the Indian Railways, by replacing a heritage locomotive with a modern, state-of-the-art coach, symbolising the railways’ move towards next generation trainsets.The Indian Railways began its journey in 1853, with its first-ever ride between Bombay now Mumbai) and Thana.The Vande Bharat Express - India’s first semi-high speed train - had begun its first commercial run in February 2019.The Shatabdi-type semi-high speed trains have amenities like onboard infotainment, GPS-based passenger information system, CCTV cameras, automatic sliding doors with retractable coach footsteps and zero discharge vacuum-based bio-toilets.Railways plans to have a “selfie-point” at the site of the new replica, where visitors can take photographs of the train model without entering the restricted premises, officials said.The move to shift the heritage steam engine has, however, upset many railway enthusiasts in the country.“Steam engines ruled the roost globally for about 100 years, and more than a century in India. The charm, the joy, the sights and sounds can never be matched even by a maglev (bullet trains). And, it is unfortunate that such a beautiful piece of railways heritage has been removed from the Rail Bhawan site, the nerve centre of the Indian Railways, and from the sight of common man, at a prominent place in the heart of the national capital,” lamented J L Singh, Secretary, Rail Enthusiasts’ Society.He said, members of the Rail Enthusiasts’ Society and many other rail aficionados are upset by this move.A former senior official of the Indian Railways, who did wish to be named, also said, that the “DHR steam beauty should nkt have been shifted out”.“Indian Railways has evolved as our nation has. But, steam is our roots, that’s how we began the journey of railways in India or elsewhere. And, it’s not a good move to take an iconic piece of rail heritage away, and add it among the many catalogues of exhibits at a museum. A replica of Vande Bharat could have been added in the campus, without shifting the heritage loco,” he said.The loco no. 799 was built by North British Loco Co., Glasgow, and was the 46th engine of the DHR. So much history rode on its wheels. And, old and new could have co-existed in the Rail Bhawan premises, the former official said.Currently, a heritage loco built by Dick Kerr & Co. Ltd of London, in 1910, is displayed right outside the premises of Baroda House, the headquarters of the Northern Railways Zone, in New Delhi, he said.

The truth is the next one could be worse. It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both,” Prof. Gilbert said.“We cannot allow a situation where we have gone through all we have gone through, and then find that the enormous economic losses we have sustained mean that there is still no funding for pandemic preparedness. The advances we have made, and the knowledge we have gained, must not be lost,” she said.Speaking about the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, she said its spike protein contained mutations known to increase the transmissibility of the virus.“But there are additional changes that may mean antibodies induced by the vaccines, or by infection with other variants, may be less effective at preventing infection with Omicron. Until we know more, we should be cautious, and take steps to slow down the spread of this new variant,” she said.“But as we have seen before, reduced protection against infection and mild disease does not necessarily mean reduced protection against severe disease and death,” she added.Before COVID-19, Gilbert worked on vaccines for more than 10 years, using antigens from malaria and influenza. The 59-year-old expert was delivering the BBC’s 44th Richard Dimbleby Lecture, named in honour of a veteran British journalist and broadcaster and delivered annually by distinguished speakers.On Sunday, the UK reported another 86 cases of the new Omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, taking its Omicron tally to 246.Meanwhile, a total of 43,992 COVID cases and 54 deaths were recorded as part of the daily UK government coronavirus tally.

However, while 59.3 per cent of these respondents further opined that the relations between the communities that had got damaged because of the incident were healing with time, 38.8 per cent stated that the Hindu-Muslim relations were permanently damaged and divide continues to exits almost 30 years after the Babri demolition. Only 1.9 per cent of those who participated in the survey said that the incident did not damage Hindu-Muslim relations in the country.A clear manifestation of the impact of the Babri demolition on Hindu-Muslim relations was widespread communal riots that took place in the aftermath of the incident. Religious hatred had engulfed the nation and communal riots in different states claimed more than 1,000 lives.However, in the past few years, the number of serious communal riots has gone down and respondents in the same survey were equally divided on the reasons for the dip in communal violence in the country. While 30.8 per cent of the respondents said that exemplary punishment to rioters by the judiciary is the main reason for the reduced number of communal riots, 36.5 per cent of those, who participated in the survey said that cooler heads from both communities calming down inflamed passions is the prime reason for ebbing the communal violence and 32.7 per cent opined better law and order maintenance by police has brought down the occurrence of such horrific incidents. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/babri-demolition-destroyed-hindu-muslim-relations-347029
06-12-2021||New Delhi||Dowry a social evil, but change has to come from within society, says SC; refers plea to Law Commission||The Supreme Court Monday said dowry is a social evil and there is no doubt about it but change has to come from within the society as to how a woman is treated and how people regard the woman who comes into the family.The top court referred the plea on the issue to the Law Commission and said that there are restraints on the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution to craft remedies which essentially require legislative reforms.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna, while disposing of the PIL said, “A dialogue on considering what measures would support the existing legislation on the subject can be initiated. It is in this backdrop that we are of the view that it may be appropriate if the Law Commission of India considers the issue in all its perspectives. The petitioners are at liberty to submit a note of research and on all relevant aspects for the benefit of the Law Commission”.The bench further said, “Law reforms is a necessity but a change has to come from within the society as to how we treat a woman, how the society regards a woman, who comes into the family, how the social life of a woman is evolved. This concerns the social basic value of a marriage as an institution. This is about a social change, which the reformers have written about and are continuing to do so”.The bench said there is no doubt that dowry is a social evil but the prayers made in the petition, to designate a dowry prohibition officers like done in case of Right to Information Act, this court cannot do it.“The RTI officer is designated under the central legislation. The second prayer is for seeking direction to make jewellery and other properties given during marriages be in the name of women for at least seven years. This is a valid prayer and the legislature will look into it very seriously,” the bench told advocate V K Biju, appearing for petitioner Sabu Sebastian and others.It added that the prayer made in the plea is about constituting curriculum commissions for a proper pre-marriage course, involving legal experts, educationists, and psychologists, so that the couple goes pre-marriage counselling prior to entering the marriage and making this course compulsory for marriage.“You must know that there are some communities in the country which practice this system of counselling. You can make all these suggestions to the law commissions so that it can make appropriate recommendations to the government to strengthen the law,” the bench said.Biju contended that a similar matter is pending before another court and this matter can also be tagged along with that as he is disturbed with the recent incidents happening in Kerala where so much jewellery and gold is being given during marriages.“Children of poor and daily wagers will suffer, if this practice is not stopped,” he said, adding that recently a police officer was suspended for not acting in a dowry case of a doctor and hence court can issue notice on third prayer of curriculum commission.The bench said, “The third prayer is the most difficult one. Whole of India does not reside in Kochi of Kerala or any other cities of Delhi or Kolkata but in villages. You would not find experts in villages for these commissions, and you will have to go to the cities for the pre-marriage course. It will have serious consequences, as a hapless woman from village marriage would not be registered, just because she has not undergone the course.”        The top court said that these are all matters for the legislature to take notice and only it can amend the existing laws to give them more teeth like it was done in the case SC/ST Act.Justice Bopanna said nothing will come out of the notice and the law commission can look into the suggestions and appropriately make the recommendations to the government to strengthen the law.“We are telling you what the better option is. What is important is creating awareness to make people sensitive to these issues. You will be wasting time in the courts after the notice is issued,” Justice Bopanna said, adding that law commission recourse will at least set in motion the process for reforms.The bench noted in its order, invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, that the first and second petitioners - who are social activists - and the third petitioner, who is a lawyer practicing before the Supreme Court, have sought certain concrete directions in order to curb the social evil of dowry.It said the plea highlighted that while Parliament has stepped in by enacting penal provisions, such as Sections 304B and Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code 1860, the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 and the National Commission for Women has been constituted, the wide prevalence of the social evil requires a fresh look to give more teeth to the legislation.The bench added that during the course of the hearing, the Court has indicated that the reliefs which have been sought in the above terms pertain to the realm of legislative policy.

The last date for filing nominations for Maharashtra local body polls is Tuesday.“Without setting up a commission to collect data local government wise, it’s not open to the state election commission to provide for reservation to OBC category. That’s the first step which ought to have been taken,” it said.The order came on a petition challenging an ordinance promulgated by the Maharashtra Governor in September introducing 27 per cent OBC quota in the local body elections and the consequent notifications issued by the state election commission in this regard.Earlier, the top court had in March read down the OBC reservation in the local bodies and asked the state government to set up a dedicated commission for empirical data of OBCs, specifying that the proportion of reservation did not exceed the 50 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-local-body-polls-sc-stays-27-quota-for-obc-candidates-347026

Earlier in the day demands for revocation of the AFSPA had been made by Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma, while the TMC which cancelled a plan to send a team to Nagaland too demanded a roll back of the law which gives emergency powers to security forces.The Nagaland Police on Monday also lodged a murder case against the 21st Para Special Force of the Army for its alleged involvement in firing on the civilians, even as several tribal bodies enforced shutdowns in protest against the action of security forces.Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC have been clamped in Mon town, but the situation is tense, officials said.Meanwhile, confusion prevailed Monday over the death toll in firing by security forces on civilians in Nagaland’s Mon district.The Konyak Union, the apex trial body in the district, had initially claimed that 17 civilians were killed in the firing, but later revised the toll to 14.Police, however, have maintained that 14 civilians were killed in separate incidents of firing on Saturday and Sunday.The first incident in which six civilians were killed, occurred when army personnel mistook coal mine workers returning home in a pick-up van on Saturday evening, to be insurgents belonging to the Yung Aung faction of the banned outfit NSCN(K).As workers failed to reach their homes, local youth and villagers went in search of them and surrounded the army vehicles. In the ensuing melee, one soldier was killed and army vehicles burnt down. Soldiers who fired in self-defence killed another seven civilians.Rioting spilled over into Sunday afternoon when angry mobs vandalised the offices of the Konyak Union and an Assam Rifles camp in the area, setting fire to parts of the camp, police had said.At least one more person was killed, as security forces fired back at attackers.The Nagaland Police filed a suo moto FIR against the 21st Para Special Force of the Army.A case was registered under Sections 302/307/34 of the IPC, relating to murder, attempt to murder and criminal act committed by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all.    In the complaint, Tizit Police Station in the district said, “On December 4 at around 1530 hours, coal mine labourers were returning to their native village Oting from Tiru in a vehicle. On reaching Longkhao between Upper Tiru and Oting, security forces blankly fired at the vehicle without provocation resulting in the killing of many villagers and seriously injuring many others”. It also noted that at the time of the incident, there was no police guide nor did security forces make requisition for guides.“Hence, it is obvious that the intention of security forces is to murder and injure civilians,” the FIR alleged, urging authorities to take necessary action against the culprits.In a sudden move, tribal bodies, civil societies and student bodies on Monday morning imposed shutdowns of different durations ranging from six to 12 hours across the state.The influential Naga Students’ Federation (NSF) has announced five days of mourning, while also asking tribals not to participate in any celebration during the period.Officials said of the 28 injured, the condition of six is stated to be critical and they are undergoing treatment at hospital, officials said.—     PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nagaland-firing-victims-laid-to-rest-chief-minister-neiphiu-rio-joins-demand-for-repeal-of-afspa-347025
06-12-2021||New Delhi||SC suggests mediation to Lalit Modi and his mother for resolving property dispute in family||The Supreme Court on Monday suggested mediation to Lalit Modi and his mother Bina Modi, wife of late industrialist KK Modi, to resolve the long-pending property dispute in the family and asked both the parties to give names of mediators of their choice.The top court was hearing the appeal of Lalit Modi against the judgement of a division bench of the Delhi High Court which had held that the anti-arbitration injunction lawsuit filed by Bina Modi against her son Lalit Modi is maintainable.The lawsuit was earlier filed by Bina Modi seeking to restrain the arbitration proceedings initiated by Lalit Modi in Singapore over the dispute.A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana, after hearing brief arguments from a battery of senior lawyers appearing on both sides, said that ultimately, it was a family dispute over property and money and suggested mediation or arbitration in India to resolve the case.“Harish Salve group (Lalit Modi) is willing to have arbitration. What we feel is that this is a dispute of family members apart from trust etc. There is a provision in the deed also that this can be mediated...this is only a suggestion. We do not compel anybody to agree. Why don’t you agree for mediation or arbitration in India,” suggested the bench which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.“We have no problem”, said senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Bina Modi.“I am pleasantly surprised. We are very happy,” responded Salve who along with senior advocate A M Singhvi represented Lalit Modi.“All right, both sides suggest some names. We choose one name. You can send  the name/names in sealed cover... We will send it for mediation,” the bench said and listed the plea for hearing on December 13.In December last year, the division bench of the high court had held that it has the jurisdiction to decide  Bina Modi’s plea challenging Lalit Modi’s move to initiate arbitration proceedings in Singapore.The division bench had set aside the judgement of a single judge of the high court which had said that it does not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the anti-arbitration injunction suits filed by Lalit Modi’s mother Bina, his sister Charu and brother Samir and they are open to take such pleas before the arbitral tribunal in Singapore.The single judge had said that an anti-arbitration injunction suit does not lie, so the pleas are not maintainable, and dismissed.Bina, Charu and Samir, in two separate suits, contended that there was a trust deed between the family members and the KK Modi family trust matters cannot be settled through arbitration in a foreign country as per Indian laws.They have sought permanent injunction restraining Lalit Modi from prosecuting or continuing with the application for emergency measures and any arbitration proceedings against them in Singapore.The division bench, in its 103-page judgement passed on December 24, 2020, had said the subject dispute ought to have been prime facie adjudicated by the single judge, who had to exercise the jurisdiction vested in the court as all the parties are Indian citizens and situs of immovable assets of the trust is in India.“In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered view that the single judge gravely erred by failing to exercise the jurisdiction vested in the court, which statutorily required him to adjudicate, whether the disputes between the parties, in relation to the trust deed, were per se referable to arbitration.“This, in our respectful view, is tantamount to wrong exercise of jurisdiction by the single judge. The impugned judgment cannot resultantly be sustained..,” the bench had said.The division bench had remanded their two civil suits to the single judge for further proceedings, in accordance with law, from the stage of issuance of summons and directed the registry to list them for hearing.As per the case, the trust deed was executed at London by KK Modi as settlor/ managing trustee and Bina, Lalit, Charu, and Samir as trustees, and in pursuance to oral family settlement recorded between them on February 10, 2006.KK Modi died on November 2, 2019, after which the dispute emerged amongst the trustees.Lalit Modi contended that after the demise of his father, in view of lack of unanimity amongst the trustees regarding sale of trust assets, a sale of all assets of the trust has been triggered and distribution to beneficiaries has to occur within one year thereof, the single judge had noted.His mother and the two siblings contended that on a true construction of the trust deed, no such sale has been triggered. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-suggests-mediation-to-lalit-modi-and-his-mother-for-resolving-property-dispute-in-family-347022

Russia’s “serious concerns over its activity in the Asia-Pacific Region” was conveyed during visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s meetings here on Monday.“We expressed our concern about the activities taking place in this region under the slogan of Indo Pacific strategies where we see non-inclusive blocs,’’ Lavrov told the media after the first India-Russia two plus two talks involving both Defence and Foreign Ministers.The two plus two, he said, focused on developments in the Asia Pacific where over the past few years elements of instability have been accumulating which could undermine the universal framework of cooperation, warned Lavrov.The latest example, he said, is the AUKUS (Australia-US-UK) military grouping. “There are lots of questions on the plans to supply to Australia or make in Australia nuclear-powered submarines. There is a question whether these plans comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) norms and nuclear non proliferation rules. From a regional perspective, to what extent will Australia stick to its obligation of a nuclear-free zone in the southern Pacific,’’ observed Lavrov while pointing out that Australia had signed an agreement to this effect. The ASEAN is also a nuclear weapons free zone, he noted.“So we need to understand how all this comes together regarding the plans to supply nuclear powered submarines to Australia if they go ahead with these plans,’’ he added.On the other hand, Lavrov said Russia had “very reason to believe’’ that India and Iran should be in the Extended Troika on Afghanistan comprising US, Russia, China and Pakistan as New Delhi will contribute to the international efforts to bring about stability. India will also continue to be involved in the Moscow forum of 10 countries which brings together all of Afghanistan’s neighbours and Central Asia.Lavro said Afghanistan was mentioned in the “Asia-Pacific context’’ and both sides agreed that the Taliban must deliver on its commitments to ensure an inclusive government structure, protect human rights and prevent the terrorist threat from spilling over.Lavrov said Russia opposed any US attempt to shift forces to neighbouring countries without achieving their main objective. “Central Asia has emphasised this would be unacceptable just as the idea of pushing Afghan refugees into Central Asia is unacceptable,’’ he said.The two plus two also discussed Syria where both India and Russia had investment projects. “We discussed ways to keep working despite sanctions,’’ he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-must-join-high-table-of-us-china-pakistan-russia-extended-troika-on-afghanistan-lavrov-347016

Lis does not survive for consideration,” said a bench comprising Justices S K Kaul and M M Sundresh in its order while disposing of the appeal filed against the decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.Kishor had resigned as Singh’s principal advisor, saying he was taking “a temporary break from an active role in public life”.He had managed the Congress’ successful campaign in the 2017 polls and devised programmes such as “Punjab Da Captain” and “Coffee with Captain” to drum up support for the party during the polls.The top court was hearing an appeal filed by Labh Singh, a retired boxing coach, and Satinder Singh, an advocate, who had contended that Kishor is an expert in organising elections and is assisting parties in various states.The appeal had stated that the appointment of Kishor as principal advisor to the Chief Minister, in the rank and status of a Cabinet Minister, at the cost of public money is not permissible. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-disposes-of-plea-against-appointment-of-prashant-kishor-as-punjab-cms-principal-advisor-347013
06-12-2021||New Delhi||ED issues fresh summons to actress Jacqueline Fernandez to appear before it on Dec 8||A day after she was stopped from flying abroad, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summoned Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez to appear before it for questioning in a money laundering investigation against alleged conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar and others, officials said on Monday.The 36-year-old actor has been asked to depose before the agency here on Wednesday (December 8), answer questions and get her statement recorded, they said.Fernandez has been questioned by the ED in this case at least twice and the agency suspects she is a “beneficiary of the proceeds of crime” allegedly generated by Chandrashekhar.Her spokesperson had earlier said she was testifying before the agency as a witness.“Jacqueline Fernandez is being called to testify as a witness by the ED. She has duly recorded her statements and in future will also be completely cooperating with the agency in the investigations.“Jacqueline also categorically denies alleged slanderous statements made about relationship with the involved couple,” the spokesperson had said in a statement in October.Fernandez was stopped by the immigration authorities at the Mumbai airport on Sunday, acting on a Look Out Circular (LoC) issued by the ED against her.Agency sleuths later reached the airport and disallowed her travel, asking her to remain in the country as she may be required to join the probe.She was supposed to take a flight to Muscat, Oman.The Sri Lankan-origin actor has been questioned by the ED in multiple sessions in connection with the over Rs 200-crore money laundering case being probed against Chandrashekhar and his actor wife Leena Maria Paul.The agency last week also filed a charge sheet before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in this case and named Chandrashekhar, his wife and six others.It had alleged in the charge sheet that Chandrashekhar had gifted Fernandez numerous costly gifts, including some Persian cats and a horse. He is accused of cheating some people, including some high-profile individuals like former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh’s wife Aditi Singh.Another Bollywood actor-dancer Nora Fatehi has also been grilled by the ED in this case.Investigation found that Chandrashekhar was lodged in the Rohini jail here when he allegedly ran an extortion racket using phone spoofing technology, according to officials.The ED had arrested the couple and two co-accused, Pradeep Ramnani and Deepak Ramnani, in this case.In August, the agency raided some of Chandrashekhar’s premises and seized a sea-facing bungalow in Chennai, Rs 82.5 lakh in cash and over a dozen luxury cars.It had claimed in a statement that Chandrashekhar is a “known conman” and is being probed by the Delhi Police in a case of alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating and extortion to the tune of about Rs 200 crore.“Chandrasekhar is the mastermind of this fraud. He has been part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him...,” the ED had said.Despite being in the jail, it said, Chandrashekhar “did not stop conning” people.“He (using a cellphone procured illegally in prison) with the help of technology made spoofed calls to dupe people as the numbers displayed on the called party’s phone number belonged to senior government officers.“While speaking (from prison) to these persons, he claimed to be a government officer offering to help people for a price,” the ED had claimed.Chandrasekhar and Paul were also arrested by the Delhi Police.The police recently invoked the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in the case.The Delhi Police had alleged that Paul and Chandrashekhar, along with others, used Hawala routes, created shell companies to park the money earned from proceeds of crime.

He will also be inaugurating the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi on December 13, which is being seen as yet another reinforcement of the saffron party’s ideological (Hindutva) and cultural commitments by observers. Maurya, who is believed to be in direct competition with Adityanath over chief ministership of the key poll-bound state, was accused of polarising voters for his tweet on “temple in Mathura” and the observation that “poor law and order situation in the state earlier was due to people in skull caps who threatened traders, among others.Following the announcement of plans by certain right-wing groups to install a Krishna idol in Mathura’s Shahi Idgah on the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition, Maurya had said that preparations are underway for the construction of a grand temple in Mathura on the lines of Ayodhya and Varanasi.  “Ayodhya aur Kashi bhavya mandir nirman jaari hai, Mathura ki tayyari hai (grand temples are being constructed in Ayodhya and Kashi and Mathura will be next)”, Maurya had tweeted. The Shahi Idgah located next to the Krishna janmabhoomi has been at the centre of a legal battle for years with Hindu groups claiming that the mosque was built on land where Lord Krishna was born. Following the announcement by right-wing groups, security was ramped up in the Mathura today, the anniversary of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-deputy-cm-keshav-prasad-maurya-meets-prime-minister-narendra-modi-in-parliament-347008
06-12-2021||New Delhi||Nagaland firing incident: Left parties slam Centre, demand repeal of AFSPA||The Left parties on Monday hit out at the Union government over the killing of 14 civilians by security forces in Nagaland’s Mon district and demanded the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.Security forces opened fire on civilians killing 14 and injuring 11 more in Nagaland’s Mon district in three consecutive episodes, the first of which was a case of mistaken identity, police said on Sunday. One soldier also died in rioting which followed.“The CPI(M) strongly condemns the botched operation by the Army in Mon district of Nagaland that led to the killing of, at least, 17 civilians and one soldier,” the party said in a statement.“The explanation given by the Army that these ghastly killings happened due to an ‘intelligence failure’ does not explain how such an ambush blunder occurred. A thorough investigation must be speedily conducted and the guilty punished,” it said and demanded compensation for the victims.CPI MP Binoy Viswam has lashed out against Home Minister Amit Shah for the deaths.“Under BJP rule, human lives have no value. They can be shot dead by the military and paramilitary forces as they like. Nagaland is the latest. Guns decide the fate of Indian democracy. Shame on Amit Shah,” he tweeted.In a statement, the CPI demanded an impartial inquiry into the entire incident.It said the government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah should be responsible for the “lack of transparency” surrounding the issue of Nagaland and Naga talks.“The political and social turmoil that prevails in the Northeast also demands the repeal of Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) from Statute Book, as it is evident that AFSPA has failed in restoring normalcy in the region,” the statement said.In his statement in Parliament on Monday, Shah expressed regret over the Nagaland firing incident and said a probe by a Special Investigation Team will be completed within a month while asserting that all agencies must ensure such happenings do not recur while taking action against insurgents. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nagaland-firing-incident-left-parties-slam-centre-demand-repeal-of-afspa-347007
06-12-2021||Mumbai||Omicron: Third Covid wave projected to hit India by February, but may be milder than second||With Omicron, the new variant of SARS-CoV2, the third wave of coronavirus could hit the peak by February with cases likely to be reaching up to 1-1.5 lakh a day in the country, but it will be milder than the second wave, Manindra Agarwal, IIT scientist involved in the mathematical projection of trajectory of COVID-19, said.He said in the new forecast, the new Omicron variant has been factored in.“With the new variant, our current forecast is that the country could see the third wave by February but it will be milder than the second wave. So far we have seen that the severity of Omicron is not like the one seen in the Delta variant,” Agarwal told PTI.He, however, said a close eye is being kept on cases in South Africa where many cases of this variant have been recorded. Agarwal added that as of now South Africa has not seen a rise in hospitalisation.He said a fresh set of data on the virus and hospitalisations would help in getting a more solid picture.“It looks like although the new variant has shown high transmissibility, its severity is not like the one seen in the Delta variant,” Agarwal said.He said as observed during the spread of Delta, a mild lockdown (night curfew, restrictions on crowding) can bring down Beta substantially. That will significantly reduce the peak value, he added.The Department of Science and Technology (DST) backed Sutra-model had earlier said the third wave of coronavirus could hit the country by October if a new variant, more virulent and transmissible than the Delta, emerges.However, till November end, there was no new variant. It had then revised its forecast to November.On November 26, the World Health Organisation (WHO) named the Covid-19 virus variant detected in South Africa and some other countries as Omicron.The WHO has also classified the Omicron variant as a ‘Variant of Concern’.  Experts have expressed possibilities that owing to the genetic modification in the virus, it may possess some specific characteristics.While the transmissibility of infection seems to have increased because of this new variant, there is still not enough clarity on whether or not it will cause severe disease and whether it will evade immunity. More information is expected in the next two weeks’ time or so, it said.India has so far reported 21 cases of the Omicron variant, including 17 on Sunday- nine persons from Rajasthan capital Jaipur, seven in Maharashtra’s Pune district and a fully vaccinated man who arrived in Delhi from Tanzania.

The Congress hopes to strengthen its presence among the Hindus of Punjab with the Aam Aadmi Party wooing them actively.Out of the 80 MLAs the Congress has, 13 are Hindus, the highest for all parties.The Congress realises it must hold on to this segment to register a strong win in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-forms-punjab-poll-panels-ambika-soni-to-head-coordination-sunil-jakhar-is-campaign-chief-346998

06-12-2021||Kolkata||Question mark over AFSPA, Shah has failed to provide security to citizens: TMC on Nagaland killings||The Trinamool Congress on Monday said the killing of 14 civilians by security forces in Nagaland’s Mon district has put a question mark over AFSPA and proved that Union Home Minister Amit Shah has failed to perform his duty of providing security to the citizens of the country.Senior TMC leader Sushmita Dev referred to the Centre’s decision to increase BSF’s jurisdiction and said the killings in Nagaland in the botched anti-insurgency operation proved how things can “go wrong” if the Centre intervenes in the state’s jurisdiction.Dev demanded that the Union Home Minister Amit Shah immediately convene a meeting of chief ministers of the northeastern states and said the problems related to Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) should be resolved through dialogue and “not through domination and interference in the jurisdiction of the states”.“It is imperative that the Centre set up a committee to see if AFSPA is working in this country or not. The killing of civilians Nagaland incident by security forces has put a question mark over the Act. We demand that Amit Shah Ji immediately convene a meeting of all the chief ministers of the northeastern states and discuss the issue of AFSPA. The problems related to AFSPA should be resolved through dialogue and not through domination and interference in the jurisdiction of the states,” Dev said at a press conference here.Hitting out at the Centre, she said “Union Home Minister Amit Shah has completely failed to provide security to the citizens of this country”.Dev, TMC MP, referred to the Centre’s decision in October this year to increase BSF’s jurisdiction up to 50 kms from the border and  said “The Nagaland incident proves how things go wrong if you interfere in the state’s jurisdiction”.The party said on Monday morning said that it will not send its delegation as announced the previous day to Nagaland’s Mon district, where the killings occured, due to the prohibitory orders in force in the area at present.A five-member TMC delegation comprising of MPs Prasun Banerjee, Aparupa Poddar, Santanu Sen and party spokesperson Biswajit Deb besides Dev was scheduled to visit Mon.Announcing the party’s decision to call off the visit for now, Dev said “We came to know at the last moment that prohibitory orders have been clamped in the area.

06-12-2021||New Delhi||Resident doctors of 3 Central hospitals boycott routine, emergency services from Monday||Resident doctors of the Centre-run RML, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge hospitals boycotted all routine and emergency services from Monday in support of a nationwide protest called by the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) against the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling.Amid the protests by the resident doctors, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to stop the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling.Expressing concern over manpower shortage in the health care scenario especially with the impending third wave, and amid detection of cases of Omicron variant, the body said it is disastrous to note the postponement of NEET PG admission in medical colleges.  “This will be resulting in a shortage of almost two batches of post graduates, one appearing for the exam and one batch waiting for admission, resulting in nearly one lakh of the young resident doctors not available to tackle the crises. IMA demands the Government of India to proactively involve in this issue of PG admission and ensure it without further delay—the PG admission should be done on a war footing. It will be too late to tackle the Covid crisis if we postpone the PG admission,” the doctors’ body said.In a letter to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, the FORDA on December 4 had said healthcare institutions across the country are running short of an adequate workforce of resident doctors, with no admission in the current academic year yet.“With the possibility of future Covid-19 pandemic wave looming large, the situation will be disastrous for the healthcare sector with its bearing on the country’s population,” it said.“There seems to be no initiative or measure taken yet for expediting the (NEET-PG) counselling. Therefore, following discussions with various RDA representatives of Delhi, we have decided to escalate our agitation further and withdraw all services (routine and emergency) in healthcare institutions from Monday,” the letter read.As the resident doctors boycotted work, the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) is learnt to have visited the Safdarjung hospital where he appealed to the resident doctors for calling off the protest, but they refused.In an intimation to the hospital administration, the RDA of the Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital on December 4 said resident doctors across the country are on a peaceful protest for almost a week now in view of the delay in the NEET-PG counselling and the admission of first-year junior residents to various hospitals.The RDA had suspended the OPD services from November 27 and the routine services from December 3.“However, we are pained to bring to your notice that we have not received any positive response or concrete action from the Union Ministry of Health and the authorities concerned,” it said.Similar letters have also been written by the RDAs of the Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge (LHMC) hospitals.In its letter to the medical superintendent, the Safdarjung hospital RDA said it continued a symbolic protest in a silent manner after a meeting with the Union health minister on November 27, “respecting the verbal assurance given by him”.“However, as per the notification released on November 30, the Ministry of Social Justice has asked for a period of three weeks to submit its report in the Supreme Court, which is not consistent with the verbal assurance given to us regarding expediting this process,” it said.“Due to non-responsiveness and indifference of the government and the authorities concerned, unfortunately, we are left with no other option than boycotting the emergency services from Monday. The onus of any unfortunate incident arising due to the circumstances affecting the healthcare will be on the authorities concerned,” the RDA said.“As withdrawal of OPD and all routine services did not bring any concrete response from the authorities as was assured to us, so we the residents of LHMC and associated hospitals shall withdraw all services (Routine as well as emergency) from Monday, 6th December, 2021 onwards in support of nationwide protest called by FORDA, India,” LHMC RDA had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/resident-doctors-of-3-central-hospitals-boycott-routine-emergency-services-from-monday-346986
06-12-2021||New Delhi||SC allows police to carry on probe against ex-Mumbai Commissioner of Police Param Bir Singh; restrains it from filing charge sheet||The Supreme Court Monday allowed Mumbai Police to carry on the investigation against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh but restrained it from filing charge sheets on the FIRs against him over the allegations of misconduct and corruption.A bench comprising Justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh also directed the CBI to file its response on the issue whether the probe should be handed over to it.The top court said it was only concerned with the “likelihood of bias”.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, said the FIRs should also be entrusted to the central probe agency and he will file an affidavit regarding the same.Senior advocate Darius Kambatta, appearing for Maharashtra, stated that the Singh’s petition was a service dispute against departmental enquiries, which should be contested before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).The bench then said, “What are your allegations regarding his service etc, that is for you to take. But this is one of the very unfortunate messages”.“The only concern that we should have is, whether in regards to other matter whether the CBI should consider the same or not,” it said.Senior advocate Puneet Bali, appearing for Singh, told the apex court that the Maharashtra government was acting with “mala fide” against the former police commissioner.“After your lordships’ order, I (Singh) have joined the investigation. All non-bailable warrants and proclamations against me have been cancelled.“Then they file a charge sheet in one of the FIRs. That is a complaint filed by a person against whom I took action. Then they suspended me. The state of Maharashtra is trying to scuttle your lordships orders,” Bali said.The top court court noted the submissions and  allowed the Mumbai police to carry on investigation and restrained it from filing charge sheet.The top court also extended the interim protection granted to Singh till January 1, 2022 when it will hear the matter next.The state police had earlier told the apex court that Singh cannot be considered as a “whistleblower” under the law as he chose to speak out against alleged corruption involving former home minister Anil Deshmukh only after his transfer.The top court had granted a major relief to Singh on November 22 by directing the Maharashtra Police not to arrest him in criminal cases lodged against him and had wondered if he was being hounded for filing cases against police officers and extortionists, “what could happen to a common man”.Seeking dismissal of Singh’s plea for a CBI probe into the entire matter and against any coercive action by the state, the Maharashtra government has filed a reply affidavit in the apex court and said that the ongoing probe in criminal cases against the former top cop not be interfered with.Prior to this, the Bombay high court had dismissed Singh’s petition seeking to quash inquiries initiated against him by the Maharashtra government, and said he can approach the Central Administrative Tribunal.The high court had held that it was a service matter, and rejected his claim that the government’s action was a consequence of his allegations of corruption against then Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.After Singh was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner in March 2021 in the aftermath of the ‘Antilia bomb scare case’, in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, he levelled corruption allegations against Deshmukh.In his petition, Singh had also alleged that DGP Pande told him that the inquiries were the fall-out of his allegations against Deshmukh, an NCP leader.Singh was transferred to the Home Guard after Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze was arrested in the case of an SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, ‘Antilia’, and the subsequent suspicious death of businessman Mansukh Hiran. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-police-to-carry-on-probe-against-ex-mumbai-commissioner-of-police-param-bir-singh-restrains-it-from-filing-charge-sheet-346982

Let this matter come up on Friday and then we will see...Sorry! We can’t,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Raman told senior counsel Vikas Singh, representing the Developers and Builders Forum.Contending that thousands of crores of rupees were being lost by real estate firms due to the ban, Singh demanded that the plea should be taken up urgently either on Monday or Tuesday. “The government had lifted the ban on construction activities. This ban was re-imposed by the court and not by the government,” Singh submitted.Days after the Supreme Court re-imposed ban construction activities in Delhi-NCR to check high levels of air pollution, Developers and Builders Forum moved the top court seeking lifting of the ban on the ground that the order didn’t take into account the views of all stakeholders.As air quality refuses to show any considerable improvement, the Supreme Court on November 24 re-imposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR and ordered states to provide subsistence money to workers from the funds collected as labour cess during the ban period.But the Forum contended that the “blanket ban has directly affected the livelihoods of a large number of construction workers, supervisory personnel and other managerial staff who would be employed at such sites on a daily or monthly basis. “At a time when the entire country is coming out of the pandemic, any such ban affecting the livelihoods of a large number of citizens would have devastating effects on the society,” it submitted.However, the Forum said the direction was issued without taking into account the views of all stakeholders and without differentiating between construction activities of various kinds. “The present blanket ban on all construction activities takes within its sweep even small constructions of residential and other units which can in no manner be said to be causing large scale pollution,” the Forum submitted.Citing a report prepared by Centre for Science & Environment, the Forum contended that the entire construction activities ongoing in NCR constituted a meagre 6.7-7.9% of the entire pollution in the region. Other causes like vehicular pollution, industrial pollution, stubble burning, etc. are the major causes for the current health hazard,” it submitted.It said, “...even within the construction activities, admittedly the major contributors to pollution are the big commercial projects like multi-storey buildings, Central Vista project, Metro construction, construction of fly-overs and underpasses, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-refuses-urgent-hearing-of-builders-plea-for-resumption-of-construction-activities-in-delhi-ncr-346967

Indian Ordnance Factories’ (ranked 60th) arms sales rose marginally (by 0.2 per cent) during 2020.“Their aggregated arms sales of $6.5 billion (approx Rs 48,750 crore) were 1.7 per cent higher in 2020 than in 2019,” said the report, adding that “it accounted for 1.2 per cent of the Top 100’s total (sales)”.Domestic procurement has helped to shield Indian companies against the negative economic consequences of the pandemic. In 2020, the Indian government announced a phased ban on imports of more than a hundred different types of military equipment to support domestic companies and enhance self-reliance in arms production.China is second largestChina is now second to the US in making arms, weapons and military equipment.The combined arms sales of the five Chinese companies included in the ranking (of top 100) amounted to an estimated $66.8 billion in 2020—1.5 per cent more than in 2019.“With a 13 per cent share of total Top 100 arms sales, Chinese arms companies had the second highest volume of aggregated arms sales in 2020, behind US firms and ahead of British companies,” the report said.The rise of China as a major arms producer has been driven by its aim to become more self-reliant in weapons production and by the implementation of ambitious modernisation programmes.All five Chinese arms companies figure within the top 20, while three of these figure in the top 10 companies.With estimated arms sales of $17.9 billion in 2020, NORINCO (ranked 7th) is China’s largest arms company and land systems specialist. NORINCO’s arms sales rose by 12 per cent in 2020, in part because the company deepened its involvement in emerging technologies and contributed to the development of the BeiDou military–civil navigation satellite system.Estimated arms sales for AVIC (ranked 8th), China’s main military aircraft producer, declined by 1.4 per cent in 2020 to $17 billion. However, the decrease is probably due to exchange rate fluctuations, as its arms sales increased in nominal terms. The third Chinese company with arms sales high enough to rank in the top 10 was CETC (ranked 9th), the country’s leading producer of military electronics. At $14.6 billion, CETC’s arms sales fell by 6 per cent in 2020.All Chinese companies in the Top 100 are state-owned enterprises producing both military and civilian products. Most of the revenue generated by these five companies is derived from civilian sales.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-indian-companies-in-top-100-global-weapon-makers-346962

In the ensuing melee, one soldier was killed and army vehicles burnt down. Soldiers who fired in self-defence killed seven more civilians.Rioting spilled over into Sunday afternoon when angry mobs vandalised the offices of the Konyak Union and an Assam Rifles camp in the area, setting fire to parts of the camp, police had said.At least one more person was killed, as security forces fired back at attackers.Nagaland Police filed a suo moto FIR against the 21st Para Special Force of the Army.A case was registered under Sections 302/307/34 of the IPC, relating to murder, attempt to murder and criminal act committed by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all.In the complaint, Tizit Police Station in the district said, “On December 4 at around 1530 hours, coal mine labourers were returning to their native village Oting from Tiru in a vehicle. On reaching Longkhao between Upper Tiru and Oting, security forces blankly fired at the vehicle without provocation resulting in the killing of many villagers and seriously injuring many others."It also noted that at the time of the incident, there was no police guide nor did security forces make requisition for guides.“Hence, it is obvious that the intention of security forces is to murder and injure civilians,” the FIR added, urging authorities to take necessary action against the culprits.In a sudden move, tribal bodies, civil societies and student bodies on Monday morning imposed shutdowns of different durations ranging from six to 12 hours across the state.The influential Naga Students' Federation (NSF) has announced five days of mourning, while also asking tribals not to participate in any celebration during the period.Officials said of the 28 injured, the condition of six is stated to be critical and they are undergoing treatment at hospital.

The maximum cases were reported from Jaipur where nine persons, including four of a family, tested positive. Health Secretary Vaibhav Galriya said some patients had travel history of South Africa.Covid toll revisedIndia on Sunday saw a single-day rise of 2,796 Covid deaths, toll now stands at 4,73,326. This was attributed to reconciliation of data by Bihar & Kerala.Maharashtra health officials confirmed the seven new cases after one detected yesterday. They said a woman and her two daughters who returned from Nigeria; the woman’s brother and his two daughters in Pune and a man who returned from Finland had been detected Omicron positive. Earlier today, a 37-year-old man who returned to Delhi from Tanzania tested positive, making him the first Omicron case in the National Capital. India had on Saturday seen two new cases — one each in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Meanwhile, the WHO said today that Omicron had been detected in 38 countries across all six WHO Regions, including South-East Asia of which India is a member.“We do see increasing trends in Omicron in South Africa. So there is a suggestion that there is increased transmissibility,” said WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19 Maria Van Kerkhove.“The Delta variant is still dominant worldwide. That is important to keep in mind. We need to see how Omicron compares with Delta when they are both circulating in the population at the same time. So it will take a few more days for us to get that information,” Kerkhove said.Scientists, meanwhile, referred to early studies from South Africa that suggest milder illness with Omicron as against severe disease with Delta.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/17-more-test-ve-for-omicron-variant-346754

The BJP chief said the so-called powerful nations dithered on whether or not to impose a lockdown, but Modi’s firm response helped India fight Covid effectively.

We want greater engagement with its Far East,” said sources, while pointing out that India will in turn invite the Governors of Far East states to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit.With massive reserves of gas, oil, timber, coal, diamonds and ceramics, the largely-untapped Russian Far East is seeing a race among China, India and Japan to join hands with Russian companies. It is also short of people and it is significant that Moscow has not made similar manpower overtures to China.The initiative will dovetail with two new maritime routes on which both countries intend partnering. One is a shorter shipping route to Europe via Arctic Circle that will open due to climate change and the other is the Vladivostok-Chennai shipping route that will be used to transport much of timber and coal from Russia.Recalling the “vivid memories” of Rakesh Sharma entering space in a Soviet rocket, sources said that moment would occur again in 2023 with the launch of “Gaganyaan”. Indian astronauts have been undergoing training in Russia for over a year now.The summit and parallel meetings will look at prospects of long-term cooperation in space. In the nuclear energy sector also, they will weigh options of completing work on all six plants at Kadankulam or announcing the next batch of six Indo-Russian nuclear power plants.The two sides will also attempt to more closely coordinate their strategies on Afghanistan.Arms will, however, form an integral part of the relationship. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla had recently said that without Russian spare parts and maintenance help, “our ships won’t sail, our planes won’t fly”. The two countries are taking the US hints at ceasing defence ties in their stride.The summit, being held after two years, will overlap with the first-ever India-Russia 2 + 2 of their foreign and defence ministers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foray-in-russian-far-east-on-table-putin-arrives-today-346757

With this, four states and the National Capital have now reported cases of the potentially more contagious variant which has sparked a fresh alert across the world.The nine people who tested positive in Jaipur include four members of a family who returned from South Africa recently.“Genome sequencing has confirmed that nine persons are infected with the omicron variant,” Rajasthan health secretary Vaibhav Galriya said.The new cases in Maharashtra include a woman who along with her two daughters came from Nigeria, her brother and a man who returned from Finland in the last week of November, officials said.The total number of confirmed Omicron cases in Maharashtra has gone up to eight now.In a statement, the state health department said, “The 44-year-old, woman, who is a Nigerian citizen of Indian origin, her daughters aged 18 and 12, arrived on November 24 from Lagos in Nigeria to meet her brother in Pimpri Chinchwad area.“The woman, her two daughters, her 45-year-old brother and his two daughters aged 7 and one-and-a-half years, have tested positive for the Omicron variant as per the report given by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV).”                  Their thirteen contacts had been traced and tested, it said.The country reported the first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on Thursday in Karnataka—a 66-year-old South African flyer and a 46-year-old Bengaluru doctor with no travel history. Both men are fully vaccinated.On Saturday, a 72-year-old NRI from Gujarat and a 33-year-old man from Maharashtra’s Thane tested positive for the new strain.The marine engineer, who had arrived in Delhi from South Africa on November 23 and had then taken a flight to Mumbai, is currently undergoing treatment at a COVID-19 care centre in Kalyan town, located about 50 km from Maharashtra capital.“He is stable and responding well to treatment,” deputy director of health services, Mumbai circle, Dr Gauri Rathod told PTI.The first patient to test positive for Omicron in Delhi is a 37-year-old resident of Ranchi who had travelled from Tanzania to Doha and from there to Delhi on a Qatar Airways flight on December 2. He stayed in Johannesburg, South Africa, for a week, officials told PTI.The person is “fully vaccinated” and is currently admitted to the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital with “mild symptoms”, an official said.“He had to take a connecting flight to Ranchi, where he lives with his family. Since he gave his sample at the IGI Airport which came out positive, we admitted him to LNJP hospital,” the official said.Authorities are trying to locate and isolate 10 people who occupied the seats close to this passenger on the flight.Delhi’s Health Minister Satyendar Jain said 17 COVID-19 patients and six of their contacts have been admitted to the LNJP Hospital so far.“The Omicron variant has been found in one of the 12 samples sent for genome sequencing so far, according to a preliminary report,” he said         “The patient complained of sore throat, fever and body ache. He is stable now,” Medical Director Suresh Kumar said.The Delhi health minister said banning international flights is the most effective way to contain the spread of the Omicron variant even as he appealed to people to wear masks and take COVID-19 vaccine.He said there is a 99 percent chance that the mask can save people from all COVID-19 variants, be it Alpha, Beta, Delta or Omicron.Under the new norms, RT-PCR tests are mandatory for passengers arriving from the “at-risk” countries and they will be allowed to leave the airport only after the results come.According to the Centre, the countries designated as “at-risk” are European countries, including the UK, and South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.Also, two percent of the passengers arriving on flights from other countries will be subjected to the test randomly.India saw a single-day rise of 2,796 fatalities with Bihar and Kerala carrying out a reconciliation exercise of COVID-19 data, pushing the country’s death toll to 4,73,326, while 8,895 new infections were reported, according to Union health ministry data updated on Sunday.As many 2,426 deaths in Bihar and 263 deaths in Kerala were added.India’s total tally of COVID-19 cases has increased to 3,46,33,255, the data updated at 8 AM showed.The daily rise in new coronavirus infections has remained below 50,000 for 161 consecutive days now.The active cases stand at 99,155, comprising 0.29 percent of the total infections, the lowest since March 2020. The national COVID-19 recovery rate was recorded at 98.35 percent, the health ministry said.States are re-tightening preventive measures and ramping up vaccination in the face of the Omicron threat.The Union Territory of Puducherry has made it mandatory for all persons to get the COVID-19 vaccine and those skipping it would face penal action.The Director of Health and Family Welfare Services G.Sriramulu stated this in an order on Saturday night.Tamil Nadu’s Health Minister Ma Subramanian said the state has not detected any cases of Omicron variant and the five individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 after arriving from the at-risk countries were ‘asymptomatic’ and were ‘fine’ at the King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research hospital in China the city.The government has intensified the preventive measures in all the international airports and also at the border districts of the state, he said.With people resuming activities following the easing of curbs, cluster cases are being reported in some places.Telangana reported that 43 students of a private medical college in Karimnagar district have tested positive for COVID-19.In Karnataka, 59 students of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in  Chikkamagaluru district were among those who tested positive for COVID 19.Two women publishers from Pune attending the 94th Marathi literary meet in Nashik in Maharashtra have tested positive for coronavirus, civic officials said.Thousands of people had attended the three-day Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan from December 3 to 5.Officials said the two women will be quarantined either in Nashik or will be allowed to travel to their places and authorities concerned will be asked to keep them under observation.  Authorities are trying to track the people who had come in contact with the two infected women. These contacts will be tested as per the protocol, according to the officials.Even amid the emergence of new variants like Omircron, vaccination remains one of the strongest pillars of protection against disease and infection, according to experts.The issue of administering an ‘additional’ dose of COVID-19 vaccine to immunocompromised individuals will be deliberated upon in the meeting of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation scheduled to be held on December 6, official sources said.According to officials, an additional dose of vaccine is different from a booster dose.A booster dose is given to an individual after a predefined period when the immune response due to primary vaccination is presumed to have declined, while an additional dose is given to immunocompromised and immunosuppressed individuals when a primary schedule of vaccination does not provide adequate protection from the infection and disease, they explained.

In nuclear energy too, they will weigh the options of completing work on all six nuclear plants at Kadankulam or announcing the next batch of six Indo-Russian nuclear power plants.The two sides will also attempt to more closely coordinate their strategies on Afghanistan. Both countries had jointly backed the Northern Alliance against the Taliban in 2001 but had drifted apart on the question of unstinted support to the Ghani regime. Sources pointed out the ground has been prepared by two visits by Russian NSA Nikolai Patrushev which followed concurrence between PM Modi and Putin over phone to maintain a permanent communication link over Afghanistan right after the fall of Kabul.Arms though will form an integral part of the relationship. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla had recently stated that without Russian spare parts and maintenance help, “our ships won’t sail, our planes won’t fly”.The two countries are taking the US hints at ceasing defence ties in their stride. “We maintain strategic autonomy in defence. We have bought Rafales from France, Apaches from the US and are buying S-400 from Russia,’’ said the sources, while suggesting that the Indo-Russia logistics sharing agreement (LSA) may be ready for inking on the sidelines of the summit.The summit, being held after two years, will overlap with the first-ever India-Russia 2 + 2 of their Foreign and Defence Ministers. Sources said this was a “natural fit’’ in Indo-Russian ties. “There is so much political dialogue and defence issues between India and Russia and there are many cross cutting issues. This forum is appropriate,’’ they said while denying the Indo-Russian 2 + 2 was being held simply to balance the Indo-US 2 + 2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-arms-oil-as-fulcrum-modi-putin-summit-to-set-out-new-areas-of-collaboration-346561

The order uses a 1-day time frame instead of 24 hours to provide more flexibility to the air passenger and aircraft operator.By using a 1-day window, test acceptability does not depend on the time of the flight or the time of day that the test sample was taken, the circular explained.For example, flight AI191/(BOM-EWR) is at 01:30 AM IST on a Tuesday, passengers could board with a negative test that was taken any time on the 1 calendar day prior Tuesday i.e., on Monday, it said.On Saturday, New York detected three more cases of the omicron variant, bringing the total number of the state's cases to eight. Seven of the new cases have been found in New York City."The omicron variant is here, and as anticipated we are seeing the beginning of community spread," state Health Commissioner Mary Bassett said in a statement.Massachusetts and Washington announced their first cases on Saturday, a day after New Jersey, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Maryland reported their first cases.
