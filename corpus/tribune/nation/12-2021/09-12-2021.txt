They reminded people of the horrific Lakhimpur incident and how Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra (Teni) continues to be a part of the cabinet.“Eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed on October 3 during a farmers’ protest in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district. An SUV, allegedly belonging to Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra, ran over them. #Justice4LakhimpurFarmers,” tweeted Simarpreet Singh.“Ajay Mishra threatened farmers to teach lesson, if they protest against BJP in Lakhimpur & a week later his son drove over protesting farmers yet Teni-duo has not been convicted, even after 100s of video evidences proved them culprits.

Four of them were farmers who were allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers.Mishra and 15-20 unidentified men were mentioned as accused in an FIR filed after the incident and charged with murder, criminal conspiracy, rash driving and rioting among others.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, started protesting at Delhi’s border points on November 26 last year against the three farm laws.According to the opposition and farmer leaders, over 700 farmers have died during the movement. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitterati-post-celebratory-videos-victory-slogans-as-farmers-protest-comes-to-an-end-348293

09-12-2021||Vibha Sharma||Farmers' agitation managed to force majority govt to retreat, but may not be the end of story||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 9As the leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Thursday formally announced the ending of their year-long agitation at the Delhi borders in the backdrop of now-repealed farm laws and the Centre’s outreach, according to some agriculture experts the story may be far from over yet.They called the farmers’ victory “reclaiming of democracy” and one that exposed “inability/limitations of RSS-BJP strategy/instrument to counter agitation/movement without any religious tinge”.However, it was also one resulting from “pure political compulsions of the ruling BJP”, they said.“Yes, it is a glorious victory, but forced due to UP/Punjab/Uttarakhand elections. The Narendra Modi Government conceded to farmers’ demands because of the fear of losing in 2022 Assembly elections,” said agriculture expert from Western UP Sudhir Panwar, who is also associated with the Samajwadi Party.“The compelling reasons for repeal was possibility of novel political alliance in Punjab and the growing support of farmers for political alliance of Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary (in Western UP) ,” he added.Also pointing to the words used by the Prime Minister while announcing the decision to rollback, Panwar called it a “clear indication of future”.“The PM said he felt sorry over his failure in convincing a small number of farmers of the benefits of new agriculture laws. It was not an apology on the manner of implementation and implications of laws. In future the BJP government can always claim that farmers are now convinced on benefits of repealed laws,” he said.Amid speculations of divisions among farmer groups, it seems BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who infused life into the agitation with his emotional outbreak after the January-26 Republic Day violence, was not in favour of ending the agitation till the time there was a legal guarantee of Minimum Support Price.Panwar also said “farmers were divided”. While repeal was the main demand of those from Haryana and Punjab, for the rest of the country it was the legal guarantee of the MSP. “Rakesh Tikait was not as happy as farmer leaders of Punjab and Haryana. It also shows the dominant role of farmers from Punjab and Haryana in the agitation and subsidiary role of those from other regions,” he said.While there was “no real gain for farmers even after year-long agitation as issue related with electricity, burning of agriculture waste and legal guarantee of MSP handed over to committee”, the successful agitation exposed the inability/limitations of RSS-BJP strategy/instrument to counter agitation/movement without giving religious hues, Panwar said.“The BJP used all known strategies such as calling farmers anti-national, Khalistani, secessionist, anti-Hindu, etc. January 26 incidents were used to malign the image of farmer leaders and their organisations. The success of the agitation was clear records of its leaders and sustained food supply and shelters at agitation sites,” he said.“The success of the agitation is revival of democracy which seems impossible in a powerful Government having brute political power. It not only established the power of peaceful agitation but reclaimed the space for dissent and agitation which is vital for democracy,” Panwar added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-agitation-managed-to-force-majority-govt-to-retreat-but-may-not-be-the-end-of-story-348283
09-12-2021||New Delhi||Lok Sabha passes Bills to extend CBI, ED directors’ tenures up to maximum 5 years||Two bills were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday to extend the tenures of directors of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate up to a maximum of five years from the present two years.The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill, 2021 were passed separately by voice vote after the House rejected various amendments moved by Opposition members on the two bills.Congress MPs walked out of the House, saying they were not satisfied with the reply of Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh.These bills seek to replace two ordinances issued last month.The Opposition and the BJP sparred over the government’s move to extend the tenures of the directors of the CBI and the ED up to a maximum of five years, with the Opposition alleging that it would completely undermine the autonomy of these institutions, and the ruling party defending the step as being necessary to fight large scale corruption.

09-12-2021||London||UK High Court rejects India’s appeal to extradite terror accused Kuldeep Singh||The High Court in England on Thursday rejected an appeal by Indian authorities seeking permission to appeal against a magistrates’ court order turning down the extradition on human rights grounds of Kuldeep Singh, wanted in India as an alleged senior member of the banned terrorist organisation Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF).Singh alias Keepa Sidhu is charged with conspiring with others to commit terror activities in Punjab dating back to 2015-16, including a plot to assassinate then chief minister and deputy chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal, respectively.The 44-year-old is also accused of recruiting youths in Punjab to the banned KZF organisation by offering them money and organising a meeting of separatists in a gurdwara.District Judge Gareth Branston, presiding over the extradition case at Westminster Magistrates’ Court here, ruled in January that as the offences carry maximum sentences and “no possibility of a review of such a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or conditional release”, it would be contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights.“The District Judge’s comprehensive and clearly reasoned judgment cannot be faulted,” High Court Justices Nicola Davies and Pushpinder Saini said in their judgment, handed down at the Royal Courts of Justice here.“There are no grounds upon which it would be appropriate for this court to interfere with the discretion exercised by the District Judge,” they conclude.Singh faces a total of four charges in India, under sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act related to raising funds for terrorism, conspiracy and being a member of a terror outfit and of the Arms Act related to firearms offences.The court documents note that he is accused of being a point of contact in Punjab and liaising with the head of the KZF, who was residing in Pakistan, and other co-accused members of the organisation, who lived in Belgium and England.Singh, who entered the UK illegally in 2005, was on immigration bail when he was arrested at Loughborough Immigration Reporting Centre in eastern England in October 2019.In September 2020, the Indian authorities were successful in revoking bail granted to him at the magistrates’ court level.Singh – who used a Punjabi interpreter in court – then remained remanded in judicial custody for the duration of the extradition hearings before District Judge Branston, which concluded in December last year.In his judgment in January, District Judge Branston accepted Indian government assurances regarding prison conditions under which Singh would be kept as “clear, binding and sufficient”.“There is no evidence that Mr Singh has previously been ill-treated in India. This country has considered and accepted previous assurances by the Indian government. There is no cogent evidence to suggest that they will not be complied with,” he said.He also noted that it is undisputed that there is evidence of a conspiracy to commit criminal offences in India but questioned the proportionality of a life term without parole.The judge said: “In my judgment, if such a sentence were imposed upon Mr Singh in the context of this case, then such a sentence would plainly be grossly disproportionate to the offending alleged.“Whilst clearly very serious allegations, Mr Singh is alleged to have been involved in the funding and recruitment of terrorist activity. As is observed, there is no evidence that anyone was actually killed as a result of his alleged activities. He is accused of acts preparatory to terrorist offences.” Besides the human rights issue relating to a life sentence without parole, the court also found that there is “insufficient evidence to make a case requiring an answer by Kuldeep Singh”.

We used blankets and other available material to move them even as a police inspector came... as we were engaged in trying to shift them from there, I told the second person to remain calm and relaxed as we rescuers had arrived. He then asked me “some water please”.“But I realised that by the time I could oblige his request, we could as well move him to safety,” Sivakumar told PTI.The third person could hear what the rescuers spoke but could not respond, he added.Later, an Army officer showed a picture of Rawat to Sivakumar and revealed who he was.“I was upset I could not give water immediately to such a high ranking person of the country,” Sivakumar said, adding, all of Rawat’s belongings were later retrieved.Sivakumar said police and defence officials have already held enquiries with him.

09-12-2021||---||India stays away from US-led political boycott of Beijing Winter Olympics||New Delhi, December 9India and the US are making common cause at the Joe Biden-hosted virtual Democracy Summit that began on Thursday but there was dissonance in their stands on the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games.Biden had called for a political boycott of China two days back which has been endorsed by Canada, the UK, Australia and a clutch of smaller countries, some of which hedged the non-representation by pointing out that one reason was the Covid scare.France and Italy were among the bigger western countries that will send both athletes and government representatives for the event. “Sports is a world apart that needs to be protected from political interference. If not, things can get out of control and it could end up killing all of the competitions,” said the French Sports Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer. On the other hand, Germany has left the question open so far.At the same time, the boycott camp has made it clear that their athletes will participate under the country flag but there will not be any “diplomatic representatives”.While the Biden administration will not send any diplomatic or official representation due to China’s “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses”, India on November 26 supported China’s hosting of the 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games though the Republicans led by former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already started calling for a political boycott.New Delhi had announced its support along with that of Moscow at the virtual meeting of the Russia-India-China Foreign Ministers.Along with Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, Kosovo and New Zealand also expressed similar intentions. But New Zealand Deputy PM Grant Robertson said there was “a range of factors” and it was “mostly to do with Covid”.India’s support is mainly symbolic and its biggest team at the Winter Olympics has been of four athletes. This time, a skier from Kashmir, Arif Khan, is the sole qualifier.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-stays-away-from-us-led-political-boycott-of-beijing-winter-olympics-348278

By just getting a whiff, you scribes raised a storm yesterday. Disclosing everything would have caused a stampede at the function. Tejashwi certainly did not want that”.There has been palpable excitement among the RJD camp since the previous day when word spread that the heir apparent of the party’s founding chief was going to start a family.Tejashwi is eighth of the nine children of Lalu-Rabri and the last one to tie the nuptial knot.The subdued manner in which he did so, however, marked a stark contrast with the ostentatious weddings of other less politically fancied siblings of the former Deputy CM who is now the leader of the opposition. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tejashwi-gets-married-in-delhi-rjd-celebrates-in-patna-348277

09-12-2021||New Delhi||Govt set to start process to appoint next CDS soon; Gen Naravane frontrunner||The government is set to begin the process soon to appoint the next Chief of Defence Staff with Army Chief Gen MM Naravane emerging as the front-runner for the top post that fell vacant following the demise of Gen Bipin Rawat in a helicopter crash.The move by the government comes even as a number of retired military commanders said it will be prudent to appoint Gen Naravane as he is retiring as the Chief of Army Staff in five months.People familiar with the development on Thursday said the government will draw up a small panel comprising senior commanders from the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.The panel will be finalised based on recommendations from the three services in the next two to three days and then it will be sent to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh for approval.Following the approval by the defence minister, the names will be sent for consideration by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet that will take the final decision on India’s next Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), those familiar with the development said.They said the Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman Chiefs Of Staff Committee (CISC) is likely to coordinate the process of drawing up the panel of prospective candidates for the post of the Chief of Defence Staff.Explaining the process, they said the government will follow the same protocol for the appointment of the CDS that is laid down for appointing the service chiefs.The CDS is the chairman of the powerful Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC) that also comprises the three service chiefs.It is learnt that the possibility of appointing Gen Naravane to the top post is high considering his overall performance as well as the handling of the eastern Ladakh standoff.The Army chief is due to retire in April.Gen Naravane is the senior-most among the three service chiefs.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari and Navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar had taken over their respective positions on September 30 and November 30.On January 1 last year, Gen Rawat took charge as India’s first CDS with a mandate to bring in convergence in the functioning of the Army, the Navy and the Indian Air Force and bolster the country’s overall military prowess.Another key mandate of the CDS was to facilitate the restructuring of military commands for optimal utilisation of resources by bringing about jointness in operations, including through the establishment of theatre commands.A high-level committee set up to examine the gaps in India’s security system in the wake of the Kargil war in 1999 had recommended the appointment of the CDS as a single-point military adviser to the defence minister.In the last two years, Gen Rawat carried out extensive groundwork to establish on initiating tri-services reforms.The tenure of Gen Rawat as the CDS was till March 2023. The retirement age for the CDS is 65 years while the service chiefs have a tenure till they are 62 or for three years, whichever is earlier.The CDS is also the Secretary of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) in the Defence Ministry and the Principal Advisor to the Defence Minister.“It is highly likely that Gen Naravane is made the next Chief of Defence Staff and it will be a wise decision,” said a former high-ranking military commander.There has been a view among an influential section of the military planners that the Chief of Defence Staff should be from the Army, at least till the ambitious theaterisation process is completed under the ambitions higher defence reforms.If Gen Naravane is appointed the CDS, then the government will also simultaneously have to look for his replacement.In that case, Vice Chief of Army Lt Gen CP Mohanty and Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Y K Joshi will be the front-runner for the Army Chief’s post, Lt Gen Mohanty and Lt Gen Joshi are from the same batch and are the senior-most commanders after Gen Naravane.However, as Vice Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Mohanty, with extensive experience of serving extensively, in formations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), has a much better chance of succeeding Gen Naravane if he is appointed the CDS. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-set-to-start-process-to-appoint-next-cds-soon-gen-naravane-frontrunner-348274
09-12-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ protest suspension: Commuters look forward to relief from traffic chaos||With farmers set to vacate the protest sites at Delhi’s borders, commuters will heave a sigh of relief as roads closed for over a year will reopen, ending their traffic woes.After farmers agitating against the Centre’s now-repealed farm laws occupied the three border points, Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, in November last year, those travelling from Delhi to Ghaziabad, Noida and Haryana and vice versa had a tough time due to road closures and traffic diversions.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, on Thursday decided to suspend the movement against the farm laws and announced that farmers will go back home on December 11 from the protest sites on Delhi’s borders.The announcement came after the SKM, which is spearheading the movement, received a central government signed letter wherein it agreed to consider farmers’ pending demands, including the withdrawal of cases against farmers and to form a committee on minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.“After the government’s announcement of the repeal of the three farm laws, I had thought that the farmers would end their protest but they continued it. Their announcement today will bring a huge relief to many commuters like me who have been facing severe issues,” said Suman Rathore, a regular commuter to Rewari in Haryana.Neeti Rastogi, a resident of Noida extension who travels to Lutyens’ Delhi for work, said, “I used to take the Delhi-Meerut expressway to reach my office before the protests began. After the protesters occupied the border, I started taking the metro to reach my office, which meant a longer commuting time, more hassle and the fear of contracting coronavirus.”            Viplav Tripathi, also a regular commuter to Delhi from Noida, used to take his car to office every day. Due to road closures, his commuting time was extended by 45 minutes.“Using the Noida-Meerut expressway, I can reach my office in an hour but passing through Noida and the early morning traffic meant a longer commute to my office,” he said.Commuters said the traffic police issued advisories suggesting alternative routes whenever farmers had any events planned and that further added to their difficulties.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, started protesting at Delhi’s border points on November 26 last year against the three farm laws. The laws have been repealed, but they are demanding that their remaining demands also be fulfilled. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-suspension-commuters-look-forward-to-relief-from-traffic-chaos-348272
09-12-2021||New Delhi||Protest over NEET-PG counselling delay suspended for one week, says FORDA||The Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA), spearheading a nationwide protest over the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling since November 27, said on Thursday that the stir has been suspended for a week.In a statement, it said the decision has been taken in view of the developments over the issue in the last few days and the death of Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and others in a copter crash on Wednesday.FORDA has decided to put the agitation on hold for one week after holding discussions with representatives of state RDAs virtually on Thursday, it said.“We express our sincere gratitude to all resident doctors of the nation who came forward and joined the agitation. We are resuming all services with immediate effect.“In case the issue is not addressed by December 16, 2021, we will be forced to call for a complete shutdown of all services except Covid areas in healthcare institutions,” the statement said.While FORDA president Dr Manish claimed all RDAs have aligned with its decision, Dr Akash Yadav, vice-president of resident doctors association of Delhi government-run Maulana Azad Medical College, said, “MAMC RDA is yet to take any decision on it”.MAMC resident doctors had from Thursday morning boycotted all routine and emergency services as part of the nationwide stir, affecting patient care at three facilities attached to it.Lok Nayak Jaiprakash (LNJP) Hospital, GB Pant Hospital and Guru Nanak Eye Centre are attached with MAMC. LNJP is the biggest healthcare facility run by the Delhi government and is the nerve centre of its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.In a statement issued late on Tuesday night, the MAMC RDA said, “Even after the boycott by many institutions of Delhi, we continued to run emergency services. But apathy of government and plight of overburdened residents have brought us to do total boycott of all services including OPD, OT, Ward and Emergency services from 09/12/21 (Thursday)”.“Functioning of ICU and Covid wards will not be affected to safeguard the interests of critically ill patients,” it had said.Meanwhile, the general secretary of RDA of Safdarjung Hospital, Dr Anuj Aggarwal, on Thursday said, “We support the decision of FORDA for putting on hold the protest for one week while hoping for the urgent intervention by the Government of India to fast-track the process.”               However, the stand of RDAs at other hospitals was not known yet.Resident doctors of Centre-run Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge hospitals have been boycotting all routine and emergency services for over three consecutive days, as part of the nationwide protest, affecting patient care.Members of the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of Lady Hardinge Medical College and Hospital took out a march on the streets near the campus on Wednesday demanding expediting of the counselling process. Scores of doctors, holding placards and raising slogans marched near Connaught Place.The Indian Medical Association has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to ensure that post-graduate admissions are done on a war footing.Because of the protests, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital administration on Monday had issued a circular saying that all residents doctors appointed on ad hoc “cannot indulge themselves nor participate in any strike activity”.“Non-observance of the rules attracts disciplinary action as deemed fit, including termination. This issue with the approval of Medical Superintendent,” the circular had warned. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protest-over-neet-pg-counselling-delay-suspended-for-one-week-says-forda-348270
09-12-2021||---||Capt Amarinder congratulates farmers over triumphant end to stir against farm laws||Chandigarh, December 9Congratulating the farmers over the triumphant culmination of their over year-long agitation against the Farm Laws, Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday hoped it would pave the way for a more constructive political environment for the progress of the farming community, who constitute the backbone of India’s economic growth and sustainability.Amarinder said he was happy the farmers’ fight had reached its logical conclusion and the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments had agreed in principle to follow his own erstwhile government’s decision in Punjab to compensate the families of farmers who had lost their lives during the agitation. The Captain Amarinder Singh government had announced Rs 5 lakh in financial aid and a job for one member each of the deceased farmers’ families in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively.In a statement today, the former Chief Minister expressed relief that the agitating farmers, farm labourers and their families will finally be back in the warm comfort of their homes after camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year.Captain Amarinder hoped the lingering issue of MSP, for which the Centre had constituted a committee, would also be resolved soon to the satisfaction of the farmers. He further hoped all future legislations and decisions concerning the farming community, which has been at the forefront of India’s progressive march since Independence, would be taken in the spirit of mutual agreement, after due consultation with all the stakeholders.Asserting his party’s unequivocal support for the farmers, Captain Amarinder said, as in the past, he would continue to do everything in his power to protect their interests and ensure their welfare. He pointed out that as chief minister of Punjab, he had not only supported the farmers’ fight for the repeal of the Farm Laws but had ensured that they were not, in any way, harassed even when they were sitting in protest across the state or marching towards Delhi.As far back as in June 2020, he had convened an all-party meeting to seek repeal of what were then the three Farm Ordinances, pointed out the former chief minister. His government had followed it up with a Resolution rejecting the Ordinances, which was passed by the Punjab Assembly in August, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-congratulates-farmers-over-triumphant-end-to-stir-against-farm-laws-348264

09-12-2021||New Delhi||Two unmanned missions to be launched before flying Gaganyaan by end of 2022: Minister||India will launch two unmanned missions next year before the human spaceflight programme 'Gaganyaan' by the end of 2022, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Thursday.  Sharing the status of other space projects, Singh -- during the Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha -- said the Venus mission is planned for 2022, while the Solar Mission for 2022-23 and that of the Space Station by 2030.Singh, the Minister of State in the Department of Space, said space projects have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. "In the next year, we are going to have two unmanned missions before flying the Gaganyaan. That is also in the planning. That is usually the SoP (Standard Operating Procedure) which is followed. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it got delayed," he said.In the beginning of next year possibly, India will first launch unmanned missions ahead of Gaganyaan towards the end of 2022, he said, adding that it would be accompanied with robots that have been named as 'Vayumitra'.       "Following that, we will possibly in 2023 have Gaganyaan which will undoubtedly place India in the elite club of nations being the fourth one after the US, China and Russia," he added.       The minister further said the Gaganyaan programme will be different from other human missions undertaken by other countries in the sense that this will be more cost effective and inclusive.      This programme will place India as a frontline nation and will also improve the country's capabilities as far as its robotic missions are concerned, he said and added that this will also inspire youngsters and start-ups.Besides the Gaganyaan programme, the minister said, "We are going to have a number of other missions. We will have a Venus mission by 2023. Soon, we will have solar missions called 'Aditya Solar mission' planned for 2022-23."Chandrayana got delayed due to the pandemic and maybe it will be launched by next year, he said."By 2030, we will possibly be able to set up a space station, which will be unique of its kind," he noted, adding that the journey of India's ascent to the top has already begun through the space route. Replying to a supplementary query if ISRO has identified 17 technologies at lower cost from start-ups for use in Gaganyaan mission, the minister said, "There are going to be several research modules accompanying the Gaganyaan and it will involve start-ups and more than 500 industries".For the first time since the country's Independence, private industry will be involved in space technology, he said."As a result of which, we now are going to have a number of partnerships for nano satellites trying to put in their mission in collaboration with ISRO," he said.Host technologies can be innovated in a wide range of areas involving the industry, which pave the way for the newer economy getting generated through the medium of space technology, he added. The minister also informed the Upper House that India has so far launched 42 foreign satellites from 34 countries and generated a revenue of USD 56 million (one million is equal to 10 lakhs).

09-12-2021||New Delhi||Gujarat riots: Nobody has raised finger on us except plea by Zakia Jafri, SIT tells Supreme Court||The Special Investigation Team (SIT) told the Supreme Court on Thursday that nobody had “raised a finger” against it for the probe conducted in the 2002 Gujarat riots except the petition filed by Zakia Jafri, who has alleged larger conspiracy during the violence in the state.Zakia Jafri, the wife of Congress leader Ehsan Jafri who was killed during the violence at Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad on February 28, 2002, has challenged the SIT's clean chit to 64 people including Narendra Modi who was the Gujarat chief minister during the riots in the state.A bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar reserved judgement on Zakia Jafri's petition against the Gujarat High Court's October 5, 2017 order rejecting her plea against the SIT decision.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the SIT, told the bench that the apex court should endorse what the trial court and the Gujarat High Court had done on Jafri's plea otherwise it is an “endless exercise” which would go on because of “some motives” of social activist Teesta Setalvad, who is the petitioner number two in the petition.“I think what the trial court and the high court have done, your lordships should endorse it otherwise it is an endless exercise which will always go on only because of some motives of petitioner number two (Setalvad),” Rohatgi told the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, while concluding his arguments.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioners, referred to the work done by Setalvad's organisations and said to “paint” us as somebody who is “anti-Gujarat, defaming Gujarat” is unfair.“Very few times in the history of the court, matters of this moment are before you. It happened earlier on a few occasions. This is yet another occasion when the majesty of the law is being tested. And here, I am not interested in targeting anybody but as your lordships know, under criminal law you take cognisance of offences and you don't take cognisance of offender,” Sibal said.He said it is the SIT's task to find out who the offenders are, if any offence has been committed.“So, if nobody did it and all this happened without anybody doing it with the material which is before you, we can close it. But if you feel that offences have been committed then who is responsible is a matter of investigation,” Sibal said.Rohatgi said that the SIT was given a job by the apex court and the team did much more than what was required.“Nobody has raised a finger against us except this petitioner,” he said.“I have submitted and I will repeat that it is petitioner number two (Setalvad) who is driving this litigation now for the last 10 years. Ample opportunity was available at the relevant time to say something if you want,” Rohatgi said.He said that now after almost 20 years, the petitioners wanted the court to order further investigation in the matter.

09-12-2021||Vijay Mohan||Examining black box data of Mi-17 helicopter an intricate process involving 32 flight parameters||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 9Experts will be examining 32 flight parameters while investigating the crash of the Mi-15 V5 helicopter that crashed near Coonoor in Ooty on Wednesday, killing Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat and 12 others.The ill-fated helicopter’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, popularly known as 'Black Box' even though it is bright orange in colour, was recovered from the crash site on Thursday morning. Examining flight data is a tedious and intricate process that can take a long time.“The number of flight parameters recorded in helicopters and smaller transport aircraft is lesser than that in fighter aircraft,” an IAF engineering officer said. “In the case of fighters, given the flight configurations and operational environment and weapons firing, 104 parameters need to be recorded. Larger, multi-engine aircraft can have a different number of parameters,” he added.All IAF aircraft operating bases have facilities to download and analyse flight data as these are part of routine flying training and technical maintenance procedures. Such facilities are also available with IAF’s base repair depots as well as with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the public sector aircraft manufacturer.“Given the sensitivity of this case, it remains to be seen where the contents of the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voices recorder (CVR) are analysed,” a senior IAF officer said. “Several establishments, including the IAF airbase at which the helicopter was based, No 3 Base Repair Depot (BRD) at Chandigarh, where it was assembled and serviced, Inspector General (Flight Safety) at Air Headquarters and HAL, which is associated with Russian FDR technology as it also produced FDRs for MiG series aircraft, could be involved in the investigations,” he added. FDR and CVR record the flight parameters of an aircraft such are speed, altitude, engine temperature, power output, oil pressure, hydraulics, g-forces, communication between the aircrew and radio transmission between the pilots and the ground control. It is vital for accident analysis and is also used for performance evaluation and training. It is mandatory for all military and civilian aircraft above a specified weight to be equipped with FDR and CVR. These are of various types and sizes.IAF officers also cautioned that just recovering the FDR and CVR does not mean that the required data would be available for investigations. “Black boxes are designed to withstand tremendous heat and pressure for a limited period and are not totally immune to damage. If exposed to fire for long, where the temperature could be about 1,000 degrees high or a severe impact during a crash, it could be damaged,” he added. “In cases where there is a problem in accessing the contents, the FDR and CVR may have to be referred to the original equipment manufacturer,” he added.The Mi17-V5 is a Russian-origin medium lift helicopter that the IAF began inducting in 2012 to replace the older Mi-8 and earlier versions of the Mi-17 to meet its requirements for tactical airlift.According to IAF sources, the Mi-17 is equipped with the SARPP-12 FDR and the MS-61 CVR where data is recorded in wave form on a photographic film that has to be developed in a laboratory for recovering the data. The Air Force have initiated a project to replace them with indigenously developed equipment having solid state memory where data can be downloaded, processed and stored digitally in a more convenient and efficient way.Execution of the project is being done by 3 BRD here, which is also taking up several other projects to modify and retrofit Mi-17 helicopters with indigenously developed equipment to enhance their operational capability and also to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers for aero-spares.A modern, highly capable aircraft forming the backbone of the IAF’s vertical airlift component, the MI-17 V5 is powered by two engines and has a maximum speed of 250 km per hour and a service ceiling of 6,000 metres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/examining-black-box-data-of-ill-fated-mi-17-helicopter-an-intricate-process-involving-32-flight-parameters-348244

The spot was cordoned off and the forensic team and the NSG team were called to the place of the incident,” Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal said.Prima facie, the blast seems to have occurred in a black backpack that was found lying at the spot, he said.A Naib Court Head Constable, Rajeev, sustained minor injuries in the blast and is being treated at a hospital, the officer said.“Forensic teams have collected the evidence from the spot and taken it for examination.

A black backpack was also found lying inside the courtroom with a file popping out of it.“It will only be known after the examination whether the (white) substance was an explosive. A battery and some wires were also recovered from the spot,” the source added.Dinesh Tiwari, an advocate, said, “There is a long line of cars in the morning when court proceedings start and it is not possible for the police to check every vehicle. The court has a total of nine gates. The public entry is allowed from gate numbers 5 and 7.”Another advocate Sangram Singh said the security at the court was stepped up after the September shootout but despite that, the explosion occurred.“The court has nine gates and metal detectors have been installed at each of them.

Distinguished people from different parts of India, different backgrounds and even differing ideologies came together with one aim to give the people of India a worthy Constitution. Tributes to these greats,” the PM said on Twitter.He said the first sitting of the Constituent Assembly was presided over by Dr Sachchidananda Sinha, who was the eldest member of the Assembly.“He was introduced and conducted to the Chair by Acharya Kripalani. Today, as we mark 75 years of the historic sitting of our Constituent Assembly, I would urge my young friends to know more about this august gathering’s proceedings and about the eminent stalwarts who were a part of it. Doing so would be an intellectually enriching experience,” added the PM.The Constituent Assembly met for the first time in New Delhi on December 9, 1946 in the Constitution Hall which is now known as the Central Hall of Parliament House. Decorated elegantly for the occasion, the Chamber wore a new look on that day with a constellation of bright lamps hanging from the high ceilings and also from the brackets on its walls.Overwhelmed and jubilant as they were, the members sat in semi-circular rows facing the Presidential dias. The desks which could be warmed electrically were placed on sloping green-carpeted terraces. Those who adorned the front row were Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Acharya JB Kripalani, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Sarojini Naidu, Hare Krushna Mahatab, Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant, Dr BR Ambedkar, Sarat Chandra Bose, C Rajagopalachari and M Asaf Ali.

While welcoming Dr Sinha and others, Acharyaji said: "As we begin every work with divine blessings, we request Dr Sinha to invoke these blessings so that our work may proceed smoothly. Now, I once more, on your behalf, call upon Dr Sinha to take the Chair."The Constituent Assembly took almost three years (two years, eleven months and seventeen days to be precise) to complete its historic task of drafting the Constitution for Independent India. During this period, it held 11 sessions covering a total of 165 days. Of these, 114 days were spent on the consideration of the Draft Constitution.As to its composition, members were chosen by indirect election by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies, according to the scheme recommended by the Cabinet Mission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/today-75-years-ago%E2%80%A6pm-recalls-the-first-sitting-of-the-constituent-assembly-348206

09-12-2021||---||Nationwide bank strike on December 16, 17||Ludhiana, December 8On a call given by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), bankers will go on nationwide two days’ strike on December 16 and 17.The strike call has been given to protest against the government’s plan of tabling Banking Laws Amendment Bill, 2021, in recent winter session of the parliament. The government is planning to privatise two public sector banks through the Bill.Naresh Gaur, union convener, said, “As per the latest information, the government has decided to privatise two public sector banks and one general insurance company. Banks and insurance companies deal with people’s money. Privatising banks means handing over people’s money to private persons with vested interests.”“Bad loans and NPAs in banks have been increasing year after year because of corporate defaulters. Instead of taking tough action against them, the government wants to white wash balance sheets by shifting these bad loans from books of banks to the Assets Reconstruction Company or the Bad Bank. This will only benefit corporate defaulters, remove all bad loans from public glare and silently write them off,” he added.“It has, therefore, become inevitable for the United Forum of Bank Unions to hold protest in order to draw attention of the government and bank managements,” he said.At the same time, industrialists have expressed concern over the strike call given by banks on two consecutive working days. Industrialists feel that strike in banks paralyses the system and transactions get affected.Badish Jindal, president, FOPSIA, said, “Transactions worth Rs300 to 400 crore are done through banks in the industrial town on daily basis. When there are strike calls, the work gets affected and financial transactions are hit.”“Now, we will either have to postpone or pre-pone the financial matters as cheques will not be cleared, no payments will be made by banks, ATMs will also be hit. Instead of going on strikes, bank employees should initiate a dialogue with government representatives to save public from harassment”, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/nationwide-bank-strike-on-december-16-17-348049

Filing of fake claim cases of thousands of crores by advocates and you are not much serious. In fact, you should have taken action without our orders. We feel that you are just shielding your advocates by your inaction,” a Bench led by Justice MR Shah said.As the UP Bar Council advocate said the probe was on and all necessary details were being collected, the Bench — which also included Justice Sanjiv Khanna — said there would be consequences if it was found that there was any attempt to save someone.Directing the insurance agencies to render assistance in the probe, the top court posted the matter for further hearing on December 14.Earlier, the Bar Council of India (BCI) told the Bench that it has suspended 28 lawyers from Uttar Pradesh named in FIRs or chargesheets for allegedly filing fake claims under the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT) and under the Workmen Compensation Act.Last month, the BCI —which regulates the legal profession in India — had also directed the UP Bar Council to initiate disciplinary proceedings against them; asked it to conclude all inquiries in three months.The BCI decision followed directions issued by the top court to take action against the advocates who allegedly filed fake motor accident claims after the UP State Bar Council failed to take appropriate action in the matter.“It appears that the Bar Council of State is not interested in taking action and, therefore, now the Bar Council of India has to step in and take appropriate action against the erring advocates, who are found to have indulged in filing of such fake claims,” the Bench had said in October.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dont-shield-advocates-accused-of-filing-fake-claims-348110

09-12-2021||General Bipin Rawat||A down-to-earth General, at times misunderstood||Ajay BanerjeeSometime last year, in an informal chat, General Bipin Rawat said that on retirement he would like to settle down in his village in Uttarakhand, and go “back to the roots”.Also read: General Bipin Rawat survived copter crash 6 yrs agoThough General Rawat’s father had built a house in Noida, he never seemed keen on a post-retirement life in the Delhi suburb. Today, fate tragically willed otherwise. The often-misunderstood General Rawat wasn’t like the “officious” military officer who would not go beyond the strait-jacket approach. He could be informal and spoke his mind publicly, his words and actions were at times misunderstood and misinterpreted.General Rawat faced flak from veterans on the social media over the integrated theatre command and jointness of the three services. The CDS’s plans on ‘cutting the flab’, that is reducing the non-essential manpower, or his orders as Army Chief asking young officers to use military guestrooms and not hotels for overnight stay led to debates. In the past two years, he was like a man on a mission to kick-start the jointness of the three forces. Often the General cited military operations in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, during the 1971 war to emphasise what joint operations should stand for. If anything rankled him, it was the archaic administrative structures and slow decision-making, and he brutally tackled these.In 2016, General Rawat was appointed the Army Chief amid a controversy over his seniority. He had superseded two senior officers to occupy the Army Chief’s position. He then rose to become the first CDS towards the end of 2019. The government had amended the rules to extend the age of superannuation of CDS from 62 years to 65 years, paving the way for his appointment to the post.The last I met him was four days ago on Navy Day (December 4) during an At Home by the Navy Chief. The formal ceremony had just ended, the President and the Defence Minister had left. The setting was somewhat informal. General Rawat asked: “How are you, when is the book coming.” He was referring to the book which The Tribune is producing to honour the war heroes of 1971. General Rawat had contributed a message to be incorporated in the book.Just a few feet away was Madhulika Rawat with a group of officers’ wives. Like any wife of a senior ‘fauji’ officer, she called in the younger ladies for a group picture.On seeing another journalist and I close by, Madhulika Rawat called out: “Could you guys please take a picture?” My reporter colleague took Madhulika Rawat’s phone to click the image. That was the last I saw of the Rawats.Biggest military loss in crash since 1963 Poonch tragedy New Delhi: In November 1963, an IAF helicopter was on its way to Poonch in J&K when it crashed, with distinguished officers on board, making it the biggest loss of military leadership in a single accident.

09-12-2021||---||Sonia Gandhi demands discussion on border issues, agri sector||New Delhi, December 8Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday saluted the tenacity of farmers for the repeal of three farm laws and backed their pending demands for a legally guaranteed MSP and compensation to the families of deceased protesters.Addressing a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary party today, Sonia demanded a discussion in the ongoing winter session on the border issue and challenges confronting the agriculture sector.“It is extraordinary that the Parliament has been given no opportunity whatsoever so far to have a discussion on the challenges we continue to face on our borders. Such a discussion would have also been an opportunity to demonstrate a collective will and resolve. The government may not want to answer difficult questions, but it is the right and duty of the Opposition to seek clarifications and explanations. The government steadfastly refuses to allocate time for a debate. I would once again urge for a full-fledged discussion on the border situation and relations with our neighbours,” Sonia said.In wide ranging remarks, the Congress chief attacked the government over the state of the economy, Covid-19 vaccine coverage, sale of public assets and rising prices of essential commodities.She also hoped the national preparedness to deal with Omicron was high. “I hope the government has learnt a lesson from the previous waves of Covid-19 and is preparing itself to dealing effectively with the new variant,” she said, terming the suspension of 12 Opposition MPs as unprecedented and shocking.“It is the solidarity and tenacity of the farmers that has forced an arrogant government to climb down. Let us salute them for their great achievement,” she said.Congress delegates stopped from going to Nagaland Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said the party would not budge from the path of finding the truth of the civilian killings in Nagaland. He was reacting to alleged detention in Assam of a Congress delegation visiting Nagaland to meet with the families of 14 civilians who died in a botched-up anti-insurgency operation.

The book was launched by former CJI SA Bobde, who described Justice Gogoi as “a reluctant man of destiny”.Talking about the Ayodhya case, he said, “I didn’t bring Ayodhya out of the cold storage. My predecessors left that for me. So, I had only two options to either fight or flight. And as Justice Bobde mentioned, I come from a family of warriors. So, of course...I fight.”Asked why Kashmir-related cases were not taken up expeditiously, Justice Gogoi said, “I didn’t let Kashmir cases hibernate. I assigned it to the alternate Bench because I had the Ayodhya case to look at.” He said there was nil interference by the Executive in Judiciary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shouldnt-have-been-on-bench-ex-cji-gogoi-on-sexual-harassment-charges-348103

09-12-2021||New Delhi||Bipin Rawat ? An outstanding, forthright military commander with vision of tri-service synergy||A quintessential military commander, Gen Bipin Rawat possessed an uncanny understanding of geopolitical upheavals, calibrated a tri-services military doctrine to make India face myriad security challenges, and is largely credited with bringing down militancy in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir.As India’s first Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Rawat was tasked to bring in theatre command and jointness among the three services, and he was pushing it with a tough approach and specific timelines in the last two years.Read also:Known to be forthright, fearless, and blunt at times, the outstanding military commander ruffled many feathers with his controversial remarks during his tenure as Army Chief and Chief of Defence Staff.He strongly backed a policy of hot pursuit in dealing with cross-border terrorism and militancy in Jammu and Kashmir when he was the Army Chief between 2016 and 2019.Much before the Doklam standoff in 2017, Gen Rawat had highlighted that India’s primary and long-term security challenge would come from an increasingly assertive China and that India needed to modernise its armed forces to confront it.Gen Rawat had also played a major role in successfully carrying out the 2015 cross-border operation into Myanmar in response to a major ambush by Naga militants.He was also part of the planning when India carried out surgical strikes against terror launch pads across the Line of Control in Pakistani-Occupied Kashmir that inflicted significant casualties on the adversary.Gen Rawat was the Chief of Army Staff when Indian fighter jets pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan’s Balakot, and was reportedly part of the decision-making process and provided key inputs for the operation.The first sitting Chief of Army Staff to be appointed as the CDS, Gen Rawat had an illustrious career spanning over four decades during which he served with distinction in several conflict-ridden areas, including Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast.In 2017, Gen Rawat faced criticism for awarding the Chief of Army Staff’s Commendation card to Major Leetul Gogoi for efforts in counter-insurgency operations. Gogoi had tied a man to his military jeep purportedly as a shield against stone pelters during the 2017 Srinagar by-election.In 2019, his comments relating to protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act triggered criticism.In September, Gen Rawat talked about the theory of “clash of civilisations” while mentioning the western civilisation and China’s growing relations with countries like Iran and Turkey.A day later, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar sought to distance the government from the controversial comments and said India had never subscribed to any clash of civilisations theory.Rawat was born in Pauri, Uttarakhand, on March 16, 1958. His family had been serving in the Indian Army for multiple generations. His father Laxman Singh Rawat was from Sainj village of the Pauri Garhwal district and rose to the rank of Lt General.Rawat attended Cambrian Hall School in Dehradun and the St Edward’s School, Shimla.He was a graduate of the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), Wellington and the Higher Command Course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

He then commanded a multinational Brigade in a Chapter VII mission in Congo under UN mission.After promotion to Major General, Rawat took over as the General Officer Commanding 19th Infantry Division at Uri.As a Lt General, he commanded III Corps headquartered in Dimapur before taking over the Southern Army in Pune.He was appointed as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) Southern Command on 1 January 2016 and months later became the Vice Chief of Army Staff.In December 2016, he was appointed as the 27th Chief of the Army Staff, superseding two senior Lt Generals, Praveen Bakshi and P M Hariz.He is survived by two daughters.
