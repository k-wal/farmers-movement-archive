It would be only a non-speaking order which is an instance of violation of principles of natural justice.  In such a case the prosecution or the informant has a right to assail the order before a higher forum,” the bench said.The top court’s observations came on appeals against an order of Patna High Court which granted bail to an accused in a murder case.The apex court said while it was conscious of the fact that the liberty of an individual is an invaluable right, at the same time while considering an application for bail courts cannot lose sight of the serious nature of the accusations against an accused.“While considering an application for grant of bail a prima facie conclusion must be supported by reasons and must be arrived at after having regard to the vital facts of the case brought on record.“Due consideration must be given to facts suggestive of the nature of the crime, the criminal antecedents of the accused if any, and the nature of punishment that would follow a conviction vis­-a-­vis the offence/s alleged against an accused,” the bench said.

17-12-2021||Washington||J&K, Northeast India and Maoist-hit regions in central India hit by terror activities in 2020: US report||Terror outfits such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen, ISIS and Al-Qaeda continue to be active in the Indian subcontinent, with Jammu and Kashmir, Northeast India and Maoist-hit regions in central India being hit by terror activities, according to the latest report on terrorism released by the US State Department.The Indian government had made significant efforts to detect and disrupt operations of major terrorist organisations within its borders, but threats persist, the report titled ‘2020 Country Reports on Terrorism’ said.“In 2020, terrorism affected the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), Northeast India and Maoist-affected regions in central India. Major terrorist groups have been active in India, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen, ISIS and Al-Qaeeda in the Indian subcontinent,” the report, which is published annually, said on Thursday.The report cites the example of crackdown by the Indian security agencies on several key members of Al-Qaeeda-affiliated outfit Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind in Jammu & Kashmir. In September 2020, the United States and India held the 17th meeting of the Counterterrorism Joint Working Group and Third US-India Designations Dialogue. In December, India had proposed holding another Quad counterterrorism tabletop exercise along with the United States, Australia, and Japan, the report said. Although insurgent groups continue to operate in the Northeast, levels of terrorist violence have decreased. The report also examined the decreasing presence of Khalistan groups in the country. “The many organisations involved in the Sikh separatist (Khalistan) movement have not engaged in significant recent activities within India’s borders,” it said. Observing that the National Security Guard has improved its response time and reduced past dependence on other agencies for logistics, the US State Department report insisted that challenges including budget constraints and dependence on temporary details and volunteers from the armed forces remained. Noting that Indian security agencies were effective in disrupting terror threats, gaps remained in inter-agency intelligence and information sharing, the report said. In the absence of a National Counter Terrorism Centre, the Indian Multi-Agency Centre (MAC) collaborates with the United States on exchanging terrorist screening information and conducting real-time collation and sharing of intelligence among federal and state security agencies. Several Indian states have established state-level MACs to disseminate terrorism information to law enforcement, it said. “Indian security forces demonstrate limited capacity to patrol and secure extensive maritime and land borders.India is implementing UNSCR 2396 to improve detection and deterrence of terrorist travel by using watchlists, implementing biographic and biometric screening at ports of entry, and expanding information sharing,” the report added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jk-northeast-india-and-maoist-hit-regions-in-central-india-hit-by-terror-activities-in-2020-us-report-351484
17-12-2021||New Delhi||SC grants disability pension to former Territorial Army soldier||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the grant of disability pension to a Territorial Army soldier suffering from 80 per cent disability.A Bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said as per the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961, an individual who is invalided out of service on account of disability, which is attributable or aggravated by military service in non­battle casualty and is assessed 20 per cent or more, would be entitled to disability pension.The apex court said the Ecological Task Force (ETF), of which the petitioner was a member, is established as an additional company for the 130 Infantry Battalion of the Territorial Army.“It is not in dispute that the other officers or enrolled persons working in the Territorial Army are entitled to disability pension under Regulation No. 173 read with Regulation No. 292 of Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961.“When the appellant is enrolled as a member of ETF, which is a company for 130 Infantry Battalion (Territorial Army), we see no reason as to why the appellant was denied the disability pension. Specifically so, when the medical board and court of inquiry have found that the injury sustained by the appellant was attributable to the military service and not due to his own negligence,” the Bench said.Rejecting the Centre’s submission that petitioner Pani Ram had signed a document agreeing to the condition that he will not be getting any enhanced pension, the apex court said members of the Territorial Army would be entitled to disability pension.“As held by this court, a Right to Equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution of India would also apply to a man who has no choice or rather no meaningful choice, but to give his assent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard form or to accept a set of rules as part of the contract, however unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a clause in that contract or form or rules may be.“We find that the said observations rightly apply to the facts of the present case. Can it be said that the mighty Union of India and an ordinary soldier who had fought for the country and retired from the regular Army, seeking reemployment in Territorial Army, have equal bargaining power? We are therefore of the considered view that the reliance placed on the said document would also be of no assistance to the case of the respondents,” the Bench said.The top court directed the Centre to grant disability pension to the appellant in accordance with the rules and regulations as are applicable to members of the Territorial Army with effect from January 1, 2012.It also directed it to clear arrears within a period of three months from the date of the judgment with interest at the rate of nine per cent per annum.Petitioner Pani Ram was serving as a sepoy in the Territorial Army. On April 24, 2009, he met with a serious accident, and his right leg was amputated above the knee.The petitioner was invalided out of service with 80 per cent disability on January 1, 2012. A court of inquiry found that the injury sustained by him was attributable to military service and not due to his own negligence. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-grants-disability-pension-to-former-territorial-army-soldier-351483

17-12-2021||Pune||Maha State Council of Examination Commissioner arrested for ‘scam’ in teachers’ eligibility test||The commissioner of the Maharashtra State Council of Examination (MSCE) and another person have been arrested for allegedly taking money to tamper with results of the Teachers’ Eligibility Test (TET) held last year, Pune Police said on Friday.The malpractices in the TET, held in January 2020, came to light during the probe of a paper leak in the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) recruitment examination, said city Police Commissioner Amitabh Gupta.MSCE commissioner Tukaram Supe and one Abhishek Sawrikar, an advisor with the education department, were arrested by the cyber cell of city police on Thursday following questioning, he added.Supe, in connivance with Sawrikar and two others, allegedly took money to change the results of some candidates so that they could clear the test.The cyber police recovered over Rs 88 lakh in cash, gold jewelry and incriminating documents from Supe’s possession, Gupta said.“During the investigation of MHADA paper leak, we had arrested Pritesh Deshmukh, director of GA Software which was responsible for conducting the exam, and agent Santosh Harkal.“During the probe, malpractices in the TET came to light,” Gupta said.GA Software was also responsible for conducting the TET.“Supe and Sawrikar with the help of Deshmukh and Harkal allegedly received between Rs 35,000 to 1 lakh from each candidate, increased their marks and made them eligible,” Gupta said.As per preliminary estimates, the accused had received over Rs 4 crore from the candidates, the police commissioner said.A police release claimed that the accused confessed that Supe had received Rs 1.70 crore, while Deshmukh and Sawrikar had received Rs 1.25 crore each.Asked if Pune Police will probe other past examinations where GA Software was involved, Gupta said if anything suspicious was found, police will definitely look into it.Speaking about the modus operandi allegedly adopted by Supe and others, Gupta said the candidates from whom money was received were asked to keep their OMR (optical mark recognition) sheets and it was filled with right options just before they were sent for scanning.The MSEC had issued a notice to GA Software for not adhering to the norms such as producing CCTV footage of OMR sheet scanning, police said.“GA Software had been also blacklisted but Supe removed the firm from the list,” the release claimed.Supe and Sawrikar were sent to police custody till December 17 by a local court on Friday, it added.

17-12-2021||Rae Bareli||BJP government has made people face only shortages, humiliation: Akhilesh Yadav||The BJP government has subjected people only to shortages and humiliation, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav alleged on Friday, asserting that ‘Samajwad’ is a synonym of ‘Ramrajya’.Yadav made the allegation while addressing a public meeting in Bachravan assembly constituency here before starting the seventh leg of his ‘Samajwadi Vijay Yatra’ ahead of the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.The BJP government has made people only suffer from “dikkat, killat and zillat” (difficulties, shortages and humiliation), the SP supremo alleged.“No government has given so many problems to people, as the BJP government. Today there is a shortage of everything. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were shortages of medicines, medical treatment and oxygen,” he said.“People have never faced so much of ‘dikkat’ (problems), ‘killat’ (shortage) and ‘zillat’ (humiliation) in any government as it is in this government. People are feeling humiliated today, the BJP which is in power has been insulting people,” he said.Alleging a shortage of fertilisers for farmers, the SP chief said, “Is anybody getting fertiliser? If you check fertiliser bags, you will find them 5 kg lighter (than the quantity mentioned on bags). I don’t know from where the BJP gets to learn such things”. “As the price rise (of various items) is making its presence felt, there is a shortage of fertiliser. It seems they have learnt this (trick) from a Parle-G biscuit,” he said, alluding to the alleged reduction in the number of biscuits in the popular snack packs with the same price.“The price is the same but the number of biscuits has come down. The BJP too has similarly kept the price unchanged but has reduced the quantity of fertiliser,” he said.Highlighting the rise in fuel prices, Yadav said the BJP has surpassed the Congress party in burdening the poor’s miseries while enriching the rich.“The prices of petrol and diesel have spiralled. They (BJP) has emptied the poor’s pockets and filled the coffers of the rich. This was not done even by the Congress party. They have surpassed the Congress,” the SP supremo said.Taking a dig at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath, Akhilesh said: “Even people in the villages have started using mobile phones and they know how to use them. But our Baba chief minister does not know how to operate it”.   “Since he does not know how to use a laptop, he is not distributing laptops to youths. The laptops that were distributed during the SP regime are still working today,” he said.There is so much inflation and unemployment in Uttar Pradesh because the UP chief minister works 24 hours a day, he said in another dig at Chief Minister Adityanath.After visiting the Lord Hanuman temple, Yadav tweeted the last stanza of an eight-verse prayer to Lord Hanuman (Hanuman Ashtak) along with the deity’s photographs and said, “Started the Samajwadi Vijay Yatra with the blessings of Lord Hanuman after paying obeisance to him”. In a subsequent tweet, Yadav also asserted that “samajwad”, after which his party has been named, is synonymous with ‘Ramrajya’.“Working for the good of all, striving for the unbiased equity and equality for all without any discrimination is the key principle of both the Samajwad and Ramrajya. Samajwad, in fact, is a synonym of Ramrajya,” Yadav tweeted.“In Ramrajya, an environment of fearlessness is created, one is not attacked stealthily,” he said. Yadav visited Rae Bareli a day before the slated march of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the neighbouring district of Amethi.Rae Bareli and Amethi both are considered bastions of the Gandhi family but Rahul Gandhi had lost the Amethi parliamentary seat to BJP’s Smriti Irani. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, however, had been able to retain the Rae Bareli seat.The Churuva Hanuman temple has been one of the favourite halts of politicians heading to Rae Bareli from Lucknow.Both Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi have visited the temple on their way to Amethi and Rae Bareli.In January 2018, after becoming the Congress president, Rahul Gandhi had visited the temple on his way to Amethi from Lucknow during a two-day tour.Priyanka Gandhi too visited the temple in September while heading to her mother Sonia Gandhi’s parliamentary constituency Rae Bareli on a two-day tour. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-government-has-made-people-face-only-shortages-humiliation-akhilesh-yadav-351471

Results of 10 people have been declared in which eight have been tested for Delta variant, one Omicron variant (December 15) and another non-sequence. The sample of the passenger who has been declared as ‘non-sequence’ will be tested again”, he said.Subramanian said health department officials were in the process of conducting RT-PCR testing on 278 people who were contacts of the passenger who was confirmed with Omicron variant in Tamil Nadu on arrival from Nigeria.

17-12-2021||New Delhi||‘Draft Regional Plan 2041’ proposes to limit National Capital Region to 100-km radius from Rajghat||The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) in its ‘Draft Regional Plan 2041’ has proposed to limit the National Capital Region to 100-km radius from Rajghat in Delhi for more “focused” and “sustainable” development of the region.‘The Draft Regional Plan 2041’ also said that beyond 100 km radius and up to the existing NCR boundary, linear corridors will be developed which will cover areas falling within one km from expressways, national highways, state highways and regional rapid transit system.This will pave way for focused development of areas falling along these corridors, it said.‘The Draft Regional Plan 2041’ was put in public domain on Thursday and suggestions or objections have been invited until January 7. Thereafter, it will be notified by the board.The NCRPB has given in-principle approval to the ‘Draft Regional Plan 2041’ in its meeting on October 12 this year.Currently, the NCR spreads to around 150-175 km covering entire districts, tehsils and their rural areas. But with the approval of Regional Plan 2041, areas beyond 100 km are unlikely to be the main part of the NCR.“The National Capital Region should primarily be a contiguous circular region of 100 km radius from Rajghat (Delhi). If any tehsil exists on either side of the 100 km delineation, then the decision to include or exclude the whole of the tehsil will be left to the respective state governments,” the draft regional plan 2041 said.“Beyond 100-km radius and up to the existing NCR boundary, all notified cities/towns along with a corridor of 01 km on either side of connecting expressways/national highways/state highways/regional rapid transit system, will be included (in the NCR),” it added.The draft plan said the exercise for delineation or revision of NCR boundary is currently underway, but it will come into effect after being notified by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.According to the Regional Draft Plan 2041, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan had conveyed that if any tehsil exists partially within the 100-km radius from Rajghat (Delhi), then the whole of such tehsil should be included in the NCR area.However, Haryana has conveyed its decision to keep only those tehsils within the NCR, which are covered entirely within the 100-km radius from Rajghat.The regional plan said there will be no change in NCR in UP sub-region. The Rajasthan sub-region of NCR has yet to be worked out.However, Haryana has conveyed that its total area in NCR may come down to 10546.42 sq km from existing 25,327 sq km in the revised NCR boundaries.“Haryana has conveyed some tentative details showing that the total area of 14 districts in NCR currently is 25,327 sq km, of which area proposed in future NCR as covered within 100-km radius, considering only entire tehsils falling within this radius comes to 10546.42 sq km,” the draft plan said.Haryana did not convey details of tehsils proposed for inclusion or exclusion in the revised NCR.Officials on the board clarified that towns such as Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Sonipat, some areas of Meerut and others will remain part of the NCR as they fall under 100-km radius.The officials explained that after the new regional plan is notified, the NCR will be like a circle with bends and bulges that will also have linear corridors like spikes emerging out of a circle.Areas beyond 100 km will be out of NCR but if a tehsil is falling partially in the redefined boundary of the NCR, then it will be decided by the respective state if the town will go with NCR or will remain out of it.“For example, if Rewari is partially falling into redefined NCR boundaries, then it will be for the Haryana government to decide if it will be part of the NCR or not,” the official explained.He added that such exercises will ensure harmonious development of the region.The draft plan 2041 said Haryana has also conveyed a list of 26 municipal committees, 13 municipal councils and seven municipal corporations which will continue to be part of NCR.

17-12-2021||Mumbai||Varavara Rao medically stable as per hospital report, he must surrender before jail: NIA tells Bombay HC||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday told the Bombay High Court that the health condition of poet Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case who is currently on an interim medical bail granted in February this year, was stable and hence must surrender before the prison authorities.NIA's counsel Sandesh Patil told a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and S V Kotwal that 83-year-old Rao had been medically examined earlier this month by a panel of doctors at the private Nanavati Hospital in the city and the doctors were of the opinion that Rao does not need continuous medical attention or hospitalisation at present. Before being granted medical bail, Rao was lodged in Taloja prison of Navi Mumbai.  "His health condition is stable now and the time granted via medical bail to him by this court is already over. So he (Rao) should surrender now. All other issues (raised by Rao's lawyers) can be examined after that," Patil told the high court. Rao was granted medical bail for six months in February this year by a bench led by Justice SS Shinde. He was due to surrender on September 5 this year, but the time of his surrender has been extended several times by the high court since then due to reasons such as need for further medical care, time sought by NIA to get him medically examined, etc. Rao's counsel, senior advocate Anand Grover told the bench on Friday that although the NIA had submitted the Nanavati Hospital's opinion on Rao's medical condition, the same wasn't backed by any medical examination reports. He said that the high court bench must not accept such conclusion of the hospital authorities without insisting on the poet's original medical reports. The report submitted by the NIA is signed by two doctors from the Nanavati Hospital. It says that Rao's health condition was "evaluated by multiple consultants" at the hospital on December 1 this year. "Currently he has minor symptoms, such as lack of sleep and slight exhaustion. His vital parameters are in normal range. The remaining clinical examination reveals no significant abnormalities," the document submitted by the agency reads. It further says that Rao's blood pressure was slightly high and hence, he was prescribed the requisite medication. "He is able to do all his activities of daily living," the document states, adding though that Rao experiences "some slowness in activities."  After going through the report, the bench led by Justice Jamdar asked Grover why the court must insist on verifying the claims made in the document when it clearly stated that Rao had been examined as per the high court's order passed on November 18 and that he was deemed to be medically stable by the hospital. "The hospital of your choice saying that everything is normal now," the HC said.Grover however, said that the high court must keep in mind orders of the Supreme Court that say that an appellate court has the mandate to check if the expert opinion is correct and is based on medical reports or facts. "No expert opinion can be without reasons, this is now a settled law," Grover said. The high court then directed that the Nanavati Hospital submit Rao's original medical reports by Monday, December 20."Ask the hospital to submit original medical reports on Monday. If we find there is something that needs to be addressed, we will hear the parties," the high court told the NIA.  It further said that Rao needn't surrender before the Taloja prison authorities till then. —  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/varavara-rao-medically-stable-as-per-hospital-report-he-must-surrender-before-jail-nia-tells-bombay-hc-351453

These public representatives have been elected to represent the cause of women inside the Assembly. He should apologise to every woman of the country for making such a derogatory statement and strict action must be initiated against him," Sharma told PTI."It is extremely sad and unfortunate that we still have public representatives who are misogynists and have a horrible mindset towards women.

That's it. This is what I feel. I should give up controlling the situation and take the proceedings in a systematic manner, I should tell everyone to continue your talks," Kageri said laughing. He explained that his only grievance is that the business of the house is not happening.Kumar, a former minister, intervened and said, "See, there is a saying- when rape is inevitable, lie down and enjoy it.

17-12-2021||New Delhi||Ready to provide additional Rafale jets if India requires them: French defence minister||France is ready to provide additional Rafale fighter jets to India if it requires, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said on Friday while noting that the use of the same aircraft by the two strategic partners is a reflection of “real asset and strength” in their ties.Parly, on a visit to India, also said that France is fully committed to supporting the ‘Make in India’ initiative and further integrating the Indian manufacturers into its global supply chains.The French defence minister made the comments at an interactive session  organised by Ananta Centre on India-France cooperation.“I am very happy that the Indian Air Force is satisfied with its Rafale and we are very proud that despite COVID, the 36 aircraft will be delivered on time according to the contract, it is a real achievement,” she said in response to a question.“Using the same aircraft is a real asset and strength. I am sure that there is room for new developments. We are ready to answer any additional needs of request that could be made by India,” she said.The French embassy on Thursday said a total of 33 Rafale jets have already been delivered to India as per schedule despite the COVID-19 pandemic.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 59,000 crore.The first batch of five Rafale jets, manufactured by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, arrived in India on July 29 last year.The French minister also referred to India’s planned induction of a second aircraft carrier and indicated that France will be interested to supply the carrier-based jets.“We know that the aircraft carrier will soon be (there)...that aircraft are needed. We are open and ready to provide any other Rafale if this is India’s decision,” she said.India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC) Vikrant is scheduled to be inducted into the Indian Navy by August next year.In her comments, Parly said France and India are both “viscerally committed” to national sovereignty and independence.“I think that our industrial partnership is proof of that. France, more than any other country, understands the necessity of the Indian content. And we are fully committed to the ‘Make in India’ initiative, as well as to the further integration of Indian manufacturers into our global supply chains,” she said.Parly said ‘Make in India’ has been a reality for the French industry for several years, particularly for defence equipment such as submarines.Later, the French defence minister held wide-ranging talks with her Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, with a focus on further enhancing bilateral defence and security cooperation between the two countries.The defence and strategic ties between India and France have been on an upswing over the last few years.It is learnt that France was pitching for starting negotiations for procurement of another batch of 36 Rafale jets by India.The Rafale jets are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The Rafale jets are capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.Meteor is a next-generation beyond visual range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat.

Since then it has been awarded to Chief Abotts such as Ngawang Jigme Chhoedra and Thrizur Tenzin Dendup.The development comes two months after China and Bhutan signed an MoU on a three-step roadmap for expediting their boundary negotiations which may also include discussions on Doklam.China has settled its land borders with 12 out of 14 land neighbours with India and Bhutan the only standouts. The perception is that Bhutan had earlier stalled border talks with China in solidarity with India.At the same time, Bhutan signalled solidarity with its South Asian nations on December 16 Victory Day when its military contingent marched along with its counterparts from India and Russia in Dhaka where President Ram Nath Kovind was the sole invited head of state. While the US had also sent a token military team, China was the sole significant country whose presence in Dhaka was low key.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhutan-gives-its-highest-civilian-award-to-pm-narendra-modi-351423

He attacked the BJP government for ignoring the role of Indira Gandhi in the 1971 war victory.“My grandmother took 32 bullets for the unity and integrity of the country... On my way to Uttarakhand, two dates came to my mind — October 31 when my grandmother was martyred and May 21 when my father was assassinated. And the word that struck me was sacrifice,” he told the gathering as he launched his party’s campaign in Uttarakhand.The Congress leader said the credit for the 1971 victory went to the “united fight put up by Indians regardless of their caste or religion. The country spoke in one voice and America’s Seventh Fleet was forced to return.” In a dig at the Union Government, Rahul said helicopters and fighter aircraft did not strengthen a country. “A country becomes strong when its people are strong.”He attacked the Modi government over demonetisation and GST, describing these as “tools” of capitalists. “Take it from me, the youth in this country will not get jobs until the BJP government in New Delhi is removed,” he claimed. Pointing out that fuel prices had fallen in the international market, but owing to the high fuel tax in India there had been no relief for the common man, he alleged the Centre was only benefiting capitalists.“Farm laws too were aimed at finishing farmers and helping the capitalists,” the Congress leader claimed, promising to safeguard the interests of farmers and the youth, if the Congress was voted to power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/united-fight-by-indians-led-to-1971-victory-says-rahul-351120

Mishra’s shocking outburst at journalists was “wrong”, they say, adding that he had been “cautioned”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-brass-ticks-off-mishra-for-his-outburst-against-scribes-351112

Canisters of ghee lie around in the family patriarch’s room with visitors contributing their part to the offering.“Everyone who visits here believes that Baba Tikait (Mahendra Tikait) still lives in this room. As a family tradition, we have kept everything here just as Babaji would have liked. The flame he lit burns constantly,” said Gaurav, Naresh Tikait’s son.Gaurav recalls the day Mahendra Tikait left the house for the 1987 agitation against a proposed power bill hike in the region. “The Shamli district power house was gheraoed that day. Soon the agitation which started with a few farmers gathered momentum and turned into a gathering of over three lakh,” recalled Reshpal Singh, who participated in various agitations.The family legacy of struggle for farmers’ rights continues with Rakesh Tikait leading the anti-farm law agitation at Delhi borders to a major conclusion. But the Tikaits are in no mood to rest on their past laurels.They are meeting top leaders of the Baliyan khap panchayat at Sisauli tomorrow to assess the gains and losses of the 383-day agitation and discuss other issues of concern. Naresh Tikait, chief of the Baliyan khap which has 84 village heads, said, “The stir has ended, but the story of farmers’ unity has just begun.”Keeping flame burningFlame lit by BKU leader Rakesh Tikait’s father Mahendra Tikait on March 1, 1987, has remained illuminated ever since.

It called for regulating social media platforms for their content and to be denied permission unless the parent company has an office in India. Further, a statutory media regulatory authority, on the lines of the Press Council of India, should regulate the content on these platforms.The panel also asked the government to bring back mirror copy of sensitive and critical data and localise it. It should also develop an indigenous financial system to replace SWIFT the privacy of which “has been compromised widely”.It also suggested mechanisms for dealing with children’s data, single-window system for complaints and 72-hour deadline for reporting data breach. It was also against making heads of government departments directly responsible for data breach. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-moots-tighter-regulations-for-social-media-351105
