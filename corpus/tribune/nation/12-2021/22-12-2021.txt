22-12-2021||New Delhi||India should emerge world leader in post-Covid global order: PM Modi||India should emerge a world leader in the post-Covid global order, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday, calling for “surging ahead with a focused approach setting new targets for ourselves for 2047”.Addressing the second meeting of the national committee on ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, Modi said the pandemic has taught new lessons and shattered the existing structures which will lead to the emergence of a “new world order” in the post-Covid era, according to a statement.It is commonly stated that the 21st century belongs to Asia, and it is important to focus on India’s stature in Asia in this century, he said.Emphasising that this is an opportune time to set eyes on 2047 when the country will celebrate 100 years of independence, he said the current generation will be at the helm of affairs then and the nation’s destiny will be in their hands.“Therefore, it is important to decide what we must inculcate in them now so that they will be able to make big contributions in the future towards the country,” he said.“We have always insisted upon and fought for our rights but there is a higher greatness in following one’s duties,” he added.It is only when people follow their duties religiously that they are able to ensure rights of others automatically, he said.Therefore, as Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is celebrated, the commitment to duty should be the uppermost priority and the pledge to contribute meaningfully for the country should be the main resolve, he said, asserting the programme will sow the seed of a sense of duty among the youth.Noting that it must be remembered that the future is always born in the lap of the past, he said people must not forget their forefathers who have sacrificed their youth, their lives and their families for the country.No stone should be left unturned to pay respect to the freedom fighters and unsung heroes of the freedom movement, he said.“The Prime Minister concluded that as we observe Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, we should surge ahead with a focused approach setting new targets for ourselves for 2047,” the statement said.The members of the national committee who attended the meeting included the Lok Sabha speaker, governors, Union ministers, chief ministers, political leaders, officials, media personalities, spiritual leaders, artists, film personalities and eminent personalities from other walks of life, it said.Culture ministry secretary Govind Mohan gave a presentation on the overview of activities of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, being held to mark the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence.The members who gave inputs at the meeting included former prime minister H D Deve Gowda; governors Acharya Devvrat and Arif Mohammad Khan; chief ministers Yogi Adityanath, Ashok Gehlot and Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy; BJP president J P Nadda, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, iconic singer Lata Mangeshkar and actor Rajnikanth among others.

22-12-2021||Kochi||Kerala to pay Rs 1.75 lakh to girl traumatised, terrorised by pink cop: HC||The LDF government was on Wednesday directed by the Kerala High Court to cough up Rs 1.75 lakh towards compensation and litigation cost for the “trauma” and “terror” caused to a minor girl by a pink police officer, who “acted as judge, jury and executioner” while accusing the child and her father of theft.The court said the pink patrol unit, a revolutionary initiative of the state, was “ironically” expected to provide “solace and protection” to the child, but instead one of its officers ended up “terrorizing” the girl in full public gaze.“The abject helplessness and despondency that the child must have gone through at that point of time can never be properly described and it is evident she suffered grave trauma and fear, being terrorized in full public gaze by a police officer who ironically was expected to offer her solace and protect her being the pink patrol unit,” Justice Devan Ramachandran said.Besides the pink police officer, the court also found the state and the police lacking in protecting the child, as instead of rising to her defense and offering her some reparation, the “sternly refused” to even recognise the trauma suffered by her.“I expected the state to rise to her defence, because she is their daughter as much as she is ours, and to offer her some amount as reparation, which this court certainly would have accepted, however small or large it was.“But their stern refusal to even recognise her mental trauma and terror she went through would certainly require this court to sit up and take notice,” the judge said.The state and the police, defending the actions of the officer, had contended that the girl never faced any intimidation on account of the officer’s actions and therefore, none of her fundamental rights were violated.They had also said no serious misconduct can be attributed against the officer, in relation to the incident, as her reaction was only “natural” when she was under the impression that her phone had been stolen by the girl’s father.The state and police had also contended that the officer was entitled to the protection available under Section 113 of the Kerala Police Act, which insulates an officer from any suit or legal proceedings in respect of his/her conduct in good faith as part of their official duties.They had claimed that the officer’s actions were in discharge of her duties and she had no intention of intimidating the girl or her father.Justice Ramachandran rejected all these contentions in the more than two hour long proceedings, of which more than hour was devoted to dictating the order in open court that was packed with lawyers.The court said that the officer in question, in her affidavit, has admitted to have acted in the heat of the moment when she found her phone missing and despite this, the state and the police continued to support her and “deny the girl her legitimate rights under the public law doctrine by saying that the facts, particularly the time at which the child began crying, of the incident were disputed”.The court said it was “irrelevant” when the child started crying and what was important was that she did “which can only be because she was terrorised and feeling despondent when confronted by an officer in uniform and being accused of stealing and hiding a mobile phone”.It said in view of what the child went through, “no one can dispute her fundamental rights to lead a dignified and full life have been violated on account of the incident”.“It does not matter whether the officer acted vindictively, viciously or deliberately. The fact that the girl went through the harrowing experience, which will leave a scar on her psychological development, is ipso facto sufficient to grant her reparatory relief under the public law remedy”, the court said.With regard to the protection available to police officers under Section 113 of the Kerala Police Act, the court said it would not be applicable in the instant case as “respondent 4 was trying to find her own phone and was virtually acting as judge, jury and executioner in her own cause”.The court went on to direct the state government to pay Rs 1.5 lakh to the girl as compensation, Rs 25,000 as litigation cost and to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the errant officer.It also directed that till the disciplinary proceedings are initiated and concluded, the officer shall be kept away from duties, which would require her to interact with the general public and further ordered that she should be given necessary training on interpersonal relationships with the public at large.The court said the training was important, keeping in mind the larger requirement of police officers dealing with the public in a civilized manner as has been often stated by it in several judgements and orders in the past.With these directions, the court disposed of a plea filed by the 8-year-old girl, seeking a direction to the government to take stern action against the officer for infringing her fundamental right.She had also sought Rs 50 lakh as compensation, but the court said the amount awarded by it was sufficient and the petitioner was entitled to seek higher damages under civil law.The court also said the petitioner and her father can proceed with any other litigation they may want to initiate against the officer.The incident occurred on August 27 when Attingal resident Jayachandran reached Moonumukku with his eight-year-old daughter, who wanted to watch the movement of a massive cargo to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in Thumba.Rajitha, the woman Pink police officer, was deployed to assist in traffic regulation and she accused the duo of stealing her mobile phone that was kept in the police vehicle.In a video which went viral, the officer and her colleague were seen harassing the father and the daughter and even frisking him. The child broke down amid their harassment.However, when an onlooker dialled the number of the officer, the mobile phone was found in the police vehicle, following which the police team left the scene without even tendering an apology to the father and the daughter.As part of a disciplinary action, the woman officer was transferred and the State police chief directed her to undergo behavioural training.

22-12-2021||Kutch (Gujarat)||No ‘pro-Pakistan’ slogan at poll victory march in Kutch; facts twisted: cops on viral video||Police investigation into a video in Gujarat has disclosed that no slogans in favour of Pakistan were prima facie raised during the rally of a candidate who won the village panchayat election in Kutch district contrary to the claims made on social media and other platforms, officials said on Wednesday.A police officer said that a probe will be conducted and action taken against the people who spread the misinformation claiming that some people had shouted ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ during the victory rally of Reenaben Radhubhai Kothiwad, soon after the result of the panchayat election was declared in Dudhai village on Tuesday.     Earlier in the day, Gujarat Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi had cited this video and said Kutch (East) SP and Border Range IG were directed to take immediate action.The video had gone viral on social media with accompanying messages claiming that a group of people shouted pro-Pakistan slogans during the victory procession of a woman candidate.“Reenaben Radhubhai Kothiwad won the election as the woman sarpanch of Dudhai village, results of which were declared on Tuesday. In her victory rally, her supporters shouted ‘Radhubhai zindabad’ twice. However, some people misrepresented the video to claim that people shouted ‘Pakistan zindabad,” Superintendent of Police (Kutch East), Mayur Patil told reporters.He said if the video clip is listened to quietly, one can hear that, after eight seconds, people are shouting ‘Radhubhai zindabad’ twice.According to Patil, a probe will be conducted and action will be taken against people who twisted the words to spread misinformation.“We will issue a warning to the journalist who shared this video on Twitter without proper verification. We will also write to the organisation he is working for,” the SP said.Sanghavi had said that a proper investigation was being conducted in the incident of slogan-shouting (at the rally) after the poll result in Kutch.“We are taking action with all seriousness. I assure you that all those who are involved in shouting the slogan will be arrested,” the minister had told reporters.He also cited another viral video of a locality in Surat, saying a family living there was being harassed by some persons “despite the imposition of the Disturbed Areas Act”. Sanghavi said that Surat Police are investigating. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-pro-pakistan-slogan-at-poll-victory-march-in-kutch-facts-twisted-cops-on-viral-video-353344
22-12-2021||Mumbai||HC extends stay on summons to Alia Bhatt, 2 others over film row||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday extended the stay granted on proceedings in a criminal defamation suit filed against Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt, and authors S Hussain Zaidi and Jane Borges, in connection with the upcoming Hindi film ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’.A single Bench of Justice SK Shinde extended the interim stay that the HC had granted in August this year.Bhatt and the others had moved the HC against the summons issued against them earlier this year by a magistrate court after one Babuji Shah, who claims to be the adopted son of Gangubai Kathiawadi, alleged some portions of the film were defamatory and tarnished the image of his late mother, a powerful madam from Kamathipura, Mumbai’s red light area, during the 1960s.On Wednesday, Justice Shinde said Shah had failed to prove so far that he was Kathiawadi’s legally adopted son.The HC said the issue deserved attention since, in a defamation suit, only one’s close relatives or family members have the right to raise a grievance.“The issue deserves attention since the right to raise grievances against defamation is limited to family members or close relatives, hence it was important for Mr Shah to prove he was one of them,” the HC said.The Bench said prima facie (on the face of it), a case was made out for the grant of interim relief to Bhatt and the others, and stayed the proceedings and summons against them till further hearing of their plea in the HC. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/entertainment/hc-extends-stay-on-summons-to-alia-bhatt-2-others-over-film-row-353343

22-12-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Two women among 4 more held in exam paper leak case; Rs 34 lakh seized||Four more persons, including two women candidates, were arrested on Wednesday by Gujarat’s Sabarkantha police for their alleged involvement in the leaking of a question paper of an exam held on December 12 for the recruitment of government head clerks, said a senior official.Also, more than Rs 34 lakh in cash was recovered from the premises of the main accused, Jayesh Patel, and his aide Dipak Patel, both already arrested, he said.With the latest arrest, the police have so far rounded up 18 persons involved in the alleged crime and recovered cash and other valuables worth Rs 78.46 lakh from them, said Sabarkantha district SP Neeraj Badgujar.The written exam for the recruitment of 186 head clerks was conducted at centres across Gujarat on December 12 by the Gujarat Subordinate Service Selection Board (GSSSB), with nearly 88,000 aspirants appearing for the test. The exam was annulled after the paper leak episode came to light.Those who were arrested on Wednesday were identified by the police as Danabhai Dangar, Keyur Patel, Krupali Patel and Himani Desai.The police also recovered Rs 34.10 lakh in cash from the premises of Jayesh Patel and his aide Dipak Patel, who were arrested earlier, said the SP.“While Dangar was involved in acquiring the question paper from the supervisor of a printing press (where it was printed), Keyur Patel helped Jayesh Patel in gathering candidates at one place to solve the leaked paper. The two arrested women candidates (Krupali Patel and Himani Desai) had appeared for the exam after acquiring and solving the leaked paper from other accused a day before the test,” said Badgujar.Notably, the Gujarat government had on Tuesday cancelled the written test in the “larger interest” of nearly 88,000 candidates who had appeared and announced to hold a fresh exam in March.After the paper leak came to light, an FIR for cheating (IPC section 420), criminal breach of trust (409) and criminal conspiracy (120-B) was lodged at the Prantij police station of Sabarkantha district a week ago.Police investigations have so far revealed Jayesh Patel, a native of Unchha village of Prantij taluka, and other accused persons managed to acquire the question paper from the supervisor of a printing press and sold it to over 15 candidates and also helped them in solving the paper at various locations a day before the exam. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-two-women-among-4-more-held-in-exam-paper-leak-case-rs-34-lakh-seized-353328
22-12-2021||---||Beijing praise for new Indian envoy intrigues China watchers||New Delhi, December 22China watchers are intrigued by the exceptionally warm welcome being accorded by the official commentariat in Beijing to India’s Ambassador-designate for China Pradeep Kumar Rawat.The Global Times led the charge by describing Rawat as the person behind Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India in 2014 which was a “huge success”. It then went on to mention his effort as the head of the China desk in MEA in quarterbacking PM Narendra Modi’s visit to China in 2015 and the 2017 China-India border standoff.The praise for Rawat is then interspersed with some hard real politic on the border dispute where it sets out the Chinese and Indian positions and concludes by asking New Delhi to renegotiate the border issues.There is also a not-so-subtle effort to see daylight between Rawat and the Modi administration, point out the China watchers. “Rawat needs to be pioneering, and should not set preconditions. The Modi administration has been demanding to restore the status quo of April 2020 in eastern Ladakh,” points out the paper.On the previous Indian ambassador to China Vikram Misri, the paper says he had “a closer relationship with Modi, and then hopes that Rawat may not have such close ties with Modi” though he belongs to the “so-called circle of China hands in India”, wrote commentator Liu Zongyi.In another article, Yang Sheng and Yu Xi also praise Rawat for his “rich experience in diplomatic negotiations” but like Liu, they say that “to know China well doesn’t necessarily mean be friendly to China because Indian diplomats’ behavior is driven by India’s internal politics”.Rawat, they reveal, has a Chinese name, “Luo Guodong”, and many Chinese experts on Indian studies are familiar with him. However, some former Indian ambassadors to China also showed positive signs before coming to China, but eventually played “very limited roles in saving China-India ties from getting worse,” points out Lin Minwang of the Institute of International Studies of Fudan University.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/beijing-praise-for-new-indian-envoy-intrigues-china-watchers-353326

Along with this, the estrangement that arose due to property disputes in the former royal family is also expected to reduce.The dispute started about 24 years ago after the death of Jagat Singh in 1997. Former Maharaja Mansingh handed over his property to Jagat Singh, the only son of Maharani Gayatri Devi. But after the death of Jagat Singh, this matter continued in the courts for almost 24 years.Jagat Singh was married to Priyanandana of the Thailand royal family. However, his marriage with Priyanandana did not last long. After the separation of Jagat Singh and Priyanandana, their children Devraj and Lalitya started living with Priyanandana in Thailand.Priyanandana had moved the court because during her stay in Thailand, the Jaimahal Palace was taken over by Vijit Singh, son of Prithviraj Singh, who was Maharaj Mansingh's second wife's son.After this, Priyanandana moved the court to get the rights of her children in this property.Now, the settlement has come through the mediation of Justice Kurian Joseph, a retired Supreme Court judge.According to the agreement, former Maharaj Mansingh of the Jaipur royal family and former Maharani Gayatri Devi's grandson Devraj and granddaughter Lalitya are the successors of late Jagat Singh.According to the agreement, the full rights of Jaimahal Palace, now a five-star hotel located in the heart of Jaipur city, have been handed over to Devraj and Lalitya. The control of Vijit Singh from Jaimahal Palace has been completely removed.The share rights of Rambagh Palace Hotel have been handed over to Jai Singh, son of Maharaja Mansingh, and Vijit Singh, son of Prithviraj. Devraj Singh and Lalitya have also been mentioned in this Supreme Agreement and a clause about compensating them from the share of Rambagh Palace has been mentioned.Both the hotels are under the Tata Group presently.Both entities have accepted the decision, confirmed officials.

22-12-2021||New Delhi||AAP MP takes on Centre on electoral reforms: ‘Stop use of money power’||After having missed an opportunity to express his party's views during a discussion on the Bill to amend election laws in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, Aam Aadmi Party’s Member of Parliament Sushil Gupta on Wednesday took a jibe at the Narendra Modi government saying it should stop the use of money power as an electoral instrument.Gupta was absent when his name was called by the Chair to put forth his party's views on the Bill. Outside Parliament, Gupta said the money power used to influence elections was eating into the innards of democracy.He said the increasing use of money and muscle power has rendered the elections in the country “diseased and debilitated”.“The elections have been blighted and the Centre can not blind side it. The present regime is drunk on power,” Gupta said.The refrain of the opposition parties in the states and at the Centre has been the use of money power by the ruling cliques to change the voting patterns.Gupta further said that the BJP-led government at the Centre should also desist from allegedly creating problems for the governments of the opposition parties in the states.“The opposition parties form governments through a bona fide mandate of the voters. Malafide moves against them are also an effort to belittle the election process,” he said.Launching a tirade against the Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju, who had justified the election laws amendment bill in Rajya Sabha on ground that it was aimed to purge the election roll by linking it with Aadhaar number and to make the elections fair, Gupta said the government is indulging in "smoke and mirror" policy in the matter."What about breaking up parties by weaning away MLAs?" Gupta said."All the claimed purity of election process ends up in smokes, just because the ruling party at the Centre is prone to have a blast at the expense of smaller parties," he added.The AAP is apparently making every attempt to step up its visibility vis-a-vis the Union government in view of the upcoming elections in five states, including in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.It is on a move to go national, banking on its claimed clean image of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, its national convener, and his good governance in National Capital Territory of Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aap-mp-takes-on-centre-on-electoral-reforms-stop-use-of-money-power-353315
