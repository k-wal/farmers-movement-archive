But they need not seek the RBI’s prior approval to buy or transfer immovable property in India, said the apex bank in a clarification after it received a large number of queries based on newspaper reports on a Supreme Court Judgment.The Supreme Court’s judgment on February 26, 2021, in a civil appeal was related to provisions of FERA which has been repealed. At present, NRIs and OCIs are governed by provisions of FEMA and do not require prior approval of the RBI for acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India, other than agricultural land, farm house and plantation property.

29-12-2021||Mumbai||CJI Ramana says news mixed with views is a ‘dangerous cocktail’||Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said on Wednesday a healthy democracy could thrive only with a fearless and independent press, but maintained “news mixed with views is a dangerous cocktail”.The CJI cautioned journalists against the trend of seeping of ideological biases into news stories and said factual reports must keep aside interpretations and opinions.“Another trend that I witness in reporting nowadays, is the seeping of ideological stances and biases into the news story. Interpretation and opinions are colouring what should be factual reports,” he said.“News mixed with views is a dangerous cocktail,” the top-most Supreme Court judge said.The Chief Justice of India was speaking at the ‘Red Inks Award’ organised through a virtual interface by the Mumbai Press Club in the evening.While CJI Ramana congratulated all winners and reiterated how journalism, and truthful reportage was essential to a robust democracy, he lamented the “cherry picking of facts” to give news stories a “certain colour”.He further said nothing could be more lethal to democracy than the “deadly combination” of confrontational polity and competitive journalism.“Allowing yourself to be co-opted by an ideology or the state is a recipe for disaster,” the CJI said.“Journalists are like judges in one sense. Regardless of the ideology you profess and the beliefs you hold dear, you must do your duty without being influenced by them. You must report only the facts, with a view to give a complete and accurate picture,” he said.The CJI also spoke about the rising trend of discussions and interpretation of court judgements, especially on social media, attacks on the judiciary, among others, said the press must show some belief or confidence in the judiciary.“The media must have belief and trust in the judiciary. As a key stakeholder in democracy, the media has the duty to defend and protect the judiciary from motivated attacks by evil forces,” he said.“We are together in the Mission Democracy and in promoting national interest. We have to sail together,” the CJI said.He added that the trend to “sermonise about judgments, and villainise judges”, needed to be checked. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-ramana-says-news-mixed-with-views-is-a-dangerous-cocktail-355941

It was attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and experts.The DDMA on Tuesday declared a ‘yellow alert’ under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in the city amid a spike in coronavirus cases following the emergence of the virus’ Omicron variant.The ‘yellow alert’ entails restrictions like night curfew, closure of schools and colleges, opening of shops selling non-essential items on an odd-even basis, halved seating capacity in Metro trains and buses, among other things.The DDMA has decided that curbs imposed under the ‘yellow alert’ will continue in the national capital for now, the sources said.The authorities are in favour of monitoring the situation for some more time and to avoid imposing further restrictions under ‘amber alert’, they said.An ‘amber alert’ is declared when the positivity rate is recorded at one per cent or above for two consecutive days.“It was discussed that most Covid cases are asymptomatic and mild and there are fewer hospitalisations, which indicates that the situation is not that bad,” a source said.During the meeting, it was also decided to ensure strict implementation of restrictions imposed under the ‘yellow alert’. In case the situation worsens, emergency measures may be imposed, the sources said.On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 496 fresh COVID-19 cases, the highest since June 4, while the positivity rate stood at 0.89 per cent, according to health department data.The total number of Omicron cases in the city stood at 165, the data stated.

All eyes are on his visit to see whether he officially declares Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami as the BJP’s official cheif ministerial face for the upcoming Assembly elections in the state.Notably, not just the BJP, the Congress too appears to be playing safe on this rather piquant and sensitive issue of naming a candidate for the top post. Though the Prime Minister has publicly appreciated him, the Central leadership has not officially named Dhami as the face for 2022 elections so far. Though state leaders have said that Dhami, who has the formidable challenge to break the BJP-Congress cycle and also keep the party together, in what is expected to be a close fight, will be the CM when the BJP returns to power in 2022. Interestingly, the Aam Aadmi Party has announced retired Colonel Ajay Kothiyal as its chief ministerial face in hill state which is witnessing a whole lot of political churn, making the situation “extremely fluid”, according to observers.“AAP has nothing to lose”, they say, adding that despite the calm in the BJP on the surface, several leaders, like Harak Singh Rawat, are getting “restive”. Harak Singh, they claim, is on the “verge of jumping the ship”, despite his meeting with Dhami last week in presence of other state leaders.In fact, Congress sources claim that Harak Singh is “in regular touch with their party”.While Harak Singh appears to be bargaining for a better deal with the BJP, a deeply divided Congress is also walking the tightrope. The party recently witnessed a major meltdown with former Chief Minister Harish Rawat voicing his hurt in the open.Meanwhile, the PM will inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of 23 projects worth over Rs 17,500 crore, which include an array of sectors/areas like irrigation, road, housing, health infrastructure, industry, sanitation, drinking water supply in the poll-bound state, according to officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-to-lay-stones-of-23-projects-worth-rs-17-500-crore-in-uttarakhand-on-december-30-355918
29-12-2021||New Delhi||Ugandan woman arrested by customs officers at Delhi airport for smuggling cocaine worth Rs 14 crore||A Ugandan woman was arrested by customs officers at the international airport here on Wednesday for allegedly smuggling cocaine worth Rs 14 crore into the country.The passenger, who is suspected to be suffering from the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), had ingested 91 specially-designed pellets containing cocaine, sources said.After noticing her unusual body movements upon arrival on Saturday, the customs officers, out of “sheer facilitation and goodwill”, approached the passenger for providing any possible help to her.“However, the passenger not only refused to accept any help but also showed disinclination to engage in any conversation, while at the same time continuing to exhibit uneasy body movements,” a statement issued by the customs department said.Seeing the unusual behaviour of the passenger, the customs officers maintained a vigil on her, it added.The passenger crossed the green channel and was headed towards the exit gate of the international arrival hall, when the customs officers intercepted her, the statement said.“Upon questioning, the passenger finally divulged that she had swallowed 91 capsules of the narcotic substance,” it said.Since it was an impending emergency, the passenger was admitted to the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital here.“X-ray scanning revealed that the sigmoid colon (ascending, descending) of the passenger was filled with oval pellets. Under expert medical supervision, an ejection procedure was carried out, which yielded the recovery of a total of 91 pellets in batches,” the customs department said.The entire ejection process lasted for several days during which customs staff maintained round-the-clock vigil at the hospital, it said.A white powdery substance weighing 992 grams was kept concealed in the pellets, the statement said, adding that a diagnostic test revealed the substance to be cocaine.Officials said the value of the cocaine seized from the passenger is around Rs 14 crore in the international market.The hospital authorities handed over the passenger, who is in her mid-30s, to customs officials, who put her under arrest.The sources said the passenger is suspected to be suffering from AIDS, a life-threatening condition.They said she might have been allured to smuggle the drug in lieu of money to help her with her medical condition.This is the second big seizure of cocaine at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport this month.Around 2.8 kg of the narcotic substance were recovered from a Nigerian woman on December 9, who had arrived at Delhi from Lagos via Dubai. The Ugandan national in the latest case had also followed the same arrival route.Customs officers at the airport have achieved considerable success against the menace of drug smuggling, the statement said.This was the 24th case of drug seizure at the airport this year and a total of 32 passengers were arrested in connection with these cases. The estimated value of the drugs seized in these cases is more than Rs 845 crore. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ugandan-woman-arrested-by-customs-officers-at-delhi-airport-for-smuggling-cocaine-worth-rs-14-crore-355916

29-12-2021||New Delhi||Traders body opposes odd-even scheme for Delhi markets||Traders’ body CAIT on Wednesday wrote to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, terming the ‘odd-even’ scheme for shops impractical and called for markets in the national capital be divided into various zones to open at different timings for smooth conduct of trade.In its letter to Baijal on the Covid restrictions in Delhi, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) claimed that the “restrictions announced so far have been announced in haste without having a discussion with traders and other stakeholders of Delhi”.Contending that traders of Delhi have suffered huge losses in last two years and are running into great financial crunch, CAIT argued that smooth conduct of trade may be kept in mind while deciding restrictions.“In particular we would like to mention that the ‘Odd-Even’ scheme is not practical and extremely irrelevant. In fact it only causes extreme inconvenience to the public at large,” the traders’ body observed.With regard to the Odd-Even scheme, it argued that if consumers want to purchase two different products and those goods are dealt with by shopkeepers having odd and even numbers, the consumers will have to visit the market on both days.“Instead of curbing the movement of the people, it only causes people to move out more frequently,” CAIT stated. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/traders-body-opposes-odd-even-scheme-for-delhi-markets-355909

People of Punjab have already showered love and affection on AAP national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. They have appreciated his administrative skills," AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta said.Sources close to Kejriwal said the party was temporarily on the backfoot initially after the Congress made Charanjit Singh Channi, a Dalit Sikh, the chief minister. The party went to the drawing board and planned afresh for the elections.  "People of Punjab want the AAP government. Hence, the party will not be found wanting on an effective strategy for the electoral battle," Gupta said.Besides putting each of the constituencies under the charge of a leader, AAP's central leadership has decided to allow the local leadership to be in the forefront and lead the party's electoral campaign.A review would be made on this strategy midway as the election campaign intensifies.Senior leaders of AAP have by now a fair grooming in electoral strategy from the party electoral laboratory of Delhi, so to speak. The party is buoyed up with its high percentage performance in the recent local elections in Chandigarh.The party has high hopes from the assembly elections in Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aap-to-micro-manage-each-assembly-constituency-in-punjab-355883
29-12-2021||Ballia (UP)||Anurag Thakur takes jibe at Akhilesh Yadav over raids at perfume trader's properties||Taking a swipe at Akhilesh Yadav, Union Minister Anurag Thakur said the Samajwadi Party (SP) chief was "troubled" over raids at a perfume trader's properties but did not feel for the poor.He also sought to know whether Congress president Sonia Gandhi, senior leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and Yadav had taken the "BJP vaccine" for Covid-19.Yadav and some other leaders from rival parties had allegedly called India's two vaccines- Covishied and Covaxin- as "BJP vaccines".The Minister for Information and Broadcasting, and Youth Affairs and Sports was in the district for the closing ceremony of All India Invitational Prize Money Football Competition at Narhi."If the SP has no ties with the perfume trader, why is it troubled? Why is Akhilesh Yadav saying that the Income Tax department raids will be followed by raids by the Enforcement Directorate and other departments?" Thakur told the media on Tuesday."Yadav is feeling for the perfume trader but he doesn't realise the pain of the poor. The illegal money (recovered from the trader) is meant for their development," Thakur said.The minister said the "fragrance" of Yadav's association with the perfume trader has spread so much that the SP chief is unable to hide it.Around Rs 177 crore cash and huge quantity of jewellery were seized in multiple raids at perfume manufacturer Piyush Jain's residence in Kanpur as well as his house and factory in Kannauj.With months to go for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, BJP leaders have been attacking the SP over Jain's arrest, claiming that the perfume trader had links with Yadav's party. Yadav, for his part, has categorically denied any link with the trader. Thakur clarified that the raids had nothing to do with the upcoming Assembly elections in the state and that the department took the action independently and only after having sufficient information.When asked about BJP MP Varun Gandhi raising questions over the imposition of night curfew in the state while allowing election rallies during the day, Thakur said, "This is democracy."                 "States have the right to impose curfew under the protocol." he said.The Uttar Pradesh government has imposed night curfew since Saturday in view of resurgence in Covid-19 cases.Taking a dig at Yadav and Congress leaders over vaccination, he asked whether they were vaccinated or not."The country wants to know whether the Congress and SP have faith in the country's scientists and vaccines", he said.Earlier, addressing the closing ceremony of the tournament, Thakur said, "The people of Uttar Pradesh want a strong government instead of a government of riots. People do not want the era of hooliganism to return. The Yogi Adityanath government has bulldozed the criminals," he said.The minister said the country's largest sports university will be built in Uttar Pradesh.

However, the picture and video footage, released to the media by the government, showed almost everyone else except for the top spymaster of the country, The News International reported.When asked for the reason, the Minister said that it was a standing instruction for all concerned from the incumbent DG, ISI not to release any of his pictures or video footage of any official meeting that he attends.Ever since his appointment as the DG, ISI, none of his picture or video footage has been released to the media, the Minister added.Lt-Gen (retd) Amjad Shoaib, while commenting on it, said the basic principle of intelligence services is to stay away from the media's eye.He said there have been violations of the principle in the past and a number of times the governments had been releasing to the media picture and video footage of the intelligence chiefs, The News International reported.Shoaib said the intelligence chiefs should not be shown on the media and TV screens. Generally, he explained, the spymasters are not recognised in the public all over the world for the same reason. He said this basic principle got compromised during the Afghan war when Gen Hameed Gul and General Javed Nasir were heading the ISI, the report said.He said he was not part of any intelligence network but even then when he was promoted and posted as GOC Quetta, the then Army Chief General Abdul Waheed Kakar advised him to stay away from the media.Maj Gen (retd) Ejaz Awan, who also served in the ISI in the past, told The News that the new DG, ISI, seems to be following the pattern of doing his work without being publicised in the media.Awan recalled that when he was appointed as ISI Sector Commander Lahore, he was told by his DG ISI General (retd) Ahsan that "you would be a good intelligence operator if you roam around Lahore and no one notices you and no one recognises that here the ISI Sector Commander is going".

After Muslims, Christians are the new target of the Hindutva brigade," Chidambaram said.After two successive defeats in the Goa assembly elections, the Congress is hoping to make a comeback in the state polls early next year.

29-12-2021||New Delhi||'New Normal' most used phrase in 2021, reveals Google||While the phrase "now more than ever" was the one mostly searched and used in 2020, it was the turn of "new normal" amid the Covid-19 pandemic that was used the most in 2021, according to Google.Google's 'Ngrams' tool (launched in 2009 by part of the Google Books team) has revealed how words and phrases have fallen and risen in popularity over time.Ngrams shows how books and other pieces of literature have used certain words or phrases over time, and we can chart their popularity throughout the years."One caveat: Ngrams currently tracks data from 1800 to 2019, prior to 2020, Ngrams' data ranged from 1800 to 2012, but the team added a huge new dataset about two years ago," said Molly McHugh-Johnson, Contributor, The Keyword (Google Blog).This isn't the first time "new normal" appeared in the lexicon, though."It began to see small bursts of usage in literature and other writing in the mid-19th century -- though if you use Ngrams to see some of the examples of how it showed up, anew normal' was often in reference to types of academic institutions," McHugh-Johnson said in a blog post late on Tuesday.And then, "new normal" just sort of faded away, only to return big amid the pandemic."Then of course, I thought of 'vaccine', which actually began its Ngrams debut on a high, falling sharply between 1800 and 1813aonly to rise again in the early to mid 1900s, when many scholarly articles were published about things like typhoid, cholera and pertussis vaccinations," McHugh-Johnson explained.Lastly, she took a look at "hybrid", as hybrid workplaces are becoming the norm in the pandemic and Google has also adopted this.According to Ngrams, it's been in use since at least the year 1800, which is how far the tool's data goes back, and has gently, steadily risen since.What "hybrid" means hasn't really changed, but it's the situations we're applying it to that have -- there's a much wider scope of daily life that falls under this category."Hybrid" didn't change, but how we live has. 2020 felt in many ways like a pause in life, and this year we began finding new, creative ways to adapt, a little of our old methods, mixed with the new," said McHugh-Johnson.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-normal-most-used-phrase-in-2021-reveals-google-355851

29-12-2021||Akola||Case against Hindu seer Kalicharan Maharaj for remarks on Mahatma Gandhi||The police here in Maharashtra have registered a case against a Hindu religious leader, Kalicharan Maharaj, for allegedly using derogatory words against Mahatma Gandhi, Father of the Nation, an official said on Tuesday.Kalicharan Maharaj, alias Abhijit Sarag, a resident of Shivajinagar in old city area of Akola, made the remarks on Sunday during an event at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.On Monday, local Congress leaders staged a protest outside the City Kotwali police station here against him for allegedly hurting the sentiments of people.Based on a complaint filed by local Congress functionary Prashant Gawande, the police registered a case against the seer under Sections 294 (obscene acts) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC, the official from the Kotwali police station said.During the conclusion of the two-day “dharma sansad” (religious parliament) in Raipur on Sunday evening, Kalicharan Maharaj had allegedly used abusive words against Mahatma Gandhi and hailed his assassin Nathuram Godse. He had also asked people to elect a staunch Hindu leader as the head of the government in order to protect the religion.An FIR was subsequently registered against him in Raipur. His comments also drew a sharp criticism from Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and the issue found an echo in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on Monday.Baghel had said if a “hypocrite” thinks he can succeed in his intention by abusing the Father of the Nation, then it is his illusion”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/case-against-hindu-seer-for-remarks-on-mahatma-gandhi-355567
29-12-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court: Insurer can't reject claim by citing existing medical state||An insurer cannot repudiate a claim by citing an existing medical condition that was disclosed by the insured in the proposal form, once the policy has been issued, the Supreme Court has said.A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna also said a proposer was under a duty to disclose to the insurer all material facts within his knowledge.“The proposer is presumed to know all facts and circumstances concerning the proposed insurance,” it added.“While the proposer can only disclose what is known to him, the proposer’s duty of disclosure is not confined to his actual knowledge, it also extends to those material facts which, in the ordinary course of business, he ought to know,” the court said.“Once the policy has been issued after assessing the medical condition of the insured, the insurer cannot repudiate the claim by citing an existing medical condition, which was disclosed by the insured in the proposal form and which condition has led to a particular risk in respect of which the claim has been made by the insured,” the Bench said in a recent judgment.The top court was hearing an appeal filed by Manmohan Nanda against an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), rejecting his plea seeking a claim for medical expenses incurred in the United States.Nanda had bought an Overseas Mediclaim Business and Holiday Policy as he intended to travel to the US. On reaching the San Francisco airport, he suffered a heart attack and was admitted to a hospital, where angioplasty was performed on him and three stents were inserted to remove the blockage from the heart vessels.Subsequently, the appellant claimed the treatment expenses from the insurer, which was repudiated by the latter stating that the appellant had a history of hyperlipidaemia and diabetes, which was not disclosed while buying the insurance policy.The NCDRC had concluded that since the complainant had been under statin medication, which was not disclosed while buying the mediclaim policy, he failed to comply with his duty to make a complete disclosure of his health conditions.The apex court said the repudiation of the policy by the United India Insurance company was illegal and not in accordance with law.It said the object of buying a mediclaim policy is to seek indemnification in respect of a sudden illness or sickness that is not expected or imminent and that may occur overseas.“If the insured suffers a sudden sickness or ailment, which is not expressly excluded under the policy, a duty is cast on the insurer to indemnify the appellant for the expenses incurred thereunder,” the Bench said. — PTIThe case||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-insurer-cant-reject-claim-by-citing-existing-medical-state-355568

It’s a hat-trick! It’s now 3rd vaccine developed in India,” Mandaviya tweeted.The Nanoparticle Vaccine, Covovax, will be manufactured by Pune-based firm Serum Institute of India, he said. “Molnupiravir, an antiviral drug, will now be manufactured in the country by 13 companies for restricted use under emergency situation for treatment of adult patients with Covid-19 and who have high risk of progression of the disease,” Mandaviya said. — PTIStrengthen fight against pandemic: Mandaviya||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/corbevax-covovax-get-nod-for-restricted-emergency-use-355639

Sources, in fact, claimed that several leaders also poured their hearts out over Adityanath “ignoring” them in their meetings with the Central leadership.Brahmins comprise a sizable percentage of votes and are also a significant community in terms of influence beyond their actual numbers.Several leaders from the community in eastern UP also recently switched to the Samajwadi Party.To publicise welfare measures||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eyeing-brahmin-votes-bjp-sets-up-4-member-outreach-panel-355638

They mustn’t visit public places, including markets and shrines, attend any function or use public transport,” read an order issued by Punjab Principal Secretary (Home) Anurag Verma. The fresh curbs will come into force from January 15.Considering the situation in the aftermath of Omicron spread, those not fully vaccinated needed to take more precautions, said Verma. Those not due for second dose, however, would be exempted from the fresh curbs, he said. All government offices in Chandigarh have also decided to allow only fully vaccinated people or those not yet due for second dose.The same guidelines are to be followed by banks, hotels, bars, restaurants, shopping complexes, cinemas and gyms. In Delhi, the DDMA directions came after CM Arvind Kejriwal issued a “yellow alert” (declared when case positivity remains above 0.5 per cent for two consecutive days) as part of the graded response action plan (GRAP) in view of the rising cases.The fresh restrictions mean that shops of non-essential goods and services and malls will open with an odd-even formula. Besides, the timing of the night curfew, imposed from Monday, too has been extended and will now begin at 10 pm instead of 11 pm.Marriages and funeral-related gatherings will only be allowed with an attendance of 20 persons. However, public gatherings, including political or religious, have now been prohibited.The entire public transport, including the Delhi Metro, will run at 50 per cent capacity, while autos and cabs can now only carry two passengers. The alert was sounded as Delhi reported 496fresh cases on Tuesday (one death), which is the highest over the last six months.Further, restaurants and bars will now only be allowed to operate with 50% capacity.“We are imposing restrictions to avoid this virus from entering everyone’s homes. A few months ago, we had formulated GRAP to take appropriate action and impose restrictions depending on the level of spread of the virus. This will ensure a scientific and systematic approach to impose a certain amount of restrictions at a certain percentage of Covid prevalence,” Kejriwal said.“Under the GRAP, we had decided that in case the positivity rate remains over 0.5% for two days consistently, the yellow alert or Level 1 will be imposed. Since the positivity rate has consistently been above 0.5% for the past 2-3 days, we have decided to impose Level 1 starting today,” he added.6,358 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS 4,80,290ACTIVE CASES 75,456293 deaths in 24 hoursStricter curbs in CapitalSchools, colleges shut | Cap on weddingsPvt offices, Metro to run at 50% capacityCipla to market MolnupiravirDrug major Cipla on Tuesday has received emergency use authorisation permission from the Drug Controller General of India to launch antiviral drug Molnupiravir in the country to treat mild-to-moderate Covid-19.

29-12-2021||New Delhi||NEET PG counselling: Resident doctors intensify stir; police personnel deployed at Safdarjung||Intensifying their stir over the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling, a large number of resident doctors on Tuesday protested on the premises of Centre-run Safdarjung Hospital, even as police personnel were deployed to ensure maintenance of law and order. The protest, a day earlier had taken a dramatic turn, as medics and police personnel had faced off in streets, with both sides claiming several persons suffered an injury in the ensuing melee.A senior police officer said security personnel have been deployed on the premises of Safdarjung Hospital to maintain law and order amid the ongoing strike by the doctors."Over 100 police personnel have been deployed. This is also to ensure the law and order situation at the hospital. The situation is normal and under control as of now. The resident doctors are peacefully protesting here," a senior police official said.Doctors chanted slogans like 'We want justice' and sought to bolster the morale of each other after the face-off with the police on Monday went all the way to midnight as dramatic scenes were witnessed at the Sarojini Nagar Police Station.The Faculty Association of Safdarjung Hospital condemned the face-off, while the resident doctors' association of AIIMS urged the government to reveal its plans for expediting NEET PG counselling, failing which it threatened to proceed with a token strike on December 29, including a shutdown of all non-emergency services.The stir, led by the Federation of Resident Doctors' Association, entered its 12th day on Tuesday, even as patient care remained affected at three Centre-run facilities—Safdarjung, RML and Lady Hardinge hospitals and some of the Delhi government-run hospitals.FORDA on Monday had also said that several of its members were "detained" when they tried to hold a protest march from Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) to Supreme Court.FORDA president Manish had claimed that resident doctors of a large number of major hospitals on Monday "returned their apron (lab coat) in a symbolic gesture of rejection of services".The Faculty Association of Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC) and SJH on Monday had written to the Delhi police commissioner stating, it "strongly condemns and finds unacceptable, the cruel and inhuman manner, in which the protest of the resident doctors was mishandled by the Delhi police. The resident doctors were brutally assaulted by the Delhi Police." In today's civilised world, it is a matter of shame that junior doctors who have been tirelessly working as the frontline Covid warriors for the last two years have been "treated so harshly", it alleged."With the third wave of Covid almost knocking at our doors, everybody will again be begging the doctors to go beyond their call of duty so that lives can be saved. It is the duty of the administration which includes the police to look after the physical well-being of doctors."Resident doctors are protesting for the last two weeks for a cause and there can be no earthly reason why they should be beaten up...Violence in any form on either side should be and is being condemned by our association," the association wrote.However, police on Monday had denied any allegations of lathicharge or use of abusive language from their end, and said, 12 protestors were detained and released later.The AIIMS RDA wrote to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday condemning the alleged "atrocities of police" against the doctors who it said were protesting peacefully for expediting NEET PG counselling for admission of more than 42,000 doctors."By brutally thrashing and detaining the doctors, the police and government have hit a new low," it alleged.The medical fraternity has shown exemplary sacrifice for the sake of the nation at a time when Covid-19 pandemic was running carnage through the country. The same workforce, the AIIMS RDA said, now feels backstabbed and betrayed by the "duplicity of the lawmakers and the police on the issue of NEET PG counselling," it alleged in the statement."This day shall be remembered as a black day for the medical fraternity, the AIIMS RDA said.This incident is sensitive enough to spark a shutdown of all routine medical care activities by the resident doctors, and in the absence of the government's immediate response the RDA will not fail to do so. It's high time for the government to release a report of what has been done to date, and what are the government's plans moving forward, for expediting NEET PG counselling, it said."RDA of AIIMS does not believe in hampering of patient care services and hopes that the government will address the grievances in an appropriate and timely manner, and shall not force us to escalate the protest further," the RDA said in its letter.An FIR has been registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code for Covid violations, rioting and damage to public property among others, police had said on late Monday night. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/neet-pg-counselling-resident-docs-intensify-stir-police-personnel-deployed-at-safdarjung-355492

Chemotherapy uses radiation and other drugs which has many side effects and evoke immune system that causes severe pain and allergic reaction. The team has earlier developed knockout mice for miR-21 and the same was published in 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences' of the US (PNAS) journal. MicroRNA-21 (small non-coding RNA) is one of the most abundant microRNAs in mammalian cells that regulates apoptosis (programme cell death) and oncogenic effects."I have worked along with the American scientists and invented an alternative to chemotherapy and drugs in the treatment of cancer, which damage normal cells along with cancer cells during cancer treatment. This successful experiment was done by a team of 11 scientists in the Cleveland Clinic and Yang Li. Our team while experimenting on mice injected its anti-sense into mice to make miR-21 ineffective." Following this, it was found that the tumour formed in the body of the rat gradually became smaller and some tumours disappeared completely.This experiment went on for a year in America. However, it has not yet been used on the human body. Now the effort has been intensified to apply it on the human body, Pandey said.He added that due to cancer, tumours are formed in the body which are eliminated through chemotherapy and drugs. In this process of treatment along with cancer cells, normal cells are also damaged and has a negative effect on the body.The group is working on other programmed cell death mechanisms, microRNAs and chemeric antigen T-cell therapy to tackle carcinogenicity in mice model.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/chemotherapy-radiation-may-not-be-needed-to-treat-cancer-new-research-355083
