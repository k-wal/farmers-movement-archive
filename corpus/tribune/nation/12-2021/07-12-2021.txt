07-12-2021||Silchar/Hailakandi||Sedition charges against editor of news portal, Silchar Press Club demands its revocation||The editor of a news portal in Barak Valley of Assam has been slapped with sedition charges and  Silchar Press Club Tuesday demanded that it be revoked immediately or journalists will continue their protests against it.An FIR was filed against Anirban Roy Choudhury for sedition for allegedly seeking to create a division between the Assamese and Bengali communties in Barak Valley by his editorial ‘Welcome to the paradise of the spineless - we are Assamese’.The editorial had appeared after the arrest of Barak Democratic Front convenor Pradip Dutta Roy, also on sedition charges, following an ultimatum issued by him to the administration to remove a government hoarding on Covid-19 vaccination drive in Assamese put up in Bengali-dominated Silchar within 48 hours. It was found removed on November 26 and Dutta Roy was arrested the next day.The FIR was filed by a person named Santanu Sutradhar, who is a member of the All Assam Bengali Hindu Association, and Roy Choudhury was summoned by Cachar sadar police station on Monday.Besides sedition, Roy Choudhury was also charged under several other sections and he had appeared at the police station accompanied by around 50 journalists from across Barak Valley.He was interrogated for over more than an hour and allowed to go on public recognisance bond on the condition that he will appear before the police whenever summoned, police said.Roy Choudhury said that he will fight against the charges legally and will move the court soon.Silchar Press Club secretary Shankar Dey said Roy Choudhury may not have been arrested and had been allowed to go on PR bond but “our protests will continue till the sedition charges against him are dropped”.“We will not tolerate false and fabricated sedition charges against journalists at any cost and our protests will be on”, he added.More than 150 journalists of the three Barak Valley districts had written to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma urging him to drop all charges against the editor as it was an attack on the right to the freedom of expression.Dutta Roy was arrested on November 27 on sedition charges for creating disharmony among the Bengali and Assamese speaking communities in the state following the removal of the hoarding.On October 19 unidentified miscreants had smeared black ink on hoardings written in Assamese in Silchar following which some people had defaced some signboards written in Bengali in Guwahati.Sarma had said that nobody can hurt the Assamese language as “it is in our hearts”.It was people with vested interests and acting on the behest of a political party who are making the Bengalis living in the Brahmaputra Valley more vulnerable, he had said.Assamese is the official language of the state while Bengali and Bodo are the associate languages. Bengali is used for administrative and educational purposes in Barak Valley. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sedition-charges-against-editor-of-news-portal-silchar-press-club-demands-its-revocation-347525
07-12-2021||New Delhi||Accused found guilty under NDPS Act should not be shown leniency: SC||An accused who is found to be guilty of the offence under the NDPS Act should not be shown any leniency as they are instruments in causing death to several innocent young victims, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday.The top court also said while applying discretion under Section 427 of CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code), it shall not be in favour of the accused who is found to be indulging in illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.“No leniency should be shown to an accused who is found to be guilty for the offence under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Those persons who are dealing in narcotic drugs are instruments in causing death or in inflicting death blow to a number of innocent young victims who are vulnerable. Such accused cause deleterious effects and deadly impact on society.“They are a hazard to society. Such organised activities of clandestine smuggling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into this country and illegal trafficking in such drugs and substances have a deadly impact on society as a whole. Therefore, while awarding the sentence or punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society as a whole is required to be taken into consideration,” said a bench of Justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna.The bench observed while dismissing an appeal filed by Mohd Zahid against an order of the Delhi High Court which had rejected his plea and confirmed his sentence of 15 years along with a fine of Rs 1.5 lakh under the NDPS Act.The top court said, “Even while exercising discretion under Section 427 of CrPC (Sentence on offender already sentenced for another offence) to run subsequent sentence concurrently with the previous sentence, the discretion is to be exercised judiciously and depending upon the offence/offences committed.“Therefore, considering the offences under the NDPS Act which are very serious in nature and against the society at large, no discretion shall be exercised in favour of such accused who is indulging into the offence under the NDPS Act,” the bench said.Zahid was also sentenced to undergo 12 years of rigorous imprisonment by the Amritsar court for recovery of 4 kg of heroin. While in the case in Delhi, he was sentenced to 15 years for recovery of 750 grams of heroin.The question for the consideration before the top court was whether the sentences imposed against Zahid by two different courts in two different trials but against the same accused/person should run concurrently or consecutively.The bench said in the present case, Zahid has been convicted concerning two different transactions, there are different crime numbers and the cases have been decided by the different judgements.“Therefore, the appellant is not entitled to any benefit of concurrent sentence under Section 427 of CrPC. There is no specific order or direction issued by the court while imposing the subsequent sentence that the subsequent sentence to run concurrently with the previous sentence,” the bench said.The top court dismissed the appeal filed by Zahid and directed the sentences shall run concurrently.

07-12-2021||New Delhi||Judicial independence under scrutiny in recent years: Shashi Tharoor in Lok Sabha||The Congress on Tuesday said judicial independence had come under scrutiny in recent years and demanded a broad law to strengthen service conditions of judges and ensure meaningful separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive.Opening the debate on The High Courts and Supreme Courts (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill 2021 that clarifies matters pertaining to judicial pensions, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor flagged “government’s increasing influence over judicial appointments and the executive’s overarching, sometimes invisible and indirect control over the judiciary.”He along with several other MPs demanded that retirement age of Supreme Court judges be raised from 65 to 67 years and that of high court judges be raised from 62 to 65 years to manage pendency of cases, currently a whopping 4.4 crore (3.77 crore in subordinate courts; 57 lakh in high courts and 73000 in the SC).Tharoor took the occasion to cite instances of delay in the hearing of petitions challenging the Abrogation of Article 370, Citizenship Amendment Act, illegality of CBI among others to claim, “By its continued inaction, the court has not just allowed government sins against citizens to unpunished, it has also led some critics to ask whether the Supreme Court should also be considered an accomplice in the violation of rights granted by the Constitution.”A day after the 29th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition (on December 6, 1992), Tharoor said, “It is fitting to recall how an act of vandalism was legitimized by the court. There has been a clear failure on the part of the judiciary to stem the tide of militant majoritarianism.”He questioned the award of clean chit to the government in the Rafale jet matter and said “the clean chit awas given on the basis of famous sealed covers containing evidence exchanged between the CJI and government alone.”The Congress MP mentioned the non hearing by the court of petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and said, “There is an ipso facto concern of executive influence which has seemingly constrained the judiciary.  The court was seen as a constitutional instrument to define the limits of executive control over the erstwhile state of JK. Can Article 356 be used to suspend an assembly in a state and alter the nature of the state itself? Can a state be downgraded to a UT? These are constitutional questions. By repeatedly delaying the hearing on petitions, the SC failed to fulfill its role as protector of the Constitution while the rights of the people of J&K remained restricted.”The Congress MP also questioned the pendency of habeas corpus petitions before the J&K High Court to say, "Rules mandate the disposal of habeas corpus petitions in 15 days but the HC took an average of 252.5 days. This is a blasphemous number of days when compared to the urgency required in such matters. We have also seen laxity by the judiciary in hearing cases challenging the Citizenship Amendment Act."Interrupted by members of the treasury benches occasionally, Tharoor said the government should consider a larger law to raise the retirement age of judges, reduce pendency, eliminate post retirement benefits for judges and preserve judicial independence."To truly build a new India, we will have to separate the powers of the legislature, judiciary and the executive to ensure that the first two do not become a rubber stamp for the third,” Tharoor said earlier questioning the transfers of two judges who had ruled unfavorably from the point of view of the government in the Ishrat Jahan and Sohrabuddin cases.The debate on the Bill also witnessed BJD’s Pinaki Mishra seek reintroduction of the National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, with Law Minister Kiren Rijiju expected to reply to the debate on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judicial-independence-under-scrutiny-in-recent-years-shashi-tharoor-in-lok-sabha-347519
07-12-2021||New Delhi||Not giving compensation, jobs to kin of farmers who died during protests would be big mistakes: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said not giving compensation and jobs to the kin of the farmers who died during the year-long protests against three agriculture laws and not withdrawing police cases against them would be “big mistakes”.He also said the Centre has not answered the questions raised by him in the Lok Sabha on the issues of farmers and said its reply was a “joke”.“I asked questions in Parliament on agrarian injustice—Will the farmers who died get compensation? Is the government considering doing something on MSP? How did Covid affect agriculture?“They did not answer the first two questions and answered the third—‘Farming continued smoothly during the pandemic!’ What a joke!” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag “#Farmers”.“Not giving compensation to farmers who died while protesting, not giving jobs and not withdrawing police cases against ‘annadatas’ (farmers) will be big mistakes. After all, how many times will the prime minister apologise,” he said in another tweet, using the hashtag “#FarmersProtest”.Gandhi presented a list in Parliament on Tuesday that had the names of all the farmers who died during the year-long protests against the three laws and demanded compensation for them.All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also favoured the grant of compensation to the families of the farmers who died during the protests and said it will have to be given.“The families of the farmers who died should get compensation and employment. Today, Rahul Gandhiji raised this demand in Parliament by giving the names of the farmers who died.“By not giving compensation to the farmers, the BJP government has shown its anti-farmer attitude. The families of the farmers who died will have to be given compensation and employment,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.Chief spokesperson of the Congress Randeep Surjewala also asked why is the Centre scared of answering questions on compensation to the farmers who died during the protests and MSP.“Why is the Modi government so afraid of answering and discussing the issues of compensation to farmers and MSP? Rahul Gandhiji asked the question, when will the government give compensation to 700 farmers and when will it give MSP?“The Modi government and the Lok Sabha Secretariat have arbitrarily cut the question. Justice will have to be given to the farmers or else, the Modi government should pick up its bag,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.In response to Gandhi’s questions on farmers’ issues, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said, “During the lockdown, the agriculture sector functioned smoothly.”            “The government of India had taken all necessary measures to ensure smooth operation of agriculture-related activities. Farming and allied activities were exempted from the lockdown. Seed, pesticide, fertiliser etc. dealers/shops and other input related activities were allowed to open for making inputs available to farmers,” he said in a written reply.Tomar also said inter-state and intra-state movement of farm machinery, especially that of combine harvesters, was facilitated.“As a result of the various steps taken by the department, both harvesting activities of the Rabi crop and sowing of summer crop took place in a systematic manner,” he added.The minister also enumerated a number of measures taken by the Centre for farmers’ welfare, including the grant of credit to them at a low-interest rate.  --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-giving-compensation-jobs-to-kin-of-farmers-who-died-during-protests-would-be-mistakes-rahul-347517
07-12-2021||New Delhi||Govt extends time limit up to Dec 31 for submission of life certificate by pensioners||Union minister Jitendra Singh on Tuesday said the government has decided to extend up to December 31 the time limit for submission of life certificate by central government pensioners, in yet another reform to enhance ease of living for elder citizens.The decision was taken in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the vulnerability of the elderly population to coronavirus, he said.Earlier, a pensioner was required to submit the life certificate till November 30 for uninterrupted disbursement of his or her pension.Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, said the pensioners can submit life certificates through any of the modes, including in physical form or digitally using an online system, during the extended period.Pension will continue to be paid by the pension disbursing authorities (PDAs) uninterrupted during this extended period, a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said.The minister said that pension disbursing banks have been advised to continue to maintain COVID-19 appropriate behaviour while obtaining life certificates and to ensure proper arrangement and social distancing measures at their branches to prevent overcrowding.Singh said that the government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always sought “ease of living” for all sections of society, including retirees and pensioners who are the nation’s assets with all their experience and long years of service rendered by them.Last week, the minister had launched unique face recognition technology for pensioners, the statement said.The minister said the face recognition technique of giving life certificate is a historic and far-reaching reform, since it will touch the lives of not only 68 lakh central government pensioners but also crores of pensioners of state governments among others.

07-12-2021||New Delhi||Can’t let children with rare diseases die, no explanation by Centre for not utilising fund: HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said the Centre has not given any sufficient justification for Rs 193 crore lying unutilised in the rare diseases fund for children and emphasised that it will not let kids die from such illnesses despite funds being available.The high court pulled up the authorities for making a “mockery of the whole thing” and said it was strange that the allocated funds are available but not being spent on children suffering from rare diseases.“The affidavit filed by Respondent no. 1 (Centre) gives no reason or sufficient justification for not utilising the unspent amount of the fund for the last three years on children suffering from rare diseases,” Justice Rekha Palli said.The high court said the government’s affidavit also gives no sufficient justification as to why names of petitioner children are not included till date on the digital crowd funding platform made operational for medicines and treatment for rare illnesses.It asked the government to take instructions on whether it is possible to provide treatment to the petitioner children and then adjust the amount collected through crowd funding.The court granted time to Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma to seek instructions on the issue and listed the matter for further hearing on December 14.“What is this? Children are dying because of lack of funds... What about the corpus which is available with the government here. I will not permit these children to die despite funds being available. When there are funds, why should the children suffering from rare diseases not get it?” the judge said.The court did not accept the submission of the government counsel that the unutilised amount in the fund gets lapsed and said “what kind of answer is this”.On the issue of transfer of the unutilised amount of over Rs 63 crore, lying with the Kerala High Court after it was collected from the general public for the treatment of a person suffering from a rare disease, to the rare diseases fund, the Centre told the Delhi High Court that it has filed an impleadment application before the Kerala court.The court was hearing a batch of petitions on behalf of children suffering from rare diseases, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II (Hunter Syndrome), and seeking direction to the Centre to provide them uninterrupted and free of cost treatment as the therapy is very expensive.DMD, one of the various forms of muscular dystrophy, is a rare genetic disease that affects boys almost exclusively and causes progressive weakness.         MPS II is a rare disease that is passed on in families and it mainly affects boys and their bodies cannot break down a kind of sugar that builds bones, skin, tendons and other tissues. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-let-children-with-rare-diseases-die-no-explanation-by-centre-for-not-utilising-fund-hc-347512
07-12-2021||New Delhi||Elgar Parishad case: SC rejects NIA's plea against Bombay HC order granting bail to Sudha Bharadwaj||The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed the National Investigation Agency’s appeal challenging the Bombay High Court order granting default bail to lawyer-activist Sudha Bharadwaj in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case.“We see no reason to interfere with the high court order. Dismissed,” said a bench of Justices U U Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi, refusing to consider the submissions raised by the NIA which had moved the apex court against the December 1 order.Bharadwaj was arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case in August 2018 under the provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The top court had agreed on Monday to accord urgent hearing to the NIA plea challenging the Bombay High Court order granting default bail to Bharadwaj.The activist lawyer, accused of hatching conspiracy to overthrow the Union government, was entitled to bail and its denial would be in breach of her fundamental right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the high court had said.It had directed that Bharadwaj, lodged in the Byculla women’s prison, be produced before the Mumbai special NIA court on December 8, and conditions of her bail and date of release be decided.The high court, while granting default bail, had held that the additional sessions judge of Pune, which had extended the time period beyond 90 days for filing charge sheet to the NIA, was not competent to do so as it was not notified as a Special Court under a provision of the NIA Act.At the outset of the hearing on Tuesday, additional sessions judge Aman Lekhi, appearing for the NIA, said the high court wrongly interpreted the law in granting default bail to the accused.Under a provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), if an investigating agency does not file the charge sheet within 90 days, the accused becomes entitled for grant of statutory bail by default.Lekhi referred to the chronology of the case and said the 90-day period for filing the charge sheet as regard to Bharadwaj had expired on January 25, 2019.The application for extension of time was however filed on November 22, 2018, he said, adding that the probe agency was under the belief that the period of house-arrest of the accused was needed to be included.The lower court had allowed the NIA’s pleas for extension  of time on November 26, 2018 and on the same day the accused had filed plea seeking grant of default bail, he said.“So the moot question is whether the court was competent. If the competence was lacking there was no valid extension of period and the lady was entitled to statutory bail,” the bench said.The counsel for the NIA argued to establish that the extension of time granted for filing the charge sheet was valid as section 22 of the NIA Act refers to the competence of court to ‘try’ and the extension of time is different and distinct and hence the high court’s decision to discard the extension was wrong.The bench then asked whether the response of the NIA would be same if the same sessions court, which is not a special court designated under the law, denies the plea of extension of time for filing the charge sheet.“It is not your case that there is no Special Court in Maharashtra. There are Special Courts in Maharashtra. So why did you prefer this application before the other court,” the bench asked.The bench dismissed the plea without hearing the counsel representing Bhardwaj.Bharadwaj is the first among 16 activists and academicians arrested in the case to have been granted default bail.Poet-activist Varavara Rao is currently on medical bail.Jesuit priest Stan Swamy died in a private hospital here on July 5 this year while waiting for medical bail. The others are in custody as undertrials.The high court had rejected the default bail plea filed by eight other co-accused in the case—Sudhir Dhawale, Varavara Rao, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, Vernon Gonsalves, and Arun Ferreira.The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the city’s outskirts.The Pune police had claimed the conclave was backed by Maoists. The probe in the case was later transferred to the NIA. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elgar-parishad-case-sc-rejects-nias-plea-against-bombay-hc-order-granting-bail-to-sudha-bharadwaj-347511

All of them were dressed in black.Party leader Keshav Rao accused the Centre of being insensitive to farmers’ demands, while asserting that the TRS is an opposition party, not a fence-sitter, and it wants this government to go.“This is an anti-farmer government, insensitive to the demands of the farmers. Today, piles of grains are rotting on the roads in Telangana for the simple reason that the FCI is not lifting the produce,” he said, adding that no elected representative likes to boycott Parliament, but the TRS is being forced to do so by the Centre.“Please be clear that we are against this government. We are an opposition party, not a fence-sitter, and we want this BJP-led government to go,” Keshav Rao said while interacting with reporters after announcing that the party will boycott the remainder of the session.The nine Lok Sabha MPs and seven Rajya Sabha MPs of the party will not attend the rest of the session, he said.The TRS has been raising the issue of procurement of paddy by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from Telangana, party leader in the Lok Sabha Nama Nageshwar Rao said, adding that it was denied to raise this farmers’ issue in Parliament.For nine straight days, the TRS gave notices in both houses of Parliament to flag the issue but was not given the opportunity, he said.It is the Centre’s responsibility to procure paddy from the southern state and give farmers their due, Nageshwar Rao said, adding that the TRS has been demanding that a bill be introduced in Parliament for the Minimum Support Price (MSP) on crops. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trs-to-boycott-parliament-session-says-wants-bjp-government-to-go-347510
07-12-2021||New Delhi||Services at govt-run hospitals in country hit as resident docs’ strike enters 2nd day||Long queues of patients were seen outside government-run hospitals, including those in Delhi, as resident doctors boycotted routine services for the second consecutive day on Tuesday as part of a nationwide protest over the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling.The worst-hit were daily outdoor patient department services, even as senior doctors looked after arrangements and the ailing.Resident doctors’ and medical associations have said the delay in NEET-PG admission in medical colleges has caused acute shortage of manpower, and expressed concern that this comes at a time when cases of the new Covid variant, Omicron, are being detected in the country.Besides Delhi, residents doctors are on strike in major cities of Rajasthan such as Jaipur, Kota, Jodhpur, Udaipur and Bikaner, and in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and civil hospitals in Gujarat, among other states and cities.The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Postgraduate (NEET-PG) courses are conducted for fields like the Master of Surgery, and Doctor of Medicine.In the national capital, patient care at Centre-run Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge hospitals remained hit due to the protest called by the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA).The AIIMS Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) said its members will wear black ribbons at work in support of the cause of the overburdened resident doctors of the country and against the delay in NEET-PG counselling.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to ensure that post-graduate admissions are done on a war footing.General Secretary of the Safdarjung Hospital RDA, Dr Anuj Aggarwal said, “We are continuing with the protest because of no concrete action by the Union health ministry.”The resident doctors have been waiting patiently for some positive outcomes of the Supreme Court proceedings in the matter. However, there seems no respite, said Dr Sunil Duchania, president, Lady Hardinge Medical College RDA.“As withdrawal from OPD and all routine services didn’t bring any concrete response from the authorities, the resident doctors have withdrawn from all services (routine as well as emergency) from December 6 in support of the nationwide protest called by FORDA,” Duchania said.The Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum (PMSF), in a statement, said the delay in PG admissions have left them “overworked” and patients that they treat “underserved”.“Those PG students from current batches who survived their peers in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic have not only suffered immense personal losses but have also lost nearly two years of post-graduate learning which a resident doctor is supposed to acquire during their two to three years of training,” it said.The AIIMS RDA said the delay in NEET-PG counselling is depriving Indian citizens of services of around 42,000 doctors who would have otherwise joined at least six months ago.“Several hospitals are functioning with just two-third capacity of their total resident doctors’ strength, compromising with the quality of patient care. As cases of the new variant of coronavirus are increasing exponentially globally, it is prudent that our nation should be prepared for another wave of the pandemic,” it said.Medical services were also affected in medical colleges in Jaipur, Kota, Udaipur, Ajmer, Jhalawar, Bikaner and Jodhpur in Rajasthan due to the resident doctors’ strike.President, Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors, Dr Amit Yadav, said as there were no resident doctors in the first year and heavy workload was there on other resident doctors due to the pandemic, academic activities have been badly affected.He also said the resident doctors are engaged in “clerical works” related to the Chiranjeevi health insurance scheme and Bhamashah scheme in Rajasthan.Around 1,000 resident doctors of various medical colleges in Gujarat are on strike, claiming shortage of manpower in civil hospitals due to the delay in new admissions to PG courses has significantly increased their workload.The resident doctors, attached to various government hospitals, had observed a similar strike on November 29 and stayed away from the OPD (out-patient department) work from 9 am to 5 pm.“Patients will not suffer due to the strike as resident doctors will remain available for emergency duties. But, we may withdraw ourselves from other services if a lasting solution does not come soon,” said Dr Oman Prajapati, vice president of the Junior Doctors’ Association of Ahmedabad’s B J Medical College, attached to the Civil Hospital.Resident doctors in other major cities, such as Surat and Vadodara, also joined the strike and sat outside the premises of their respective colleges to register their protest.The IMA on Monday expressed concern over the manpower shortage in healthcare amid detection of cases of Omicron variant, and said it is “disastrous to note the postponement of NEET-PG admission in medical colleges”.As the resident doctors boycotted work, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had met the resident doctors and a FORDA delegation at the RML hospital on Monday.According to FORDA members, the minister and said he will get the case mentioned in the Supreme Court for an early hearing and appealed to the doctors to call off their protest, but the resident doctors refused.In a letter to Mandaviya on December 4, the FORDA had said healthcare institutions across the country are running short of an adequate workforce of resident doctors with no admission in the current academic year yet.“With the possibility of a Covid-19 wave looming large, the situation will be disastrous for the healthcare sector with its bearing on the country’s population,” it had said.

07-12-2021||New Delhi||India 'disturbed' over sentencing of Suu Kyi, others||Stopping short of demanding Aung San Suu Kyi’s release, India on Tuesday found the ``recent verdicts’’ in Myanmar disturbing.“We are disturbed at the recent verdicts. As a neighboring democracy, India has been consistently supportive of the democratic transition in Myanmar,’’ said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.``We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. Any development that undermines these processes and accentuates differences is a matter of deep concern,” he said.“It is our sincere hope that keeping their nation’s future in mind, efforts would be made by all sides to advance the path of dialogue,” he added.Myanmar's ousted leader was initially jailed for four years on Monday but was partially ``pardoned’’ hours later by the junta chief Min Aung Hlaing with her sentence reduced to two years. Ousted Myanmar President Win Myint was also similarly dealt with. This is the first of a series of sentences Suu Kyi will face with some carrying jail terms of up to 50 years.``It’s a kind of rustic dialogue with the international community. They are trying to0 say we are nice. We are nice. We can engage. China, ASEAN and Russia will say yes of course. The West will not become convinced,’’ said former Ambassador of France to Myanmar, Jean Michel Lacombe.The pardon was ``more stage managed than even the sentencing itself. If it was an attempt at magnanimity, it has fallen flat,’’ said International Crisis Group's Richard Horsey.The US has led the international condemnation of the sentences. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi as well as all those detained. Over 10,000 people have been imprisoned and over 1,300 have died since February 1 when the Myanmar military took over power after refusing to recognise the election results in which it had performed poorly.``Following a sham trial in secretive proceedings before a military-controlled court is nothing but politically-motivated,’’ said UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet.Several countries have imposed sanctions including Canada, the EU, the UK, and the US.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-disturbed-over-sentencing-of-suu-kyi-others-347496
07-12-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik wilfully breached undertaking to not make statements against Wankhede family: Bombay HC||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday said that it seems that Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik has "wilfully breached" his undertaking given to the HC last month on not making any public statements against Narcotics Control Bureau's Mumbai unit chief Sameer Wankhede and his family members.A bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav directed the senior NCP leader to file an affidavit explaining why the court must not take any adverse action against him for the breach of undertaking.The bench was hearing an application filed by Sameer Wankhede's father Dnyandev Wankhede alleging that despite assuring the HC last month that he will not make any public statements against the Wankhedes, Malik continued to make such defamatory statements. He had approached the high court on Monday through senior counsel Birendra Saraf, seeking an urgent hearing.   On Tuesday, Saraf submitted portions of an interview that Malik had given recently to a regional newspaper wherein he had made the alleged defamatory comments.  Malik's counsel Karl Tamboly told the HC that he had given the said interview as the spokesperson of his political party and not in his personal capacity.  The bench, however, held that the said comments were in breach of his undertaking given to the court.  "This is impinging on our order (recording Malik's undertaking not to tweet or make public statements against the Wankhedes.) He (Malik) is over-reaching our order. Before we take any action against the respondent, we direct him to file his affidavit setting out as to why action should not be taken against him for wilful breach of statements/undertaking," it said.  The matter was posted for further hearing on December 10.  On November 29, the high court had quashed and set aside the November 22 order of a single-judge bench that had refused to restrain Malik from making statements against the Wankhedes. At that time, Malik had agreed that he will not make public statements and post anything on social media against the Wankhedes till the disposal of the defamation suit filed by Dnyandev Wankhede. The HC had then asked Malik to file his detailed reply to Dnyandev Wankhede's suit seeking interim restrain against him by December 9. The Wankhede senior was told to file a rejoinder (additional) affidavit by January 3, 2022. Dnyandev Wankhede had filed a defamation suit against Malik and sought damages of Rs 1.25 crore for allegedly posting defamatory posts against him and his family members. He has claimed that Malik had started a smear campaign against the Wankhede family members after his (Malik's) son-in-law was arrested by the NCB in a drugs case.  Malik's son-in-law was granted bail by a Mumbai court in September, nearly eight months after he was arrested. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nawab-malik-wilfully-breached-undertaking-to-not-make-statements-against-wankhede-family-bombay-hc-347495

Advocate Prashant Bhushan – representing some farmers’ bodies – supported Mehta’s submission.The Bench was hearing a petition filed by Monicca Agarwal—a women resident of NOIDA – on the issue. Agarwal—a single parent with some medical issues—alleged that due to blockade of roads by the agitating farmers travelling between NOIDA and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes and that it had become a nightmare to commute between Noida and Delhi.The top court had on October 21 given three weeks to farmers’ bodies to respond to a petition seeking directions to the authorities to end blockades of roads connecting NCR regions to the national capital by farmers protesting against farm laws.“I am not averse to their right to protest even when a legal challenge is pending. But roads can’t be blocked… Ultimately some solution has to be found,” Justice Kaul—who on September 30 wondered how highways can be blocked perpetually – had noted.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 7 last year ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-sc-defers-hearing-on-petition-seeking-removal-of-road-blockades-347472

Lal topiwalas want power so that they can indulge in scams, load their safes with cash and valuables, carry out illegal encroachments and allow the mafia to have a free run,” Modi said.“Lal topiwalas want to constitute the government to shower generosity on terrorists and release them from prisons,” Modi added.“Please remember that lal topiwalas are like red alert for UP – they are like the ringing of danger bells,” the PM said evoking loud cheer from the crowd.The prime minister said that sugarcane farmers of UP would find it hard to forget the trouble they were made to undergo by the previous SP government. Payments for sugarcane used to be made in instalments and there used to be big time gaps between each payment, the prime minister said.“People of Purvanchal and other parts of UP are aware how sugar mills used to play truant and there used to be proliferation of scams,” the PM said.The Gorakhpur Fertiliser Plant, inaugurated by Modi today, was lying shut for the last 30 years. It has been revived and built at a cost of around Rs 8,600 crore under Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Limited (HURL), a joint venture of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Coal India Limited, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Fertilizer Corporation of India and Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited.Besides providing fertilizer to the farmers of the area and becoming a source of employment and income for the local people, the plant will also take care of requirement of other states in the neighbourhood such as Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha, Modi said.Similar plants are also coming up in four other locations in the country, Modi said and added that when all five new plants would become operational, an additional 60 lakh tonnes of urea would be produced in the country. The country would be spared importing urea worth thousands of crores of rupees from abroad as a result of this, Modi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-warns-people-against-lal-topiwalas-at-gorakhpur-rally-347471

It is apparently a foul up of intelligence. That is what it appears to me," Lieutenant General Ashok Mehta (retired) told PTI."What followed is even more tragic. The villagers were so angry that they surrounded the commandos and apparently attacked them with machetes, and in self defence, they had to fire at them," he added.He said that in his opinion, such an incident had never happened before in the north-east."This is one of the biggest foul ups of military operations or counter-insurgency operations in recent times," Mehta added.On Nagaland Chief Minister’s demand to repeal the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), he said: "If you repeal AFPSA then the armed forces will not operate because they would not have any police powers or safeguards."

These evidences contain detailed records of the group's unaccounted income on which due taxes have not been paid," the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement.A preliminary analysis of evidence, the policy-making body for the tax department said, indicates that the group is indulging in "unaccounted sales of goods and scrap in cash which is not recorded in the regular books of account”.Evidences related to "malpractices like unaccounted cash loans advanced and interest earned thereon, expenses incurred in cash, bogus expenses and purchases, unaccounted land investments, etc, have also been unearthed," it said.The deleted WhatsApp chat of a key person showed evidence of obtaining huge accommodation entries (bogus business entries in the accounts) by the group to "reduce" its taxable income, the CBDT said.It added that 18 bank lockers were put under restraint."The search action has led to the detection of total unaccounted transactions exceeding Rs 500 crore," it said.

If the competence was lacking there was no valid extension of period and the lady was entitled to statutory bail," the Bench told Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, while dismissing the NIA's petition against the high court's order.On Monday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had sought urgent hearing of the NIA's plea, saying since bail order would become operational on December 8 the petition should be taken up before it.The Bombay High Court had on December 1 allowed default bail to Bharadwaj in the Bhima Koregaon case on the grounds that the extension of time for investigation and detention under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been given by a court of competent jurisdiction.However, the High Court had refused to grant default bail to eight other accused as they had not applied for default bail when that right had accrued to them on the failure of the probe agency to file a chargesheet within the statutory period of 90 days.The Bhima Koregaon case relates to December 31, 2017 Elgar Parishad event organised by a group of persons, including activists and retired judges, on the 200th anniversary of the victory of Dalit soldiers in a battle against a local Brahmin Peshwa ruler. There were violent clashes between Dalit and Maratha groups. Three FIRs were filed in the case after one person died and several others got injured. The probe was handed over to the NIA in January 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-rejects-nias-plea-against-bombay-high-court-order-granting-bail-to-sudha-bharadwaj-347429

07-12-2021||New Delhi||Rare striped hyena spotted in Delhi for first time in 7 years||A striped hyena - a near-threatened species with a global population of less than 10,000 individuals - has been spotted in Delhi for the first time in around seven years, according to forest and wildlife department officials.Camera traps installed in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary have confirmed the presence of the nocturnal animal in the forest, they said.“This is the first time a striped hyena has been caught on a camera trap in Delhi. According to reports, a striped hyena was killed in a road accident in Dera Mandi area in 2015. That was the last sighting,” Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), South Division, Amit Anand, said.A wildlife guard in the Asola sanctuary said the staff had found the pugmarks of the animal on a few occasions in 2017-18.The striped hyena invests most of the day in its den. It forages individually and is rarely seen in groups."It's a scavenger and plays an important role in maintaining the stability of a forest ecosystem. The presence of a striped hyena in Asola indicates an improvement in the Asola forest," said wildlife expert Prof Randeep Singh of Amity University.“Though pugmarks have been found on several occasions in the Aravalli forests of Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi, this could be the first time it has been caught on camera, but I am not surprised,” he said.Anand said they had been expecting striped hyenas to be present near Ayanagar and Dera Mandi village, but “we found it closer than we thought – in Deoli”.He said the department had been able to confirm the presence of two leopards - a sub male and a male - in the sanctuary through the images captured by camera traps.“The leopards are active these days, and we think that their kill might have attracted the striped hyena,” the DCF said.The International Union for Conservation of Nature has categorised striped hyenas as 'near threatened' species and their global population is estimated to be below 10,000.Earlier this year, the forest and wildlife department had set up around 20 camera traps in the sanctuary to conduct an animal census, which started in July, to ascertain the number of species and the pattern of their distribution in the forest.The wildlife sanctuary covering 32.71 sqkm area on the Southern Delhi Ridge of Aravalli hill range on Delhi-Haryana border lies in southern Delhi and northern parts of Faridabad and Gurugram districts of Haryana.It is part of the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor, which extends from the Sariska National Park in Rajasthan to Delhi Ridge.

He is currently pursuing PhD from the Punjabi University.Citing the technological advancements in other fields, he said changing with the needs of the time was very important.General Naravane further said, “Smartphones and watches are making our lives easier. Those who evolve are still around, but in different avatars. Those who refuse to see this change, or are too slow to adapt, disappear.”He said big companies including Apple, Google and others had kept pace with technology, adapted to change and reinvented business models. “Similar is the case with warfare. The advent of rapidly evolving dual-use technologies presents new opportunities and is changing the character of warfare like never before.”Meanwhile, VC Prof Arvind said the university would pen down the history of the 1971 India-Pakistan war.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ai-will-change-future-warfare-army-chief-347225

He will also be inaugurating the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi on December 13, which is being seen as yet another reinforcement of the saffron party’s ideological (Hindutva) and cultural commitments by observers.Mauraya, who is believed to be in direct competition with Yogi over chief ministership of the poll-bound state, was accused of polarising voters for his tweet on “temple in Mathura” and the observation that “poor law and order situation in the state earlier was due to people in skull caps who threatened traders, among others”.Following the announcement of plans by certain right-wing groups to install a Krishna idol in Mathura’s Shahi Idgah on the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition, Maurya had said preparations were underway for the construction of a grand temple in Mathura on the lines of Ayodhya and Varanasi. The Shahi Idgah, located next to the Krishna janmabhoomi, has been at the centre of a legal battle for years with Hindu groups claiming that the mosque was built on land where Lord Krishna was born.PM Modi to inaugurate projects in Gorakhpur||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-skull-cap-remark-up-deputy-cm-keshav-prasad-maurya-meets-pm-347076
07-12-2021||Aditi Tandon||In 2020, sale of electric vehicles less than 1% of engine vehicles||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 6Electric vehicle (EV) sale last year was less than 1 per cent compared to that of internal combustion engine vehicles posing massive challenges for the country’s COP21 pledge to reduce the carbon footprint by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 — below 2005 levels.In its report on “Electric and Hybrid Mobility prospects and Challenges in Automobile Industry” tabled in Parliament on Monday, the standing committee on industry expressed concern at the poor uptake of EV sales 2020-21 and asked for urgent midterm course correction to achieve energy transition goals.Engine vehicle sales by volume last year was 1,78,95,224 as against 1,58,575 EVs. This translates into 0.8 per cent EV sales over that of internal combustion engine vehicles.“India, the fifth largest automobile market in the world, is importing crude oil to cover 80 per cent transport fossil fuel needs thereby draining the exchequer and increasing pollution from engine vehicles. The EV ecosystem is still in its nascent stage. The need of the hour is to scale up the transition process to electric mobility,” the panel said.Electric mobility in India began in 2015 with the launch of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) Scheme — a two-year plan with Rs 795 crore to support hybrid and EV market development. The scheme was extended on April 1, 2019.The idea was to promote energy transition from carbon intensive fossil fuels to low energy options and reduce India’s whopping crude oil import bill for fossil fuel needs. The bill was USD 112 billion in FY 2019-2020, equivalent to 4 per cent of India’s GDP.The transition is also critical with India’s COP21 pledge to increase the share of non-fossil fuels based electricity to 40 per cent by 2030.Highlighting gaps in energy transition goals, the parliamentary panel said, “FAME 1 scheme in 2015 primarily targeted promotion of EVs in India. The ministry could not anticipate the evolution and adoption of electric mobility which at this point of time demands urgent midterm course correction to see the desired take off in mass adoption of EVs.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-2020-sale-of-electric-vehicles-less-than-1-of-engine-vehicles-347236

The two sides extended the programme for military technical cooperation from 2021 to 2031, setting the tone for joint development and production of military equipment.Today was the 20th meeting of India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military Technical Cooperation. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh led the Indian delegation while his Russian counterpart General Sergey Shoigu headed the visiting team.Not only China was discussed at the meeting, India told Russia that it was seeking partners who were “sensitive and responsive to India’s expectations and requirements”. This is seen as an indication of New Delhi leaning on Moscow to keep Beijing at bay. Last October, Russia had hosted a meeting between Indian and Chinese Defence Ministers.Rajnath said India’s defence challenges were “legitimate, real and immediate” and highlighted the ongoing border tension between India and China along the LAC.“Extraordinary militarisation and expansion of armament in our neighbourhood and the completely unprovoked aggression on our northern borders since early summer of 2020 have thrown in several challenges,” he is learnt to have said.India and Russia, literally hand-in-hand during the Cold War (1945 to 1991), have clearly “tightened their strategic embrace” as New Delhi is hedging its strategic bets between the US and Russia. India is already part of the much-discussed Quadrilateral or ‘Quad’ with Japan, US and Australia being the other partners.Rajnath and Shoigu discussed “emerging challenges” and the “enhanced requirement” of India for a closer military and military-technical cooperation with Russia. The Indian side wants “advanced research, co-development and co-production of defence equipment leading to self-reliance”, said sources. Lavrov takes on USRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the S-400 missile system deal had an important practical meaning for Indian defence capability. “We have witnessed how the US tried to undermine the deal. Indian friends have made it clear that they will decide who will partner India and whose weapons to buy,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-russia-tighten-strategic-ties-ignore-us-sanction-threat-347235

The leader, however, asked the Chair to first revoke the suspension of the 12 MPs and allow them to participate in the discussion.Kharge said, “In a democracy, it is a crime to run the House and start a discussion after suspending 12 members.” Patra said the proposal for the short-term discussion was brought by them only and now they didn’t want to discuss it.Tharoor not to host Sansad TV showCongress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday said he was withdrawing himself from hosting a talk show on Sansad TV in solidarity with the 12 Rajya Sabha members suspended from the House and would not resume anchoring until their suspension was revoked and a “semblance of bipartisanship restored to the conduct of Parliament”.

The details were released on Monday morning by Swedish think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its report ‘Top 100 arms-producing and military services companies, 2020’.The sales of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (ranked 42nd) and Bharat Electronics (66th) rose by 1.5 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, during 2020. The sales of Indian Ordnance Factories (60th) saw a marginal rise of 0.2 per cent. All three are owned by the Ministry of Defence. “Their aggregated arms sales of $6.5 billion (approx Rs 48,750 crore, accounting for 1.2% of the top 100’s total) were 1.7% higher in 2020 than in 2019,” said the report. Domestic procurement has helped shield Indian companies against the negative economic consequences of the pandemic, the report said.It also mentions that China is now second only to the US in terms of arms manufacturing. The combined sales of five Chinese companies figuring in top 100 stood at an estimated $66.8 billion in 2020—1.5% more than in 2019. “With a 13% share of the total top 100, Chinese companies had the second highest volume of aggregated arms sales in 2020, which is just behind US firms and ahead of UK companies,” the report said.

Russia’s “serious concerns over the United States’ activity in the Asia-Pacific Region” was conveyed during the two plus two meeting of Defence and Foreign Ministers here.India is faced with challenges arising out of extraordinary militarisation in its neighbourhood and completely unprovoked aggression on the northern border. Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister“We expressed our concern about the activities taking place in this region under the slogan of Indo-Pacific strategies where we see non-inclusive blocs,” Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the media. The two plus two, he said, focused on developments in the Asia-Pacific where elements of instability accumulating over the past few years could undermine the universal framework of cooperation, he warned.The latest example, he said, was the Australia-US-UK military grouping. “There are questions on the plans to supply to Australia or make in Australia N-powered subs and whether these plans comply with IAEA norms and nuclear non-proliferation rules,” Lavrov added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-expresses-serious-concerns-over-asia-pacific-347219
07-12-2021||---||India, Russia ink 28 agreements, decide to expand cooperation in defence, space & oil||New Delhi, December 6India and Russia on Monday signed 28 agreements and MoUs, including the pact to manufacture AK-203 rifles in the country, but were unable to finalise the military logistics sharing agreement, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said after several rounds of high-level meetings capped by a summit meeting between visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Nine of the agreements were government-to-government while the 19 others were commercial pacts in an array of sectors. Ahead of the summit, the two countries held inaugural ‘2+2’ dialogue, attended by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Gen Sergey Shoigu.“Our agreements in various sectors will facilitate India-Russia cooperation further. Our defence cooperation is being further strengthened through co-development and co-production under the ‘Make in India’ programme,” noted PM Modi. Both sides had not only cooperated with each other without any hesitation, but had also taken special care of each other’s sensitivities, the PM said. Putin said Russia saw India as a great power and a time-tested friend.India a time-tested friendIndia is a great power, time-tested friend... The ties are growing and I’m looking into future. Vladimir Putin, Russia PresidentFriendship has been constantA lot of geo-political equations emerged, but India-Russia friendship has been a constant. Narendra Modi, PMDescribing Putin’s visit as “short but substantive”, Shringla said PM Modi also discussed long-term sourcing of fertilisers and coking coal while flagging Indian interest in supply of skilled manpower and petroleum projects.Russia showed interest in investing under the production-linked scheme in 13 sectors, including shipbuilding and organic fertilisers. Asked if India had informed Russia of its security-linked difficulties with China, the Foreign Secretary said all issues, including the Indo-Pacific and “security concerns”, were discussed. The two sides also discussed enhanced sourcing of Russian crude oil on long-term contracts, strengthening LNG imports to India and the possible utilisation of the Northern Sea Route for energy supplies. The joint statement welcomed the signing of a new long-term defence program for 2021-31 and spoke of the need to upgrade defence cooperation, which Shringla said reflected the Russian interest in meeting the Indian requirement of co-development and production of defence systems.The Foreign Secretary confirmed that the S-400 missile defence systems from Russia had started arriving this month and “will continue to happen”. On balancing the import of Russian military hardware with the threat of US sanctions, he said, “There is a sense that it is a legacy contract, going back to 2018 and discussed before that”. But the issue did not come up at the summit meeting.However, India’s Indo-Pacific strategy was one issue of discord that came up. “As far as the Indo-Pacific is concerned, there was a sense that we are cooperating extensively with Russia in areas that involve the region. The detailed project report of the Chennai-Vladivostok corridor is nearing completion. We also discussed extending our cooperation in the Indian Ocean region,” pointed out Shringla in a bid to counter Russian criticism that the concept is being pushed by a closed club of countries.The two sides also discussed the evolving situation in Afghanistan and emphasised that its territory should not be used by terrorist groups. “There was the fullest sense that all those responsible for terrorism need to be taken into account by international community,” observed the Foreign Secretary. In Ukraine, Russia provided a briefing but there was no discussion beyond that.Boosting ties Defence: Pact to manufacture AK-203 rifles at a plant in Amethi (UP); long-term defence programme for 2021-31Fertilisers: Long-term sourcing of organic fertilisers, coking coal; related projects in the Russian Far EastOil: Enhanced sourcing of Russian crude oil on long-term contracts, strengthening LNG imports to IndiaCounter-terror: Both sides discuss evolving Af situation, emphasise its territory shouldn’t be used for terrorCyber attacks: Pact between Reserve Bank of India and Bank of Russia in responding to cyber attacks||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-russia-ink-28-agreements-decide-to-expand-cooperation-in-defence-space-oil-347218

The ministers held comprehensive discussion on strategically important bilateral and regional issues.Ahead of the ‘2+2’ talks, Rajnath and Shoigu co-chaired a meeting of the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) during which the two sides inked the agreement for joint production of over six lakh AK-203 assault rifles at a manufacturing facility in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi and extended the pact on military cooperation for 10 years (2021-31).The rifles will be manufactured for the Indian armed forces at a cost of around Rs 5000 crore. The 10 year pact on military cooperation is a renewal of an existing framework.“The pandemic, the extra-ordinary militarisation and expansion of armament in our neighbourhood and the completely unprovoked aggression on our northern border since early summer of 2020 have thrown in several challenges,” Singh said without naming China.At the same time, he said India is confident of overcoming these challenges with the strong political will and inherent capability of its people.“Recognising that its development needs are colossal and that its defence challenges are legitimate, real and immediate, India seeks partners who are sensitive and responsive to India’s expectations and requirements,” the defence minister said.Singh also hoped that Russia will remain a major partner for India in these “changing circumstances”.“From the Ministry of Defence we have urged for greater military-technical collaboration, advanced research, co-development and co-production of defence equipment leading to the self-reliance of India,” Singh said.“Separately, we proposed greater engagements in Central Asia and the Indian Ocean region. India is a continuation of the vast Eurasian landmass and at the same time central in the enormous Indian Ocean region,” he said.“We are optimistic about Russia’s cooperation in all the domains,” he added.Referring to his bilateral meeting with Shoigu, Singh said he had discussed the “emerging challenges India is confronted with and the enhanced requirement of India for closer military and military-technical cooperation with Russia”.In his remarks, Jaishankar said ties between India and Russia have been “close and time-tested” in a world that has changed so much.“They (the ties) have been exceptionally steady,” he said.“We are meeting at a critical juncture in the global geopolitical environment which is in great flux, especially in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.“As close friends and strategic partners, India and Russia have been working together to safeguard our common interests and to ensure peace, progress and prosperity for our peoples,” Jaishankar said.The external affairs minister also said that the situation in Afghanistan has wider repercussions including for central Asia.“The Covid-19 pandemic has raised questions about the current model of global affairs. But the long-standing challenges remain even as new ones emerge Prominent among them are terrorism, violent extremism and radicalisation. The situation in Afghanistan has wider repercussions, including for Central Asia,” he said.Shoigu said bilateral military-technical cooperation is especially important in India-Russia relations, and that he and Singh had finalised plans for future cooperation.Russian foreign minister Lavrov said the 2+2 ministerial dialogue mechanism will further expand traditional understanding and help reinforce the bilateral special and privileged strategic partnership. “Both Russia and India have a similar worldview of a more poly-centric, more multi-polar, more equitable world order. We advocate similar or identical positions on the most important political and military issues,” he said.Tweeting on his discussions with the Russian ministers, Singh said India values its special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia.“India deeply appreciates Russia’s strong support for India. We hope that our cooperation will bring peace,  prosperity and stability to the entire region. Glad that a number of Agreements/Contracts/Protocols were signed pertaining to small arms and military cooperation,” he tweeted.
