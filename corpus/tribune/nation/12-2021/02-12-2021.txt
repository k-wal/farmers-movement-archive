Rather, he added, they were meant to facilitate India’s humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.On India’s reported proposal that the wheat should be shipped either in Indian or Afghan trucks, the official said, “This option is not feasible.”      He said that India was given permission to use Pakistan’s land route on an exceptional basis.“Since there is no two-way trade between Afghanistan and India through Pakistan, even New Delhi knows its trucks cannot be used for the transportation of wheat,” according to the official.The official also said if Pakistan allowed Indian trucks and their crew to use its land route, some incident might happen that would trigger a diplomatic crisis. Secondly, Pakistan did consider the option of using Afghan trucks. However, it was told that Afghan trucks used Pakistani lorries for exports to India.Afghan trucks transfer goods destined for India on Pakistani trucks because of documentation and other requirements. They unload the consignments at the Wagah border. “Therefore, the option of using Indian or Afghan trucks is not feasible,” the official maintained.“The ball is in India’s court. There is no delay on our part,” he added.In October this year, India announced 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat for Afghanistan as humanitarian assistance and sought Pakistan’s permission to transport it through the Wagah border.Afghanistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi had also requested Prime Minister Imran Khan to allow India to transport wheat via Pakistan, suggesting that the Taliban government was willing to accept the humanitarian assistance from India.India has contributed to the humanitarian requirements of the Afghan people. This included providing more than 1 million metric tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan over the past decade. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-turns-down-indias-wheat-transit-proposal-report-345524

02-12-2021||---||Ex-NSA Shiv Shankar Menon seeks Parliamentary oversight for national security bodies||New Delhi, December 2Former National Security Adviser Shiv Shankar Menon on Thursday backed Congress leader and former Union Minister Manish Tewari’s plea for Parliamentary oversight of intelligence agencies.Launching Tewari’s book on 10 national security situations that have impacted India in the last 20 years, Menon pointed out that with the exponential rise of security challenges over the past 20 to 25 years, India has built up a series of national security institutions. It now needs to be ascertained whether they are integrated and how institutions of national security have changed over the years.Speaking at the launch, the Congress leader disclosed that the Government had been stonewalling his questions in Parliament on China on grounds of national security. “It is not just Subramanian Swamy alone. Every question I asked has been refused on grounds of national security. It is a blanket attempt not to disclose anything on China,” he observed, adding that the Government will brief the Opposition on the situation in September last year. “Every time we ask, we are met with a wall of silence,” he complained.“It is surprising that 20 years after Kargil, Chinese similarly intruded across a broad swathe of the frontier. How was it undetected? Why was no responsibility ever fixed? In Parliament there has not been one substantial discussion,” he said.Though the pre-launch publicity of the book was dominated by Tewari’s observation that the UPA government should have explored kinetic options against Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks, the author pointed out that this was his personal observation. That moment had presented the Indian state’s “quintessential dilemma on the use of conventional power that is efficacious against non-state actors”, he clarified.Tewari was, however, unimpressed by the Modi government’s surgical strikes. Such strikes had been going on for a long time but this was the first time the Government took ownership for such a military action.“The question which the BJP should be asking is whether the actions they initiated brought about substantive change in the behaviour of the Deep State of Pakistan,” he pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-nsa-shiv-shankar-menon-seeks-parliamentary-oversight-for-national-security-bodies-345513

02-12-2021||New Delhi||Dam Safety Bill gets Rajya Sabha nod||The Rajya Sabha on Thursday passed a bill that seeks to set up an institutional mechanism for the safety of specified dams in the country.The Dam Safety Bill, 2019 was passed by the Lok Sabha on August 2, 2019. The Rajya Sabha passed the bill with two official amendments through a voice vote. One of the amendments relates to the change in the year mentioned in the bill title from 2019 to 2021.The bill will now go back to the Lok Sabha as the Rajya Sabha has made amendments to it.The proposed legislation provides for surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of the specified dams for the prevention of dam failure-related disasters. It provides for an institutional mechanism to ensure a safe functioning of the dams.The demand of some opposition parties to send the bill to a select committee of the Rajya Sabha for scrutiny was negated as only 26 members voted in its favour, while 80 voted against it.Also, all the amendments moved by the opposition parties were negated.The House, the functioning of which has been disrupted following the suspension of 12 opposition MPs earlier this week, witnessed the participation of 22 members in the discussion on the bill.Participating in the discussion, Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said the proposed legislation will create a National Dam Safety Authority.“That system will have power to impose penalties,” he added.A clause has been added to the bill to impose punishment on the states or people if the norms are not adhered to.Referring to the National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS), he said it works as a think-tank at the central level and the National Dam Safety Authority would monitor the implementation of the recommendations made by the NCDS. Similar bodies would also be there under the state governments.“We have considered the report of the standing committee as the backbone for making this bill,” Shekhawat said.Noting that dam failures lead to loss of lives, he said the stress should be on duties rather than rights.Several opposition members raised concerns that certain provisions of the bill interfere with the federal structure, the minister pointed out.“When the Machchhu Morbi dam broke in 1976, thousands of people lost their lives. When the Morbi dam broke, for the first time in this country a discussion started to set-up a systematic protocol. A committee was formed at that time, which held comprehensive discussions with the states,” he said.Shekhawat said the committee had proposed to make a protocol around the safety of the dams, adding that now, there is an opportunity to support the legislation after 40 years. He said the NCDS has held 38 discussions till date, including comprehensive consultations with the states.Attacking the government over the proposed legislation, Manoj Kumar Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) said it “violates the principle of federalism”. He asked the government to refer the bill to a select committee to remove anomalies.Vaiko of the MDMK also opposed the bill. K Ravindra Kumar of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) said it is not right for the Centre to encroach upon the rights of the states. Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) urged the Centre to send the bill to a select committee.“Do not keep bringing such bills which you have to revoke later,” he said. Singh also urged the House to revoke the suspension of the 12 opposition members.Fauzia Khan of the NCP and GC Chandrashekhar of the Congress also pointed out various lacunae in the bill, while Birendra Prasad Baishya of the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Rambhai Harjibhai Mokariya of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supported the proposed legislation.BJP MP Kamakhya Prasad Tasa said the Lower Subansiri dam is in Arunachal Pradesh while its downstream is in Assam and there is a need to consider the impact on the downstream. He said even small dams should be taken care of. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dam-safety-bill-gets-rajya-sabha-nod-345510
02-12-2021||New Delhi||Journalists protest restrictions on entry of media persons into Parliament||Journalists on Thursday held a protest against certain restrictions imposed on the entry of scribes and camera people into Parliament, alleging the move is a precursor to a “complete ban” on spot coverage of parliamentary sessions by the media in the coming days.They demanded that all restrictions imposed on journalists’ entry into Parliament premises and the Press Gallery must “immediately” be lifted, and media persons be allowed to perform their professional duty.Several senior editors, journalists and camera persons working with various media organisations joined the protest.The Editors Guild of India (EGI), Press Association, Indian Women’s Press Corps (IWPC), Press Club of India (PCI), Working News Cameraman Association and various other organisations of journalists extended their support to the protest.A limited number of scribes, photojournalists and camera people working with the print and electronic media are being allowed to enter Parliament premises during sessions since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year.“This (restriction on the entry of media persons into Parliament) was started in the name of Covid in 2020 but now it has gone too far. I think if it is not protested now, it will become a tradition. Media is going to be kept out in the name of Covid,” senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai said, addressing a protest meet of the journalists organised on the premises of the PCI.He said that a lottery system being followed at present to issue passes to journalists for entry into Parliament is giving “no access” to the scribes working with smaller newspapers.“Covid times require certain norms and rules, but it cannot reach a state where journalists are being denied access,” Sardesai added.Press Association president Jaishankar Gupta said the issue needs to be seen from “a larger perspective” as it is not just about restrictions on the number of journalists entering the Parliament premises during the sessions.While entry passes are being issued through a lottery system and journalists who have permanent passes being denied entry into Parliament, the process for accreditation of journalists by the Press Information Bureau, required to enter ministries and other departments of the government for the purpose of reporting, has been kept on hold for long by the government, he said.“They do lottery for issuing Parliament passes in which a journalist’s turn for getting an entry pass comes once in a week. Journalists who have a permanent pass cannot enter Parliament. Entry of journalists to the Central Hall of Parliament has already been banned. The intention behind all these restrictions is to not let journalists access information,” he alleged.PCI president Umakant Lakhera said that he had raised the issue with the authorities, requesting them to lift all restrictions on the entry of media persons into Parliament but all went in vein. “Democracy cannot function without media,” he said.“If the government can allow opening of cinema halls, malls, tourism and other things, why is there a restriction on the media’s entry into Parliament? It is not sending out a good message to the world. Pandemic is a concern but issues can be resolved,” IWPC president Vineet Pandey said.Office-bearers of various organisations of journalists, while addressing a large gathering of media persons, opined in unison that since the media works as a conduit between the people and lawmakers, it is all the more necessary that the process of free flow of news from Parliament be restored.The protest meet later passed a resolution, appealing to the Union government in general and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha in particular to ease off the restriction on journalists’ entry into Parliament with immediate effect.The journalists took out a symbolic march near the PCI and threatened to intensify their protest in the coming days if their demands were not fulfilled.Later, a joint delegation of journalists’ organisations lead by the PCI president submitted a memorandum to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, urging them to restore the entry of all journalists with permanent passes and sessional passes into Parliament, entry of journalists into the Central Hall and to reconstitute the Press Advisory Committee “at the earliest”.The delegation also demanded the restoration of the provisions for the long and distinguished category for journalists “as a mark of honour for their long service in the profession”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/journalists-protest-restrictions-on-entry-of-media-persons-into-parliament-345509

This Court is not a walk in place only because Chandigarh happens to be in the proximity to Delhi,” a Bench led by Sanjay Kishan Kaul told petitioner Ramesh Chander Diwan.“We are of the view that the petitioner must pay for wastage of judicial time and thus dismiss the petition with cost of Rs 20,000 to be deposited with the Supreme Court Group “c’ (Non-Clerical) Employees Welfare Association within four weeks from today,” ordered the Bench which also included Justice MM Sundresh.“The special leave petition has been preferred not on any other fact or even the fact that the order is wrongly recorded but that the High Court erred in mechanically adjourning the matter for three months without issuing notice to the respondent and that the long adjournment without any interim protection would take away the petitioner’s right to approach a Higher Court,” the top court noted.“We do not know why the adjournment was requested -- whether the counsel was not ready or whether there was lack of material instructions from the petitioner to the counsel! The fact remains that the learned Judge only obliged the counsel for the petitioner by accepting the request for adjournment. Yet the order is sought to be faulted by the petitioner by filing a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of India,” it said in its November 22 order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/this-court-is-not-a-walk-in-place-only-because-chandigarh-is-close-to-delhi-says-sc-345505

02-12-2021||Satya Prakash||Divorced man liable to maintain child till the age of majority, rules SC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 2The Supreme Court has ruled that the liability and responsibility of a father to maintain the child continues till the age of majority despite dissolution of his/her parents’ marriage.“Whatever be the dispute between the husband and the wife, a child should not be made to suffer. The liability and responsibility of the father to maintain the child continues till the child/son attains the age of majority. It also cannot be disputed that the son…has a right to be maintained as per the status of his father,” a Bench led by Justice MR Shah ruled on December 1.The order came on an appeal filed by a woman against the Rajasthan High Court’s verdict confirming dissolution of her marriage with an Army officer ordered by a family court on the grounds of cruelty and desertion on her part. She had complained that she and her 13-year-old son were not getting maintenance from him that they used to get during the pendency of the case.Taking note of the fact that there was an irretrievable breakdown of marriage and the husband has already re-married, the top court upheld the decree of divorce saying, “…no useful purpose shall be served to further enter into the merits of the findings recorded by the courts below on ‘cruelty’ and ‘desertion’ by the appellant-wife”.Noting that the man owed responsibility to his son till he became an adult, it directed him to pay Rs 50,000 per month with effect from December 2019 to the appellant and clear the arrears in eight weeks. Future maintenance would be deducted directly from his salary by the Army and credited to the wife’s bank account, it said.In case he failed to pay the arrears in eight weeks, it ordered the Army authorities to deduct it in monthly installments from his salary not exceeding 50 per cent of his total monthly pay.During the subsistence of the marriage, she had filed several complaints against her husband, including those of extramarital affairs, with Army authorities.However, the husband was exonerated in an enquiry conducted by the Army. He then filed a case in the Jaipur Family Court seeking divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion by his wife. On May 19, 2018, the family court ordered dissolution of their marriage and the order was confirmed by the Rajasthan High Court, forcing her to move the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/divorced-man-liable-to-maintain-child-till-the-age-of-majority-rules-sc-345502

That has been impacted with the Covid pandemic and the months of lockdown that followed. As the world marks another anniversary, those that were left behind count their losses.The official number of deaths from what has come to be known as the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, among the world’s worst industrial disasters ever, was 2,259 but activists estimate the number could be well over 20,000, maybe double that.The effects were devastating for those who survived, and for the generations that followed. Adding to the long-term effects of those who inhaled the gas was the slow poisoning of the groundwater. Those exposed passed the effects on, leading to many children born with disabilities, including Down’s syndrome, muscular dystrophy and attention-deficit disorders.Alfez is 10, Umair 12, Isha 18, Mohsin 24… Just some of the many who live their lives confined to their beds and inside their homes, helpless and totally dependent for their everyday needs. While studies continue and much is still to be known, the chain from that night 37 years ago is clear, said experts. And it is going on still.Azaan is only three years old. He has cerebral palsy, a debilitating, genetic condition that probably goes back to his grandparents who were exposed to MIC.“I was eight months pregnant when the gas tragedy happened. My daughter was born with nasal related complications though not severe,” said his grandmother.Azaan’s seizures have increased in the last six months, probably because he didn’t get regular therapy due to the lockdown. Help has come in the form of therapists from the Chingari Trust, a rehab centre, doing weekly home visits and video calls.Ten-year-old Alfez, who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), leads a lonely life with few people to understand him. His mother Tarannum recalls taking him to a doctor when he wasn’t even a year old and being asked whether anyone in the family was affected in the gas tragedy.It finally turned out that his father Sajid, who was then just a year-and-a-half, had inhaled the gas. Decades down the line, when he had a child, the impact was passed on. And the doctor told Tarannum, “Alfez’s medical condition is congenital.” “The lockdown interrupted Alfez’s regular therapy (which includes speech, occupational and special education at Chingari Rehab Centre). His behaviour has changed. With regular therapy, Alfez had started to speak a bit. That has stopped and now he can’t even tell us when he needs to go the toilet and soils himself.”The behavioural problems of 12-year-old Umair Ahmed, who was born with Down’s Syndrome, have also exacerbated. Much loved by his family, he has started hitting out when someone comes too close because no therapy sessions have been happening. And his attention span has decreased, Umair’s father was just four in December 1984 when he was exposed to the poisonous gas. There could be other reasons for Umair’s medical conditions and research on genotoxic and long-term effects of MIC gas are still going on.The cases are many. Hidden in the bylanes of Bhopal, each story of despair lined with the silver of a loving family which looks after their children with care and empathy.Like 18-year-old Isha Ansari, who has spastic cerebral palsy, and doesn’t have use of her hands but like any other teenager loves listening to music, watching videos and playing on her mobile – operating it all with her toes.In her case, her mother Jainab was exposed to MIC. And both parents drank the contaminated groundwater for years.Amaan, 12, whose parents were exposed to the gas, also has cerebral palsy. He can’t eat himself but loves good clothes and good food, and even tries to do some writing.The lockdown has been tough.According to his family, Armaan was doing better with regular therapy but his condition has deteriorated now. He is not able to squat as he was earlier. He had also started articulating his words but has regressed to communicating through signals.Fifteen-year-old Zoya Khan, who has an intellectual disability with a wrist drop, holds her grandmother tight when she sleeps. “She looks for me,” the fond ‘dadi’, Asha Bi, said. A few months ago, Asha Bi lost her husband. The entire family – Asha Bi, her husband and her son – were affected by the gas leak.While Zoya’s father died a few years ago, the mother doesn’t keep well.Then there is the ever smiling Nida Khan, a 12-year-old who has Down’s Syndrome with alopecia, partial or complete lack of hair. Her mother Shabana Bi was seven when she inhaled the gas.Nida loves playing with her cousin, good clothes – shorts and dresses but not salwar kurta—and her favourite film is “Chennai Express”.The progress made over the years has been hindered by no therapy. She is struggling with her speech. Four months ago, her father passed away. Though she hasn’t been told about it, she senses his absence and sometimes looks out of the window to say, ‘Abbu hain wahan’ (father is standing there)”.Not far away, 12-year-old Ayushi’s mother Jyoti kissed her on her forehead and said, “My daughter needs only two things; continuous love and regular therapy.” One is ever present for the child who has cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability, the other not so much because of the pandemic.Before the lockdown, Ayushi had learnt to sit better, started signalling when she was hungry or when she needed to go to the toilet, said Jyoti, who was five when she breathed in MIC.Her brother’s child also has medical complications like Ayushi. There could be other reasons for Ayushi’s and her cousin’s medical conditions but there are researches on genotoxic and long-term effects of MIC gas.Mohsin is older, 24 and confined to his bed. He would earlier talk and walk but fell 13 years ago and his cerebral palsy worsened.“Mohsin understands almost everything. He knows when guests come home. He recognises us and he plays with me and his siblings. He smiles at us when he is happy”, his mother, who was three in 1984, said.And so it goes on – lives whose destinies were written that cold winter night when poison spread through the air and the water.When will it end? Experts are still looking for answers. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhopal-gas-leak-37-years-on-children-not-then-born-scarred-forever-345497

02-12-2021||---||Our lives depending on unpacking, decoding CCP’s slogans: Tibetan researchers||New Delhi, December 2A team of Tibetan researchers has created a “Decoding Chinese Communist Party” database to tell the wider world what the Communist leaders actually mean when they utter certain phrases.“We Tibetans have unique insights into our powerful neighbour. Often our lives depend upon close and critical readings of China’s official jargon. This website delves into implicit assumptions, unconscious biases, fear and projections of the official Chinese mind and offers keys to deeper understanding,” said Tsering Tomo, director of the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy.“China takes itself so seriously, which is a bit comical,” noted Tsering Dorje, the principal researcher and writer of “Decoding CPP”.“There is a deep history implanted in China’s claim to be an exemplary civilisation. We know the backstory well and navigate our place in the world by unpacking these slogans,” she added.For instance, take the phrase “untrustworthy persons”. There are at least ten phrases that hide behind this seemingly benign term and many of them lead to compulsory incarceration in a re-education centre to instill a change of identity.One description of an “untrustworthy person” is “persons with no official religious duties who possess religious knowledge”. In Xinjiang especially, such people require compulsory re-education.At the launch of the “a sure guide to the indeterminate vagueness of key phrases in constant official use” were Tibetologist Vijay Kranti and former diplomat Deepak Vohra.“If you find yourself dealing with representatives of China’s party-state, you will find in this handbook the fine print that frames Chinese meanings and images,” pointed out Dorje.Vohra expressed satisfaction that the country’s thinkers, diplomats and academics had come out of the “Mira Sinha Bhattacharjee syndrome”, referring to the former diplomat who quit IFS because of a then rule that required women officers to quit on marriage. She then set up the Department of Chinese Studies in Delhi University as well as the China Study Group.Nevertheless, Vohra said she “poisoned the minds of two generations of Indian policy makers, thinkers, diplomats and journalists”.Kranti felt satisfaction that the Indian government had got out of the phobia of not annoying China. He regretted that in the past, the animus displayed towards Pakistan was not there in the Indian approach to China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/our-lives-depending-on-unpacking-decoding-ccps-slogans-tibetan-researchers-345483

But Congress' leadership is not the DIVINE RIGHT of an individual, especially when the party has lost more than 90% elections in last 10 years," Kishor had tweeted."Let opposition leadership be decided democratically," he added.Kishor and his I-PAC team have been working for the Trinamool Congress since the Assembly poll in West Bengal and are working on devising strategies in expanding the party nationally.His remarks come at a time the TMC has made a conscious effort not to follow the Congress's leadership of the opposition in Parliament and questioned the party's ability to take on the BJP.A few months ago, Kishor had held talks with the Congress leadership over his possible induction into the party. He had also met former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and there was serious talk over his entry into the grand old party but it did not materialise.Kishor had taken potshots at the Congress two months ago as well, saying those looking for a quick revival of the opposition led by the grand old party following the Lakhimpur Kheri incident are in for a big disappointment as there are no quick-fix solutions to its "deep-rooted problems".

The GFC awarded him one year’s rigorous imprisonment, dismissal from service and forfeiture of all arrears of pay and allowances and other public money due to him at the time of dismissal.When the findings and sentence were sent to the ITBP Director General, the GFC’s convening authority, for confirmation, the punishment of rigorous imprisonment was remitted, but dismissal from service and forfeiture of financial benefits were upheld.The findings and sentence as confirmed by the Director General were promulgated on December 1, and the officer was struck off the ITBP strength on the same day, according to sources.A GFC in the ITBP is akin to a General Court Martial in the armed forces and has the powers to try any person subject to the ITBP Act for any offence defined in the Act and pass any sentence as mention therein.The officer had been posted as Commandant (Staff) at Sector Headquarters, Srinagar, when the trail by GFC was ordered. He was thereafter attached to Sector Headquarters, Lucknow, for further proceedings.The charges levelled against him were under provisions of Sections 33(b), 33(d) and 33(f) of the ITBP Act that deal with offences with respect to property, including misappropriation and intent to defraud, Section 34 for extortion and exaction, Sector 38 for falsifying official documents and making false declarations, Section 43 for violation of good order and discipline, Section 46 for abetment of commission of an offence and Section 26 for unbecoming conduct.A Court of Inquiry had been ordered in 2019 by the Inspector General, Eastern Frontier, Lucknow, regarding the allegations pertaining to the period when the Commandant (equivalent to a Colonel in the Army) was posted under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Frontier Headquarters.The trial, held first at the location of ITBP’s 39th Battalion in Noida and later at the force’s Service and Supply Battalion at Saboli in Haryana, concluded in August 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-court-dismisses-commandant-deprives-him-of-financial-benefits-after-finding-him-guilty-on-seven-counts-of-misappropriation-345461

Initially 12 fishermen were untraceable, but four of them managed to swim back to the shore, while eight are still missing. We have started a rescue operation with the help of a helicopter sent by the Coast Guard," Khambhra said.According to Navabandar sarpanch (village head) Somvar Majithia, the fishermen were sleeping inside their anchored boats when the strong winds and waves struck the coast around midnight following a sudden change in the weather."There was a storm-like situation after midnight. We have learnt that eight fishermen are missing after their boats got destroyed and capsized in the sea waters due to the rough weather. While 10 boats were totally destroyed, around 40 other boats also suffered damages," Majithia said.Gujarat witnessed a change in the weather conditions on Wednesday with some parts of the state receiving rain, which is unusual in December.Parts of Maharashtra and south Gujarat received rain on Wednesday, owing to a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea and a western disturbance, the India Meteorological Department earlier said, adding that the showers are likely to continue on Thursday.

02-12-2021||New Delhi||Now book your Uber ride via WhatsApp in India||In a global-first move, ride-hailing major Uber and Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp on Thursday announced that people in India can now book an Uber ride via the company's official WhatsApp chatbot.The service is being rolled out on a pilot basis in Lucknow first, and will soon be expanded to other cities in the country."We want to make it as easy as possible for all Indians to take an Uber trip. We are thrilled at this global-first integration for Uber, and look forward to rolling it out across India," said Nandini Maheshwari, Senior Director, Business Development, Uber APAC.Built on WhatsApp Business Platform, the partnership will expand access to Uber's mobility services in one of the company's largest international markets.Currently, the option to book a ride via WhatsApp will only be available in English but it will be expanded to other Indian languages soon."The Uber experience on WhatsApp is simple, familiar, and relatable for users and has the potential to accelerate adoption of Uber with a new category of riders in India," said Abhijit Bose, Head of WhatsApp India.With this integration, riders will no longer need to download or use the Uber app.WhatsApp users can book an Uber ride through three simple ways: messaging to Uber's business account number; scanning a QR code; or clicking a link directly to open an Uber WhatsApp chat.They will be asked to provide pickup and drop off locations.Users will receive upfront fare information and the driver's expected time of arrival."Riders get the same safety features and insurance protections as those who book trips via the Uber app directly," the company said.They will be informed of the name of the driver and licence plate of the driver on booking; be able to track the location of the driver en route to the pickup point and be able to speak to the driver anonymously using a masked number.If the user selects the "emergency" option while on the trip, they will receive an inbound call from Uber's customer support team. Uber riders will also have access to its safety line number to call, if needed, until 30 minutes after the trip ends.

02-12-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court sets 24-hour deadline for govt to come up with concrete measures on air pollution||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 2The Supreme Court on Thursday gave 24 hours to the Centre to propose concrete control measures to check the worsening air pollution condition in Delhi-NCR which has witnessed high AQI levels for several weeks.“We are giving you 24 hours’ time. We want you to take a hard look at this and come up with a solution with seriousness…We will take this up tomorrow morning for 30 minutes, we can assemble at 10 am. You update us about the steps, otherwise we will pass directions,” a Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.“In an emergency situation, you have to work in emergent ways. Suppose the temperature goes up in fever then what can be done to control it?” the CJI said, hinting at setting up a task force if the government failed to come up with concrete measures.“Please let me respond tomorrow and let me speak with the minister. We are not averse to this and highest functionaries are equally worried,” Mehta said."You cannot fire bullets from our shoulders, you have to take steps. We can’t infuse creativity in your bureaucracy…You have to come up with some steps," said the Bench, which has been very critical of the bureaucracy for its “inaction and lack of planning and imagination” to deal with the emergency air pollution condition in Delhi-NCR."They do not want to take any decision. They want courts to pass orders and they are happy to implement it. It is unfortunate that bureaucracy has come to this pass,” the Bench had said on November 17.On Thursday, the top court also pulled up the Delhi government for reopening schools and exposing children to high levels of air pollution."You have implemented work from home for adults. So, parents work from home and children have to go to school. What's this?" asked the Bench which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant.“We are looking at this aggressively...you told us schools are closed but it is not so. Three-to-four-year-old children are being made to go to school…If you want orders we will appoint someone,” the Bench noted.It also took exception to the Delhi government’s 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign to curb vehicular pollution, terming it nothing but a popular slogan. The Delhi government made assurances such as work from home, lockdown, and closure of schools and colleges in the previous hearings but the children were going to school while elders were working from home, it said."Poor young boys standing in the middle of the road with banners, who is taking care of their health? Again, we've to say, other than the popularity slogan, what else is it?" it said.On behalf of the Delhi government, senior advocate AM Singhvi submitted that it’s taking all necessary measures to check air pollution and more than 1500 old polluting vehicles were impounded in November."We think that nothing is happening as the pollution level is increasing. We think that we are wasting our time,” the Bench said, noting that nothing was happening on ground to control the pollution level in Delhi.“As a layman I am asking…the day when this matter started there was X AQI level of pollution, then tall statements were made. If so much effort has been made then how is the pollution rising further...Stubble burning also has come down,” it said.“We are not opposition leaders…our aim is to only control pollution. You had made assurances on the first day that work from home is there and you are ready for lockdown, etc…you closed schools and colleges, but then what?” it asked.“So, basically nothing is happening and everything is being done,” the CJI wondered.On behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey, senior advocate Vikas Singh said, “Today, the AQI level is 500…It’s serious and that means someone is flouting (orders). All these directions like water sprinklers, etc are working or not have to be seen.” He suggested that a proper flying squad has to be deployed to ensure that the ban on certain types of activities was uniformly enforced.Singh took exception to the ongoing work at the Central Vista Project site. “No development can be at the cost of public health. If you go to India Gate, there is a lot of dust around. Ultimately, these bans will not work unless there are flying squads to implement these directions,” he submitted.The Centre had on Wednesday told the top court that all construction activities in the capital by the Central Public Works Department had been stopped following the court’s order, except the Central Vista redevelopment, a project of "national importance".In an affidavit filed in the court, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development said construction activities at Central Vista complied with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-slams-delhi-govt-over-red-light-on-gaadi-off-campaign-345430

Actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan is among the accused in the case.Before being arrested by the Pune police, Gosavi was on the run after his selfie with Aryan had gone viral.A case was earlier registered at Kelwa police station here against Gosavi of cheating under the pretext of offering jobs in Malaysia following a complaint lodged by one Adarsh Kini.The complainant had stated that he saw a Facebook post on April 3, 2018, with an offer to get an overseas job.Kini and his friend Utkarsha Tare contacted the phone number and were assured by the accused (Gosavi) that he would get them jobs abroad and also the passport and visa.The accused took Rs 1,65,000 from Kini and his friend promising them job overseas, the police earlier said.As per the instructions of the accused, Kini and his friend travelled to Cochin from Panvel by train. When they showed the air ticket given to them at the Cochin airport, it turned out to be fake, as a result of which they could not take off, the police said.When they sought refund of the money paid to Gosavi, he evaded them. Realising that they were cheated, they approached the police.The case against Gosavi was registered under IPC Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc) and 471 (using a forged document as genuine), the police said.Kelwa's assistant police inspector Bhimsen Gaikwad said Gosavi would be questioned in connection with the cheating case.

You are propagating regressive colonial values,” said Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, the first one to speak followed by Trinamool’s Kakoli Ghosh, BJP’s Heena Gavit and NCP’s Supriya Sule.The Congress questioned the provision, which says a woman donating eggs should be married with a child of three years.Karti also flagged concerns that the Bill permitted screening of embryos for pre-existing life-threatening diseases. “This amounts to selection,” he said, asking why when the surrogacy regulation Bill provides for records to be stored for 25 years, the ART Bill asks for storage up to 10 years only.Barring surrogacy which will be regulated under a standalone law, the ART Bill will pave the way for regulating other forms of ARTs provided by infertility clinics such as gamete donation, intrauterine insemination (IUI), in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), Intracytoplasmic sperm injection and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).The Bill seeks to establish a national advisory board, state advisory boards and a national registry for the accreditation, regulation and supervision of all ART clinics and banks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-clears-assisted-reproductive-tech-bill-oppn-terms-it-colonial-345265

As of Monday, there have been 261,435,768 confirmed cases of Covid worldwide, including 5,207,634 deaths.Historic decisionThe decision is historic and represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to strengthen the global health architecture against pandemics.  —Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director generalTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General, said WHA’s decision was historic and represented a once-in-a-generation opportunity to strengthen the global health architecture against pandemics.“Covid has shone a light on the many flaws in the global system to protect people from pandemics: the most vulnerable people going without vaccines, health workers without needed equipment to perform their life-saving work, and ‘me-first’ approaches that stymie the global solidarity needed to deal with a global threat,” said the WHO chief.The Health Assembly met in a special session, the second-ever since World Health Organisation’s founding in 1948, and adopted a sole decision titled “The World Together.”As per today’s decision, the INB will hold its first meeting by March 1, 2022, to agree on ways of working and timelines.

The SII cited adequate stock of the vaccine in the country and a demand for a booster shot due to the emergence of new variants, official sources said. In an application to the Drugs Controller General of India, the SII cited that the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency had already approved the booster dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, they said.ICMR norms for FOREIGN ARRIVALS The Centre had a week ago announced resumption of international flights, suspended in March last year after Covid outbreak.

02-12-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws scrapped, President gives assent||The three controversial farm laws that provoked a yearlong agitation in Delhi’s borders stood annulled on Wednesday with President Ram Nath Kovind giving his assent to the repeal bill.The Farm Laws Repeal Bill 2021 was passed by both the Houses of Parliament on November 29, the first day of the Winter Session days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking on Gurupurab (November 19)  assured the protesting farmers of rollback of the laws.With the Presidential assent today, the bills have become history paving the way for the withdrawal of farmers’ protests.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar again appealed to the agitating farmers to return home, assuring to address the issues related to MSP, crop doversification and zero-budget farming through a committee the PM earlier announced.The government has initiated the process of constitution of the panel which, Tomar said, will have the representatives of farm unions.The ball is now in the court of Samyukta Kisan Morcha which will announce its next move on December 4.The Presidential assent repeals The Farmers Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020; The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce Promotion and Facilitation Act 2020 and The Essential Commodities Amendment Act 2020.The Essential Commodities Amendment Act empowered the government to regulate under extraordinary circumstances (war, famine, extraordinary price rise, and natural calamity of grave nature) the supply of cereals, pulses, potato, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils.The government while repealing the laws defended the laws and said it was unable to convince some farmers of the benefit of the move.The statement of reasons for The Farm Law Repeal Bill 2021 passed by Parliament on Monday read, “Even though only a small group of farmers are protesting against these laws, the government tried hard to sensitize the farmers on the importance of the laws through several meetings. Without taking away the existing mechanisms available to the farmers, new avenues were provided for trade of their produce. Besides, farmers were free to select avenues of their choice where they could get more prices for their produce without any compulsion”..The Repeal Bill said extensive consultations were held with various stakeholders before bringing the laws.“The operation of the laws has been stayed by the Supreme Court. During Covid period, the farmers have worked hard to increase production and fulfill the needs of the nation. As we celebrate the 75th year of Independence—Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav—the need of the hour is to take everyone together on the path of inclusive growth and development. In view of the above the farm laws are proposed to be repealed,” Agriculture Minister Tomar said about the Bill.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-scrapped-president-gives-assent-345157
02-12-2021||Bhopal||MP man kills dog after it bites his son, brutality video goes viral||A man allegedly killed a stray dog after it bit his son in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior district, the police said on Wednesday.The incident took place about a month back in Simariatal village, while a video of the brutal killing surfaced on social media on Sunday, following which an animal activist lodged a police complaint, Dehat police station in-charge Anand Kumar said.In the purported video shot from a distance, the man is seen hitting the dog, screaming with pain, with a sharp-edged tool and then chopping off its leg.An activist of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) demanded action in the matter from Gwalior police.Superintendent of Police Amit Sanghi told PTI that an FIR has been registered against the man following the complaint.“According to the villagers, the accused, Sagar Vishwas, was angry as the dog had attacked his son and bitten off flesh of the boy’s jaw. The dog had also bitten at least five other people of the village,” Kumar said.A notice will be issued to the accused for appearing before a court, he said.  Based on a complaint by NGO People for Animals (PFA) activist Chhaya Tomar, the police registered the FIR against the man under Indian Penal Code Section 429 (mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming an animal) and relevant provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.PETA activist Meet Ashar and PFA’s Priyanshu Jain said the incident was caught on a video that went viral on social media platforms.The PETA in a statement said it is learnt that the man allegedly killed the community dog by repeatedly beating the animal with a rod and then chopping off its leg with a knife.“PETA India commends the Gwalior police for taking steps to send across the message that cruelty to animals will not be tolerated,” Ashar said.Jain said they had never come across such an act of cruelty against an animal in Madhya Pradesh.“The accused needs mental evaluation and counselling. Cases like these signify the need for stronger laws against animal abuse,” Jain said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-man-kills-dog-after-it-bites-his-son-brutality-video-goes-viral-345155

02-12-2021||New Delhi||Serum Institute seeks DCGI's approval for Covishield as booster dose||Serum Institute of India has sought from India’s drug regulator approval for Covishield as a booster dose citing adequate stock of the vaccine in the country and a demand for a booster shot due to the emergence of new coronavirus variants, official sources said.In an application to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), Prakash Kumar Singh, the Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Serum Institute of India (SII) cited that the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has already approved the booster dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, they said.Singh is learnt to have said in the application that as the world continues to face the pandemic situation, many countries have started administering booster dose of Covid-19 vaccines.“People of our country as well as citizens of other countries who have already been fully vaccinated with two doses of Covishield are also continuously requesting our firm for booster dose,” an official source quoted Singh as having said in the application on Tuesday.“You are aware that now there is no shortage of Covishield in our country and the demand for a booster dose is increasing day by day from the people who have already taken two doses in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and emergence of new strains.” It is the need of the hour and a matter of right to health of every individual that they should not be deprived of third dose/booster dose to protect themselves in this pandemic situation, Singh stated.The Union government has informed Parliament that the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 are deliberating and considering scientific evidence for the need and justification for a booster dose.Recently, Kerala, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh have urged the Centre to decide on allowing booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine diseased amid concerns raised by ‘Omicron’, the new variant of SARS-CoV-2.The Delhi High Court on November 25 directed the Centre to clarify its stand on administering booster doses to those who are fully vaccinated against coronavirus, saying it does not want a second-wave-like situation on account of being conservative.

02-12-2021||Mumbai||There is no UPA, says Mamata Banerjee after meeting Sharad Pawar||There is no United Progressive Alliance now, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday after her meeting Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar in Mumbai."What is UPA? There is no UPA," Banerjee, the chief of the Trinamool Congress who's on a three-day visit to Mumbai, said after a meeting with Pawar.On his part, Pawar made a fresh pitch for the unity of opposition parties to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party."All those opposed to the BJP are welcome to join us. There is no question of excluding anyone," Pawar told reporters when asked if an alliance without Congress was on the cards. "We discussed the prevailing situation and the need for all like-minded parties to come together and provide a strong alternative to the BJP," the NCP chief said. "Leadership is not an issue at this point. We need to work together against the BJP," he added.Banerjee's statement is significant given her own pronounced attempts to breach regional boundaries. It’s also particularly significant given that Pawar’s NCP is part of a triumvirate that makes up the Maha Vikas Aghadi government along with Congress and the Shiv Sena.Incidentally, both Banerjee and Pawar have their political roots in the Congress party. Banerjee left the Congress to form the TMC in 1997, and Sharad Pawar left it to form the NCP in 1999.Her statement also comes hours after she claimed she’d suggested an advisory council comprising prominent personalities from civil society be set up to give a direction to the opposition to the Congress.“If all regional parties come together, it would be easy to defeat the BJP,” Banerjee said while interacting with some civil society members here. "We want to say BJP hatao, desh bachao," she said, adding that her party Trinamool Congress (TMC) will not contest the forthcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. "I don't want my opposition to make their own strategy. So, I am not revealing much," she said.Banerjee's visit comes amid strain in ties between the TMC and the Congress. After its landslide victory in West Bengal earlier this year, the TMC inducted several Congress leaders into its fold. Recently, 12 out of 17 Congress MLAs in Meghalaya defected to the TMC, making it the principal opposition party.To a query on if she would lead the opposition alliance against the BJP, Banerjee said she is a "small worker" and wants to continue so. "Continuous endeavour is necessary in politics. You can't be abroad most of the time," she said in a veiled dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi."I had suggested to the Congress that there should be an advisory council comprising prominent personalities from the civil society to give a direction to the opposition, but in vain," she said.Banerjee said the BJP is "not safe" and the need is to keep the country safe."Have faith in your cadres. Three farm laws were repealed (by the Centre) and a debate was not allowed in Parliament...why? Because they are afraid and the decision to repeal (the farm laws) was made with an eye on the forthcoming Uttar Pradesh elections," she claimed. "I am not contesting the UP elections," she said adding that her party will work for all sections of the society without bias, but the focus will be on the poor people.She said laws like the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) were being misused in the country. "The UAPA is for the internal security and protection from external forces. This is not for common people. The UAPA is being misused like anything. The I-T department, CBI  ED are also being misused," the TMC chief claimed. Banerjee said there was no need to be afraid and that she will fight till her last breath. The West Bengal CM also said she was against the sellout of public sector enterprises. "More employment should be created. We feel the public and the private sector should co-exist, but employment and the poor should not be impacted," she said.On her meeting scheduled with NCP president Sharad Pawar later in the day, Banerjee said Maharashtra and West Bengal have good relations and that is why she is going to meet Pawar. "Let's be united, give justice to people and save our country and democracy," she said. Banerjee appealed to members of the civil society to travel to across the country to generate awareness towards this cause.On the occasion, NCP leader Majeed Memon said West Bengal and Maharashtra account for 90 Lok Sabha seats and claimed the BJP's strength could be reduced substantially in the Lower House of Parliament.Noted lyricist Javed Akhtar, social activist Medha Patkar, actor Richa Chadha and stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui were among those who participated in the interaction.On Tuesday, Banerjee met Shiv Sena leaders Aaditya Thackeray and Sanjay Raut.The meeting was seen as an outreach to fellow opposition leaders by the TMC head. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-is-no-upa-mamata-banerjee-after-meeting-sharad-pawar-345114
