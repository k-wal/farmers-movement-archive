And I think it is important to remember that vaccines can be tweaked,” Dr Guleria here said on Sunday.“We will have second generation vaccines. This is something which we need to keep in mind. The current vaccines are effective but with new variants, they will decrease on immunity, however vaccines can be tweaked,” he added.He was speaking at the Dr V S Prayag Memorial Oration 2021 organised here in Maharashtra by the Association of Physicians of India.Every year, a new vaccine (for diseases in general) is created based on surveillance data provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO), therefore it is easier to do it, Dr Guleria said.While Omicron was first reported in South Africa on November 24, India’s first two cases of this heavily mutated version of the coronavirus were detected in Karnataka on December 2.Till Sunday, 153 cases of Omicron were reported in India.According to central and state officials, the Omicron cases have been detected in 11 states and Union Territories—Maharashtra (54), Delhi (22), Rajasthan (17) and Karnataka (14), Telangana (20), Gujarat (11), Kerala (11), Andhra Pradesh (1), Chandigarh (1), Tamil Nadu (1) and West Bengal (1).Earlier this year, the Delta variant of the coronavirus was primarily responsible for the deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.

States can implement the new education policy and teach (Bhojpuri) in Class 1 to 12,” the minister of state for education replied.The minister said the Union government issues advisories to the state governments from time to time.“If the state governments want, they can comply with them and make provisions for teaching (Bhojpuri) to students of classes 1 to 12,” she added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-can-make-provisions-for-teaching-of-bhagavad-gita-bhojpuri-in-schools-govt-352517

20-12-2021||New Delhi||Hitting back, Rahul Gandhi dares govt to hold debate in Parliament on issues raised by Opposition||Asserting that it is the government's responsibility to run Parliament, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday said if the Centre has the courage, it should allow debate on issues of public importance raised by the opposition.  "They are attacking democracy. There is a non-stop attack on democracy and that is why we are fighting here," Gandhi said, accusing the government of not allowing debate on price rise, Lakhimpur Kheri and other issues.He was asked about the government's charge that the opposition was not allowing Parliament to function."What kind of government is this that it does not know how to handle Parliament? They cannot stop our voice in raising issues like price rise, Lakhimpur, MSP, Ladakh, Pegasus and suspended MPs. If you have the courage, allow the discussion to take place," he said in a tweet in Hindi.The former Congress chief also said the government should remove its Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra and allow a discussion on the Lakhimpur Kheri issue to enable the Parliament to function."It is the responsibility of the government to bring the house in order and run it and not of the opposition," he told reporters outside Parliament."It is clear, we want that the government to remove its minister and allow a discussion on the Lakhimpur Kheri issue. The government is not allowing it," he said when asked about why they were not allowing the house to function."It is the responsibility of the government to run Parliament. You see the rules and read them, it is the government's responsibility and not ours. It is also the government's responsibility to allow a debate," he said.The Congress leader said he wanted to raise the issue of grant of statehood to Ladakh, but was not allowed to do so."I want to tell all people of Ladakh. Daro mat (Don't be afraid). Whatever is yours, you will get," he said.Opposition parties earlier did not attend a meeting convened by the government to end the standoff over the suspension of 12 Rajya Sabha members, as none of the opposition leaders attended.Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu also expressed concern and disappointment over no resolution being worked out over the issue of suspensions.  Gandhi earlier gave an adjournment notice in Lok Sabha seeking grant of statehood to Ladakh and grazing rights to the people living in border areas of Ladakh."I moved an adjournment motion to raise the issue of Ladakh and the struggle my brothers and sisters in Ladakh are going through, asking for their rights for their statehood. I wanted to support them and I wanted to raise their issue in Parliament. Unfortunately, the government does not allow us to raise it. "So I wanted to give a message to everybody in Ladakh that we are with you and we are going to raise your issue. Unfortunately, the government is not interested in allowing us to raise your issue," he said, adding that there is a lot of anger and pain in Ladakh over the issue of statehood to Ladakh.He alleged that whatever important issues they wanted to raise, the government is not allowing. "Our people have been suspended, but the government is not allowing us to discuss the issue. And then we are being accused of not allowing the house to function," he said.Asked about claims of phone tapping of leaders, Gandhi referred to the Pegasus snooping row."We wanted a discussion, but the government did not allow it also,' he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hitting-back-rahul-gandhi-dares-govt-to-hold-debate-in-parliament-on-issues-raised-by-opposition-352514

I refuse to be ruled by fear, pessimism, and negativity. I refuse to quit. With courage and love, I will push forward. pic.twitter.com/GprpRWtksC  The 37-year-old actor said she first noticed a "tiny lump" in her breast four months ago and got it checked."Four months ago, I felt a tiny lump in my breast. That very moment I knew that my life was never going to be the same. Eighteen years ago I had lost my mom to a dreadful disease and I had since lived under its dark shadow. I was scared."Within a couple of hours, I was at a mammography clinic getting the lump checked out. I was asked to immediately meet up with a surgical oncologist who suggested that I needed a biopsy. The biopsy confirmed all my fears and I was diagnosed with a Grade III Invasive Carcinoma (breast cancer)," Nandini, who has gone bald for her treatment, wrote.The actor said the tumour was removed after a surgery but she later "tested positive for BRCA1 (hereditary breast cancer)"."This means that I have a genetic mutation that almost guarantees that I would have a 70 per cent chance of another breast cancer and a 45 per cent chance of ovarian cancer throughout my life."The only way to mitigate the risk is through some very extensive prophylactic surgeries which I need to undergo before I can claim victory," Nandini added.The actor said she had undergone nine cycles of chemotherapy so far."I have made myself a few promises: I will NOT let this disease Define My Life and that I will fight it with a Smile and Win. I will get back on screen Better & Stronger. I will tell my story so that I can help Educate & Inspire others. And, I will Consciously Celebrate Life & all it has to offer," she added.Nandini then thanked her well-wishers for their "love and concern" which has kept her going through this ordeal."I assure you that I am under the care of an exceptional team of doctors. This along with the unbridled support of my family, friends, and the film fraternity, I'm putting up a spirited fight with a dense dose of positivity and gratitude," she concluded the statement.

On the security side, Moscow is likely to hold the next meeting of NSAs which will be attended by Ajit Doval and his five Central Asian counterparts.The announcement about the presence of the five Central Asian Presidents is likely to come later in the day on Monday when the visiting Foreign Ministers call on PM Narendra Modi. The only Central Asian President to have graced the Republic Day celebrations so far was the now-retired Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan.Besides the sustained engagement with the Central Asian countries, India’s concomitant plan is to open up an alternative transport artery via Iran for these double landlocked countries.At their third meeting on Sunday, the five Central Asian Foreign Ministers along with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar resolved to take their ties to the “next level” in areas of commerce, connectivity, defence and counterterrorism.Significantly, the Central Asian ministers were not shy in endorsing some key principles of transnational connectivity routes even though these could be interpreted as similar to what India says should be there in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In this respect, the joint statement at the end of the meeting said connectivity initiatives are to be based on transparency, broad participation, local priorities, financial sustainability and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.The Central Asian Foreign Ministers were also unequivocal on terrorism as all of them, like India, have in the past battled violence and radicalism from Islamist extremists. The joint statement “condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reiterated that providing safe havens, using terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism and terror financing went against the basic principles of humanity and international relations”.They also wanted perpetrators to be held accountable and brought to justice in accordance with principle of “extradite or prosecute”.Earlier, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in his opening remarks said New Delhi is pleased at the state of the bilateral relations with Central Asia but knows that the potential is very much more. The Foreign Ministers of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan also delivered their remarks.The ministers felt interaction in defence and security was an important element of India-Central Asia cooperation and resolved to regularly hold consultations between their NSAs on terrorism and other emerging security challenges in the region.They decided to continue providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and spoke against the country’s being used for planning terrorist acts and called for concerted action against all terrorist groups.  They also sought an inclusive government, central role of the UN in providing humanitarian assistance and preserving the rights of women, children and other national ethnic groups.It was also decided to jointly celebrate the 30th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Central Asia.The two sides also touched on utilising India’s $ 1 billionn line of credit for infrastructure development projects while Turkmenistan stressed on the importance of the TAPI gas pipeline project.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-asian-presidents-to-be-chief-guests-at-republic-day-parade-352476

We are trying to find out the truth in it. By questioning us (the Shiv Sena), our government and our Hindutva, they are misleading the country, but people are not ready to believe them. I can see this failure in state (BJP) leaders."  The Shiv Sena had not left Hindutva and would never abandon it, the Rajya Sabha member asserted.

20-12-2021||Tribune Web Desk||Revenge of the apes: 2 monkeys 'kill over 200 puppies by dropping them off trees' after dogs kill an infant monkey||Chandigarh, December 20It was a “retaliatory attack” by these two monkeys.  In the last three to four month, over 200 puppies have lost their lives after they were "taken away" by the two simians. According to several reports, the dogs were killed in an act of revenge by the simians after a few dogs killed an infant monkey.Meanwhile, the two monkeys were captured by the forest department in Maharashtra's Beed district for allegedly taking away some puppies and placing them on trees or roofs where they died either without food or after falling over the last few months, an official said on Sunday.These monkeys were trapped on Saturday and shifted to their natural habitat, he said.Range Forest Officer Amol Munde, however, said only 3 to 4 incidents of puppies dying after they were taken away by the two monkeys were reported from this village.A villager, Radhakishan Sonawane, said the two monkeys used to take away puppies with them."Such incidents had been happening over the last three months. These two monkeys come to our village. They take away puppies with them to the roof of houses or at any other place at height."At such height, these puppies don't get any food or water. Hence, they died naturally many times. But sometimes they fell from a height and died. Over 200 puppies had lost their lives in our village," Sonawane told PTI.Munde said the monkeys used to take away puppies, which was their "habit".  "They take care of puppies. They used to keep puppies on roofs or tall trees. The puppies couldn't survive at such places as they couldn't get food or water. If a puppy escaped from the two monkeys it used to die after falling from a height. The reported incidents of the death of puppies in Lavool village are 3 to 4," he added.Responding to a query about whether these monkeys are targetting puppies in "retaliatory attacks", he said no death of any baby monkey was reported in Lavool village in the last few months.He said some people were also injured while running away from the two monkeys. "Monkeys generally don't attack human beings but people are afraid. Some people were injured in the past few days while running away from these monkeys. However, no incident of any monkey bite was reported in this village," Munde added.

In summary, this work suggests that Omicron does appear to have become more immune evasive, but that properties associated with disease progression may be attenuated to some extent. The significant growth of Omicron nevertheless represents a major public health challenge,” Gupta said, signalling possible low severity of Omicron.Anurag Agarwal, Director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said Omicron may need more receptor density to infect and cause less cell-cell infusion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-variant-possibly-less-severe-says-study-352280

He is credited with the liberation of the Marathwada region in Maharashtra from the erstwhile Nizam’s rule.Modi lauded freedom fighters, including those from outside Goa, who fought for the state’s freedom. “When India got Independence, they still continued the fight to liberate Goa. They ensured that the struggle to liberate Goa did not end after India’s Independence,” he said.The PM congratulated the Goa Government for leading in parameters of good governance. The state had topped on parameters such as per capita income, exclusive toilet facility for girls in schools, tap water in every household, door-to-door waste collection and food security, he said.Modi also remembered former Goa Chief Minister late Manohar Parrikar, saying he understood the potential of the state and nurtured it for people’s welfare.During the event, Modi felicitated freedom fighters and veterans of Operation Vijay undertaken by the Indian armed forces to liberate Goa.He added, “Goa came under the Portuguese rule when a major part of the country was ruled by Mughals, but centuries later, neither has Goa forgotten its Indian moorings nor has India forgotten Goa.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goa-wouldve-been-freed-earlier-had-patel-lived-longer-says-pm-352275
20-12-2021||New Delhi||Assess the need to redefine CBI mandate: Parliament panel to government||The parliamentary committee on personnel, law and justice has asked the government to assess the need to amend the existing law or enact a new one to clearly define the mandate of the Central Bureau of Investigation in the wake of eight states withdrawing general consent to the probe agency for investigations. Why the directions1,007 vacancies in CBIOf the 1,007 vacancies, 822 are in CBI’s executive ranks, 88 of law officers and 97 of technical officers (as of January 31, 2021)In its report to Parliament last week, the committee, chaired by BJP’s Sushil Kumar Modi, agreed with the view of the CBI that withdrawal of general consent impeded investigations.Eight states have currently withdrawn the general consent to the CBI on a case-to-case basis. These include West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Kerala.“The committee agrees with the view of the CBI that withdrawal of general consent by states impedes investigation. The committee recommends the government to assess if there is a need to amend the existing laws or bring out a new legislation altogether in order to clearly define the mandate of the CBI and vest more powers in it,” said the panel.It also noted with concern that the CBI had not submitted a view to the panel on whether there was a need to amend existing laws or enact a new one. “The committee would like the CBI to state its opinion regarding the matter,” the panel said.The Ministry of Personnel, in its reply on the question of general consent, told the committee that state governments had withdrawn general consent under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, to the CBI for conducting investigations in the state (not being a UT or railway area) and they were now giving the requisite consent on a case-to-case basis.Recently, in response to a case wherein the West Bengal Government had challenged a CBI move to probe several cases after the state withdrew general consent, the Centre had stated in an affidavit before the Supreme Court that the CBI was an autonomous body and was entitled to investigate charges against Union Government employees without the consent of a state government.The Centre had also said that no state could withdraw general consent to the CBI through an omnibus order but could do the same on a case-to-case basis after due application of mind, keeping larger public interest in mind.The parliamentary panel in its report also flagged 1,007 vacancies in the CBI ranks. It said 822 vacancies existed in CBI’s executive ranks, 88 of law officers and 97 of technical officers as of January 31, 2021.“The committee recommends the CBI to prepare a roadmap as to how and by when it plans to fill such a large number of vacancies. The committee also hopes that cadre restructuring exercise in the CBI is initiated soon,” the panel report said.It said the performance of the CBI was invariably linked to the strength and quality of its personnel. “An organisation is only as good as its people and an understaffed organisation is usually overburdened. The CBI is in grave need of cadre restructuring,” the committee said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assess-the-need-to-redefine-cbi-mandate-parl-panel-to-govt-352269

These, incidentally, are the issues that India says are missing in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).The ministers also condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reiterated that providing safe havens, using terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism and terror financing went against the basic principles of humanity and international relations.They stressed that perpetrators should be held accountable and brought to justice in accordance with the principle of “extradite or prosecute”.

Government has left ten other opposition parties out of the invitation. This is a failed stunt. The opposition is clear – first revoke arbitrary suspensions.”Suspended MPs belong to the Congress, TMC, Shiv Sena and CPM and government invitation for a meeting was also sent to these four parties.Leaders of the four parties said they would not attend the government meeting.RS has witnessed serial disruptions since the MPs were suspended on November 29, the first day of the winter session which is scheduled to end on December 23.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-stalemate-joint-opposition-rejects-govt-proposal-to-meet-4-parties-on-monday-352167
20-12-2021||New Delhi||Rohini court blast accused DRDO scientist tries to kill himself, admitted to AIIMS||A senior DRDO scientist who was arrested for “planting explosives” inside the Rohini district court allegedly attempted suicide by consuming hand wash in a washroom in police custody, officials said on Sunday.The accused, Bharat Bhushan Kataria (47), is undergoing treatment at AIIMS and is completely stable, they said.Kataria was arrested for allegedly planting an improvised explosive device (IED) in a tiffin box inside the Rohini court on December 9 with an intention to kill his neighbour, who had filed several cases against him and was present on court premises that day.The accused was questioned by the Delhi Police’s Special Cell on Friday and subsequently arrested on the same day. He was in police custody since then and was being interrogated, the police said.On Saturday night, Kataria allegedly consumed liquid hand wash inside a washroom and was later found lying unconscious. When asked, he complained of vomiting and stomach ache. He was rushed to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and referred to AIIMS from there, a senior police officer said.“When police personnel went to check on him at the hospital, he told them that he didn’t consume anything. But we spoke to the doctors and they said he had consumed hand wash,” he said.“He is being treated at AIIMS and is completely stable. All his vitals are normal. A senior doctor will be checking on him tomorrow (Monday) and he is expected to be discharged. He will be interrogated soon,” the officer added.The officer said that the accused had prepared himself in advance on how to evade questioning in case he gets caught.“He is misleading and manipulating the investigation team by evading questioning. He is uncooperative and using all that he has studied about the system to avoid interrogation,” he added.The IED planted by Kataria triggered a low-intensity explosion in courtroom number 102. Naib Court head constable Rajeev was injured in the blast.The IED was not properly assembled due to which only the detonator exploded, the police had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/rohini-court-blast-accused-drdo-scientist-tries-to-kill-himself-admitted-to-aiims-352155

20-12-2021||Alappuzha/Thiruvananthapuram||Social Democratic Party of India leader, BJP functionary killed in Kerala; CM condemns killings||Kerala’s coastal Alappuzha district was rocked by back-to-back killings of two party leaders, the first belonging to the SDPI and the second to the BJP, leading to clamping of prohibitory orders by police on Sunday.Following the killing of an SDPI state secretary, a BJP leader was hacked to death subsequently in 12 hours and prohibitory order under CrPC Section 144 was imposed in the entire Alappuzha district on Sunday, district officials said.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan Sunday condemned the killings and said steps will be taken by the police to nab the culprits and those behind them.The Chief Minister said such heinous and inhumane acts of violence were dangerous to the country and that people should keep away from such groups and their hateful activities.K S Shan, the state secretary of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Kerala, was brutally attacked on Saturday night while he was on his way back home and his party alleged the RSS was behind it.Shan succumbed to his injuries at a Kochi hospital around midnight, police said.Hours later, BJP’s OBC Morcha state secretary Ranjeet Sreenivas was hacked to death by some assailants who barged into his house on Sunday morning, police said.Police said it suspects the fatal attack on Sreenivas, also a member of the BJP state committee, was in retaliation to the killing of Shan.State Police Chief (SPC) Anil Kant told the media that senior police officers were camping in the district and additional forces have been deployed there.He said that ADGP-Law and Order would be heading the probe into the two killings and that the police would soon be rounding up troublemakers, ‘goondas’ and their leaders in the area to prevent another such incident from happening in the near future.Kant also said a state-wide alert has been sounded and all district police chiefs have been directed to closely monitor the law and order situation there and if required, prohibitory orders would be imposed and additional forces would be deployed.Terming the BJP’s leader’s killing as disgraceful, Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V Muraleedharan told reporters here that had the police taken appropriate steps after the murder of the SDPI leader, the situation would not have escalated to the present level.He said Sreenivas’ killing was a result of the failure of the state government and the police to take precautionary or preventive steps after the SDPI leader’s murder.He also said that according to information he has received, the SDPI was behind the killing of the BJP leader.The Union Minister said the Chief Minister should change his administration’s stance towards such groups and take strict action against them.He denied allegations that the RSS was behind the SDPI leader’s death, saying in that area the struggle for dominance was between the CPI(M) and SDPI and added that police should investigate who is trying to implicate BJP in the matter.He said that even if Sreenivas’ death was a retaliation, as claimed by some, then the Chief Minister should clarify whether it was an ‘eye for an eye’ system in the state.SDPI’s Kerala president, meanwhile, issued a statement refuting allegations that it was behind the killing of the BJP leader.It said that it was not going to take another person’s life in retaliation for Shan’s death and that it has faith in the rule of law in the country.SDPI said the motive behind implicating it for Sreenivas’ killing was to tarnish its image.SDPI leader, Shan, was on his way home when a car rammed into his bike and as he fell down, the assailants assaulted him leading to his death, police said.Following the BJP’s leader’s killing, prohibitory order was clamped in Alappuzha.
