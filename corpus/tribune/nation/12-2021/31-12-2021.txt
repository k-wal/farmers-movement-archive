These online restaurant aggregators will be liable to pay GST on the services provided through them. They will have to pay an overhead Goods and Services Tax of 5% from cooked food orders.In its 45th meeting in September, the GST Council recommended compliance for food delivering platforms to pay GST on behalf of the restaurants on board. Earlier this month, the finance ministry issued a circular that the new rule will come to play starting 2022. The circular said, “As ‘restaurant service’ has been notified under section 9(5) of the CGST Act, 2017, the e-commerce operator (ECO) shall be liable to pay GST on restaurant services provided, with effect from the 1st January, 2022, through ECO.”This move is expected to impact both restaurants and customers because Swiggy, Zomato will offload a part of the charge to them. It also increases the load on these food aggregators because they are now liable for collecting and depositing GST from restaurants on their platforms.The new charge will be over and above the already existing 18 per cent that platforms pay for rendering delivery services.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ordering-food-on-zomato-swiggy-to-get-costlier-from-january-1-356670
31-12-2021||New Delhi||Congress questions PM’s ‘silence’ on China renaming places in Arunachal||The Congress on Friday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “silence” on reports of China renaming 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh in their own language and calling the north-eastern state as South Tibet.“A few days back, we were remembering India’s glorious victory in the 1971 war. Wise and strong decisions are necessary for ensuring the security and victory of the nation. You cannot win with empty rhetoric,” former Congress President Rahul Gandhi said on Twitter, referring to a news report on the Chinese move.Chief Congress spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala described the Modi government as “weak” and accused Prime Minister Modi of remaining “silent” on Chinese “threats” to India’s territorial integrity.“As the year ends, China threatens our territorial integrity and sovereignty. China has already transgressed & occupied Depsang Plains & Gogra Hot Springs in Eastern Ladakh. China has set up a village in Arunanchal. Mr. 56” refuses to say a word. Weak Govt, Mum PM,” Surjewala said on Twitter, the 56-inch-chest jibe being a reference to Modi’s assertion during the 2014 parliamentary election campaign that he would adopt a strong policy on national security.Addressing a press conference here, Congress spokesman Gourav Vallabh wondered when the Prime Minister would “look China in the eye” and take strong steps to counter its moves.“Will our response be limited to banning Chinese apps, while India-China trade crosses the 100-billion-dollar mark,” Vallabh asked.He said the government should respond to Chinese moves strongly and assured the support of Congress in every such step.According to the Chinese state-run Global Times, the country’s Ministry of Civil Affairs announced on Wednesday that it had standardised in Chinese characters, Tibetan and Roman alphabet the names of 15 places in Zangnan, the Chinese name for Arunachal Pradesh.India had strongly rejected China’s action and asserted that Arunachal Pradesh has “always been” and “will always be” an integral part of India and that assigning “invented” names does not alter this fact.

So if returns are being filed in such numbers, I see no reason for anybody to claim (deadline extension)”, Bajaj told reporters.He said as on December 30 last year, 4.83 crore tax returns were filed, compared to 5.43 crore filed till December 30, 2021.The government has already extended the deadline for filing income tax returns for 2020-21 fiscal year (ended March 2021) by five months till December 31.“I expect another at least 20-25 lakh returns to come by 12 in the night... The figures that we were anticipating would have come... There is absolutely no proposal to extend the dates,” Bajaj said.To a query on the glitches on the I-T portal impacting filing, he said “I’m okay (with extension) if the returns were less by 1 crore. But the returns filed is more than last year’s... I’m watching the figures every hour... ITR filings are going up to 3 lakh (per hour) “.

When we receive complaints regarding content on our platforms, we assess them carefully,” it added.The content removal was done under several categories, including copyright (60,387), trademark (535), circumvention (131), court order (56) and graphic sexual content (5).Google explained that a single complaint may specify multiple items that potentially relate to the same or different pieces of content, and each unique URL in a specific complaint is considered an individual “item” that is removed.For user complaints, the “removal actions” number represents the number of items where a piece of content was removed or restricted during the one-month reporting period as a result of a specific complaint, while for automated detection, the “removal actions” number represents the number of instances where Google removed content or prevented the bad actor from accessing the Google service as a result of automated detection processes.Google said in addition to reports from users, the company invests heavily in fighting harmful content online and use technology to detect and remove it from its platforms.“This includes using automated detection processes for some of our products to prevent the dissemination of harmful content such as child sexual abuse material and violent extremist content.“We balance privacy and user protection to: quickly remove content that violates our Community Guidelines and content policies; restrict content (e.g., age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences); or leave the content live when it doesn’t violate our guidelines or policies,” it added.Google said automated detection enables it to act more quickly and accurately to enforce its guidelines and policies. These removal actions may result in removing the content or terminating a bad actor’s access to the Google service, it added.Under the IT rules, large digital platforms - with over 5 million users - have to publish periodic compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken thereon.The report needs to also include the number of specific communication links or parts of the information that the intermediary has removed or disabled access to in pursuance of any proactive monitoring conducted by using automated tools.

31-12-2021||New Delhi||Omicron has started replacing Delta variant in India: Sources||Omicron has started replacing Delta variant in the country in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases and 80 per cent of the travellers who tested positive have this new variant, official sources said on Friday.However, a third of all the detected cases were mildly symptomatic, and the rest were asymptomatic, they said.A total of 1,270 Omicron cases have been detected across 23 states and UTs so far, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday.Noting a considerable decline in Covid testing, the Centre had on Thursday urged 19 states/UTs to ramp up testing “in a big way” to identify the positive cases promptly and restrict the spread of transmission in view of the increased transmissibility of Omicron variant, and the larger preponderance of asymptomatic cases.Since, the first two cases of Omicron variant were announced in the country on December 2, the Health Ministry has been working in a mission mode and constantly guiding states on the measures to be undertaken to contain the spread of the infection.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also regularly holding meetings to review the status of Covid-19, Omicron and preparedness of health systems across the country, while Union Health Minister Manuskh Mandaviya reviews the ongoing situation with expert teams and senior officials daily.He also takes updates on the buffer stocks of drugs and ventilators and oxygen availability.The Health Ministry’s war room is working 24x7 and analysing all trends and surges, and monitoring the nationwide situation.The ministry has advised states and UTs to enhance testing, strengthen hospital preparedness, increase the pace and coverage of vaccination drive and ensure strict enforcement of restrictions to counter the spread of infection wherever necessary.It also advised setting up containment zones and buffer zones as per extant SOPS, strengthening hospital-level preparedness and ensuring optimal utilisation of financial resources under ECRP-2.Ninety per cent of India’s eligible adult population has been administered the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and 64.40 per cent people are now fully vaccinated.Highlighting the vaccination coverage in other countries with highest cases and deaths, sources said the data shows vaccination reduces hospitalisation and death. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-has-started-replacing-delta-variant-in-india-say-sources-356649
31-12-2021||New Delhi||Chinese Embassy writes to MPs against supporting Tibetan cause, triggers strong reaction||A letter written by the Chinese embassy to several Indian lawmakers for attending a reception hosted by the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile triggered sharp political reactions on Friday, with a prominent parliamentarian slamming the mission for commenting on a matter in which it does not have a locus standi.At least six MPs from various political parties attended the dinner reception in Delhi last week.The Chinese embassy, in a letter to some of the members of the All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet, expressed concern over their attendance at the event and asked them to refrain from providing support to Tibetan forces.Sujeet Kumar, the convenor of the forum, said the Chinese embassy has no locus standi to write to an Indian MP.There was no immediate reaction from the government on the issue. Generally, India does not approve of any foreign embassy commenting on the country’s internal matters.The Chinese embassy’s letter came in the backdrop of strain in ties between the two countries following the eastern Ladakh border row.Kumar, a BJD MP, said he himself has not received the letter but several other members of Parliament have got it.“I personally treat the letter with the contempt it deserves. It is not the first time the embassy has written to me, it has written to me several times. The embassy does not have any locus standi to write to an Indian parliamentarian. If it had any issue, it could have written to the Ministry of External Affairs. It has violated the protocol,” he told PTI.Underlining that the meeting of the Indian MPs with the Tibetan government-in-exile was not a political engagement, Kumar said it was aimed at promoting cultural and trade ties.“We have not met the Tibetan government-in-exile on behalf of the Ministry of External Affairs or the Indian government. We attended the dinner as members of the All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet. Our meeting was aimed at promoting cultural and trade ties between India and Tibet.“The forum is advocating for the preservation of Tibetan art, culture and philosophy. We do not want to engage in political activities but wish to increase people-to-people interaction,” he said.Kumar added that as an Indian citizen, he can express his views and so can other MPs.He said the members of the forum do intend to visit Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh and meet the Dalai Lama.When contacted, Manish Tewari of the Congress, who is also a member of the forum, said, “My attention has been drawn to a report published in some English newspaper. Neither have I received any letter nor will I demean or diminish myself by responding to such imbecile missives. Had (Chinese Foreign Minister) Wang Yi written, perhaps I would have considered responding.”     After a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and came to India, where he set up a government-in-exile.Beijing has in the past accused the Dalai Lama of indulging in “separatist” activities and trying to split Tibet, and considers him as a divisive figure.However, the Tibetan spiritual leader has insisted that he is not seeking independence but “genuine autonomy” for all Tibetans living in the three traditional provinces of Tibet.Kumar, who was recently appointed as the convenor of the All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet, said the forum was almost defunct for several years, but it is being revived now.“The forum was very active when late George Fernandes was its convenor. Later, I think it got defunct, it was not very active. Now, it is being revived. We have plans to visit Dharamshala and meet his holiness the Dalai Lama. We also want to talk about the cultural genocide in Tibet,” he said.

Are you his partner? Because only partners know whose money is kept,” she said.Dismissing opposition charge that the raids were politically motivated, she asked if the raiding parties come empty handed.Recovery of money shows there was actionable intelligence, she said, adding the raids happening on Friday too were based on such inputs.

31-12-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks court-monitored investigation, prosecution in connection with hate speeches||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored investigation and prosecution in hate crimes related to the “continuous attack” on the personality of Prophet Mohammad and disparaging remarks by various people in different parts of the country attacking the very belief system of Muslims at large.The plea has been filed by the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind through its president Maulana Syed Mahmood Asad Madani and it seeks a direction to the Centre for a report on the action taken by different state mechanisms in relation to hate speeches, more particularly targeting the personality of Prophet Mohammad.The petition, which has been filed by advocate MR Shamshad, also sought directions and orders for constituting an independent committee to compile all the complaints related to hate crimes in the country.“It is submitted that insulting Prophet Mohammad is akin to attacking the very foundation of Islam and in that sense, is of an extremely grave nature as it results in not only the targeting of Muslim people, but also assailing the basis of their faith,” the plea said.It said such speeches go beyond the limits of a permitted critical denial of another’s beliefs and are certainly likely to incite religious intolerance, and the state as well as the central authorities ought to consider the same to be incompatible with respect to the freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and must take proportionate restrictive measures.“It is also pointed out in the petition that such speeches destroy the secular fabric of our nation, which also forms the part of the basic structure of our Constitution. Resultantly, the respondents, being bound by the Constitution, ought to have an adversarial relationship with the proponents of such speeches and must take adequate remedial steps to prevent the same,” the plea said.The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind said it has approached the court after waiting for a considerable amount of time and giving the state authorities time to take appropriate steps for remedial action as well as preventive measures.“However, it appears that the state authorities have completely failed in this regard. The petitioners have also taken steps by lodging appropriate complaints before the police authorities. Against many other communally sensitive speeches, the police have not at all registered an FIR and if the aggrieved persons have approached the court of the magistrate seeking appropriate directions for registration of FIRs, the magistrate has dismissed the complaints...,” the plea said.It added that considering the facts, it is necessary that the court invokes the extraordinary jurisdiction by issuing appropriate directions, fixing the accountability of responsible persons placed within the system and also laying certain guidelines as to how the issue of hate speeches and those accused of giving such speeches are to be dealt with in a time-bound manner.“The petitioners are making the submissions being conscious of the fact that these hate speeches, specifically when they are made against religious personalities like Prophet Mohammad and the Muslim community at large, the diversity in the country and the peaceful coexistence of the followers of different religious beliefs come under a serious threat,” the plea stated.It added that protecting the diversity and peaceful coexistence of all citizens of the country is the collective responsibility of the society at large, including the authorities responsible for maintaining law and order. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-seeks-court-monitored-investigation-prosecution-in-connection-with-hate-speeches-356638

During their rule they stashed black money. Today the ‘durgandh’ (bad smell) of Samajwadi Party ‘ittra’ (perfume) is spreading. Today when raids are going on, they (SP) are getting worried,” Shah said addressing the public rally in Ayodhya.He also asked people whether the enforcement agencies should not conduct raids on corrupt people who have black money.“Do you have any problem or issues that people with black money are being raided,” Shah asked people at the rally, where he also targeted the Congress and other rivals in the poll-bound UP.    The Samajwadi Party, which is completely backing Pushpraj Jain, is claiming that now the BJP has gone after the “real target” after “mistakenly raiding Piyush Jain, their own man”.The Income Tax Department today raided multiple premises linked to perfume traders and some others in Uttar Pradesh as part of a tax evasion investigation, including in Kannauj.The Samajwadi Party tweeted from its official handle that the premises of its MLC Pushpraj alias Pampi Jain in Kannauj had been raided.It claimed that the raids were launched by the “BJP government” after Yadav announced in the media conference there and dubbed the action as an “open misuse of central agencies by a scared BJP”.Yadav had recently launched a perfume called ‘Samajwadi ittra’ prepared by Jain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/massive-political-war-in-up%E2%80%94bjp-and-sp-trade-charges-amit-shah-targets-akhilesh-yadav-in-ayodhya-356631

But what when a wild cat attacks the safari vehicle? Now, that can be quite tricky. A video shared by industrialist Anand Mahindra is doing rounds on the internet. In the video, a tiger can be seen chewing down the rear bumper of a Mahindra Xylo SUV. The wild cat even manages to drag the car (filled with tourists) backwards just with its jaws.One of the tourists can be heard saying, “Oh, my God, he is pulling the whole car.”The entire view is clearly captured by tourists in another car standing on the road. Anand Mahindra, who shared it on his Twitter account, saw the video on Signal. The chairman of Mahindra Group believes the tiger shares his view about the car. He wrote, “Well, that car is a Xylo, so I guess I’m not surprised he’s chewing on it. He probably shares my view that Mahindra cars are Deeeliciousss.”Watch the video:Going around #Signal like wildfire. Apparently on the Ooty to Mysore Road near Theppakadu. Well, that car is a Xylo, so I guess I’m not surprised he’s chewing on it.

31-12-2021||Beijing||China says Arunachal Pradesh 'inherent part' of its territory||China on Friday defended the renaming of 15 more places in India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, claiming that the southern part of Tibet is an "inherent part" of its territory.India on Thursday strongly rejected China renaming 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh and asserted that the state had "always been" and would "always be" an integral part of India and that assigning "invented" names did not alter this fact.India's reaction came in response to China's Ministry of Civil Affairs announcing Chinese names for 15 more places in Arunachal Pradesh which Beijing claims as South Tibet."We have seen such. This is not the first time China has attempted such a renaming of places in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. China had also sought to assign such names in April 2017," External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in New Delhi."Arunachal Pradesh has always been, and will always be an integral part of India. Assigning invented names to places in Arunachal Pradesh does not alter this fact," Bagchi said.Asked for his reaction to India's assertion, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that “the southern part of Tibet belongs to the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China and it has been China's inherent territories”.“People of different ethnic groups have been living in that area for many years and have given many names for that areas,” he said.“For standardised management of the area, the competent authorities in China in accordance with relevant regulations have published the names for the relevant area. These are matters within China's sovereignty,” Zhao said.This is the second batch of standardised Chinese names of places in Arunachal Pradesh released by China.The first batch of the standardised names of six places was released in 2017.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet which is firmly rejected by the External Affairs Ministry which has asserted that the state is an "inseparable part of India".Beijing routinely protests against visits of top Indian leaders and officials to Arunachal Pradesh to reaffirm its claim.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488 km long Line of Actual Control (LAC).China's renaming of the places in Arunachal Pradesh came in the midst of the lingering eastern Ladakh border standoff that began in May last year.

Sources, however, said another perfume trader based in Kannauj and one in Kanpur were also being searched as part of the latest action.Sources said the action was launched after the department obtained details from the Goods and Service Tax (GST) department about possible income tax evasion by perfume business entities and others by allegedly claiming bogus input tax credit.The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), an investigation agency under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), had recently carried out large-scale raids in Kanpur and Kannauj against Shikhar brand pan masala, a transporter and others and later arrested perfume trader Peeyush Jain, seized over Rs 197 crore cash apart from 26 kg gold and huge quantity of sandalwood oil.Both Peeyush Jain and Pushpraj Jain have their residential premises located at a distance of few metres in the same locality in Kannauj.The I-T department functions under the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).The DGGI raids and recovery of cash have triggered a war of words between political parties in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a rally in Kanpur on Tuesday, took a veiled dig at the Samajwadi Party over the cash seizure, saying the ‘ittar’ (perfume) of corruption that it had sprinkled all over Uttar Pradesh before 2017 is there for everyone to see. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-t-raids-uttar-pradesh-entities-engaged-in-perfume-trade-sp-says-kannauj-mlc-searched-356607

She was dragged out of her car by a few men and attacked with lethal weapons at 11 pm.The police cracked the murder case on December 30 and arrested seven people, including the victim's second husband Naveen Kumar (33) and daughter Yuvika Reddy, in connection with the murder in Bengaluru.DCP South East Srinath M Joshi had earlier said that the accused had conspired to kill Archana Reddy to get her property and lead a luxurious life. However, the investigations revealed that Naveen and Yuvika fell in love and wanted to lead a lavish life after getting married, according to police sources.Naveen, a gym trainer, had promised to make Yuvika, who was pursuing her B Com, a model and trained her in the gym.After the gyms closed down during the pandemic, he continued to train her in the house, police said.Archana had a daughter and a son from the first marriage. Her late father was a realtor and she owned properties worth Rs 40 crore in the Jigani area of Bengaluru.The woman got a hint about her daughter and second husband's relationship and had objected to it. She had filed a dowry case against Naveen in November.She confronted the two and threatened to disinherit her daughter from her ancestral property if she continued her relationship with her stepfather. However, the duo moved out after the fight.Archna had also sent goons to Naveen's house to warn him to stay away from her daughter and send her back. But he had clarified that he would divorce her and marry Yuvika.However, they could not lead a luxurious life as Naveen earned Rs 25,000 as a gym trainer and after lockdown the gyms were closed down leading to a financial crunch and plotted the murder.The investigations were based on eyewitness accounts, CCTV footage and complaint. The police have secured the custody of the accused and investigated the case.After the murder of his wife, Navin had allegedly made calls to Yuvika to inform her about the murder.

He will be produced in a court within 24 hours of custody, the official said.However, MP Home Minister Mishra termed the Chhattisgarh Police’s action as “highly objectionable”. “The federal structure did not allow such an action. They should have informed us. If they wanted, they could have summoned him (Kalicharan) by sending a notice. I have asked MP DGP to immediately talk to Chhattisgarh’s DGP and register a strong protest and also seek an explanation on the issue,” Mishra told reporters in Bhopal when asked about the seer’s arrest.During the conclusion of the two-day ‘dharma sansad’ (religious parliament) in Raipur on Sunday evening, the seer had allegedly used abusive words against the Father of the Nation, and asked people to elect a staunch Hindu leader as the head of the government in order to protect the religion. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chhattisgarh-arrests-hindu-seer-from-mp-both-states-spar-356458

Addressing a rally at Aligarh, he praised the Yogi Adityanath government, claiming no “bahubalis (musclemen)” were visible in the state now.Editorial: UP shockers: No end to caste atrocities and crimes against girls“The people of Uttar Pradesh do not need the ‘nizam’ of bua, babua and bahan (reference to BSP chief Mayawati, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra). Their ‘nizam’ is a symbol of corruption, crime and hooliganism,” he alleged.Addressing BJP’s Jan Vishwas Yatra, Shah said, “The SP, BSP and the Congress have given a new LAB to Uttar Pradesh. It means loot, aatankvaad (terrorism) and bhrashtachar (corruption). These parties have looted the state and have worked to fill the sacks of perfume traders.”Shah alleged that the general public, especially “our daughters and sisters” were harassed by ‘bahubalis’ during the Samajwadi Party government in the state. “Today in the regime of Yogi Adityanath, these musclemen have disappeared.”The Union Home Minister claimed that even if the ‘bua-babua-bahan’ were to come together in UP, they would not succeed. He alleged while “700 riots” took place during the Akhilesh government, “ no one has had the courage to incite riots during the Yogi dispensation.”Praising the Modi government, Shah said it had dealt a heavy blow to terror activities and “our neighboring country was given a befitting reply after the terror strike in Pulwama”. He asserted the BJP would win more than 300 seats in the upcoming elections. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/home-minister-says-up-free-of-bahubalis-under-yogi-government-356456

The system is in the final stages of development and then it will be put to trial. The idea is to target all homeless, shelter-less destitute who might not have ration cards,” Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told the media.The government supplies foodgrain at Rs 1-3 per kg to more than 81 crore people having ration cards through the Public Distribution System (PDS) as part of the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The Centre is also supplying free foodgrain to NFSA beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) as part of relief measures during the Covid pandemic. This scheme is valid till March 2022.However, the homeless and the destitute with no ration or identity card or residential address proof cannot be covered under the NFSA and the PMGKAY.“All these issues will be addressed,” said Pandey.Meanwhile, FCI CMD Atish Chandra said states had lifted 11.21 lakh tonnes of foodgrain in the 2021-22 fiscal for distribution to people not covered under the NFSA.State governments have managed to cover 79.71 crore out of the total 81 crore NFSA beneficiaries.

India recorded the highest single-day rise in Omicron infections with 180 fresh cases, taking the total tally to 961 on Thursday.Delhi recorded the maximum number of cases (263) followed by Maharashtra at 252, Gujarat 97, Rajasthan 69, Kerala 65 and Telangana 62. The daily rise in Covid-19 cases crossed the 13,000-mark after nearly 49 days, taking the total tally to 3,48,22,040, while the active cases increased to 82,402.“The R0 is 1.22 as per the available data... so the cases are now increasing, not shrinking. As the scenario emerges, we believe what we are witnessing could be part of the global rise in cases pushed by the Omicron variant... we are already aware that this variant is highly transmissible and that perhaps explains the speed with which it is rising in the world.“As we have explained, the severity issues are answered and we quote World Health Organisation’s statement — severity (is) hopefully mild but cannot be taken for granted. This is work in progress,” Paul said.He, however, urged people not to panic. “As a nation, we are prepared. As a nation, we have experience and the massive shield of very high coverage of the vaccine. I repeat, no need to panic. But there is a need to be prepared, to be responsible and disciplined.”Several state governments have taken appropriate measures, Paul said, adding that all variants enter through the same route and that can be blocked by wearing a mask. — PTICovaxin safe for 2-18 age group: StudyNew Delhi: Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) on Thursday announced that BBV152 (Covaxin), its whole-virion inactivated Covid-19 vaccine candidate, has proven to be safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic in paediatric subjects in phase II/III study.

This is not the first time China has attempted such a renaming of places in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. China had also sought to assign such names in April 2017," said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.The 15 "renamed" places include eight townships, four mountains, two rivers and a mountain pass in Arunachal Pradesh. In 2017, China had Sinicised the names of six places in Arunachal Pradesh.At that time, it was seen as a retaliation against the Dalai Lama's visit to the state.Officially, China said its civil affairs ministry had "standardised" in Chinese characters, Tibetan and Roman alphabet the names of 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh which it calls Zangnan or South Tibet.But this time, the renaming takes place when the armies of both countries are in forward deployment along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. It also took place a couple of days before China's new Land Border Law comes into effect on January 1, 2022.The Ministry of External Affairs has expressed concern over the law and called on China to "avoid undertaking action under the pretext of this law which could unilaterally alter the situation in India-China border areas".China had earlier defended the renaming, stating that the renaming was "carried out in accordance with our regulations about the names of localities and it is a legitimate action by the Chinese government".Beijing lays claim over 90,000 sq km of territory in Arunachal Pradesh of India, but New Delhi has consistently rejected the claim.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-renames-arunachal-sites-it-doesnt-change-status-says-mea-356436

The meeting was also attended by some Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers, besides senior officers from states and the Centre.Union Finance Secretary TV Somanathan welcomed the participants and informed them about the importance of this particular consultation meeting, said an official news release.“Most of the participants thanked the Union Finance Minister for financially supporting their states/UTs during the worst months of the pandemic, by enhancing borrowing limits, providing back-to-back loans to states and through special assistance for capital expenditure.Key suggestionsThe participants also gave numerous suggestions to the Union Finance Minister for inclusion in the Budget speech. Among the suggestions were increased research and development (R&D) spending, infrastructure status for digital services, rationalisation of income tax slabs, investment in online safety measures and incentives to hydrogen storage and fuel cell development.On personal income tax, some state Finance Ministers felt the personal income tax slabs saw sharp a jump from 5 per cent to 20 per cent and 30 per cent slabs. Multiple surcharges on some of the slabs jack up the personal income tax rate to over 40 per cent.Pointing out that the Centre has already reduced corporate tax rates to increase compliance and attract more industry, they felt such an approach could be applied to income tax slabs as well.GST compensation for another 5 yrs soughtOpposition-ruled states have demanded extension of GST compensation cess from two to five years.

Would you forget their sin? Will you get carried away by their tall promises?” he asked a cheering crowd at the MB Inter College ground in Haldwani.“Generations of people in Uttarakhand villages were forced to leave their homes in the absence of roads and other facilities and migrate somewhere else,” he said.“While I correct their mistakes, you teach them a lesson,” the Prime Minister said.Apart from the Lakhwar Project, the PM inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of Rs 8,700 crore road projects to “improve connectivity in remote, rural and border areas”. “The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra will get better connectivity,” he said.The PM also laid the foundation stone of AIIMS Rishikesh satellite centre at Udham Singh Nagar, Jagjivan Ram Government Medical College at Pithoragarh, Aroma Park at Kashipur and Plastic Industrial Park at Sitarganj, along with initiatives in housing, sanitation and drinking water supply in the state that goes to polls early next year.Lakhwar hydropower projectRs5,747 crore estimated cost300 MW Electricity to be generated330 million cubic MWater in its reservoir will supply irrigation and drinking water to U’khand, HP, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan & Delhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-uttarakhand-pm-modi-accuses-previous-governments-of-looting-state-356423

31-12-2021||Chennai||Heavy rains pound Chennai; roads, subways inundated||Heavy to very heavy rains pounded Chennai and the suburbs on Thursday, inundating roads and subways, and the intense spell may turn out to be one of the heaviest witnessed in recent years.It was a repeat of scenes witnessed here last month as motorists struggled to manoeuvre their vehicles on flooded roads and subways while showers led to traffic congestion as well in many areas.Starting from noon, most areas in the city and suburbs began receiving rainfall and it was heavy to very heavy in several locations.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the highest rainfall of 17.65 CM was recorded in MRC Nagar here. It was 14.65 CM and 10 CM at Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam respectively.In other areas, including those falling under neighbouring Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts, the showers ranged from 1 CM (Madhavaram) to 10 CM (Nandanam). The rainfall data was recorded between 8.30 AM and 6.15 PM today.Isolated heavy to very rainfall activity is likely to continue over north coastal Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas of south coastal Andhra Pradesh during next three days and decrease thereafter, the IMD said.Weather enthusiasts made claims in the social media vis-a-vis the intensity of rains and on showers beating previous records.One such claim said Thursday’s rains in Chennai was the heaviest for a single day in the month of December after 2015.IMD officials here, however, did not confirm such claims.Officials said a conclusion could be arrived at only after looking into actual rainfall for the 24-hour period and following a scrutiny of previous data.Enthusiast Pradeep John (Tamil Nadu Weatherman) tweeted, “Mylapore crosses 200 mm. One of the craziest spells of lifeime. Chennai City (Nungambakkam) beats 2015 annual rainfall.”  In another tweet, he said,”2015 annual rainfall is overtaken by 2021 & is the 3rd wettest year of all time behind 2005 & 1996.”   He had also given data for Chennai city (Nungambakkam) to support his claim.Tamil Nadu witnessed heavy rainfall during the north east monsoon (October-December) monsoon and according to the weather office, presence of ‘convective cells,’ led to rainfall.A weather forecast by the IMD (issued 12.30 hours on December 30) had said: “Thunderstorm with moderate rain is likely to occur at a few places over coastal Tamil Nadu. Thunderstorm with moderate rain is likely to occur at many places over Villupuram, Cuddalore and Delta districts, Puducherry and Karaikal. Light rain is also likely to occur at isolated places over Interior Tamil Nadu districts.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/heavy-rains-pound-chennai-roads-inundated-356408

Besides, ramping up testing in the initial days itself will help to ensure that the infected individual does not spread the virus to others,” Ahuja said.“However, it is observed that there has been a considerable decline in COVID-19 testing in some states, which is a cause of serious concern,” she said.The official advised the states and UTs to ensure focused and comprehensive testing as per extant ICMR guidelines and to ramp up testing in a big way to identify Covid-positive case promptly and also to restrict transmission.It is also important to ensure other logistics like sufficient stock of testing reagents and kits etc are maintained so that there are no stock-outs or shortages.She asked the states and UTs to review the same and ensure sufficient stock as well as regular arrangement of testing facilities, consumables and logistics.A total of 961 cases of the Omicron variant have been detected across 22 states and UTs so far, while the daily rise in COVID-19 cases crossed the 13,000-mark after around 49 days, taking India’s total tally of infections to 3,48,22,040.The count of active cases in the country has increased to 82,402, according to the data updated at 8 am.

With Omicron looming, we need 95.10 crore doses,” he said.Surjewala sought to know whether the Election Commission had even asked the Modi government to share the data of COVID-19 infection, particularly the spread of Omicron, the vaccinations plan and timeline and efficacy of vaccine.He accused the poll authority of being a “mute and complicit bystander” during the first wave of the pandemic as Prime Minister Narendra Modi “went ahead with ‘Namaste Trump’ and carried on with huge election rallies in Bengal and Jan Ashirvaad Yatras elsewhere”.The Allahabad High Court had on December 23 suggested the Union government defer the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections due to a possible Omicron-driven third Covid wave.Earlier in day, Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra said in Lucknow that all political parties in Uttar Pradesh want the Assembly elections to be held according to schedule while ensuring Covid protocol.The CEC also asked the state to step up coronavirus vaccination.

Not only have the rural people but people in urban areas also shown their support to the party,” he stated.“They have reposed faith in us and we will deliver their expectations in future,” he said.Reacting to Siddaramaiah’s claims, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that the Congress has managed to win a few city corporation seats where minorities are more in number.“Let them not rejoice with that. We have won more gram panchayat seats. The results are also favourable in city corporations. BJP is going to come back to power in 2023, let Siddaramaiah and Congress not worry about that,” he stated.However, CM Bommai suffered a setback as Congress managed to win the Bankapura Municipality which comes in the Shiggavi constituency of Haveri district which he represents. The Congress has won in 14 wards, BJP in 7 and 2 independent candidates have also won. Similarly, Guttala City Municipal Corporation of Haveri taluk has also gone the Congress way.In the Vijayapura district among the 6 City Municipal corporations, three have been won by the Congress. Vijayapura district is considered the bastion of the BJP. In the Belagavi district also, the BJP has failed to sweep elections and Congress has gained upper hand. —Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-claims-big-win-in-karnataka-urban-local-body-polls-356391

We have asked for increasing vaccination,” he told reporters on the last day of his visit.He said because of the pandemic, the number of polling booths in the state will be increased by 11,000 to maintain proper social distancing. “Earlier, a booth was made for 1,500 voters. But keeping in mind the Covid pandemic, the number of voters in each booth has been reduced to 1,250. Because of this, the number of polling booths has increased by 11,000. So, a total of 1,74,351 polling booths will be set up,” he said.Chandra said besides the Naxal-infested areas, polling time will also be increased by an hour across the state.Polling officials will be vaccinated and those eligible will be given a booster dose, he said. Thermal scanners and masks will be provided at all polling booths and special care will be on maintaining social distancing and proper sanitisation, he said. Chandra said all officers on poll duty will necessarily have to be fully vaccinated and orders have been issued to give the status of frontline workers to the officers related to the elections. Every polling booth will function as per the COVID protocol, he said.For the first time, senior citizens above 80 years of age, people with disabilities and those affected by COVID-19 will be provided with the alternative facility of postal voting sitting at home. If they want to come to the polling centre to cast their vote, they are welcome or else the commission will reach their doorstep, he said.The list of all such voters will be given to political parties and a videography team will go to their homes.During this, care will be taken that the secrecy of voting should not be disturbed, he said. The CEC said some of parties expressed concern over the election rallies being held without following the coronavirus protocol. Apart from this, some parties complained about the “biased” attitude of some in the administration and police, he said. Representatives of political parties have also expressed concern over hate speeches and paid news, he said, stressing that the Commission is committed to make the voting process smooth, simple and temptation free.Chandra said there will be at least 800 women-managed polling stations.A mobile application named “CVIGIL” has been launched to prevent any malpractice in voting, he said. If there is any irregularity or unethical work being done in the elections, the related picture or information or both will have to be uploaded and prompt action will be taken on it, Chandra said.He said officials have been asked to ensure that people who could create disturbances do not enter from neighbouring states or through international borders and round the clock monitoring of all border posts be done with the help of CCTV cameras.He said on January 5, the electoral roll will be published. Voters will be able to file their claims and objections till the last day of filing of nominations. Till now, the number of voters in the state is more than 15 crore.Chandra said so far 52.80 lakh new voters have been included, which is a record in itself.This includes 28.86 lakh women voters, he said. Of the new voters, around 19.89 lakh are in the age group of 18 to 19, which is three times more than last time, the chief election commissioner said. For maintaining transparency, webcasting will be done at not less than 1 lakh polling places.VVPAT machines will be installed at all polling booths along with electronic voting machines and as per directions of the Supreme Court, VVPAT slips of at least five polling stations in each Assembly constituency will be matched with the EVM count.Chandra said to increase polling percentage, places with low percentage have been identified and awareness related activities have also been increased there.There will be 4,030 model polling booths, 10 in each constituency, he added.

31-12-2021||New Delhi||Govt declares Nagaland 'disturbed area' as demand for AFSPA withdrawal continues||The Centre on Thursday declared the entire Nagaland as a "disturbed area" for six more months with effect from December 30 under the AFSPA while terming the state's condition "disturbed and dangerous".The move came days after the Union government constituted a high-level committee to examine the possibility of the withdrawal of the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from Nagaland.The AFSPA has been operational in Nagaland for decades."Whereas the Central government is of the opinion that the area comprising the whole of the state of Nagaland is in such a disturbed and dangerous condition that the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is necessary."Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (No. 28 of 1958) the Central Government hereby declares that whole of the State of Nagaland to be 'disturbed area' for a period of six months with effect from December 30, 2021, for the purpose of the said Act," a home ministry notification said.The notification was issued by the additional secretary in the Home Ministry, Piyush Goyal, who has been named the member secretary in the panel to examine the possibility of the withdrawal of the AFSPA. The committee is headed by secretary-level officer Vivek Joshi.The high-level committee has been set up apparently to soothe the rising tension in Nagaland over the killing of 14 civilians.Protests for the withdrawal of the AFSPA have been going on in several districts of Nagaland ever since an Army unit killed 14 civilians in the state's Mon district earlier this month, mistaking them as insurgents.The AFSPA empowers security forces to conduct operations and arrest anyone without any prior warrant. It also gives immunity to the forces if they shoot someone dead. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-declares-entire-nagaland-as-disturbed-area-under-afspa-for-6-more-months-356288
