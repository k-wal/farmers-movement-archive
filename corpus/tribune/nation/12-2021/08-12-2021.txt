08-12-2021||New Delhi||‘I should not have been on the Bench’: Justice Gogoi on sexual harassment case||More than two-and-a-half years after he was exonerated by an in-house panel of sexual harassment charges leveled by a Supreme Court employee, former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on Wednesday admitted that it was a mistake on his part to be on the Bench in the case."In hindsight, I should not have been a judge on the Bench. It might have been better if I was not part of the bench. We all make mistakes. No harm in accepting it," Justice Gogoi told India Today TV after being asked if it was wrong for him to be a part of the Bench which took up the matter regarding allegations of sexual harassment against him.Speaking at the launch of his autobiography 'Justice for the Judge', Justice Gogoi said it happened because 45 years of his hard work in the Bar and Bench was being spoiled. The book was launched by former CJI SA Bobde, who described Justice Gogoi as “a reluctant man of destiny”.“Why I said justice Gogoi is a reluctant man of destiny?...there is a story in Assam that his father's law minister asked if his son would become chief minister like him, he said no but he added that he had the potential to become the chief justice of India,” Justice Bobde said. Talking about the Ayodhya case, he said, “I didn't bring Ayodhya out of the cold storage. My predecessors left that for me. So, I had only two options to either fight or flight. And as Justice Bobde mentioned, I come from a family of warriors. So, of course...I fight.”Asked why Kashmir related cases were not taken up expeditiously, Justice Gogoi said, “I didn't let the Kashmir cases hibernate. I assigned it to the alternate bench because I had the Ayodhya case to look at. But on my watch, the Kashmir case was not hibernated or shelved. It was assigned to a bench of reputed senior judges…We don't monitor the work of our brother judges in the judiciary.”"What was right was not said. What was said was not right,” he said,  “I am least convinced about the Rajya Sabha seat offered to me as quid pro quo for the Ayodhya judgment. These are all made up by the media and newspapers.”He asserted that there was nil interference by the Executive in the Judiciary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-should-not-have-been-on-the-bench-justice-gogoi-on-sexual-harassment-case-347946

The AAP has already declared its Chief Ministerial candidate and presented itself as an alternative to the ruling BJP and the Congress.A leader of AAP said the party is banking on good governance provided in Delhi to be presented as a model for other States under its stewardship and general acceptability of Arvind Kejriwal as leader and administrator among the people.In such a situation, Banerjee's calisthenics threatens to cast a shadow on AAP's national aspirations, and upset its applecart.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/undercurrents-of-rivalry-between-aap-and-tmc-will-impinge-on-bid-for-opposition-unity-against-bjp-347935

08-12-2021||Coonoor (TN)||Chopper crash: Burning bodies in misty Western Ghats forest numb people with disbelief||A kind of a thud and ‘something’ whirring from nowhere was the first sign that something has gone seriously amiss. Humble tea estate workers, in their serene Western Ghats village in Nilgiris District of Tamil Nadu were quickly overwhelmed with a sense of foreboding.Soon, it was sheer disbelief that gripped them in their modest hillside colony when they saw a frightening bright blaze emerging from the misty woods amid clanking of metal objects. Though it was a little past noon, fog still shrouded the hills on Wednesday.Read also:Although neither workers nor their family members could comprehend what was unfolding, they and some local people were the first to reach the location, where the Air Force helicopter, with Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 other people on board, crashed.However, they could not get very close as the fire raged destroying all that it could in the wooded vicinity. The location of the mishap is a forest area, close to a tea estate and mountain chain and valleys.Eyewitness accounts said hearing ‘something like a boom’ and then ‘clanking of objects,’ while the fire raged for well over half an hour, destroying the copter, killing its occupants and reducing huge trees to ashes.“The helicopter crashed in a forest area, pretty close to a tea estate. The main, motorable route to this area is only through the tea estate. It was the local people and workers who saw what happened immediately after the crash,” a senior state police official in Chennai told PTI quoting preliminary inputs.“The Defence authorities could throw light on the crash,” he added.Eventually, when some people managed to reach close by, they could just not believe what they saw.When they spotted a ‘burning thing’ they initially thought that it could be the branch of a tree, and on inching closer, the stench of the flesh that was still ablaze made them realise what it was a ‘burning and burnt’ body of a man crushed under the heavy branch of a huge tree that fell down in the impact of the crash.When they saw another partially burnt body near bushes, apparently of a young soldier, they got an indication of the gravity of the situation. With only some shreds of his olive green uniform over a part of his upper torso, he was just lying flat on the ground, lifeless.Another army man, who apparently sustained severe burns was lying in a prone position and was obviously dead. People, however, had no clue about the identity of the victims.According to local people, some occupants of the helicopter may have got thrown out in the impact of crash, which they say happened “as the rotor blade of the chopper hit a huge tree due to poor visibility while on the ascend.”People in Nilgiris district are accustomed to man-animal conflict and wild animals entering villages and destroying crops and even killing people.The spectacle of burning bodies, and the stench of flesh and helicopter crash is something they have neither seen nor could easily forget for many years to come.

Immigration authorities have reported more visa frauds with people desperately trying to travel abroad for high paying jobs.The officials at the Hyderabad International Airport have recently apprehended the largest number of people trying to travel overseas on fake visas.On Tuesday, the Immigration authorities announced the detection of forty-four forgeries among women passengers attempting to travel to Kuwait on forged visas.All the women have been detained, and the police have been apprised about the travel agent, who charged vast sums of money to prepare fake visas for unsuspecting job seekers.Most of the detained women belonged to the two Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and had come to the airport ready to fly to Kuwait. Some women are also from Goa and Tamil Nadu.The mastermind behind the fake visa racket has been identified to be a Mumbai-based travel agent who lured unsuspecting women with the help of an Andhra Pradesh-based agent. The two prepared fake visas and other documents with the identity of these women.The agent made two visas, one tourist and another employment – the first was for showing to the immigration authorities in India, while the other was for Kuwaiti authorities and was said to be a job visa.Finding a large number of women travelling to the same destination, the immigration authorities got the documents verified and found them to be fake. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) deployed at the airport detained all these women.The airport police station later let off the women after it learnt that the women had been cheated and they had no clue about the fraud played upon them by the travel agent.The local police have sounded a red alert asking people to be cautious about the fake visa scam. Many people, the police said, were desperate to travel abroad after losing their jobs during Covid times.Sources said that these women came to the airport for onward travel to Kuwait by Jazeera Airways. Many of these women are from the Guntur and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh and some from Goa and Tamil Nadu. Most of these women had lost their jobs during the past year due to Covid.Vijay Kumar, Inspector of police of Shamshabad, said all passengers had two visas, one was a visit visa, and the other was an employment visa. This was done to circumvent the protector of emigrants.The police have registered a case against the travel agent based on the investigation. The police are being sent to different places from where the women arrived to arrest those involved in the visa scam.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-jobs-loss-women-fooled-by-fake-visa-racket-in-hyderabad-347928

It appears to be a case of cyber crime," said Kamal Kishore Rai, the civil surgeon of Gaya.

08-12-2021||New Delhi||Court frames 'attempt to murder' charge against man who pointed gun at cop during Delhi riots||A Delhi court has framed charges of rioting and attempt to murder against Shahrukh Pathan, who had allegedly pointed a gun at a police officer during the 2020 Delhi riots, while rejecting his plea seeking discharge.A photograph of Pathan pointing a gun at Delhi Police Head Constable Deepak Dahiya had surfaced on social media during the communal riots last year. He was arrested on March 3, 2020, and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail.While framing the charges, additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said it was quite apparent that Pathan led a group of rioters, attempted on Dahiya's life, obstructed and used criminal force on a public servant on February 24, 2020.The judge charged Pathan under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting armed with a deadly weapon), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of duty), and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC.Charges were also framed under sections 353 (assault), 307 (attempt to murder) read with section 149 (member of unlawful assembly guilty of a common offence) of the IPC and various sections of the Arms Act, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.Pathan had sought discharge from sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC on grounds that he had no intention to kill the cop and was unaware that section 144 of the CrPC was in force.Section 144 of the CrPC prohibits the assembly of four or more people in a specific area.Denying the relief, ASJ Rawat noted that “intention to kill” the cop was clearly made out from the statement given by Dahiya that Pathan aimed at his head and fired but he managed to escape.The judge said contentions made by Pathan's counsel that he did not attempt to kill the cop but only threatened him by firing in the air cannot be a basis for discharge in the face of the specific statement by Dahiya and the video footage.

They want only power so that they can indulge in scams, load their safes with cash and valuables, carry out illegal encroachments and allow the mafia to have a free run… shower generosity on terrorists and release them from prisons,” the PM said, evoking loud cheer from the crowd.Hitting back, Akhilesh asserted that the people wearing red caps were “red alerts” also for the BJP as they would oust it from power.The PM said sugarcane farmers of UP would find it hard to forget the trouble they were made to undergo by the SP government. “Sugarcane payments used to be made in instalments and there used to be big time gap between each payment,” he said.Among the inaugurated projects, the Gorakhpur Fertiliser Plant was lying shut for 30 years. It has been revived and built at a cost of around Rs 8,600 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/red-caps-a-red-alert-for-up-pm-targets-sp-on-yogis-home-turf-347672

If the competence was lacking there was no valid extension of period and the woman was entitled to statutory bail,” the Bench told Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, while dismissing the NIA’s petition against the High Court order. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elgar-case-sc-rejects-nias-plea-against-default-bail-to-sudha-347678

There has been a clear failure on the part of the judiciary to stem the tide of militant majoritarianism.”He questioned the award of clean chit to the government in the Rafale jet matter and said, “The clean chit was given on the basis of famous sealed covers containing evidence exchanged between the CJI and government alone.”The Congress MP mentioned non-hearing by the court of petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and said, “There is an ipso facto concern of executive influence which has seemingly constrained the judiciary. The court was seen as a constitutional instrument to define the limits of executive control over the erstwhile state of J&K. Can Article 356 be used to suspend an assembly in a state and alter the nature of the state itself? Can a state be downgraded to a UT? These are constitutional questions. By repeatedly delaying the hearing on petitions, the SC failed to fulfill its role as protector of the Constitution while the rights of the people of J&K remained restricted.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-flags-govts-indirect-control-over-judiciary-347679

Charges are accordingly directed to be framed against him for the said offences.”There was sufficient material on record to prima facie show that Kumar was not only a part of the mob, but he was also leading it, the judge said in his December 4 order.The court is likely to formally frame charges against Kumar on December 16 when he will be asked if he would like to plead guilty or claim trial.The judge, however, discharged him of the charges of attempt to murder and destruction of evidence for want of “sufficient or prima facie material”.The case relates to the killing of S Jaswant Singh and his son S Tarun Deep Singh—residents of Raj Nagar in West Delhi on November 1, 1984, allegedly by a mob led by Kumar. An FIR was registered in 1985 on the basis of an affidavit of the complainant, whose identity was not revealed.An SIT set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2015 to reinvestigate the 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases had closed 233 of the 292 cases it examined. The complainant had recorded her statement on November 23, 2016 before the SIT. This is one of the five cases in which the SIT has filed chargesheets.Kumar (75) is already serving a life sentence in another case relating to anti-Sikh riots. He has been in jail since December 31, 2018 when he surrendered – 14 days after being convicted and awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court. The case in which he is in jail relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment’s Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.The Supreme Court had on September 21 refused to grant hi, interim bail, saying his medical condition was stable. “He (Kumar) is accused of heinous crimes...You want him to be treated like some super VIP patient,” a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul had told his counsel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1984-anti-sikh-riots-delhi-court-orders-framing-of-murder-rioting-charges-against-sajjan-kumar-347502

08-12-2021||Kohima/New Delhi||Nagaland `tense but calm'; state Cabinet calls off Hornbill Festival, wants repeal of AFSPA||The situation in the border state of Nagaland, where protests and rioting broke out after firing by security forces claimed 14 civilian lives, remained tense but calm on Tuesday as the state cabinet met to demand the Centre repeal the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).Demand for repeal of the act found echoes in the nation’s Parliament with National People’s Party (NPP) MP Agatha Sangma, a former Minister in the UPA Government, terming the act as “the elephant in the room which (needs to) be addressed” and seeking the “draconian” Act be repealed.The AFSPA was enacted in 1958 to give armed forces far-reaching powers of arrest and detention after an armed insurgency started in Nagaland. Critics have maintained that the controversial law has failed to control insurgency despite giving armed forces powers to act with impunity, sometimes leading to human rights violations.Sangma said the killing of 14 civilians in Nagaland, “reminded all of the Malom massacre” in which over 10 civilians were shot dead in Imphal “and prompted a 28-year-old Irom Sharmila to go on a 16 year-long hunger strike”.The Nagaland cabinet which met in an emergency sitting under the leadership of Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio on Tuesday also called off the ongoing Hornbill Festival in protest against the killing, besides deciding to write to the central government on the repeal of the act, state ministers said.The 10-day Hornbill Festival, the state’s largest tourism extravaganza held at Naga Heritage Village in Kisama near the state capital, was scheduled to end on December 10.During the meeting, the cabinet was briefed about the action taken after firing, including setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by an IGP rank officer and grant of ex-gratia to the next of kin of the deceased by the state and central governments, ministers Neiba Kronu and Temjen Imna Along told reporters.The cabinet has directed the SIT to complete the investigation within a month, they said.Officials said the situation in the state where people had taken to the streets in protest against the firing was “tense but calm”.An initial report submitted to the state government on Sunday claimed the army made no attempt to ascertain the identity of the civilians returning from work on a pick-up truck before shooting them in Nagaland’s Mon district on Saturday.The joint report by the state’s Director General of Police (DGP) T John Longkumer and Commissioner Rovilatuo Mor quoted eyewitnesses, who said the Army’s special forces tried to “hide” the bodies of six people by wrapping and loading them on a pick-up van with the intention of taking them to their base camp.Kronu said that altogether 14 civilians have died, while two seriously injured are undergoing treatment in neighbouring Assam, and six are being treated in Dimapur.The firing incidents took place in Oting-Tiru area on December 4 and Mon town on December 5.The first incident in which six civilians were killed, occurred when army personnel mistook coal mine workers returning home in a pick-up van on Saturday evening, to be insurgents belonging to the Yung Aung faction of the banned outfit NSCN (K).As workers failed to reach their homes, local youth and villagers went in search of them and surrounded the army vehicles. In the ensuing melee, one soldier was killed and army vehicles burnt down. Soldiers who fired in self-defence killed another seven civilians.Rioting spilled over into Sunday afternoon when angry mobs vandalised the offices of the Konyak Union and an Assam Rifles camp in the area, setting fire to parts of the camp, police had said.At least one more person was killed, as security forces fired back at attackers.The Nagaland Police filed a suo moto FIR against the 21st Para Special Force of the Army.The Indian Army has ordered a court of inquiry headed by an officer of major general rank into the Nagaland incident.Expressing regret over the Nagaland firing incident, Shah on Monday said a probe by an SIT will be completed within a month and asserted that all agencies must ensure such happenings do not recur while taking action against insurgents.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nagaland-tense-but-calm-state-cabinet-calls-of-hornbill-festival-called-off-wants-repeal-of-afspa-347482
08-12-2021||New Delhi||Farmers' protest: Samyukt Kisan Morcha puts off decision on the fate of agitation until Wednesday||No decision has been taken yet on calling off the farmers’ protest, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which is spearheading the stir, said on Tuesday and demanded clarification on certain points, in the government’s proposal, including on the precondition set for withdrawal of “fake” cases against farmers.Farmer leaders, who are members of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), after a meeting also said they will meet again at 2 PM on Wednesday to decide the future course of action.Kulwant Singh Sandhu, a prominent farmer leader, has claimed that a consensus has been arrived at and “nearly all demands” have been met.However, the SKM said there was no consensus yet on ending the protest, which was triggered last year after the government enacted three farm laws.“SKM confirms to have received a written draft proposal from the government of India. The proposal was constructively discussed by the farm leaders at the SKM meeting at the Singhu Border today. The morcha will seek further clarifications on a few points of the government’s proposal, and will reconvene at 2 pm tomorrow for further discussion. The SKM hopes for a positive response from the government,” the umbrella body of over 40 farm unions said in a statement following the meeting.Farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said the government’s proposal said that it will form a committee to look into the demand for legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) for crops and the panel will include farmer organisations outside the SKM, government officials and representatives of states.                    “We had objections to it … we do not want other committees who have been against our demands since the start to be part of the panel on MSP. We have demanded the government give a clarification in this regard,” Rajewal said.“We are also against the condition set by the government that farm unions should lift the protest for the withdrawal of fake cases against farmers,” he said, adding the cases include those registered in connection with the January 26 violence.Another farmer leader said they received the government’s proposal on Tuesday afternoon.“We discussed it in the meeting. We had certain objections to some points in the proposal. Our members have given some suggestions and these have been sent to the government,” he said.The SKM had formed a five-member panel on Saturday to hold talks with the government on the pending demands of the protesting farmers, including a legal guarantee on MSP for crops, compensation to the kin of the farmers who died during the agitation against three agriculture laws and the withdrawal of cases against the protesters.The five-member panel of the SKM has farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ashok Dhawle, Shiv Kumar Kakka, Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Yudhvir Singh.“We have sent our proposal to the government and their response will deliberated upon further. Then we want a letter from MHA (ministry of home affairs) on their letter head with the sign of the home minister,” Kakka said.Farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu said protesting farmer unions have reached a consensus on the future course of the agitation as nearly all their demands have been met, but a formal announcement of the decision will be made on Wednesday.“Nearly all demands raised by us have been met.... Letter (from the government with assurances on farmers’ demands) has been received. A consensus has been reached, the final decision will be announced tomorrow,” Sandhu told reporters after the SKM meeting.Another farmer leader and SKM member said the agitation is likely to be called off on Wednesday as there have been some positive responses from the government side on the farmers’ demands.However, a final decision will be announced after another meeting of SKM on Wednesday, he said.On November 29, a bill was passed in Parliament to repeal the three contentious farm laws, one of the main demands of the protesting farmers.But the stalemate continues with the protesters demanding that the government fulfil their other demands too. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-meet-at-singhu-border-get-draft-copy-from-centre-on-six-demands-347469

The dangers of a violent, radicalised majority that has corroded India's neighbour has reached our doorsteps. And yet we remain blind. https://t.co/5vijTDm5eFPolice on Monday registered a case of rioting against unidentified persons after the incident which occurred on the premises of St Joseph School in Ganjbasoda, some 105 km from Bhopal, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The education institution had denied the charge of religious conversion.“The type and nature of Ganjbasoda incident is different. Four persons have been detained and directions were issued that such incidents should be prevented from recurring,” Mishra told reporters.He reiterated that all places (like one at Ganjbasoda), PFI (Popular Front of India) and NGOs which are using foreign funding for religious conversion are under investigation.Hindu organisations had accused the St Joseph Church and school of indulging in religious conversion, a charge denied by the educational institute.Eyewitnesses had said on Monday that stones were hurled at the school building during the ruckus.A school management spokesman had said that after getting the information about the protest through the media, the local administration was intimated in advance about the possible disturbance.But the people started gathering and stones were pelted which damaged the school property, he had claimed while denying all charges of religious conversion.The students were present for the examination in the school when the incident occurred, he said.Madhya Pradesh’s Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) office-bearer Nilesh Agrawal had told PTI on Monday that they had only organised a peaceful protest outside the school and later submitted a memorandum to the local administration. He had denied any role of the protesting outfits in the disturbance at the institute.In a memorandum submitted to the local administration after the protest, the VHP, the Bajrang Dal, the Hindu Jagran Manch and other right-wing organisations accused the school management of converting eight students to Christianity.In the memorandum, these outfits accused the school management and the church associated with it of forcing students to not apply ‘tilak’ (a coloured mark) on the forehead and wear ‘kalawa’ (a sacred thread worn by Hindus on the wrist).It was also alleged students are forced to say prayers of Christianity.In a letter written to the Vidisha district collector on Sunday, the Saint Joseph Church had denied all allegations of religious conversion and claimed rituals which were performed on eight Christian children were like ‘Janeu Sanskar’ in Hinduism (related to wearing a white, sacred thread) on October 30.The church also called for an investigation to find out the truth. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/four-detained-for-creating-ruckus-at-mp-missionary-school-over-religious-conversion-allegations-347466

The Prime Minister accepted his mistake when he apologised for making anti-agriculture law. The Punjab government has given compensation to the families of those who were killed. So, what I want to say is that here are the names of all those who died in the agitation and that they should be given their due since the Prime Minister has also admitted his mistake,” Gandhi said.He told the House that the Congress government in Punjab had paid Rs 5 lakh compensation each to the families of 403 deceased farmers in the state, and provided jobs to 152 of their relatives.In addition to the list of 403 deceased farmers from Punjab, Gandhi said he was also providing names of those from places outside Punjab, including Haryana, compiled from public records.“The Prime Minister himself has said that he has made a mistake. He has apologised to the nation. Well, as a result of that mistake, 700 farmers have died,” he said.Earlier too, Gandhi had slammed the Centre for claiming that there is “no record” of the farmers who had died in the protests.The government in a reply to Parliament had said that it had not kept track of farmers who lost their lives in the agitation against the farm laws and hence the question of compensation did not arise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-submits-in-lok-sabha-list-of-farmers-who-died-during-the-farmers-agitation-347438
08-12-2021||Kohima||Army made no attempt to identify civilians before shooting, tried to 'hide' bodies: Report||The Army made no attempt to ascertain the identity of the civilians returning from work on a pick-up truck before shooting them in Nagaland's Mon district on Saturday, a joint report by the state's Director General of Police (DGP) T John Longkumer and Commissioner Rovilatuo Mor has said.Quoting eyewitnesses, the two top officials have said villagers found the Army's special forces trying to "hide" the bodies of six people by wrapping and loading them on a pick-up van with the intention of taking them to their base camp."On the evening of 4th December around 1610 hours, when eight villagers were returning home from coal mining work at Tiru in a pick-up truck, were ambushed and killed by Security Forces (reportedly, 21st Para Special Force based in Assam) at random, apparently without any attempt for identification," the report, submitted to the state government on Sunday, said.The officials said the victims were all unarmed civilians working in coal mines. Of them, six were killed on the spot and two critically injured.On hearing the gunshots, the villagers went to the spot. "On reaching the spot, they found the pick-up truck and the special forces personnel trying to hide the dead bodies of the six villagers by wrapping and loading them in another pick-up truck apparently with the intention of taking the dead bodies to their base camp,” the officials have said in the report.Violence broke out between the villagers and security forces when they discovered the bodies covered with tarpaulin sheets. Angry people then set on fire three vehicles of the security forces, the report said.“In the melee, the security personnel again opened fire against the villagers which led to the death of seven more villagers and eyewitnesses have confirmed that the special forces personnel opened fire indiscriminately as they fled from the scene towards Assam side even firing in the coal mine hutments on the way,” they said.Acknowledging that the first incident was a "case of mistaken identity", Union Home Minister Amit Shah had told Parliament on Monday, "The Government of India sincerely regrets this unfortunate incident in Nagaland and offers its deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives."The report said altogether, 13 civilians were killed on Saturday while 14 were seriously injured and eight suffered minor injuries.Two of the seriously injured persons were taken to Assam by the security forces themselves and are admitted in the ICU at Dibrugarh Medical College Hospital, it said.About the Sunday incident in Mon Town, the DGP and Commissioner's report stated that the Konyak Union had announced a mass funeral service for the 13 deceased civilians at the helipad, after their mortal remains were brought from Oting village, where they were killed.However, the event was postponed to Monday at 10 am but no clear announcement was made about the deferment, the report said.The confusion led to the crowd getting agitated, and a section of the public started marching towards the district hospital and Konyak Union office. All the deceased belonged to the Konyak tribe.The angry crowd vandalised the Konyak Union office, before proceeding towards the 27 Assam Rifles post located at Thamnan Ward.The violent crowd threw stones, vandalised property and set fire to three buildings within the post.
