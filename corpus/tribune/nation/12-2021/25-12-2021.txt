25-12-2021||Amaravati||Judiciary faces perennial problems, if unsolved will haunt my successors too: CJI Ramana||Stressing the need for stepping up judicial Infrastructure in the country, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Saturday said the Judiciary is also facing certain fundamental problems and they continue to haunt his successors also if not solved.Speaking at a Civic Reception in Vijayawada, he further said there are 4.60 crore pending cases in courts and the number is not big for a country like India which has a population of about 150 crore.Maintaining that courts would interfere when there is violation of rights, Justice Ramana said the Executive is also responsible for providing justice and that if it functions within the parameters of law, there is no necessity for anyone to come to courts.“Like all systems, the Judiciary is also facing certain fundamental problems. My predecessors, Chief Justices, also mentioned them. I am also raising those issues. This will be a perennial problem to my successors too, because slowly we are forgetting the importance of Judiciary and legal education,” he said.He said there is a need to develop judicial infrastructure and it would result in more respect towards courts.Justice Ramana was given LifeTime Achievement award by Rotary Club in a felicitation programme.“You all know how important the Rule of Law is. If there is no rule of law in any country, anarchy prevails. It poses a threat to the existence of democracy. There is a necessity to enlighten the public on rule of law,” he said.Indianisation of the country’s legal system is the need of the hour and it is crucial to make the justice delivery system more accessible and effective, the CJI said adding simplification of legal procedures is necessary for the common people to understand court proceedings.He said though the nation got independence about 75 years ago, the country is still facing problems such as illiteracy, health issues, poverty, unemployment and superstitions which need to be alleviated.Stating that people should be enlightened about their constitutional rights and responsibilities, Justice Ramana said organistions such as Rotary Club should take up awareness programmes for the public.The Chief Justice is on a three-day tour of Andhra Pradesh.Earlier in the evening, the State government hosted a High Tea for the CJI. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, along with his wife Bharathi, welcomed the CJI and participated in the programme.Supreme Court Judge Justice JK Maheshwari, and Chief Justices and several judges of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana High Courts also participated.

If thinking is big it will give a new dimension to your personality. Youths should never allow hopelessness to enter their lives, if they work with this passion, they will be able to do anything,” Aditynath said.“This is not only a smartphone and tablet. With this, you will get free digital access and content. Now on, this type of programme will be held in every division, and the digital revolution will reach even the villages. Online education will be linked with online and competitive exams,” he said.Giving tablets and smartphones to students was part of BJP’s 2017 assembly election manifesto.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had earlier alleged that since Adityanath didn’t know how to use a laptop, he was not fulfilling the manifesto promise.Addressing a gathering in Azamgarh a few days ago, he said if the SP is voted to power it will give laptops to all the students of the state.The CM invoked Chhatrapati Shivaji, Maharana Pratap, Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi as people who sent a strong message to the world while they were still young.Union Minister for Education, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Dharmendra Pradhan was also present on the occasion.Without taking names, Yogi accused Akhilesh of misleading people during the pandemic and encouraging nepotism under his rule.“Those who wake up at 12 o’clock are not youths, those who opposed the vaccine during the corona pandemic and misled people are not youths, they are all tired and retired, don’t trust them,” he said.Akhilesh headed the SP government in UP from 2012 to 2017 and was succeeded by Yogi Adityanath.“Before 2017 there was nepotism in appointments, if a job was announced, people of one family, of one lineage, uncle, nephew, maternal uncle all used to go out for extortion,” he said.Adityanath claimed to have created 4.5 lakh jobs in the state in the five years of his rule and cracking down on “mafia” to the shock of their “patrons”.He also made students raise a slogan “Soch Imandar, Kaam Dumdaar”, coined by the BJP for 2022 elections.Paying his tributes to Vajpayee and founder of Banaras Hindu University Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, who share birthday, Yogi said students of UP have attained a new identity in the country and the world.The CM honoured weightlifter Mira Bai Chanu, who won a silver medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, with a reward of Rs 1.5 crore and her coach Vijay Kumar Sharma with Rs 10 lakh.Addressing the gathering earlier, Pradhan said the students of the country realised the importance of smart phones and digital education during the corona pandemic.Citing a report, he said due to poverty and lack of internet connectivity, only 50 per cent youths of the country were able to connect with digital education during the pandemic.He said in the coming few months, all UP villages will be connected with the internet.

25-12-2021||New Delhi||AAP calls Uttarkhand Chief Minister ‘incompetent' over alleged sacking of Dalit woman cook||The Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday slammed the BJP government in Uttarakhand over the alleged sacking of a Dalit woman cook at a school in the state and offered to give her a job in the Delhi government.Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here, senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and Social Welfare minister in Delhi government Rajendra Pal Gautam also hit out at Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on the issue, alleging that he is “incompetent” to render justice to the people of the state.He demanded that Dhami should apologise to the people of the state for the “removal” of the Dalit woman from her job.“I invite her to come here. The Delhi government will give her a job as a cook,” Gautam told reporters.A Dalit woman who served a mid-day meal at a government secondary school in Uttarakhand's Champawat district was allegedly removed from her job recently after upper-caste students refused to eat the meal cooked by her.Following a row, the Uttarakhand chief minister on Friday ordered a probe into the incident and asked the authorities to take stern action against the guilty after visiting the school in Sukhidhang.“Chief Minister Dhami is not competent. He cannot render justice to people. Their entire politics is to divide people on the basis of religion and caste,” Gautam charged.He claimed that the Dalit woman was appointed as 'Bhojanmata' at the government school through a due process of selection but removed by chief education officer of Champawat R C Purohit because some of the upper caste students had refused to eat the food cooked by her.“For this, Dhami Ji should apologise. He should have taken immediate cognisance of it and rendered justice to the victim,” Gautam said.The removal of the Dalit woman from her job is an act of “encouraging those who discriminate people on the lines of caste,” he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aap-calls-uttarkhand-chief-minister-incompetent-over-alleged-sacking-of-dalit-woman-cook-354394
25-12-2021||New Delhi||Government committed to bringing back Sikh artefacts: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said, of late, the Central Government has been successful in bringing the ‘saroop’ of the Guru Granth Sahib from Afghanistan to India.“What can be a greater experience of Guru’s grace than this,” the Prime Minister said while virtually addressing Gurpurab celebrations of Guru Nanak at Gurdwara Lakhpat Sahib in Gujarat's Kutch district.During his US visit in September, the Prime Minister recalled that America returned more than 150 historical objects to India. These included a ‘pesh kabz’ or a small sword, on which the name of Guru Hargobind is written in Persian. “It is the great fortune of this government to be able to do all this'," he observed.The Prime Minister also underlined that the Centre regularly celebrates auspicious occasions in Sikh history and mentioned the hosting of 350th Prakash Purab of Guru Gobind Singh and 550th Prakash Purab of Guru Nanak Dev. Currently the 400th Prakash Utsav of Guru Teg Bahadur is celebrated. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, which was awaited for decades, was completed in 2019 by the government.The Prime Minister also recalled the contribution of the Gurus in times of subjugation and attacks by the invaders. Guru Nanak Dev, he said, was clear in his understanding of the danger that Babar’s invasion posed for India, Guru Tegh Bahadur’s sacrifice against Aurangzeb taught the country to fight against terror and religious fanaticism, and Guru Gobind Singh Sahib was a living example of tenacity and sacrifice. In recent times, Sikhs fought tenaciously for the country’s independence even under British rule.“It is our responsibility to ensure that in such an important period, nobody hurts our dreams and the unity of the country. To achieve the dreams for which our gurus lived and sacrificed their lives, we should all remain united. Unity is essential for us all.  The dangers against which the gurus alerted us remain the same even today, so we have to be alert and also ensure that the country remains secure,” he said.Every year from December 23 to 25, the Sikh Sangat of Gujarat celebrates the Gurpurab of Guru Nanak Dev at Gurudwara Lakhpat Sahib. Guru Nanak stayed at Lakhpat during the course of his travels and the Gurudwara there has his relics including wooden footwear and palkhi (cradle) as well as some manuscripts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-committed-to-bringing-back-sikh-artefacts-pm-354391
25-12-2021||New Delhi||Centre hatching ‘conspiracy’ to bring back farm laws after assembly polls: Congress||The Congress on Saturday alleged that the Centre was hatching a “conspiracy” to bring back the three farm laws after the next round of assembly polls and urged the people to teach the government a lesson by defeating it in the elections.The Congress’s sharp attack came over Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s remarks at an event on Friday in which, while talking about the agriculture laws, he said the government moved a “step back” and “will move forward again”.Congress’s former chief Rahul Gandhi said the country’s agriculture minister has “insulted” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “apology”—“it is condemnable”.“If anti-farmer steps are taken again, then satyagraha of ‘annadatas’ will take place again,” he said.“Had defeated arrogance, will again defeat it,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag ‘FarmersProtest’.Speaking at the event in Nagpur, Tomar said, “We brought agriculture amendment laws. But some people did not like these laws which were a big reform brought about 70 years after Independence under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership.”.“But the government is not disappointed, we moved a step back and we will move forward again because farmers are India’s backbone,” he added.Referring to the remarks, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the “concerted conspiracy” to bring back the three “anti-farmer” agri laws now stands exposed again by the statement made Tomar.“Perceiving defeat in the five state elections including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had apologised and repealed the three black laws in Parliament. This happened after the longest, peaceful, Gandhian agitation for over 380 days on the borders of Delhi where over 700 farmers sacrificed their lives,” Surjewala said.“Even then we had suspected the intent of the prime minister, the BJP, the RSS and the Modi government,” he said.Immediately after the repeal of the laws, many BJP leaders had made intemperate statements pointing to the “conspiracy” to bring back the three farm laws, he said.On November 21, Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra said the three repealed farm laws will be brought back and also BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj made a statement to that effect, Surjewala said.Many people dismissed these statements as aberrations but on Friday in Maharashtra, Tomar has “fortified the conspiracy being hatched” by the Modi government to bring back the three “anti farmer” farm laws after the completion of the elections in five states, he said.“We call upon India’s farmers, we call upon fellow Indians, that the only way to stop the diabolical conspiracy of the Modi government from bringing back the farm laws is to decisively defeat the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and other elections so that a lesson is taught to the crony capitalist-driven BJP government at the Centre that they cannot annihilate the rights of 62 crore farmers of the country,” Surjewala said.The Farm Laws Repeal Act repealed the three farm laws which were passed by Parliament in September last year with an objective to bring reforms in the agriculture sector, especially marketing of farm produce.These three farm laws were—Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-hatching-conspiracy-to-bring-back-farm-laws-after-assembly-polls-congress-354389

25-12-2021||Vijay Mohan||Sharing information collected from public domain, if meant for official use, is breach of secrecy, rules AFT||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 25The Armed Forces Tribunal has held that documents and associated material collected from the public domain for official use is privileged information and sharing the same with an unauthorised person is breach of security.The documents were collected by a senior naval officer for the purpose of making an official presentation on the subject, ‘Pakistan Security Scenario 2020’, and this was prepared with information from the internet.“Once the documents were collected for preparing an official presentation, parting with such a document and giving it to a civilian was clearly an act in breach of security and unbecoming of an officer in uniform, the Tribunal’s bench comprising  Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz observed.Upholding the naval authorities’ stand on the issue in its order, the bench was of the considered view that if the authorities found this act of the officer to be a breach of security or against the interest of the administration, no interference can be made into the matter by the Tribunal.A naval officer of the rank of captain had been accused by a woman, who was known to him since their school days, of molesting her and leaking secret naval information to her. Based on the complaint, a one-man inquiry was convened by the Naval Headquarters.After the Navy chose to proceed against the officer administratively instead of trying him by a court martial, he was served a showcause notice and his services were terminated with 50 per cent forfeiture of pension.He then challenged the proceedings before the Tribunal, averring certain irregularities and illegalities in the inquiry proceedings and the contents of the showcause notice. He had also contended that sharing information which was already in the public domain did not constitute breach of secrecy.The Tribunal, while upholding the convening and findings of the one-man inquiry and the subsequent termination of services, however, held that the act of withholding 50 per cent pension was unsustainable in law as the same did not find any mention in the showcause notice and hence the officer could not challenge it in his reply to the showcause notice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sharing-information-collected-from-public-domain-if-meant-for-official-use-is-breach-of-secrecy-rules-aft-354336
