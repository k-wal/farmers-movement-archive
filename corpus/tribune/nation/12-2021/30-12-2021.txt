For the time being, the government has decided not to issue a Level 2 alert. Alerts will be issued according to GRAP in Delhi.”             It also said 54 per cent of the new cases in the capital have tested positive for the Omicron variant.Earlier in the day, Jain had said, “The latest genome sequencing report showed 46 per cent of the cases have Omicron. These people include those who do not have any travel history. It means Omicron is now inside Delhi.”                An official said the data was updated in the evening.“Indeed, the variant is gradually spreading in the community and its proportion will increase in the coming days,” Jain said when asked if Omicron will be the dominant variant in an imminent third wave of the pandemic.He also said of the 200 coronavirus cases in Delhi hospitals, only 102 belong to the city. Also, 115 patients are those who were directly taken to hospitals from the airport.Of the hospitalised Covid patients in Delhi, 115 do not have any symptoms and have been kept in hospitals as a precautionary measure. None of the hospitalised patients is on oxygen support, Jain said.The statement from the minister’s office said the Delhi government has decided to open four step-down Covid care centres at Teerapath Bhawan, Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre, Commonwealth Games Village and IBIS Hotel.A step-down Covid Care Centre is used when a hospitalised patient’s health improves and he or she does not require medical attention at a hospital.The patient is then sent to the step-down Covid Care Centre where he or she is looked after by healthcare workers. Each Covid Care Centre can cater to 100 to 500 patients.The Delhi government has also issued instructions to all its hospitals to keep a buffer stock of medicines for three months, Jain said.The Delhi health minister had on Wednesday said many international travellers who tested Covid-negative at the airport were found to be positive for the disease after a few days. During this period, they were infecting their family members.“Delhi has imposed stringent curbs on gatherings including weddings and funerals, schools, gyms and spas have been closed, shops and malls will open on alternate days and metro trains and buses will operate at 50 per cent capacity... It is better to be precautious,” Jain said, adding “a decision on more restrictions will be taken at a DDMA meeting”.He said countries like the US and France have recorded their highest number of daily cases amid the spread of Omicron but the good news is that it does not cause severe infection and very few patients need hospitalisation.The DDMA had on Wednesday decided that Covid-related restrictions imposed in Delhi under the ‘yellow alert’ would continue for the time being and authorities would monitor the situation for a while before deciding on fresh curbs.On Tuesday, it had declared a ‘yellow alert’ under the GRAP in the city amid a spike in coronavirus cases following the emergence of the Omicron variant.The ‘yellow alert’ entails restrictions like night curfew, closure of schools and colleges, opening of shops selling non-essential items on an odd-even basis and halved seating capacity in Metro trains and buses, among other things.The GRAP is based on positivity rate (on two consecutive days), cumulative number of new cases (over a week) and average oxygenated-bed occupancy (for a week) for designated four levels of alerts.After the ‘yellow alert’, further restrictions are imposed at advanced stages of ‘amber’, ‘orange’ and ‘red’ with a higher number of new cases and hospitalisations.According to official figures, out of the 8,965 dedicated Covid beds, 262 or 2.92 per cent were occupied and 97 per cent were vacant on December 28.

30-12-2021||---||Pre-Budget consultations: States seek rationalisation of personal income slabs||New Delhi, December 30Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday chaired pre-Budget consultations with state finance ministers. The meeting was also attended by some Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers besides senior officers from states and the Centre.Union Finance Secretary T. V. Somanathan welcomed the participants and informed them of the importance of this particular consultation meeting, said an official news release.Most of the participants thanked the Union Finance Minister for financially supporting their States/UTs during the worst months of pandemic, by enhancing borrowing limits, providing back to back loans to States and through Special assistance for capital expenditure.The participants also gave numerous suggestions to the Union Finance Minister for inclusion in the Budget Speech. Among the suggestions were increased R & D spending, infrastructure status for digital services, rationalisation of income tax slabs, investments in online safety measures and incentives to hydrogen storage and fuel cell development.On personal income tax, some state finance ministers felt that the personal income tax slabs saw too sharp a jump from 5 per cent to the 20 per cent and 30 per cent slabs. The multiple surcharges on some of the slabs jack up the personal income tax rate to over 40 per cent. Pointing out that the Centre has already sharply reduced corporate tax rates in order to increase compliance and attract more industry, they felt such an approach could be applied to income tax slabs as well.State finance ministers also sought infrastructure status for digital services in keeping with the vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. Some of the digital services that are in need for this status are Internet backbone, broadband, mobile telecom, cloud services and software, operational security, user identity and data encryption.Sitharaman thanked the participants for their inputs and suggestions towards Union Budget 2022-23 and assured to examine each of the proposals, said the release.The Finance Minister had earlier met stakeholders from seven broad sectors over eight interactions. Some of the areas represented at these meetings with Sitharaman were agriculture, industry, infrastructure and climate change, financial sector and capital markets, services and trade, social sector, trade union and labour organisation, and economists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pre-budget-consultations-states-seek-rationalisation-of-personal-income-slabs-356386

30-12-2021||New Delhi||States demand extension of GST compensation for another 5 years||Many states have demanded that the GST compensation cess regime be extended for another five years and the share of the Union government in the centrally-sponsored schemes be raised as the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted their revenues.The GST compensation to states for revenue shortfall resulting from subsuming of local taxes such as VAT in the uniform national tax Goods and Services Tax (GST) will end in June next year.There has been a loss of revenue to the states due to the GST tax system, the Centre has not made arrangements to compensate the loss of revenue of about Rs 5,000 crore to the state in the coming year, so the GST compensation grant should be continued for the next five years after June 2022, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said.“Many states have asked for this. We have also asked to extend GST compensation. If it is not extended, the finances of many states will be in a bad shape,” Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said after pre-Budget consultation of finance ministers of states with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman here.Pointing out that Chhattisgarh has received less share of central taxes by Rs 13,089 crore in the Union Budget of the last three years, Baghel demanded the share of central taxes should be given to the state completely in the coming year.He also demanded that Rs 4,140 crore deposited with the Centre at the rate of Rs 294 per tonne on coal mining from coal block companies should be transferred to Chhattisgarh soon.Rajasthan Education Minister Subhash Garg said extension of compensation cess window till 2026-27 is a valid demand of states and the Centre should consider it.He also demanded reduction in import duty on gold and silver from 10 per cent to 4 per cent.“Our most significant demand is that the Centre’s share in centrally-sponsored scheme has gradually reduced and states share has increased. Earlier share would be 90-10 and now it is 50-50 or 60-40, our request is that it should go back to 90-10,” Garg said.Rajasthan also requested that all irrigation and water work projects should be brought under the Centre’s ambit and declared central schemes.West Bengal also pitched for extension of GST compensation for another five years citing two years of difficult time due to Covid-19.Covid crisis was not anticipated when this was fixed, said West Bengal Urban Development & Municipal Affairs Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya.             She also said that states have also asked for raising the Union government’s share in the Centre-sponsored schemes.With regard to state borrowing, she said that additional borrowing window should be without any restriction.Tamil Nadu Finance Minister P Thiaga Rajan said he has demanded extension of GST compensation cess regime for at least two years because of Covid-19.He also made a case for raising share of Government of India in the centrally-sponsored schemes. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-demand-extension-of-gst-compensation-for-another-5-years-356380

I follow the Prime Minister and therefore, I do not wear a mask, and even people do not wear masks.” At the same time, the Shiv Sena’s spokesperson also said everyone should take care while attending public programmes.“Prohibitory orders are on at present, but I wish there should be no such curbs during the day as it will stop the economic growth.

30-12-2021||New Delhi||Maharashtra, WB, Delhi see upsurge in Covid cases; weekly positivity rate over 10% in 8 districts, 5-10% in 14||The government on Thursday said that Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat are emerging as states and UTs of concern on the basis of weekly COVID-19 cases and positivity rate.It said that eight districts are reporting over 10 per cent weekly positivity, while 14 districts are reporting between 5-10 per cent positivity.India’s R naught value, which indicates spread of COVID-19, is 1.22 so cases are increasing, not shrinking, the government said.The country has reported more than 10,000 daily new COVID-19 cases after 33 days, it said stressing that there is a need for heightened vigil in view of sharp increase in infections.Evidence shows that Omicron variant has a growth advantage over Delta with doubling time of 2-3 days, the government said quoting the WHO.It said the durability of immunity post COVID-19 infection persists for about 9 months.The government said 90 per cent of India’s adult population has been administered the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and 63.5 per cent people are now fully vaccinated.The precautionary dose of the vaccine is primarily to mitigate severity of infection, hospitalisation and death, it said.The government said that masking before and after vaccination is a must. It said that earlier and currently circulating strains of coronavirus spread through the same routes and added that treatment guidelines for the infection remain the same.It said that the whole virus infects an individual in natural settings and added that it elicits cell mediated immunity and immunological memory.The government said that within one month 3,30,379 cases of Omicron variant and 59 deaths were reported across 121 countries.

30-12-2021||Mumbai||R-value exceeds 2 in Delhi, Mumbai; indicates faster spread of coronavirus||As coronavirus cases spiral, the ‘R-value’, which indicates how rapidly the virus is spreading, has crossed two in Delhi and Mumbai, researchers said on Thursday.Chennai, Pune, Bengaluru and Kolkata have R-value (or reproduction number) of over 1, as per the data study by the researchers of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.Sitabhra Sinha, who led the study, said the R-value of Delhi stood at 2.54 between December 23-29, while for Mumbai it was 2.01 between December 23-28.Both these cities have seen an exponential rise in cases.Pune and Bengaluru recorded R-value of 1.11. The R-value of Kolkata and Chennai was 1.13 and 1.26, respectively.“Since mid-October, the R-value of all these cities was over 1. What is new was the sudden rise. The fact that Delhi and Mumbai crossed the R-value 2 is quite surprising,” Sinha told PTI.Delhi on Wednesday reported a massive jump in daily Covid-19 infections with 923 fresh cases, the highest since May 30 and 86 per cent up from a day earlier.The positivity rate in Delhi crossed 1 per cent after six months to reach 1.29 per cent. On December 20, 91 new Covid-19 cases had been recorded in the national capital, but the figure climbed to 923 on Wednesday.The Covid-19 positivity rate in Delhi thus jumped to 1.29 per cent from 0.19 per cent between December 23 and December 29.Similarly, Mumbai on Wednesday reported 2,510 Covid-19 cases, the highest daily addition since May 8, 2021, besides one death.On December 20, only 283 cases had been reported in Mumbai, whereas on Tuesday the financial capital of the country recorded 1,377 cases, and on Wednesday the figure went up by 80 per cent.The Reproduction number or R refers to how many people an infected person infects on average.In other words, it tells how ‘efficiently’ a virus is spreading.An R value of less than 1 denotes that the disease is on decline. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, it means the number of infected people is increasing in each round—technically it becomes the ‘epidemic phase’.  —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/r-value-exceeds-2-in-delhi-mumbai-indicates-faster-spread-of-coronavirus-356367
30-12-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan, India inch closer towards deal on Afghan wheat transit: Report||India has provided a list of Afghan contractors and truck drivers to the Pakistan government who would transport the Indian consignment of 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan as humanitarian assistance, as the two neighbours inch closer towards finalising the agreement, a media report said on Thursday. Both countries have agreed to the modalities, and the shipment of wheat would commence once Pakistan approves the list of Afghan contractors and drivers, the Express Tribune newspaper said. In October, India announced 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat for Afghanistan as humanitarian assistance and requested Pakistan to ship the food grains via the Wagah border. Currently, Pakistan only allows Afghanistan to export goods to India, but doesn’t allow any other two-way trade through the border crossing. However, the Imran Khan government made an exception to this rule during the first Apex Committee meeting of the newly established Afghanistan Inter-ministerial Coordination Cell here last month, when he announced that Pakistan would allow India to send wheat to the war-torn country through its territory. Pakistan, however, said this decision was taken keeping in view the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and must not serve as a precedent for future transhipment. Pakistan had initially suggested for the transportation of wheat to be done under the banner of the United Nations.But the Indian government made a counter proposal, suggesting the shipment be done either in Afghan or Indian trucks, the report said. Once Islamabad gave nod to this proposal, sources said that Pakistani authorities have begun the process of vetting the list of Afghan contractors and drivers sent by India, the report added.The two countries have agreed to join hands at a time when Afghanistan is in desperate need for international aid ever since the Taliban regime took over in August this year. According to the UN estimates, nearly 23 million Afghans are facing acute food shortage, with as many as 3.2 million children at the risk of malnutrition. The UNDP has warned that 97 per cent of Afghans would slip below the poverty line by June next year if steps are not taken. Earlier this month, Pakistan hosted the extraordinary conference of the member nations of the Organisation of Islamic countries (OIC), in which it was agreed that a humanitarian trust fund would be set up for relief measures in Afghanistan.

30-12-2021||Haldwani/Dehradun||PM inaugurates, lays foundation stones of projects worth over Rs 17,500 crore in Haldwani||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday accused successive Congress governments at the Centre and in Uttarakhand of dragging their feet for decades over development projects, forcing people to migrate from their villages in the state.Addressing a rally in Haldwani, Modi accused the previous Uttarakhand governments of “looting” the state and doing nothing for its development.He said this inaugurating and laying foundation stones of projects worth over Rs 17,500 crore, including the Rs 5,747 crore Lakhwar hydropower project.Modi said the Lakhwar project was thought of in 1974 and took nearly 46 years to see the light of day. “Wasn’t it sinful on part of those who were in power before us to delay a project like Lakhwar meant to give you electricity, drinking water and irrigate your lands. Would you forget their sin? Will you get carried away by their tall promises,” he asked a cheering crowd at the MB Inter College ground in Haldwani.“Generations of people in Uttarakhand villages were forced to leave their homes in the absence of roads and other facilities and migrate somewhere else,” he said.“While I correct their mistakes, you teach them a lesson,” the prime minister said.He said there are two approaches—one to keep the hills deprived of development and the other to work day and night for their development.“They have only looted Uttarakhand with both hands,” Modi said without naming anyone.He accused the previous regime in Uttarakhand of being interested only in “looting” the state and said it did nothing for its development.In a veiled attack on Congress leader Harish Rawat, Modi said one of those in power earlier said, “You may even loot the state but save my government. Those who love Uttarakhand cannot even think of something like that.”               His reference was to a purported video in which Harish Rawat was allegedly heard negotiating a money deal to buy back the support of rebel MLAs in the state in 2016.Modi said the implementation of the projects whose foundation stone was laid today are his commitments.“I am working with my heart and soul for the development of Uttarakhand,” he said.“I have faith in the strength of the people of Uttarakhand and I am confident that their strength will make this decade that of the hill state. I am putting emphasis on development projects like these with that objective in mind,” Modi said           “These foundations are not just stones, they are our commitment, which the double engine government will fulfil,” he said.Modi, who inaugurated and laid the foundation stones of projects worth over Rs 17,500 crore before addressing the Vijay Sankalp rally in Haldwani, also announced that he is bringing infrastructure projects worth Rs 2,000 crore to Haldwani as a New Year gift.These projects are related to construction of roads, installation of water and streetlights, Modi said.He also charged the opposition with manufacturing rumours, spreading them and then shouting over them treating them as facts.“I have been told that people are being misled about the Tanakpur-Bageshwar rail line project. I want to tell you that the work on final location survey of the project has begun. Takanpur-Bageshwar rail line will be built the way Rishikesh-Karnaprayag rail line is being built,” he said.Attacking previous governments, he said women are the worst victims of the politics of denial.He said schemes like Shauchalaya Yojana,  Ujjawala, Jal Jivan Mission or Har Ghar Jal or Har Ghar Nal se Jal were launched by his government over the last seven years as an honest attempt to address problems faced by women in the country for decades.Modi inaugurated six projects worth Rs 3,420 crore and laid the foundation stones of 17 others worth Rs 14,127 crore.The inaugurated projects include three different stretches of the Char Dham all-weather road, which have been widened, Nagina-Kashipur National Highway, Suring Gad hydel project and sewage works under the Namami Gange programme at Nainital.An AIIMS satellite centre for Kumaon worth Rs 500 crore, Moradabad-Kashipur four-lane road, improved road connectivity with Nepal and an Aroma Park in Kashipur are among the key projects whose foundation was laid by the prime minister.The Lakhwar multi-purpose project will produce 300 MW of electricity.The 330 million cubic metres water in its reservoir will supply irrigation and drinking water to six states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi.This is Modi’s second visit to the state this month.On his last visit to Uttarakhand on December 4, Modi had unveiled projects worth over Rs 18,000 crore in Dehradun.

The temple was established in 1920.A number of Hindu pilgrims from India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States would arrive in Peshawar on January 1 to visit the samadhi at Teri at the invitation of the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC), the Dawn newspaper reported.“This is the second time that the Council has invited Hindu pilgrims from other countries so that they can see for themselves the existence of a tolerant and pluralistic society in Pakistan,” Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, the PHC's patron, told the newspaper.The Council had arranged the programme in collaboration with Pakistan International Airlines, the report said.Fifty-four Hindus from India, Canada, Singapore, Australia and Spain had visited the country last month.The group was led by Shri Satguru Ji Maharaaj Ji, the fifth successor of Paramhans Ji Maharaaj.In December last year, over 1,000 people led by some local clerics belonging to the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl  (JUI-F) instigated the villagers to demolish the temple and as a result, people led by local seminary students attacked the temple.On the orders of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, the temple was restored. The apex court also ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government in October 2021 to recover Rs 33 million (USD 1,94,161) from the culprits involved in vandalising the century-old shrine.In 1997, the shrine was first attacked and severely damaged, and PHC head Vankwani had approached the apex court in 2015 seeking help to restore the holy place and restart the annual pilgrimage to the place.Pakistan Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmad had celebrated Diwali at the temple last month to express solidarity with members of the Hindu community and to welcome pilgrims from other parts of the country.According to Vankwani, the PHC invited the chief justice only to give a message to “hate-mongers that the state is determined to foil their nefarious designs”.

On Wednesday it was 8.4 degrees Celsius.The automatic weather stations at Delhi's Ayanagar and Narela on Thursday recorded a minimum temperature of 3.8 degrees Celsius and 3.2 degrees Celsius, respectively.Delhi had experienced cold wave conditions on December 20 and 21 when the minimum temperature settled at 3.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest this season so far, and 4 degrees Celsius.Thereafter, two back-to-back western disturbances and the resultant slowing down of cold northwesterly winds and cloudy conditions gradually pushed the minimum temperature up to 9.8 degrees Celsius.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.The IMD has predicted cold wave to severe cold wave conditions in northwest India till January 3.The weather department predicted the minimum temperature will start increasing from January 4 under the influence of an active western disturbance which is likely to cause fairly widespread rain and snow over Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh between January 4 and 7.It will also lead to "light to moderate scattered to fairly widespread" rain over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh Delhi, north Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh between January 5 and January 7.

Earlier, it was five per cent for sale value up to Rs 1,000 per piece for apparels and per pair for footwear.Adviser to the West Bengal CM Amit Mitra had earlier said the raising of GST on manmade textiles would lead to the closure of one lakh units and 1.5 crore jobs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-council-meet-tomorrow-to-discuss-rate-rationalisation-356087

30-12-2021||Vibha Sharma||PM Modi in Uttarakhand today, to lay stone for Rs 17,500-crore projects||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 29Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Thursday lay the foundation stone of multiple projects in Uttarakhand. His visit assumes significance as all eyes will be on whether he will officially announce Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami as the BJP’s CM candidate for the upcoming Assembly elections in the state.Notably, not just the BJP, the Congress too appears to be playing safe on this rather piquant and sensitive issue of naming a candidate for the top post. Though the PM has publicly appreciated him, the Central leadership has not officially named Dhami as the face for 2022 elections so far.State leaders have said Dhami, who has the formidable challenge to break the BJP-Congress cycle and also keep the party together in what is expected to be a close fight, will be the CM when the BJP returns to power in 2022.Interestingly, the Aam Aadmi Party has announced Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd) as its chief ministerial face in the hill state.“The AAP has nothing to lose,” they say, adding that despite calm in the BJP on the surface, several leaders like Harak Singh Rawat are getting “restive”. Harak Singh, they claim, is on the “verge of jumping the ship”, despite his meeting with Dhami on Saturday in the presence of other state leaders.In fact, Congress sources claim that Harak Singh is “in regular touch with their party”. While Harak Singh appears to be bargaining for a better deal with the BJP, a deeply divided Congress is also walking a tightrope.Meanwhile, the PM will inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of 23 projects worth over Rs 17,500 crore, which include an array of sectors/areas like irrigation, road, housing, health infrastructure, industry, sanitation and drinking water supply, according to officials.Rs 361 cr released for Jal Jeevan missionNew Delhi: Eyeing Assembly elections in BJP-ruled Uttarakhand, the Centre has released Rs361-crore grant to the state for speedy implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) for 2021-22.
