27-12-2021||New Delhi||CDSCO panel recommends emergency use authorisation for SII’s Covid vaccine Covovax||An expert panel of the country’s central drug authority has recommended granting emergency use authorisation to Serum Institute of India’s Covid-19 vaccine ‘Covovax’ with certain conditions, official sources said on Monday.Prakash Kumar Singh, director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Serum Institute of India (SII) had submitted an application to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in October for grant of market authorisation for Covovax for restricted use in emergency situations.“The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) reviewed the emergency use authorisation (EUA) application for the second time on Monday and after detailed deliberation recommended granting emergency use authorisation to Covovax,” an official source said.Noting that the vaccine is the technology transfer of Novavax vaccine, the DCGI recently had sought to know the approval status of the application with regulatory authorities in the country of origin that is the USA.The apex drug regulator had also asked the Serum Institute to provide details on Matrix component used in the vaccine.On November 27, the Subject Expert Committee on Covid-19 had evaluated and deliberated on SII’s application and sought additional data from the pharma company.The Pune-based firm had submitted interim safety and immunogenicity data of phase 2/3 bridging clinical trial conducted in the country as well as interim clinical trial data of safety and efficacy from phase3 clinical trials conducted in the UK and the US along with its application.The government had recently permitted the export of 2 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine Covovax to Indonesia produced in India by SII, as the jab had not yet been approved for emergency use in the country, official sources had said.The DCGI office had granted SII permission to manufacture and stock Covovax on May 17. Based on DCGI approval, till now, the Pune-based firm has manufactured and stockpiled the vaccine doses.In August 2020, US-based vaccine maker Novavax, Inc had announced a licence agreement with SII for the development and commercialisation of NVX-CoV2373, its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, in low and middle-income countries and India.The World Health Organisation had on December 17 issued emergency use listing for Covovax, expanding the basket of jabs validated by the global health body against the viral disease. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cdsco-panel-recommends-emergency-use-authorisation-for-siis-covid-vaccine-covovax-355177
27-12-2021||New Delhi||Centre advises poll-bound states to speedily ramp up Covid-19 vaccination||The Centre on Monday advised poll-bound states to speedily ramp up Covid-19 vaccination of all eligible population for the first dose and ensure that those due for the second dose are administered the same.The poll-bound states were also advised to exponentially increase the testing to ensure that the infected are identified promptly for timely initiation of public health response measures, and there is no sudden upsurge in numbers due to low testing besides ensuring that recommended Covid appropriate behaviour is strictly followed and adequate measures are undertaken for their effective enforcement.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan held a high-level meeting with the five poll-bound states of Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to review the public health response measures for containment and management of Covid-19, and the vaccination status in these states, a Health Ministry statement said.While Uttarakhand and Goa have reported vaccination coverage for the first and second doses higher than the national average, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Manipur have the coverage numbers below the national average, it said.A total of 142.38 crore vaccination doses have been administered as on date, of which, more than 83.80 crore vaccine doses are for the first dose and more than 58.58 crore are second doses of Covid-19 vaccine, the ministry said.“The states were advised to speedily ramp up the Covid-19 vaccination of all eligible population for the first dose and ensure that those who were due for the second dose are administered the second dose,” the ministry said in the statement.District-wise weekly vaccination implementation plans are required to be drawn up for this purpose. The state authorities were advised to review the implementation status on a daily basis, the statement said.“The poll-bound states were also advised to exponentially increase the testing to ensure that the infected cases are identified promptly for timely initiation of public health response measures, and to ensure that there is no sudden upsurge in numbers due to low testing.“The state authorities were strongly advised to ensure that recommended Covid appropriate behaviour is strictly followed and adequate measures are undertaken for their effective enforcement,” the statement stated.The Union government continues to support the efforts of states/UTs towards management of Covid-19 pandemic under the ‘Whole of Government’ approach, it added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-advises-poll-bound-states-to-speedily-ramp-up-covid-19-vaccination-355171

However, 151 out of the 578 people, who contracted the infection, have recovered or migrated.The 578 cases have been detected across 19 states and union territories with Delhi recording the maximum number of 142 cases followed by Maharashtra at 141, Kerala  57, Gujarat 49, Rajasthan 43 and Telangana 41.India’s total tally of COVID-19 cases rose to 3,47,93,333, while the active cases declined to 75,841, according to the data updated at 8 am.The death toll has climbed to 4,79,997 with 315 fresh fatalities, the data stated.Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said states and union territories may consider imposing need-based, local curbs and restrictions, to control the crowd during the festive season. A number of states have already imposed curbs on congregation of people besides night curfew.A 48-year-old returnee from Tanzania tested positive for Omicron variant in Manipur, making him the first patient of the strain in the northeastern state.The Directorate of Health Services in Imphal said the man, a resident of Imphal West district, recently returned via Delhi. He tested positive on the eighth day of his return to India.He has been placed under isolation at the state-run Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal, and he has not exhibited any severe symptoms, officials said.Three other family members of the man have also tested positive for COVID-19, but their genome sequencing results are yet to come.In Panaji, an eight-year-old boy, who arrived from the UK, was confirmed to be infected with Omicron.The Delhi government on Sunday had decided to re-impose night curfew from 11 pm to 5 am from Monday in view of surge in daily cases and significant rise in positivity rate. According to a graded response action plan, a ‘Yellow’ alert will come into force, bringing a set of restrictions.Maharashtra reported 26 new cases, including 11 in Mumbai, of the Omicron variant, taking the state’s tally of those infected with the new strain to 167.During the day, Haryana reported two more cases of the Omicron variant, pushing the tally of such cases to 12 in the state.In view of the emergence of the Omicron cases, the Haryana government has already imposed a night curfew and restrictions on gatherings from Saturday. It has also said people eligible for vaccination but not fully vaccinated will be banned from entering shopping malls, cinema halls, restaurants and grain markets, among other crowded places, from January 1.Three more persons tested positive for Omicron in Uttarakhand, taking the number of people infected with the latest variant to four in the state.One of the three cases is a 28-year-old man who had returned from Yemen and tested positive for the Omicron variant in Haridwar.The two others are a 74-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman who had come into contact with a family that had returned from Dubai and tested positive for the strain in Dehradun.Gujarat reported 24 new cases of the Omicron variant, raising the tally to 73.In Indore, the health department has sent for tests samples of 164 people, who came in contact with nine people found infected with the new Omicron variant.Out of these 164 people, if anyone tests positive for coronavirus, then that person’s sample will be sent to the National Centre for Disease Control for genome sequencing to ascertain if the person is infected with the Omicron variant, Indore’s Chief Medical and Health Officer Dr B S Saitya said.Of the nine people found infected with Omicron after return from abroad, seven have recovered and gone back home from hospital, he said.“The other two patients are admitted in different hospitals here and their health condition is stable,” the official said.Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government has requested the Centre to grant the state permission, as a special case, to announce Omicron confirmed cases rather than wait for reports from the National Institute of Virology, owing to its expertise in whole genome sequencing.Reiterating the demand for necessary approvals, Health and Family Welfare Minister Ma Subramanian claimed that by the time the NIV confirmed the samples, those testing positive in the state get discharged after treatment.Subramanian said of the 97 people recently detected with S-gene drop in Tamil Nadu, the NIV confirmed the presence of Omicron variant in 34, of whom 18 have already been discharged while 16 are undergoing treatment.

27-12-2021||Bangalore||Congress will repeal anti-conversion legislation immediately after coming to power in Karnataka||The Congress party will repeal the proposed contentious anti-conversion legislations immediately after coming to power following the 2023 Assembly polls in Karnataka, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah said on Monday.Calling the "Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, 2021" popularly known as the anti-conversion Bill as "anti-constitution" and "draconian", he said the Congress too is opposed to religious conversion by force or through inducement. "We will repeal it hundred per cent, we will do it within a week after coming to power. We will repeal and throw it in the first session," Siddaramaiah told reporters. Responding to a question about BJP planning to pass an ordinance implementing the anti-conversion bill that is yet to be passed by the legislative council, he said, ordinance route is used during emergency situations. "What is the emergency now?"   "It is being brought in with a mal-intention, targeted at a particular religion. Our party is also opposed to religious conversion by force or through inducements. There are already provisions in the constitution and IPC to take action against such conversion," he added. The Karnataka Assembly last week passed the Bill during the recently-concluded winter session of the state legislature in Belagavi, amid protest by opposition parties. The Bill however, is yet to become a law as it is pending for tabling and passage in the Legislative Council. Further alleging that the bill is part of BJP's conspiracy to divert the attention of the people from several key issues, by raising such emotive subjects and to polarise the society. He also questioned the provisions of the bill that calls conversion by marriage as illegal. "If a boy and girl from different religion fall in love and get married, is it conversion, is it against the constitution? It my right to love and marry any one, prohibiting it is un constitutional," the former CM added. The bill provides for protection of right to freedom of religion and prohibition of unlawful conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means. It proposes an imprisonment from three to five years with a fine of Rs 25,000, while for violation of provisions with respect to minors, women, SC/ST, the offenders will face imprisonment from three to ten years and a fine of not less than Rs 50,000. The bill also makes provisions for the accused to pay up to Rs five lakh as compensation to those who were made to convert, and with regards to cases of mass conversion there shall be a 3-10 year jail term and a fine of up to Rs one lakh. It also states that any marriage which has happened for the sole purpose of unlawful conversion or vice-versa by the man of one religion with the woman of another, either by converting himself before or after marriage or by converting the woman before or after marriage, shall be declared as null and void by the family court. Wherever the family court is not established, the court having jurisdiction to try such a case, on a petition presented by either party thereto against the other party of the marriage. The offence under this bill is non-bailable and cognisable. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-will-repeal-anti-conversion-legislation-immediately-after-coming-to-power-in-karnataka-355167

27-12-2021||New Delhi||Amit Shah reviews national narcotics scenario; creation of call centre, canine squad on anvil||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday chaired a high-level national meeting on narcotics coordination and directed the creation of a pan-India portal, a canine unit, free call centre and specialised task forces in states to curb the menace of drugs, an official statement said.The minister reviewed the drugs abuse scenario and the mechanism to counter it in the country during the third apex-level meeting of the narcotics coordination mechanism NCORD, which has a theme of eradicating drugs from the country with the objective of 'nasha-mukt Bharat abhiyan' or drugs-free India movement.The meeting was organised by the federal anti-narcotics agency, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), and it was attended by the secretaries and police chiefs of various states and the Centre.Shah underlined during the meeting that the Narendra Modi government has adopted a zero tolerance policy against narcotics and it considers drug abuse as a major threat to the national security which can only be dealt with overall coordination."As per survey reports, the number of drug abusers has increased approximately 7 folds in the last two decades, which is alarming."To protect, especially our children and youth, the home minister emphasised that there is a need to create awareness against drugs and its ill-effects from a young age by incorporating it in academic curriculum," the statement said.Shah "reviewed the prevailing drug trafficking and abuse scenario in the country and expressed his concerns over its emergence as national threat." "He stressed upon the need for close coordination between the states and central government agencies to tackle this problem that transcends boundaries. The minister underscored the importance of organising NCORD meetings regularly at all the levels with participation of senior officers," the statement said.According to official data shared during the meeting, drugs worth Rs 1,881 crore were seized between 2018-2021, which is "three times" the value of drugs seized between 2011-2014 at Rs 604 crore.Between 2018-2021, about 35 lakh kg of drugs were confiscated while between 2011-2014, about 16 lakh kg of drugs were confiscated, it said.For strengthening the coordination mechanism, the minister asked all states to create dedicated anti-narcotics task force (ANTF) which can also function as the NCORD secretariat at the state level, the statement said.The minister also directed the agencies "to take some important measures such as creation of a national NCORD portal, constitution of inter ministerial standing committees (IMCs) to devise effective policies with regard to dual use prescription drugs and precursors, raising of a national narco canine pool, and establishment of drug de-addiction centres in all prisons of 272 most affected districts etc." The minister said the Union government will also create a 24x7 toll free national narcotics call centre where the public can share inputs and information on drug matters.It was also directed by the minister that "arrangement of container scanners and related equipment for scanning of incoming and outgoing containers at all ports, whether government or private" should be made."An effective system to be put in place to stop increasing use of dark net and crypto currency in illegal drugs trade and drug cultivation should be curbed using drones, satellite and other technology," the statement said.Shah directed the NCB to build capacity of various drug law enforcement agencies like the police, paramilitary forces, public prosecutors and employees of civil departments "at national level on various areas of narcotics control." The minister also "expressed concern over increasing drug trafficking through maritime route which has become an emerging challenge on coastal front of the country and emphasised on involvement of all stakeholders in the state NCORD meetings especially of coastal states and suggested extending the mandate of existing joint coordination committee under the NCB." --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-reviews-national-narcotics-scenario-creation-of-call-centre-canine-squad-on-anvil-355165

There are considered intellectual people but they are misguiding people. The anti-mob lynching act is not a Hindu, Muslim or Adivasi act because a mob is simply a mob. We were forced to enact the legislation after the BJP, which is like Ravana, came to power at Centre and created an atmosphere which ruined the social fabric of the country,” Soren told reporters.The Chief Minister claimed that a caste census will help policymakers frame targeted welfare schemes for backward castes.

27-12-2021||Lucknow||Piyush Jain—the man who threw up India’s biggest cash haul||For one who has thrown up the biggest cash haul in the history of the country, Piyush Jain can easily be mistaken as just another common man.For one who stacked up crores in cash at his house and its walls, Jain’s lifestyle has been astonishingly simple.In his hometown Kanpur, Jain still rides an old scooter and his house was extremely modest though he recently renovated it. He owns a Qualis and a Maruti and when cash spilled out of his house, his neighbours were shocked.“He was just another businessman in the perfume business and we never imagined that he would have so much cash stacked in his house. He never flaunted his wealth and even his lifestyle was very middle class,” said RK Sharma, who lives in the Chippatti locality where Jain also lives.Jain’s father lives mostly in Kannauj while he and his brother Amrish live in Kanpur. Jain learnt the art of making perfumes and edible essences from his father, who is a chemist.Jain, 52, was born in Kanpur and completed his education from there. He then joined the family business in Kannauj though he continued living in Kanpur.His acquaintances claim that he had no political connections or friends in power.“We have never seen him visit any politician or political party office. He never claimed to know any influential person either,” said one of his associates, requesting anonymity.Contrary to popular belief, Jain is in no way related to Pampi Jain, the Samajwadi Party leader who had launched the ‘Samajwadi Itr’ in Lucknow last month.“The only thing common between the two is that they are both in perfume business, they both live in the same locality and both belong to the Jain community. Pushpraj Jain a.k.a. Pampi Jain is a SP MLC and it was he who launched the ‘Samajwadi Itr’,” said Kunal Yadav, a resident of Kannauj.However, media reports connecting the two—Piyush Jain and Pampi—have led to a political slugfest in Uttar Pradesh.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Monday that now he knows why ‘some people’ were opposing demonetisation.“The black money is now coming out of walls,” he said.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav clarified that “this raid should not be linked with SP at all. Piyush Jain has no relation with SP MLC Pampi Jain”.SP leaders, in fact, claim that Piyush Jain’s family is inclined towards the BJP and always supported the ruling party.As political parties battle over Jain’s affiliation, the party now seems to be over for this businessman.As a senior official said, “Accumulating so much wealth is not possible without any patronage. As investigations progress, the truth will tumble out. As things stand, Piyush Jain can prepare for a long stint behind the bars and his pleasing perfumes may not be able to make life less unpleasant for him.”On Monday, Jain was remanded to 14-day judicial custody by a local court after he was arrested under Section 132 of CGST Act.“Jain has accepted that the cash recovered from the residential premises is related to sale of goods without payment of GST,” said a GST official. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/piyush-jain%E2%80%94the-man-who-threw-up-indias-biggest-cash-haul-355160
27-12-2021||Chandigarh||Air pollution over north, west India increased during lockdown, in contrast to other parts of the country||Satellite observations have revealed that reduction in economic activities during the pandemic-related lockdown notwithstanding, there was an increase in air pollution levels over north India and central-western India. This is in contrast to the general trend in other parts of the country.Based on analysis of satellite data, scientists have suggested that certain regions in north India and central-western India are prone to higher air pollution exposure and hence are exposed to greater risk of respiratory problems. This could have aggravated respiratory health risks around those regions during the pandemic.In 2020, a complete nationwide lockdown was imposed to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. While this had enormously disrupted the economy, the single positive side effect was a short-term improvement in the air quality.Scientists at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nanital, used EUMETSAT and NASA satellite observations for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to investigate the influence of significant reduction in anthropogenic activities on the changes in the distribution of ozone, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide during the lockdown period.The study published recently in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research journal showed that ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide showed an increase of about 15 per cent over central-western part of India. Carbon monoxide showed an increase of as high as 31 per cent at higher altitudes.The long-range transport and downward transport from the stratosphere significantly increased ozone concentrations over north India during the lockdown. Remote regions like the Himalayas and coastal cities showed the bare minimum influence of lockdown in air quality, with a tendency to increase in air pollutants, the study observed.According to ARIES scientists, ozone production and loss are constrained through the complex photochemistry involving its precursor gases. A decrease in precursor gases could also lead to enhancement of ozone, depending upon the chemical environment. Ozone concentrations are also altered by ambient meteorology and the downward transport of ozone-rich air from the stratosphere to the troposphere.This study helped to identify the regions prone to higher air pollution exposure hence can identify areas at a greater health risk, the Ministry of Science and Technology said in a statement issued today. While INSAT-3D is a valuable Indian geostationary satellite to study ozone pollutions, India is lacking in space-based observation capability for other pollutants, for which an air quality monitoring indigenous satellite is needed, the statement added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-over-north-west-india-increased-during-lockdown-in-contrast-to-other-parts-of-the-country-355159

This is the real report of the UP’s BJP government,” Samajwadi Party chief asserted in a tweet.“By publishing misleading advertisements, the reality cannot be changed. The people will give a reply in 2022 (elections) to those who have spoiled the health of UP,” he added.“UP is saying today that the BJP is not needed,” he claimed.The Niti Aayog on Monday released its fourth Health Index report for the country, putting Kerala at the top of the list of states as per their performance in the health sector and Uttar Pradesh at its bottom.The fourth round of the Health Index took into account the period 2019-20 (reference year).The report by the government think tank said Tamil Nadu and Telangana have emerged as the second and third best performers, respectively, on health parameters.Bihar and Madhya Pradesh were the second and third-worst performers, respectively, on health parameters.The report, however, added that Uttar Pradesh topped in terms of incremental performance by registering the highest incremental change from the base year (2018-19) to the reference year (2019-20).Yadav, however, chose to keep silent on this positive remark of the Aayog about Uttar Pradesh.

27-12-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks AIIMS’ opinion on medical termination of 28-week pregnancy||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought an AIIMS expert body’s opinion on medical termination of a 28-week pregnancy on account of certain abnormalities in the foetus after the initial medical report indicated the foetus was alive and might need medical care after being removed from the uterus at this stage.Justice Anu Malhotra, who was dealing with a petition by a 33-year old woman seeking permission to undergo medical termination of pregnancy, said that in view of the medical report, the question was not whether the pregnancy “can” be terminated but whether it “should” be.The counsel for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, said that the foetus has a heartbeat and in case the medical termination of pregnancy is proceeded with, there was a chance that the child would be born alive.He nonetheless stated that the institute would comply with whatever orders are passed in the case.The court said that it shared AIIMS’ concern for the foetus being born with life.“That’s what I’m also saying that I will be entering into murder. That was my first sentence. I know that the child is alive. The report is very clear and it says that if the child is born, it will need postnatal resuscitation,” Justice Malhotra said.“It is very clear that the child is alive and if it is removed from the uterus also, it would continue to be there and it would need care and immediate attention and if it is not given, it may collapse but can a court order that? That’s my concern,” she said.The petitioner had moved the court for permission to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, claiming that the foetus suffered from abnormalities of the heart and chances of survival were remote.On December 22, the court had asked AIIMS to set up a medical board at the earliest for the examination of the woman.The court noted that according to the report submitted by the AIIMS medical board, the foetus was viable and there was an 80 per cent chance of success if it receives due medical care and attention. “There have been cases where patients have survived and here they are showing a success rate of 80 per cent, and 80 per cent is not small. What can be done is that a further report can be called for,” the court stated.The court directed the board to give its opinion on the postnatal outcome in the case of a full-term delivery and the need for surgeries during childhood for the child’s well-being as well as the follow-up care.The court also asked the board to state if there was any danger, physical or mental, to the petitioner if the pregnancy is continued and the kind of postnatal resuscitation and management required in case of termination done at the present gestation.The counsel for the petitioner said that it was the mother’s right to decide if she wanted to continue with the pregnancy and argued that according to the law, pregnancies could be terminated even after 24 weeks.“Nobody says it can’t be performed. Whether it should be performed is the query. I’m not saying that it can’t be,” the judge said.The petitioner also claimed that now permitting her to undergo medical termination of pregnancy would put her through financial, emotional as well as physical strain.The matter would be heard next on December 29. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-seeks-aiims-opinion-on-medical-termination-of-28-week-pregnancy-355145

27-12-2021||New Delhi||Number of Covid cases to increase in Delhi in next two months; peak likely in Feb: Experts||With the number of fresh COVID-19 cases going up by 10 times from what it was at the beginning of the month in Delhi, experts on Monday said the number of cases will see an increase in the next couple of months due to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, with the peak likely to be attained in February.Delhi reported 331 fresh Covid cases on Monday with a positivity rate of 0.68 per cent, while the number of new cases and the positivity rate rose to 331 and 0.68 per cent respectively on Monday.The national capital reported 39 fresh cases of the infection with a positivity rate of 0.07 per cent on December 1. The following day, the positivity rate had declined to 0.06 per cent, while the number of fresh cases was 41.Between December 9 and December 15, Delhi logged 48 daily cases on an average, which rose to 95 between December 16 and December 22. According to official data, it was a rise of 49.47 per cent on a weekly basis.Epidemiologist Giridhar R Babu said, “It is very unlikely that the number of cases has risen due to the festive season because in that case, the impact would have been seen 14 days after Diwali in November and the number of cases would have risen by November-end. The number is rising due to the Omicron variant, which is highly transmissible. The cases will see a rapid ascent and a rapid descent and the peak is likely to come between mid-January and mid-February.”      Dr Jugal Kishore, the head of the community medicine department at the Safdarjung hospital, said the number of coronavirus cases and the positivity rate are bound to increase, but will not translate into mortality.“What we can say is that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the present cases could be related to Omicron, while the rest could be due to other variants. The transmission occurs because of proximity. In winter, people are indoors and meeting each other in a close-knit environment, and even the number of influenza cases rises during this period,” he said.The senior doctor also said till the time the panic button is not pressed and the situation is managed well, there will not be any issue.“All kinds of disasters are results of a system failure. The government should formulate guidelines on proper management. Those who are suffering from issues like a severe headache or fever should go to hospitals while the rest should manage at home and should not even go for testing. After testing positive, the person will panic trying to grab hospital beds and medicines,” he said.Babu said those who have not been vaccinated and have not been infected with the virus are more susceptible and it is that population that needs to be looked after.Kishore echoed similar views and said while vaccination does not mean one would not contract the infection, it certainly reduces the severity of the infection.

27-12-2021||Bengaluru||HC asks cop not to indulge in 'moral policing'||The Karnataka High Court (Dharwad bench) has imposed a penalty of Rs 1 lakh each on a police inspector and a rehabilitation centre for forcefully keeping a married woman and her three-year-old daughter at the centre. The court further expressed its displeasure that the act of the policeman, in this case, amounts to moral policing and said that a police inspector can not intervene in the married life of a person.The verdict was given by a bench headed by Justice NS Sanjay Gowda. The woman had filed a petition before the court seeking her release from the rehabilitation centre. The bench has also observed that it is an unfortunate case of a woman being kept at a centre where victims of human trafficking and sexual assault are rehabilitated.The bench has ordered that the inspector and rehabilitation centre must pay the fine to the court and the registrar should deposit the amount in the name of the girl child as a fixed amount and the petitioner can take the interest.The petitioner, who got married in 2007, had a daughter out of the wedlock. In 2021, on May 3, she moved out of her husband's house along with the kid due to family dispute. The husband filed a missing complaint with Malamaruthi police station.Inspector Balasaheb Patil called the woman to the police station and tried for reconciliation. When she rejected his offer, she was sent to the rehabilitation centre where victims of human trafficking and sexual assault are kept.The court underlined after verifying statements of the inspector and the victim, that the woman had not requested shelter in the first place. Since she rejected living with her husband, she had been sent to the rehabilitation centre. This reflects a lack of humanity and sensitivity on the part of the police inspector.The court also objected that even after several requests the woman was not allowed to go outside and said she was kept in illegal detention for 6 months.The woman stated that she was in love with a man living in the neighbourhood. With an intention to live with him, she decided to end her marriage. She also said that the inspector forcefully kept her in detention so that she could not have any contact with the outside world, particularly the man whom she loved.It is clear that the woman was kept in forceful detention. The Police inspector cannot interfere in the life of a person. This amounts to moral policing, the court said. The verdict was given on December 8.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-cop-not-to-indulge-in-moral-policing-355105

In front of our eyes they had captured in 1947 (referring to partition)...They had earlier captured Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. They captured Bangladesh and Pakistan through politics...I salute Nathuram Godse that he killed Gandhi”. Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Baghel slammed Kalicharan Maharaj for his remarks against Mahatma Gandhi, and said if a “hypocrite” thinks he can succeed in his intention by abusing the Father of the Nation and spreading venom in society, then it is his illusion.Baghel said strict action will be taken under the law if anyone tries to instigate people by making such remarks.“By abusing Bapu (Mahatma Gandhi) and spreading venom in society, if a hypocrite thinks that he will be successful in his intention, then it is his illusion. Their bosses should also listen...whoever tries to hurt the soul of both India and Sanatan culture...neither the Constitution will spare them, nor the people will accept them,” the CM tweeted in Hindi.Earlier in the day, talking to reporters at the Swami Vivekanand Airport in Raipur, Baghel said whoever tries to instigate people by making such remarks will face stern action.To a question on the religious leader’s statement, Baghel said, “Whoever the person is, legal action will be taken.” “An FIR has been registered in the matter. Police are looking into it and action will be taken accordingly,” the CM said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik raised the issue in the state Assembly, which is having its winter session in Mumbai, and demanded that the religious leader be booked for treason and arrested.NCP member Malik said in the House that Kalicharan Maharaj hails from Akola in Maharashtra.BJP member Sudhir Mungantiwar wondered what was the Maha Vikas Aghadi government doing on the issue and why it was not taking action against Kalicharan Maharaj.Malik’s demand for action against the seer was supported by Congress members Nana Patole and Vijay Wadettiwar. They urged the Chair to give necessary directions to the Maharashtra government.To this, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said Malik and Wadettiwar were representatives of the government.“It is the job of the government to take action. The MVA government will seek a report about the comments (of Kalicharan Maharaj) and take stern action,” Pawar said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fir-against-hindu-religious-leader-for-derogatory-remarks-against-mahatma-gandhi-355048

The Law Ministry, state governments, Governor, HC Collegium, IB and the executive are part of the process. NV Ramana, CJIHe was delivering the fifth Sri Lavu Venkatewarlu Endowment Lecture on “Indian Judiciary — Challenges of future” at Siddhartha Law College in Vijayawada.He also said that in recent times, physical attacks on judicial officers were on the rise and at times, there were concerted campaigns in the print and social media against judges if parties did not get a favourable order while these attacks appeared to be “sponsored and synchronised”.There was a need to liberate the institution of public prosecutors. Total independence must be granted to them and to make them answerable only to the courts, he further said.“It is nowadays fashionable to reiterate phrases such as ‘judges are themselves appointing judges’. I consider this to be one of the widely propagated myths. The fact is the judiciary is merely one of the many players involved in the process,” Justice Ramana said.Recently, Kerala MP John Brittas had reportedly said during a debate in Parliament on the High Court and Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill, 2021, that judges appointing judges was unheard of anywhere.“Many authorities are involved, including the Union Law Ministry, state governments, Governor, High Court Collegium, Intelligence Bureau and lastly, the topmost executive, who all are designated to examine the suitability of a candidate. I am sad to note that the well-informed persons propagate the aforesaid notion. After all, this narrative suits certain sections,” Justice Ramana said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judges-appointing-judges-a-propagated-myth-says-cji-354909

27-12-2021||Johannesburg/New Delhi||Anti-apartheid icon Desmond Tutu dead||Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South Africa’s revered anti-apartheid icon who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for fighting racial discrimination in the country, died on Sunday. He was 90.Guiding lightHe was a guiding light. His emphasis on human dignity and equality will be forever remembered. — PM ModiLost a great manHe lived a truly meaningful life. The best tribute will be to see how we too can be of help to others. — Dalai LamaPresident Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Tutu passed away in Cape Town in the early hours of Sunday. Tutu, who previously survived tuberculosis, had undergone a surgery for prostate cancer in 1997. He was also hospitalised several times in recent years for various ailments.A contemporary of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, Tutu, known affectionately as “the Arch”, was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991.From the temporal to the spiritual, world leaders of all hues collectively mourned the death of the blunt-speaking, first black Bishop of Johannesburg who was widely recognised as conscience of this generation. From India, PM Narendra Modi and the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetans, were among those who condoled his death.In his final years, Tutu had regretted that his dream of a “Rainbow Nation” had yet to come true, and often fell out with erstwhile allies of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party over their failures to address the poverty and inequalities that they promised to eradicate.Just 5 ft 5 inches tall and with an infectious giggle, Tutu travelled tirelessly through the 1980s to become the face of the anti-apartheid movement abroad.Long-time friends, Tutu and Mandela lived for a time on the same street in the South African township of Soweto, making Vilakazi Street the only one in the world to have been resident to two Nobel Peace Prize winners.“His most characteristic quality is his readiness to take unpopular positions without fear,” Mandela once said of Tutu. Born near Johannesburg, Tutu spent most of his later life in Cape Town. — Agencies/TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-apartheid-icon-desmond-tutu-dead-354897

He said, “Modi ji failed the migrant workers, poor and small traders during the Covid waves.”Alleging that Covid “mismanagement” led to “death of nearly 40 lakh Indians” Surjewala said, “The tepid response on Omicron virus is even more alarming now.” The Congress leader said despite the “lofty announcement”, the harsh reality is that 47.95 crore adults over 18 years of age are yet to be administered 59.40 crore doses.Questioning jab availability, Surjewala said the PM’s announcement would mean that 25.69 crore people would be entitled to 35.7 crore more vaccine doses.

27-12-2021||New Delhi||Government 'oblivious' to threat posed by Omicron; PM Modi continuing to hold rallies: Congress||Accusing the government of being "ignorant" to the threat posed by the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the Congress on Sunday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must follow a clear vaccination policy, provide jabs for children between 5 and 15 years and spell out the roadmap to combat the pandemic.The Congress also took a swipe at Prime Minister Modi over political rallies, saying while in Uttar Pradesh gatherings at weddings are being limited to 200, the prime minister is holding rallies wherein lakhs participate The Opposition's attack at the Centre over its handling of the pandemic came a day after the prime minister announced that vaccination against COVID-19 for children between 15 and 18 years will start from January 3, while "precaution dose" for healthcare and frontline workers would be administered from January 10. In an address to the nation, Modi said the precaution dose will also be available for citizens above 60 years of age and with comorbidities on the advice of their doctor from January 10 next year as well.Reacting to the announcement, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the Centre has "accepted my suggestion" to allow the administration of booster doses of Covid vaccine and asserted that the protection of vaccines and booster shots has to be provided to every citizen of the country.At a press conference, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that the Modi government has "failed India" during the pandemic."Modi ji failed the migrant workers during the first and second Corona wave, Modi ji failed the poor during the first and second wave when he failed to put a single paisa in the hands of the poor when the whole world was doing it, Modi ji failed the small and medium businesses when he virtually left them to fend for themselves," he charged.Ciitng surveys, Surjewala said "mismanagement" of the coronavirus pandemic led to death of nearly 40 lakh Indians."The tepid response on Omicron virus bordering on the directionless drift is even more alarming now. The entire policy paralysis of the Modi government in dealing with coronavirus including Omicron is marred by failure of leadership, rudderless response and planless preparation," Surjewala charged.The only solution Modi offers is to "escape responsibility, have completely confused and repeated changes in vaccination policy", be preoccupied with self-promotion by putting his picture on the vaccination certificate and hold public rallies, Surjewala said. He also accused the prime minister of shifting the buck on to the states while shouldering "zero responsibility".Attacking the prime minister over his address to the nation on Saturday, the Congress leader said that despite the "lofty announcement and the accolades that he was trying to earn yesterday", the harsh reality is otherwise. "The harsh reality is -- 47.95 crore adults over 18 years of age are yet to be administered 59.40 crore doses," Surjewala said.The other "harsh reality" is that "where are the vaccine doses", and as per the Modi government, they have availability of 17.74 crore vaccines doses only, he said.Surjewala said Prime Minister Modi's announcement on Saturday would mean that 25.69 crore people would be entitled to 35.7 crore more vaccine doses, he said.So the total need of vaccine doses is over 90 crore and asked "where are the vaccines".India's capacity is to produce 16.8 crore vaccine doses per month, he said. "So,  how and by when, till which date, will all these Indians be administered these vaccines," Surjewala asked."The need of the hour is that the prime minister follows the 'raj dharma', adopt a clear vaccine policy, provide vaccine to the children in the age group of 5 to 15 years and suggest a way to save the country from the danger of the Omicron virus," he said.Surjewala also attacked the prime minister over holding of public rallies in Uttar Pradesh."Modi ji did not prepare to deal with Omicron virus but banned gathering of 200 in weddings. However, his own rallies with lakhs of people are going on. When the first wave of Covid came, PM put people's lives in danger by doing the 'Namaste Trump' event, in the second wave did the 'Jan Ashivaad Yatra' and did rallies in West Bengal without caring for people and now again trying to score political points, while in Uttar Pradesh gathering of 200 in weddings is not allowed, two lakhs are brought for PM's rallies using public money by buses," he said.Surjewala said past experience shows that once the virus has taken root in the UK and US, it hits India within 65 days and within 80 days it is at its peak. "Why is it that the government is oblivious and ignorant, bordering on criminal negligence, to the threat of the Omicron virus. We know that it doubles between 1.5 and 3 days, it escapes existing antibodies, we know that it changes protein spikes, it is fastest communicable, it will lead to large scale massive hospitalisation," he said.As many as 422 Omicron cases have been detected across 17 states and union territories in India so far and 130 of these people have recovered or migrated, according to Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-oblivious-to-threat-posed-by-omicron-pm-continuing-to-hold-rallies-congress-354670
