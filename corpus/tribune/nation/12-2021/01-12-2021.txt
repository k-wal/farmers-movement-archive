He demanded that charge sheets be filed in a six months trial be concluded expeditiously in two years.“The remarks are not only outrageous and blasphemous but also intend to cause riots, hurt religious sentiments; they are defamatory as well as portray Sikhs in a totally anti-national manner. It also justifies the innocent killing of Sikhs. The remarks are totally against the unity of our country and the actress deserves a serious punishment in law. They cannot be brushed aside or excused,” the petitioner submitted.The advocate requested the top court to direct the Union Ministry of Home and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to take preventive measures with regard to her social media posts.None of her posts on social media should be allowed without amendment, deletion, and modification or censoring in order to maintain law and order in the country, he submitted.The petitioner alleged that her posts inferred that all Sikh farmers were separatists and aspirants of Khalistan. “Such kind of irresponsible statements can spread hatred amongst the Indians resulting in the disunity of the Country,” he submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/advocate-moves-sc-against-kangana-ranaut-over-blasphemous-social-media-posts-345171

CBSE acknowledges the error made and will take strict action against the responsible persons,” the board said in an official statement.It said the CBSE guidelines for paper-setters clearly state that they have to ensure the questions should be academic oriented only and should be class-, religion-neutral and “should not touch upon domains that could harm sentiments of people based on social and political choices”.The multiple choice question in the sociology exam asked – “The unprecedented scale and spread of anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002 took place under which government?”           The options offered were—Congress, BJP, Democratic and Republican.The riots broke out in the state in 2002 after the burning of two coaches of the Sabarmati Express train near Godhra railway station in which 59 Hindu ‘karsevaks’ were killed.

Farmers’ unions stand united and the Modi government should stop its continued divisive agenda. The SKM is awaiting formal communication with all required details from the government,” it said.Criticising the Union government’s response, the SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, said through such remarks the Centre continues to “insult” the huge sacrifices made by protesting farmers.“The SKM condemns the response of Government of India in Parliament where Narendra Singh Tomar in a written reply said that the government has no information about deaths in the farmers’ movement and therefore, question of financial assistance does not arise.“The SKM reiterates its demand for compensation and rehabilitation of the kin of more than 689 martyrs in the ongoing agitation,” the statement said.Senior farmer leader and SKM core committee member Shivkumar Sharma ‘Kakkaji’ alleged that the government was “lying” and running away from its responsibilities by making such remarks.“Teams of the Intelligence Bureau were collecting information from us about farmers who were martyred during the course of the movement but still the government is saying that they have no record of such deaths. It shows the government is lying in Parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to provide compensation to the families of deceased farmers,” Sharma told PTI.He said the government can also check with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) about farmers’ deaths during the agitation as they also collect data about all types of deaths in the country.The farmers’ body also clarified that the agitation is still continuing and no one is leaving protest sites.“Morchas around Delhi borders continue, with more tractor-trolleys reaching the protest sites and the struggle will continue. More farmers are coming so that everyone can go back together victorious,” the statement said.The SKM appealed to farmers not to believe falsehoods being spread about protests ending.It added that the SKM will hold its meeting on December 4, as announced earlier, and decide the future course of the agitation.On Monday, a bill was passed in Parliament to repeal the three contentious farm laws.Repeal of the farm laws was one of the main demands of the thousands of protesters. But the stalemate continues as their other demands such as legal guarantee on MSP, compensation to families of farmers who died during the movement and withdrawal of cases against them are still to be met.The Centre on Tuesday demanded five names from the SKM for a panel to deliberate on MSP and other issues.However, the SKM in a statement said that its leaders had received a phone call from the Centre on the issue but they were yet to get a formal communication in this connection.

I can play videos, how dust is coming up from Central Vista. It cannot be more important than Supreme Court orders,” Singh had said even as Mehta termed it “trumpet-blowing.”On Wednesday, the Centre’s affidavit asserted that “…so far as the Parliamentary Building and the Central Vista Avenue is concerned, it complies with Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules and each and every condition which is put to ensure that it does not cause any pollution”.It said the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development has taken all the measures as contemplated under the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules which included measure such as use of anti-smog gun, mist spray system, use of dust suppressant like magnesium chloride, use of conveyer belt to transfer construction material, keeping all construction material in wet condition etc.The top court—which had ordered the governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to comply with the directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas, the Centre and the court—will take up their compliance reports on Thursday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution%C2%A0central-vista-complies-with-pollution-control-norms-centre-tells-sc-345159
01-12-2021||New Delhi||Over 2 million Indian accounts banned by WhatsApp in October: Report||Over 2 million Indian accounts were banned by WhatsApp, while 500 grievance reports were received by the messaging platform in October, according to its compliance report.In its latest report released on Monday, WhatsApp said 20,69,000 Indian accounts were banned on WhatsApp during the said period.An Indian account is identified via a +91 phone number, it added.“WhatsApp is an industry leader in preventing abuse, among end-to-end encrypted messaging services. Over the years, we have consistently invested in Artificial Intelligence and other state of the art technology, data scientists and experts, and in processes, in order to keep our users safe on our platform,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.In accordance with the IT Rules 2021, the platform has published its fifth monthly report for the month of October, the spokesperson said.“This user-safety report contains details of the user complaints received and the corresponding action taken by WhatsApp, as well as WhatsApp’s own preventive actions to combat abuse on our platform. As captured in the latest monthly report, WhatsApp banned over 2 million accounts in the month of October,” the spokesperson said.Previously, the Facebook-owned company had stated that more than 95 per cent of bans are due to the unauthorised use of automated or bulk messaging (spam). The global average number of accounts that WhatsApp bans to prevent abuse on its platform is around 8 million accounts per month.Over 2.2 million Indian accounts were banned by WhatsApp, while 560 grievance reports were received by the messaging platform in the month of September.WhatsApp, in its latest report, said it received 500 user reports spanning across account support (146), ban appeal (248), other support (42), product support (53), and safety (11) during October.During this period, 18 accounts were “actioned” under the ban appeal category based on the reports received.WhatsApp explained that “Accounts Actioned” denotes reports where it took remedial action based on the report.Taking action denotes either banning an account or a previously banned account being restored as a result of the complaint.Also, reports may have been reviewed but not included as ‘Actioned’ for many reasons, including the user needing assistance to access their account or to use some features, user-requested restoration of a banned account and the request is denied, or if the reported account does not violate the laws of India or WhatsApp’s Terms of Service.The new IT rules — which came into effect in May — require large digital platforms (with over 5 million users) to publish compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken.Previously, WhatsApp had emphasised that being an end-to-end encrypted platform, it has no visibility into the content of any messages.Besides, the behavioural signals from accounts, it relies on available unencrypted information, including user reports, profile photos, group photos, and descriptions as well as advanced AI tools and resources to detect and prevent abuse on its platform, it had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/science-technology/over-2-million-indian-accounts-banned-by-whatsapp-in-october-report-345158
01-12-2021||New Delhi||All 191 Covid samples genome sequenced at ILBS between Oct, Nov were Delta variant: Official||A genome sequencing laboratory at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) tested 191 Covid samples between October and November and found all of them to be of Delta variant, according to a senior official at the facility.The laboratory, which started in July, has processed around 720 samples between August and November.Dr S K Sarin the vice-chancellor of ILBS said of the samples received between October and November, 191 have been sequenced and all of them are of Delta and its sub-variants.Dr Ekta Gupta, professor, department of clinical virology, at ILBS, said the laboratory had received over 277 samples in November.Around 170 samples are pending and they will be sequenced in the next couple of days, she said.Asked if the institute plans to ramp up its genome sequencing capacity amid concerns over the Omicron variant of coronavirus, she said, “We have a high capacity for sequencing samples. The case positivity rate of Delhi is currently low so we are not receiving a very high number of samples.”Dr Gupta said samples that undergo genome sequencing are those that have a CT value of 25. “Currently, the viral load is low, hospital admissions are low and there is a lesser number of symptomatic people which means that we receive a lower number of samples for testing,” she added.The facility at ILBS is equipped with the latest machines called NextSeq and MiSeq which can sequence the whole virus to the tune of 400 sequences per week.The Delhi government has approved a new machine for ILBS, the NovaSeq, which will allow viral sequences up to 3,000 every week.In June, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that two genome sequencing laboratories to identify variants of coronavirus will come up at the LNJP Hospital and the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.Setting up of these laboratories were part of the Delhi government’s preparations to tackle a possible third wave of coronavirus.

01-12-2021||Guwahati||Death of main accused in the lynching of AASU leader prompts jubilation, concern in Assam||The prime accused in the lynching of AASU leader in Jorhat died after being hit by a police vehicle when trying to escape from custody in the early hours on Wednesday, which prompted jubilation by people across Jorhat city and Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to say that the state will become crime-free.The opposition on the other hand accused the police of extrajudicial killings and some to express their concern.Neeraj Das alias ‘Kola Lora’ (black boy) was arrested on Tuesday, a day after the gruesome incident, and was to be produced before the court on Wednesday.Jorhat superintendent of police Ankit Jain said that during interrogation the prime accused Neeraj Das alias ‘Kola Lora’ (black boy) had revealed that a big drug consignment was coming and a police team set out with him at around 2 am on Wednesday in a bid to intercept the consignment.Das tried to escape by jumping off the police vehicle in the lonely stretch on Chinamora-Mariani road and while trying to flee, he was accidentally hit by the police vehicle which was moving at a high speed. “The driver of the vehicle then lost control of the vehicle which rammed into a wall and was damaged,” Jain told PTI.Das was taken to the hospital, where he was declared “brought dead”. Three policemen were injured in the incident.A total 13 people, including Das, were arrested on Monday and Tuesday in connection with the lynching of All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) leader Animesh Bhuyan. Two others, including a reporter, who was accompanying Bhuyan were injured in the incident on Monday.As the news of Das’ death spread people came out to the streets in Jorhat city, which is a major educational hub of upper Assam, and burst crackers in jubilation.Sarma wrote on Twitter, “Assam will be free of crime and criminal—come what May” and retweeted a post by Special DGP (Law and Order) GP Singh.The government headed by Sarma will complete its first year in May next year and the tweet is assumed to be a reference for bringing crime under control before it.Singh had tweeted at around 2.29 am on Wednesday “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction—Newton’s Third Law” apparently referring to Das’ death after being hit by a police vehicle.Sarma later told reporters on the sidelines of a programme at Gorukhuti in Darrang district, “To save Assam from crime and criminals, crime has to be checked. Assam Police is committed to eradicate crime from our society.”   Referring to Das’ death, he said, “Some people are saying it’s a good thing, but I am not satisfied in my heart. We have reached a point where our youths are killing each other”.AASU general secretary Sankarjyoti Baruah said, “For the first time we are happy over a person’s death. Das had many cases against him and was a terror for Jorhat. God has delivered justice”.“Today, Animesh’s soul and his family have attained their peace,” he said and demanded the arrest of all those involved in the lynching and exemplary punishment against them.Leader of Opposition Debabrata Saikia apparently suspecting foul play in the death of Das said, “Whenever there is death of a person in custody, NHRC mandates enquiry. We hope that the enquiry is done impartially.”  On the contention by the police that Das was being taken to provide a lead on a drugs consignment, Saikia said that he had complained to Jorhat police of business in drugs in the area ten years ago but no action was taken. Das had about 90 cases, including those relating to drug offences pending against him but no action was taken.Questioning the police action, the Congress leader said: “Perhaps the cat would have got out of the bag and hence the quick action. But of course we will have to wait for an investigation before arriving at any conclusion”.  Assam Jatiya Parishad president Lurinjyoti Gogoi demanded security and quick justice for the two injured in the lynching undergoing treatment at Jorhat Medical College and Hospital.He visited them during the day and enquired about their health.The sense of jubiliation among a section of the people over Das’ death has led many to ring the bell of caution. Sushanta Talukdar, the editor of a Guwahati-based online news magazine, in a tweet apparently referring to the circumstances of Das’ death said, “Manufacturing consent for #extrajudicial killing is a part of conscious attempt to weaken the judicial system for covering up failure of the State.”   Another senior editor Sangeeta Barooah Pisharoty also questioned the manner in which Das was killed and took to the micro blogging site to air her apprehensions. Maintaining that “What @assampolice did is essentially taking over role of judiciary”, she wrote  “Let’s be very clear - police is to main law and order ONLY not deliver justice” and retweeted the special DGP’s post. Kaushik Deka, another senior scribe from Assam, tweeted: “No sympathy for a mob leader, but is it the way to compensate for poor policing and slow judicial process? Could become a Frankenstein in a blood thirsty society. Everyone demanding an encounter is no less than a potential lyncher.”Reacting to Deka, the special DGP replied: “Without taking away from our failures, at times, we’ve to carry the load of failure of the other partner institutions of the criminal justice system”.Bhuyan was beaten to death and two others were seriously injured by a group of people following a heated argument over an accident. The incident took place in the day when an old man fell down from a scooter in front of Bhuyan’s four-wheeler but some people claimed that the AASU leader had hit the two-wheeler. He and his two friends had got down from the vehicle to help the elderly person. The elderly man’s son Neeraj Das and some of his friends, who were nearby, rushed to the spot and started thrashing Bhuyan and his two friends, accusing them of causing the accident. Bhuyan was the education secretary of Brahmaputra Regional Committee of AASU’s Golaghat district unit. One of his companions was local reporter Mridusmanta Baruah and the other was Pranay Dutta, both AASU members. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/death-of-main-accused-in-the-lynching-of-aasu-leader-prompts-jubilation-concern-in-assam-345153

Asked if it is possible to file a case at the Supreme Court against the Union Government for illegally ceding Indian territories to China, Swamy said, “Yes under Article 1 of the Constitution.Venugopal too had his question removed. He had sought to ask whether NRIs living abroad were harassed at airports and sent back and if some were asked by the authorities to stop helping the farmers’ agitation.In the last Session, the Government wrote to the Rajya Sabha Secretariat asking it to remove a question posed by Communist leader Binoy Viswam seeking details on whether the Centre had entered into a contract with NSO Group which sells the Pegasus snooping software. Usually, this observation is mentioned in the tabled reply which then gives no further details. “I have been informed informally that my question was disallowed but I am yet to get a formal response. They must face questions on the issue of the Pegasus,” Viswam had said in August.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-ducking-tough-questions-in-parliament-bjps-subramanian-swamy-345151
01-12-2021||New Delhi||Mandaviya tables Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill for regulation of clinics||The government on Wednesday moved the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill which proposes the establishment of a national registry and registration authority for all clinics and medical professionals serving in the field.Moving the bill for consideration and passage in the Lok Sabha, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said it was tabled in Parliament in September, 2020, and the Lower House had referred it to a standing committee.Many suggestions came from the standing committee and the government considered them, he said.The standing committee’s report on the bill was submitted in March this year.The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020 seeks for the regulation and supervision of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and ART banks, prevention of misuse, safe and ethical practice of ART services and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto, be taken into consideration.“Many such ART clinics have been running in the country without regulation. A need was felt for regulation of such clinics as there are implications on health of those who undertake the procedure,” Mandaviya said.Initiating a debate on the bill, Congress’s Karti Chidambaram said this law is Victorian as it is not all encompassing.It excludes those who cannot afford this expensive procedure for a baby and the government should consider supporting poor, childless parents for taking ART’s help, Chidambaram said.He also suggested that the government consider including lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people (LGBTQ) in the bill’s ambit.BJP’s Heena Gavit said the bill seeks to set minimum standards and codes of conduct for fertility clinics and egg or sperm banks. It also proposes stringent punishment for those practising sex selection and sale of human embryos or gametes.She said about 80 per cent of ART clinics are not registered and the bill will ensure strict adherence to guidelines.“Ensuring confidentiality of commissioning couples, women and donors will also be done under the aegis of this proposal of the Cabinet. The bill also has a provision that those involved in trafficking and sale of embryos will be fined Rs 10 lakh at first instance and in second instance, the person can be imprisoned for up to 12 years,” she added.TMC MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar also mentioned scientist and pioneer of test tube babies, Subhash Mukherjee, who was recently recognised by the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal for his work four decades after his death.Speaking on the bill, Dastidar, herself a specialist in the field, said experts should be involved at every level to monitor the bill’s provisions.She also said “banks” under the bill should be abolished, unless they are associated with labs.YSRCP’s B Venkata Satyavathi said twhile she and her party supported the bill, there are only six IVF centres in government sector, while thousands exist in private sector.JD(U)’s Alok Kumar Suman contended that the cost of the procedure should be effectively monitored so that even the poor can can avail its services.BSP’s Sangeeta Azad and TMC’s Dastidar both raised the issue of exclusion of single parents and LGTBQ community from using this procedure. “They have a right to be parents too,” both said.Welcoming the bill, NCP’s Supriya Sule said that besides couples, there are a cross-section of people in this country who want to have a child, especially the LGBTQ community and single men.She said that because of adoption rules of 2017, single men cannot adopt a girl and that is why they can not avail this bill’s benefits.“This is something we, as a society, need to introspect... I think we should not deprive any human being who deserves or wants to have a child. Why do we not put all the bright minds together... and see how we can make sure that everybody can make use of all legislations we make,” Sule said.She also said there should not be any jail terms for doctors.BJD’s Anubhav Mohanty also said the bill discriminates against the LGBTQ community.He said the health minister should reconsider this bill and should not bring it in a hurry as there are some issues that need consideration.Mohanty also suggested setting up of a separate ministry for children.Supporting the bill, BJP’s Rita Bahuguna Joshi said stringent measures are necessary to streamline things.During the discussion, RSP’s N K Premachandran raise the point of order on an issue related to the bill which is dependent upon another bill.“Surrogacy bill is pending in the Upper House, that has not been passed. How can this House pass a law depending upon another law... My point is that this bill cannot be taken into consideration, this bill cannot be discussed,” he said.Responding to this, Mandaviya said that the surrogacy bill was passed in the Lok Sabha and now it is in the Rajya Sabha, and immediately after that “we brought this ART bill” and both the bills would now be taken up in the Upper House together.CPI(M) MP A M Ariff said the point of order raised by Premachandran should be considered as the clarification given by the minister was not sufficient.Premachandran added that there was a procedural irregularity in this bill and it was a “bad” legislative practice.“Suppose the Rajya Sabha does not pass the surrogacy bill, then what will be the fate of this bill,” he asked. Supporting the bill, he said, “something is better than nothing” but also suggested bringing in a comprehensive bill.

I’m happy to inform that my shows in Bangalore which were scheduled over the next 20 days have been cancelled. They’ve been cancelled for two reasons.“Firstly, we didn’t get special permission to seat 45 people in the venue that can seat more. Secondly, threats have been made to shut down the venue if I were to ever perform there. I guess this is also part of the Covid protocol & new guidelines. I suppose I am seen as a variant of the virus now,” the comedian said.Kamra said now his shows have also been cancelled after Faruqui, it proves that the “ruling class” is at least trying to “oppress with equality”.“For those on Twitter that have been wondering how ‘A Kamra goes on to perform while a Farooqui has had to quit comedy’ we can find solace in the fact that the ruling class is at least trying to oppress with equality.“Maybe if we continue down the road of equal oppression, we would get to a point of equal liberation, in a post climate change era,” he said.He further listed five steps to get a comedian’s show cancelled.“If they use this method & a show is not cancelled I’ll give up being a stand up comedian. Step no 1 - Inform police that there could be violence. Step no 2 - Inform venue owner there could be violence. Step no 3 - Inform artist that if he/she/they will be coming there will surely be violence. Step no 4 - Remind the venue of what could happen if the artist manages to do a show despite the threats.“Step no 5 - Be ready with celebration memes that show your victory and togetherness in missing the point. You can also apply this formula to an artist that you don’t agree with, you don’t find funny or don’t like their art...”Besides Kamra and Faruqui, comedian Vir Das also faced several complaints and online trolling for his ‘Two Indias’ monologue in the US recently.

01-12-2021||New Delhi||International passengers subject to random Covid sampling can leave airport after giving samples: MoCA||The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) on Wednesday said only two per cent of the passengers coming from countries that are not in the ‘at-risk’ list will be subject to random sampling for coronavirus and such passengers will be permitted to leave the airport after giving the samples.Amid mounting concerns over the new Covid variant Omicron, stricter norms for international passengers came into effect from Tuesday midnight and all passengers coming from ‘at-risk’ countries have to compulsorily undergo Covid test, among other requirements.Issuing a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), the ministry said that travellers undergoing random sampling may give the sample and be allowed to leave.“Now, the random sampling would be limited to 2 per cent as per latest MoHFW (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) guidelines and it would be on self-paid basis. Airlines/Airports may coordinate with the officials of State/UT governments to select the passenger at random sampling,” the ministry said in a release.There is also a question about travellers from countries, excluding those ‘at-risk’, transiting through the airports of countries ‘at-risk’ but staying within the airports.On whether such travellers can be exempted from post-arrival testing based on the self-declaration form, the ministry has provided a clarification.“Post-arrival testing can be exempted if a person is travelling from a not at-risk country and has only a transit (without leaving immigration) in at-risk country before taking the destination flight.“However, if the person has travelled to any at-risk country in last 14 days, he/she will be asked for post-arrival testing and other additional restrictions...,” the release said.On whether travellers who have submitted their sample for post-arrival COVID test at the point of arrival (self-paid) have to wait for their test results before leaving or taking a connecting flight, the ministry said, “after the negative results are received, the passengers can take connecting flights to reach their final destination”.Further, the ministry said a passenger can exit the airport or can take connecting flights for final destination once the negative report is received. “He/she need not wait for the report of all the co-passengers,” it added.The ministry said the FAQs are being issued for better understanding of the passengers and to enable them for safe, secure and hassle-free international air travel.“It may be noted that these steps are being taken to ensure the good health and safety of every citizen of the country so that the subsequent problems do not arise,” the release said.

01-12-2021||New Delhi||Bank unions threaten two-day nationwide strike against proposed privatisation of PSBs||The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions, has given a call for a two-day strike from December 16 to protest against the proposed privatisation of two state-owned lenders.In the Union Budget presented in February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the privatisation of two public sector banks (PSBs) as part of its disinvestment plan.The government has already privatised IDBI Bank by selling its majority stake in the lender to LIC in 2019 and merged 14 public sector banks in the past four years.The government has listed the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, for introduction and passage during the current session of Parliament.In view of this, UFBU has decided to oppose the move for privatisation, All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said in a statement.Strike notice for December 16 and December 17, 2021, has been served by UFBU on the IBA, he said.In a developing country like India, where banks deal with huge public savings and they have to play a leading role to ensure broad-based economic development, public sector banking with social orientation is the most appropriate and imperative need, he said.Hence, he said, for the past 25 years, under the banner of UFBU “we have been opposing the policies of banking reforms which are aimed at weakening public sector banks”.Members of UFBU include All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Confederation of India (BEFI).Others are Indian National Bank Employees Federation (INBEF), Indian National Bank Officers Congress (INBOC), National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO).

01-12-2021||New Delhi||UP lives in fear under BJP rule as it is a party of dictators: Bhupesh Baghel||Uttar Pradesh lives in fear under the BJP rule as it is a party of dictators where voices of dissent are stifled, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said on Wednesday.Baghel, who has been appointed senior observer for next year's Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, claimed that the BJP had not fulfilled any poll promise, and is trying to divert people's attention by making religious remarks.“Congress is the only party in UP which is fighting against the ruling BJP. Two other opposition parties, the SP (Samajwadi Party) and BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) both appear to be compromised in favour of the BJP,” he told PTI in an interview.Baghel said Uttar Pradesh Assembly election results would be very different from previous elections and might surprise poll pundits.“It is a fact that Uttar Pradesh lives in fear under the BJP rule. If I can express my opinion in just one sentence, Uttar Pradesh is being ruled by the party of dictators, where the voice of dissent is punished,” he said.The Chhattisgarh chief minister said the Centre's decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws is a "political move" and farmers have lost faith in the Narendra Modi government.“It is clearly visible that farmers have lost all their faith in the Modi government. Now, they don't trust the BJP anymore. The political damage is permanent. The decision to take the laws back cannot make the BJP a farmer-friendly party,” he said.“Of course, assembly elections in some crucial states, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, were in the minds of the BJP leadership. It took them 12 months to reach this point. They didn't have a choice,” he added.This farmers' agitation has proved that the roots of democracy are too deep for the BJP to understand, the senior Congress leader said.Baghel said it is a fact that the Congress is not in power in Uttar Pradesh for the past 32 years but many things have changed in the last two years after Priyanka Gandhi Vadra started working in the state as the party's general secretary in-charge.“She is working very hard to reboot the party organisation at the ground level and is fighting for the people's cause,” he said.Rejecting voices against changes in the Congress leadership from within the party, Baghel said his party believes in democracy and not in dictatorship like the saffron party.“As far as Rahulji's leadership is concerned, he is the only opposition leader fighting a political battle against Narendra Modi. He is fearless and selfless at the same time. From corona to lockdown to China to farmers' agitation, his political calculations and predictions have been proved absolutely correct,” he said.Baghel said Rahul Gandhi would be proved right in the case of "Rafale deal" too. “Just wait for the time,” he said.Baghel said the Congress party is up and active at the village level in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.“Our party cadre is now vocal at every level and working very hard. We had three major rallies in recent times, one in Varanasi which is the PM's constituency, second in Gorakhpur which is the home district of the UP CM, and third in Bundelkhand. All three have been organised by our party workers. Many are surprised by the crowd and enthusiasm at these meetings,” he said.

But when she received her vehicle’s plate number, she was subjected to mocking and bullying by  people around her.“The aunties of my neighbourhood are calling me shameless,” she told DailyO, adding that she is being bullied. Seeing her trouble, when her father requested the two-wheeler seller to change the number, the seller refused his request saying that a lot of people had received similar numbers.Currently, in Delhi, the identifiers in circulation have the first two letters ‘E’ and ‘X’ in them. Adding them to ‘S’ becomes ‘SEX.’ This also means that anyone if anyone received their two-wheeler plate number in Delhi unless the series is exhausted would end up with these letters.According to KK Dahiya, Commissioner of Delhi Transport, the allotted number could not be changed as there was no provision. “There is a set pattern that is followed during the process of generating a registered number,” Dahiya told India Today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-girl-is-being-bullied-and-called-shameless-for-riding-scooty-with-sex-on-number-plate-345096

The change will come into effect from Wednesday midnight, the officials said.According to a Delhi government statement, the city's diesel prices are already the "cheapest" in NCR at Rs 86.67 per litre while the rates of diesel in Noida and Gurgaon are Rs 87.01 and Rs 87.11 per litre, respectively.At a cabinet meeting chaired by the chief minister, it was decided the Value-Added Tax (VAT) on petrol will be reduced from the present 30 per cent to 19.4 per cent, leading to a cut of around Rs 8 per litre, government officials said."We made petrol quite cheaper in Delhi today. The VAT was reduced from 30 per cent to 19.4 per cent. Petrol and diesel have become cheaper in Delhi as compared to other NCR cities. I hope this step will give relief to the people of Delhi from price rise," Kejriwal said in a tweet.The petrol price in Delhi was higher as compared to the NCR cities in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, where the state governments had announced a VAT cut following the Centre's decision to reduce the excise duty on fuel prices. Kejriwal, chairing the cabinet meeting, expressed deep concern for the people of Delhi in the current situation and was of the view that the government needs to reduce prices at this juncture to support the public, the statement said.The Delhi government had "marginally" increased the VAT rate on petrol last year. Back then there was 27 per cent VAT on petrol in Delhi, which was increased to 30 per cent later, it said.The 10.58 per cent cut in VAT now will directly benefit the public by bringing down petrol price by Rs 8, it added.Delhi Goods Transport Organisation expressed disappointment over no VAT cut on diesel and urged the Chief Minister for providing relief to transporters."We strongly oppose this disappointing announcement by the Delhi government. We will have to run a campaign to ask commercial vehicles not to refill diesel in Delhi if no relief is provided to us," said Rajendra Kapoor, president of the Delhi Goods Transport Organisation. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petrol-to-be-cheaper-by-rs-8-per-litre-in-delhi-as-aap-govt-decides-to-cut-vat-sources-345088

Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said there was no question of revoking the suspension of the MPs since they showed no remorse for what they did inside the House.“This is not the parliamentary system …running to the well of the House, climbing on the table, throwing papers, snatching papers from the minister … doing everything that is unparliamentary and undemocratic … and they have no remorse,” Naidu said recalling what happened that day.The Opposition members, who were on their feet, paid no heed to the Chairman and continued with their protest.Naidu said important notices had been listed for Zero Hour. The members should pay attention, he said. But his appeal had no effect on the protesting MPs.Naidu then signalled an MP to read his zero member notice. But, noisy protest by the Opposition MPs made it difficult to carry on with the Zero Hour proceedings. Naidu then adjourned the House till noon.Earlier, members laid on the table of the House various papers, including reports of various departments-related standing committees.Jose K Mani, Kerala Congress leader, also took oath in the presence of the Chairman.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-adjourned-till-noon-amid-protest-by-opposition-345082

The veteran actress-politician makes some interesting revelations about Amitabh. She says that Amitabh Bachchan never picks up call. “Aap inko phone karo, kabhi phone uthate nahi hai (You call him, he never picks),” complains Jaya. In response to her, Amitabh replies, “Internet agar gadbad hai, hum kya karein bhai (If internet is not working, how is it my fault?)"A post shared by Sony Entertainment Television (@sonytvofficial)  Shweta is also seen taking Jaya’s side. Reminding him, she says, “Social media pe photo lagayenge, tweet karenge (He will share photos on social media, tweet from his account)." Soon, granddaughter Navya quizzes Amitabh Bachchan, “Jab hum parlour se aate hai aur nani ko aap bolte hai ki aap kitni acchi lag rahi hai, jhooth bol rahe hai hume ya actually me hum acche lag rahe hai (Whenever we come from beauty parlour, you tell Nani (Jaya) that she is looking good.

Parents of the girl agreed not to marry her till she attains the age of 18,” Sanakhemundi Tahasildar, Srinibash Behera said on Tuesday.The district administration has prevented a dozen child-marriage attempts in the district in November and 199 so far this year. Last year, the administration had scuttled 228 child marriage attempts in the district, official sources said.According to the National Family Health Survey 2020-21, Ganjam district has 22.3 per cent of women aged 20-24 years who were married before 18 years of age, down from 29.8 per cent in 2015-16. It has reduced to 20.5 per cent in Odisha from 21.3 in 2015-16.Ironically, the recent incident comes despite the administration declaring 2,042 out of 3,250 villages, 266 out of 286 wards and 221 out of 503 panchayats as child-marriage free in the district.“More such cases are being reported from different areas because people have become aware of the marriageable age of girls and ill-impact of the child marriage,” Action Aid district coordinator Debabratt Mahunt said.The administration gives a cash reward of Rs 10,000 to the informer about impending child marriage and has made mandatory verification of Aadhaar card of both the bride and the groom by an anganwadi worker.It also has a policy of taking action against priests who solemnise child marriage.Under an initiative, awareness programmes are held in villages, where anganwadi workers and accredited social health activists educate adolescent girls against child marriage on the third Saturday of every month.

These have been deployed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh.These are an advanced version of the Heron procured from Israel. Last winter, the Indian Navy had leased high performance ‘Predator’ drones from the US and these were used extensively.The existing version of the Heron drones with the Army was without satellite communication and allowed only line of sight communication. This restricted operations in mountains of Ladakh. The drone could fly to a maximum 28,000 feet, couldn't operate in winter and its effective vision was limited to 7-8 km.Also, the Army had to fly two drones in tandem, one that ‘looked across’ and the other to act as relay for communication to ground controller. Satellite communication drones remove such bottlenecks. The new version is all- weather capable and flies up to an altitude of 45,000 feet. The new drones perform a variety of missions, including intelligence gathering, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-heron-drones-deployed-along-lac-344836

Repair and overhaul of weapons, vehicles and equipment of the Army is done at Army base workshops.The CAG also pointed out “lack of planning in the implementation of dress allowance” for jawans.

The Centre’s review came ahead of international travel guidelines taking effect from midnight today. So far, 14 countries have reported Omicron since its detection in South Africa on November 25.Member, Health, NITI Aayog, VK Paul, meanwhile, asked states and UTs to ensure masking, distancing, hand hygiene and avoidance of large gatherings, besides testing.

However, the drastic effects of last year’s country-wide lockdown continue to cast a shadow. The GDP is yet to claw back to the growth recorded in the first half of 2019-20, which was Rs 71.20 lakh crore or Rs 3 lakh crore higher than the economic performance two years later, according to the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO).The GDP details suggest that private consumption, especially the household sector, continued to grow slower than expected but investments grew at a slightly higher pace.While farm, construction and public administration and defence services (PADS) grew at a faster clip, the weak performance by the manufacturing sector acted as a drag on growth.“The broad story remains intact. We believe that real GDP growth could be 5-5.5 per cent in the second half, implying full year of about 9 per cent or 1 per cent higher than in the previous fiscal,” said Nikhil Gupta, Chief Economist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Looking ahead, high commodity prices and global supply bottlenecks would pose a challenge while the new Covid variant has infused uncertainty in the system. “If this uncertainty lingers or aggravates, it would have repercussions on the economic growth,” cautioned Rajani Sinha of Knight Frank India. — TNSBright spots||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gdp-expands-at-8-4-growth-picks-up-pace-344833

For raising people’s voices in Parl? No way. Rahul Gandhi, Cong‘Accept your mistake’Everyone can make a mistake. Wisdom lies in accepting and regretting it. We all want our friends to return to the House. Piyush Goyal, Leader of Rajya SabhaThe government said it could retract its steps if the erring MPs apologised for their “unprecedented misconduct on August 11, 2020, the last day of the monsoon session”. Both sides dug in heels with the Opposition rejecting the government’s proposal and Rahul Gandhi asking: “Apologise for what, for raising people’s voices in Parliament? No way.” Sixteen Opposition parties jointly strategised on the issue at the Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge’s chamber this morning and walked out together. The TMC skipped the meeting, boycotting RS and protesting outside Parliament on its own.TMC’s Derek O Brien later also announced that the suspended MPs would start a sit-in at Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Parliament from tomorrow onwards.In the RS, a visibly agitated Naidu said members who committed sacrilege against the House on August 11 had not expressed any remorse. “On the other hand, they are justifying it. I don’t think the appeal of the Leader of Opposition is worth considering. I am not considering it at all,” Naidu said, dismissing Kharge’s points of order—that the chair did not name MPs before suspending them, though rules mandate this, and that actions pertaining to MPs’ conduct in a session the President had prorogued couldn’t taken in the current session. Naidu called the RS a continuing House in defence of the government motion of suspension, which RS passed yesterday. Kharge, however, again challenged the Chairman through a late-night letter, which said, “The argument of continuity would have held had the President not prorogued the House on August 31 and the House had only been adjourned without prorogation.”The government defended the suspensions after the Opposition said the MPs had not been heard. “It was the Opposition that refused to join the committee we had was proposed to go into the issue,” leader of Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal said as acrimony persisted all day. Naidu asked the Opposition not to sermonise him on democracy.“You disturbed the House, ransacked the table, threw papers on the chair, some MPs stepped on the table and you are giving me lessons now. Everyone was named on August 10,” Naidu said to Kharge, who claimed one of the suspended MPs had not been named by the chair in the last session.Goyal later recounted “unprecedented misconduct of MPs on August 11 with one of them attempting to pull out an LED screen in the chamber” and argued that preserving the dignity of the House had become obligatory, and hence the motion of suspension. The government, however, urged MPs to apologise with Goyal noting, “Everyone can make a mistake. Wisdom lies in accepting and regretting it. We all want our friends to return to the House.” The government also suspended all business until tomorrow noting that the Opposition boycott was only for a day. There was no sign of thaw in the matter though as Kharge shot off a late-evening letter to Naidu asking for revocation of suspensions in “larger interest of democracy.” The Opposition said it would strategise its next move tomorrow.Oppn’s argumentGovt’s retort||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-stages-walkout-as-m-venkaiah-naidu-refuses-to-revoke-suspensions-344832
