04-12-2021||---||Sexual harassment at workplace: Don’t turn process into punishment, says SC||New Delhi, December 4The Supreme Court has asked courts not to resort to hyper-technical interpretation of service rules and regulations on prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace, saying the “transformative legislation” may not come to the aid of victims if the appellate mechanisms turn the process into a punishment."It is important that courts uphold the spirit of the right against sexual harassment, which is vested in all persons as a part of their right to life and right to dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. It is also important to be mindful of the power dynamics that are mired in sexual harassment at the workplace," a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said on Friday.Deciding a case under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013, the Bench – which also included Justice AS Bopanna – said courts should interpret service rules and statutory regulations on sexual harassment at the workplace in a manner that metes out procedural and substantive justice.Disapproving of the rising trend of invalidating proceedings inquiring into sexual misconduct by resorting to hyper-technical interpretation of service rules, the Bench said, “We implore courts to interpret service rules and statutory regulations governing the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace in a manner that metes out procedural and substantive justice to all the parties.”Upholding the charges of sodomy against an officer of the Border Security Force (BSF) and the punishment of forfeiture of five years services for the purpose of promotion and seven years of service for the purpose of pension, the top court reversed the order of the Calcutta High Court. The HC had set aside the BSF DG’s order on hyper-technical grounds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sexual-harassment-at-workplace-dont-turn-process-into-punishment-says-sc-346299

04-12-2021||New Delhi||New Delhi administration issues notices to Air India, Mahan Air for violation of Covid guidelines||The New Delhi district administration has issued show-cause notices to Air India and a private airline from Iran for alleged violation of passenger boarding guidelines issued by the Centre following the emergence of the coronavirus variant Omicron, officials said on Saturday.They said three passengers—one each in Air India flights from Dubai and Amritsar and the third travelling in a Mahan Air flight from Tehran—were allowed boarding without filing up their personal details.No response was available from the two airliners to queries by PTI.The Vasant Vihar subdivisional magistrate under New Delhi district has asked station managers of the airlines to respond to the show-cause notices within 24 hours.Earlier, the New Delhi district authorities had issued a notice to American Airlines for alleged non-compliance with the guidelines for international arrivals.According to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on November 30, airlines are directed to allow boarding to only those international passengers who have filled up their personal details on Air Suvidha portal and uploaded negative RT-PCR test report.A passenger in Mahan Air flight from Tehran that landed at Delhi’s IGI Airport on Friday evening was allowed boarding despite not filling up personal details form, stated the notice.Similarly, two passengers from Air India’s Dubai and Amritsar flights that landed here on Saturday early morning had not submitted their personal details.The notices stated that not furnishing replies by the concerned airlines officials within 24 hours will be taken up seriously and it would be presumed that they have nothing to say in the matter.Action as deemed fit shall be initiated as per relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005; Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws, in case of non-compliance, it stated.According to the Centre, the countries designated as “at-risk” are European countries, including the UK, and South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.Travellers from these “at-risk” countries are following additional measures on arrival in India from Tuesday midnight.Under the new norms, RT-PCR tests are mandatory for passengers arriving from “at-risk” countries, and they will be allowed to leave the airport only after the results come. Also, two per cent of passengers arriving on all flights from other countries will be subjected to the test randomly. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-delhi-administration-issues-notices-to-air-india-mahan-air-for-violation-of-covid-guidelines-346293
04-12-2021||Kolkata||TMC bins Shiv Sena’s editorial piece, says party will continue work to build opposition front||The Trinamool Congress leadership on Saturday declined to attach much importance to Shiv Sena’s remarks on the party’s effort to build an opposition alliance, one parallel to the UPA, and said that it would continue to cobble up an alternative front as the Congress “failed to lead the fight” against the BJP.In a snub to TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, whose party is currently engaged in a tussle with the Congress, the Shiv Sena on Saturday said keeping the grand old party away from national politics while creating an opposition alliance parallel to the UPA is akin to strengthening the ruling BJP and other “fascist” forces.In an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the Sena also said that those who don’t want a Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) should make their stand clear publicly instead of creating confusion by talking behind curtains.“The Shiv Sena is free to have its opinion. But let’s not talk about what is right and wrong. The Shiv Sena itself was part of BJP-led NDA. It left the NDA after a fracas over the chief minister’s post in Maharashtra. It joined hands with the NCP and the Congress for CM’s chair,” TMC Member of Parliament Sougata Roy said.He stated that the party would continue to increase its strength and venture out to other states.“The TMC only wants opposition unity to be strengthened. We have never said that an opposition alliance will be forged without Congress. But if Congress can’t perform its duty, we have nothing to do. They can’t blame us for their incompetence. If one fails, then someone else has to fill the vacuum,” he said.Echoing him, TMC’s state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said Shiv Sena’s comment is out of its “alliance compulsion” in Maharashtra.“We don’t want any misunderstanding with the Shiv Sena. It is running a government in Maharashtra with the support of Congress. So they have some compulsions, and these statements have been made out of that compulsion. We are cobbling up an opposition front as the Congress has failed to do so,” he underlined.Reacting to TMC’s remarks, veteran Congress leader and MP Pradip Bhattacharya said the activities and statements of the TMC are only going to help the BJP.“It seems the TMC is more interested in fighting the Congress than the BJP. The TMC is doing everything to break opposition unity and, in turn, helping the BJP in its political interests,” he said.The TMC has been up in arms over the Congress’ alleged failure to fight against the BJP.Banerjee during her recent visit to Mumbai had said that “UPA doesn’t exist”.Her camp termed the Congress an “incapable and incompetent” party that has gone into a “deep freezer”.The relationship had soured after TMC mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’ claimed that Banerjee, and not Rahul Gandhi, has emerged as the face of the opposition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Last week, the ruling camp in Bengal had said it is “disinterested” in coordinating with the Congress during the winter session of Parliament, but maintained that it would cooperate with other opposition parties on various issues concerning people’s interest. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-bins-shiv-senas-editorial-piece-says-party-will-continue-work-to-build-opposition-front-346292

04-12-2021||Ravi S Singh||A pictorial tribute to 9th Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 4A pictorial exhibition on life and martyrdom of the 9th Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, held in Gurdwara Bangla Sahib here on Saturday, was thronged by devotees of all ages.The exhibition, however, was a wholesome montage of more than 40 pictorial frames depicting the celebrated moments in the lives of all the Sikh Gurus.While some of the frames were purely edifying, loaded with mystical frisson of spiritual excitement for some of the apparently spell-bound devotees, the others were a lesson in the religion-spiritual historicity of Sikhism.A painting of Bhai Jaita, who was later lionised as Baba Jiwan Singh, reverently carrying the severed head of martyred Guru( Tegh Bahadur) from Delhi to Anandpur (Punjab) to be handed over to the latter’s son, Guru Gobind Singh, for conduct of obsequies, apparently touched the deep chord among the visitors.Bhai Jaita, a Sikh general, who hailed from a low caste, was an associate of Guru Gobind Singh.The recorded history says that Bhai Jaita, who helplessly witnessed the beheading of Tegh Bahadur, demonstrated exemplary courage in whisking away the severed head.Another painting depicting the severance of the Guru’s head by a henchman of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb had one inset of the head and the torso, which is in a sitting posture, on a cot. Another inset showed two other Sikh associates of the Guru being tortured in captivity by Mughals.The painting had another inset showing a courtier informing Aurangzeb of the execution (beheading) of the Guru.Guru Tegh Bahadur was executed on the order of Aurangzeb for defending his faith and championing the cause of others.Also, a painting depicting Guru Nanak’s visit to Mecca in blue robe and in another him reclining with his feet towards Kabba and the legend related to it, were also of mega attraction.One Sikh legend has it that when the Kazi objected to Guru Nanak’s feet pointing towards Kabba, the latter asked him to turn his feet to some other side where there was no Kaaba. When the Kazi moved the feet, Kabba started revolving in synchrony with the direction of the feet moved.Besides, a painting of Nanak offering “aarti” (prayer ritual) at the Lord Jagganath temple in Odisha was also cynosure to all eyes.The exhibition was organised by the Bhai Vir Singh Sahitya Sadan with the support of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/a-pictorial-tribute-to-8th-sikh-guru-tegh-bahadur-346280

The concerned students/individuals are firmly advised to cancel the proposed programme immediately failing which a strict disciplinary action as per the university rules may be initiated against those responsible for this event. The students are also instructed not to get provoked by this pamphlet, which is unauthorised and unwarranted,” the circular read.‘Ram Ke Naam’, a 1992 documentary by filmmaker Anand Patwardhan, explores the campaign to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya.JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, in a Facebook post, said they have scheduled a screening of ‘Ram Ke Naam’ at the union hall.“So the puppet body of this RSS-BJP has come out with a circular that this documentary screening is unauthorised and might disturb the communal harmony. ‘Ram Ke Naam’ shows the truth, what is BJP doing in this country and how communal hatred is spread in this secular country by the right-wing fundamentalists,” she alleged.“The JNUSU will not back out at any cost. This screening will happen and we request JNU student community to participate in huge numbers at 9 pm for watching this documentary,” she said.JNUSU vice president Saket Moon said the administration cannot decide what the students will watch.“December 6 will be the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition. We decided to hold the screening of the documentary. The university administration cannot decide what students will watch. The documentary is in the public domain, freely available on Youtube and has also won awards,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jnu-administration-advises-students-union-to-cancel-unauthorised-screening-of-ram-ke-naam-346269

Districts of concern in the week ending December 2 are Thiruvananthapuram (5,541), Ernakulam, (4,976), Kozhikode (3,676), Thrissur (2,903) and Kottayam (2,478),” Bhushan noted.Four districts—Thiruvananthapuram (11.61 per cent), Wayanad (11.25 per cent), Kozhikode (11 per cent) and Kottayam (10.81 per cent) -- are showing high weekly positivity of more than 10 per cent, while nine districts are reporting weekly positivity between 5-10 per cent.“Kerala has reported a slight increase in weekly new deaths to 2,118 deaths (week ending December 3) from 1,890 deaths (week ending November 26). Four districts—Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kollam—are reporting high quantum of weekly new deaths in the state,” he highlighted.As for Jammu and Kashmir, Bhushan said, it has reported 4,806 new cases in the month ending December 3, with a few districts such as Kathua, Jammu, Ganderbal and Baramulla showing an increase in the previous week.Tamil Nadu has reported 23,764 new cases during the same period. Vellore, Thiruvallur and Chennai showed an increase in weekly new cases in the past week.As far as Odisha is concerned, Bhushan pointed out that the state has reported 7,445 new cases during the same period, with a contribution of 2.5 per cent to India’s new cases from over the past month.“It is important to note that Khordha district in the state is reporting a high quantum of weekly new cases with 900 new cases reported in the week ending December 3. Further, six out of 30 districts ---Dhenkanal, Kandhamal, Nabarangpur, Kendujhar, Anugul and Balangir—reported an increase in the weekly caseload as compared to the week ending November 26,” he said in the letter addressed to the Additional Chief Secretary (Health), Odisha.Further, the state exhibited a decline of 3.1 per cent in weekly tests conducted, from 4,01,164 tests in the week ending November 26 to 3,88,788 tests in the week ending December 3, with -36 per cent RT-PCR share, the Union health secretary highlighted.Mizoram has reported 12,562 new cases in the month ending December 4, with a contribution of 4.1 per cent to India’s new cases from over the past month.It is important to note that Aizawl district is reporting a high quantum of weekly new cases with 1,079 new cases reported in the week ending December 3.Further, four out of 11 districts—Saiha, Khawzawl, Serchhip, Mamit -- reported an increase in the week ending December 3, as compared to the week ending November 26.Also, eight out of 11 districts are showcasing high weekly positivity of more than 10 per cent, Bhushan said in his letter.“In this context, required necessary steps to control the spread of infection and reduce fatality need to be taken as per the ongoing strategy of Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate-Covid Appropriate Behaviour to keep the situation under control,” he underlined.The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will continue to provide requisite support to states/UTs in the ongoing and collective efforts against COVID-19, he added.

04-12-2021||---||Explore arbitration, mediation and conciliation before moving courts, CJI tells litigants||New Delhi, December 4As pendency of cases continues to rise, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Saturday advised litigants, particularly businessmen, to treat litigation as the last resort—only after exploring alternate dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms such as arbitration, mediation and conciliation to resolve their disputes.“My advice, after participating in the legal profession for over 40 years in different capacities, is that you must keep the option of going to Courts as a last resort. Use this last resort only after exploring the option of ADR- arbitration, mediation and conciliation. Arbitration and mediation are efforts at restoring a relationship,” the CJI said while addressing the ‘Stakeholders’ Conclave’ at the International Arbitration and Mediation Centre, Hyderabad.Citing various reasons for opting for mediation or arbitration over traditional litigation, he said there were several benefits of ADR—fewer delays, less expensive, greater party choice, more control, more comfortable and amicable environment for the parties.Justice Ramana wondered if anyone could even imagine a world without conflicts. “A prudent person tries to find ways to resolve the same amicably. Conflicts have a human face and it helps to be humane in our approach to resolve the same. One must have the foresight to look beyond the conflict,” the CJI noted.Citing an example from the Mahabharata, Justice Ramana said Lord Krishna had attempted to mediate the dispute between the Pandavas and Kauravas and the failure of mediation led to disastrous consequences.“But in a business, you cannot lose money, honour or your reputation. You cannot sacrifice the interests of business or industry. In such a situation also, you can think of an easy way of settling disputes without wasting much time or money, or losing your peace of mind. You can find a better way for further growth and improvement,” he said, advising businessmen to use the ADR mechanism before rushing to courts.Despite the presence of some arbitration centres in the country, Indian parties entering into an international arbitration agreement often opt for an arbitration centre outside India incurring huge expenses, the CJI said.“The setting up of this International Arbitration and Mediation Centre in Hyderabad will change this trend in India. This Centre is being established with the best infrastructure and the empanelling of internationally acclaimed arbitrators and mediators”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/explore-mediation-courts-should-be-last-resort-for-dispute-resolution-cji-ramana-346258
04-12-2021||New Delhi||Venkaiah Naidu calls for debate on freebies; says Parliament must sit for 100 days in a year||Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday called for a wider debate on freebies for harmonising welfare obligations with developmental needs and urged the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament to examine this aspect to enable wider discussion.Underlining that Parliament should meet for a minimum of 100 days and state legislatures for at least 90 days every year, Naidu said that there should be a political consensus on this issue.Naidu was speaking at an event in the Central Hall of Parliament to mark 100 years of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that was also attended by President Ram Nath Kovind, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and the committee chairman and Congress leader of Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.Noting that the PAC examines public expenditure to find out irregularities, Kovind said the parliamentary committee not only looks at it from the legal perspective but also from the “point of view of the economy, prudence, wisdom and propriety”.“It (PAC) has no other objective but to bring to notice cases of waste, loss, corruption, extravagance, inefficiency. If more paise out of every rupee coming from honest taxpayers are reaching those in need and also for nation-building initiatives, the PAC and its members have played a large role in the process,” Kovind said.Stating that the main responsibility of democratic institutions is to make the government accountable and transparent to the people, Lok Sabha Speaker Birla noted that the parliamentary committees have contributed significantly in making this possible through their functions.The parliamentary committees, which are like mini Parliament, are also seen as effective platforms to solve the problems of the people and fulfillment of their expectations, Birla said.In his address, Naidu suggested that the PAC examine the utilisation of resources from a socio-economic perspective to check wastages and called for a wider debate on doling out freebies.“We are all alive to the present scenario of the governments indulging in doling out freebies for obvious reasons. While ensuring the welfare and social security of the needy people is an important obligation of the governments, it is time that there is a wider debate on harmonising the welfare and development objectives.“Since PAC has to examine the effectiveness of resource use in terms of socio-economic outcomes, it may be in order for the Committee to examine the issue,” the Rajya Sabha chairman said.PAC chairman Chowdhury said it is the function of the committee to ascertain that the money granted by Parliament has been spent by the government “within the scope of the demand”.“Over the decades, the examination of accounts by the PAC accomplishes the aim of enforcing public accountability in the transactions of government business. And in this manner, the committee contributes towards maintaining the standard of efficiency and financial propriety in the running of the administration,” the Congress leader said.Pointing to the scope of wasteful expenditure and misutilisation of scarce resources, Naidu recalled former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi saying about 35 years back that out of every rupee spent, only 16 paise went to the people.Noting that the audit review is a core function of PAC, Naidu also suggested that it may be re-designated as Public Accounts and Audit Committee (PA and AC).Naidu also expressed his anguish over members not attending the parliamentary committee meetings and said that parliament should function for 100 days and state legislative assemblies for 90 days every year.There should be a political consensus on this, he said.

04-12-2021||New Delhi||KVIC rolls out project in Assam to prevent elephant-human conflict||Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has launched a project aimed at reducing elephant-human conflict using bees in Assam, nine months after it was initiated in Karnataka.Under the Project RE-HAB (Reducing Elephant-Human Attacks using Bees), fences are created by setting up bee boxes on the passageways of elephants to block their entrance to human territories.The boxes are connected with a string so that when elephants attempt to pass through, a tug or pull causes the bees to swarm the elephant herds and dissuade them from progressing further, KVIC said. It was first launched in Karnataka in March this year.The project was launched by KVIC chairman V K Saxena on Friday in Mornoi village in Goalpara district of Assam which severely grapples with elephant-human conflicts.Saxena said the project would prove to be a sustainable solution to the human-elephant conflicts that are very common in Assam.“Project RE-HAB has been a great success in Karnataka, so it has been launched in Assam with greater efficiency and better technical knowhow. I am hopeful that the project would contain elephant attacks in the coming months and bring the local villagers back to their farms. At the same time, the bee boxes distributed by KVIC to these farmers will add to their income through beekeeping,” Saxena said.The project has been implemented in Assam with the support of the local forest department, KVIC said.“Surrounded by dense forests, a large part of Assam is infested by elephants with 332 human deaths reported between 2014 and 2019 due to elephant attacks,” the Commission said in a statement.It said the project is a cost-effective way of reducing human-wildlife conflicts without causing any harm to the animals.“It is scientifically recorded that elephants are annoyed by honey bees. Elephants also fear that the bee swarms can bite their sensitive inner side of the trunk and eyes. The collective buzz of the bees is annoying to elephants that force them to return,” it said.A total of 330 interspersed bee boxes will be placed at Mornoi and Dahikata villages in Assam in a week’s time to ward off elephants, KVIC said.“These bee boxes have been given to 33 farmers and educated youths of these villages by KVIC whose families have affected by elephants. Crop-raiding by elephants in these villages are reported almost every day for 9 to 10 months a year,” it said.It said that the elephant menace there is so severe that villagers, over the last few years, had stopped cultivating their farms fearing elephant attacks.“These villages have abundant production of paddy, litchi and jackfruit that attract elephants. High resolution, night-vision cameras have been installed at strategic points to record the impact of bees on elephants and their behaviour in these zones,” it said.Project RE-HAB is a sub-mission of KVIC’s National Honey Mission.While the honey mission is a programme to increase the bee population, honey production and beekeepers’ income by setting up apiaries, Project RE-HAB uses bee boxes as a fence to prevent elephant attacks.Project RE-HAB was launched at 11 locations in Kodagu district of Karnataka on March 15, 2021.In just six months, this project has reduced elephant attacks by over 70 per cent, KVIC said.Sharing data, KVIC said that nearly 500 people die every year due to elephant attacks in India.“From 2015 to 2020, nearly 2,500 people have lost their lives in elephant attacks. On the contrary, nearly one-fifth of this number, i.e. nearly 500 elephants have also died in retaliation by humans in the last five years,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kvic-rolls-out-project-in-assam-to-prevent-elephant-human-conflict-346242
04-12-2021||New Delhi||1 in 3 Indians continue to refrain from carrying masks when stepping out: Survey||Mask compliance continues to remain at its lowest in India despite concerns over detection of Omicron variant in the country, with only 2 per cent of surveyed citizens saying that people in their area, city or district are complying well with mask-wearing norms.According to a latest survey conducted by digital community based platform LocalCircles, one in three Indians say most people in their area are not even carrying masks when stepping out of their houses.The survey, conducted in April, received more than 25,000 responses from citizens residing in 364 districts of India.It also said that 29 per cent of citizens rated mask compliance as high. This percentage dropped to 12 per cent in September, and dropped drastically to only 2 per cent in November.The need of the hour is to educate the public on the effectiveness of masks as two in three Indians are still wearing cloth masks that provide limited protection from Covid-19. “It is critical that the central government, state governments and district administrations introduce all possible mechanisms to create awareness about mask compliance in light of the Omicron variant and enforce necessary penalties to drive this compliance," Sachin Taparia, founder, LocalCircles said.If two individuals in an indoor space are not wearing a mask, in just 10 minutes, the infected person can transmit the virus to the other person, while if both are wearing a fitted N-95 mask, it requires over 600 hours of exposure for transmission, he said.The Omicron variant, which has scientists and epidemiologists from around the world raising red flags, was categorised as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation earlier this week after it was identified in three countries.Within a week, Omicron has been detected in over 40 countries around the world, with India reporting its first two cases in Karnataka.

04-12-2021||Dehradun||We believe in empowering people, not in using any section as vote bank: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted development projects worth more than Rs 18,000 crore to poll-bound Uttarakhand on Saturday and said his government believes in the development of all and not in serving a particular community, caste or religion and using them as a “vote bank”.The prime minister alleged that the ten years of rule by the Congress-led UPA were a “waste” for Uttarakhand and the country, and said his government is making up for the lost time by doubling the speed of infrastructure and connectivity projects.“We bring development projects for the benefit of all, irrespective of their caste or religion. We don’t believe in using a particular community,  caste or religion as a vote bank. We work for the empowerment of all,” Modi said kickstarting the BJP’s campaign for 2022 assembly polls with a  a rally at the Parade Ground here.He addressed the public meeting after the inauguration and foundation laying of 18 projects worth Rs 18,301 crore including the Rs 8,600-crore Delhi-Dehradun economic corridor, Asia’s biggest elevated wildlife corridor and a new bridge as an alternative to Rishikesh’s iconic Lakshman Jhoola. Terming vote bank politics as one of the perversities that have entered the country’s polity, Modi said that unlike other parties that believe in keeping people weak so that their dependence on them never ends and their “crown” remains intact, the BJP believes in empowering them and making them independent.He alleged that efforts launched in the field of connectivity and infrastructure development by the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the beginning of the century came to a halt during the ten years of UPA.“The government that succeeded saw only scams in the name of infrastructure projects. Those ten years went waste for Uttarakhand as well as the rest of the country. We are making up for the lost time by doubling the speed of infrastructure and connectivity projects,” Modi said.“A connectivity “Mahayagya is underway across the country at present to make up for the lost time. Today’s inauguration and foundation laying programme here is part of that Mahayagya,” he said.Modi who began his speech in Garhwali said these projects will help make this a decade of Uttarakhand.“I had said from the sacred land of Kedarpuri that this decade belongs to Uttarakhand and I repeat it again. These projects will help Uttarakhand achieve that goal,” he said.Terming the projects as unprecedented work in the field of infrastructure development in Uttarakhand, he said the development of the hills state is the “double engine” government’s topmost priority.“Those who question what the double engine government has done should come and see for themselves how the double engine government works... the projects cover all sectors, be it health, infrastructure, religious tourism, medicinal herbs,” the prime minister said.Drawing a comparison, he said the UPA built only 288 km of national highways in Uttarakhand in seven years from 2007-2014 while the BJP government at the Centre had built 2000 km of national highways in the state in the 7.5 years.“They spent Rs 600 crore in seven years on the construction of national highways in Uttarakhand while we spent more than Rs 12,000 crore during the last seven to seven and a half years, “ he said.     He said the Centre had sanctioned projects worth over Rs one lakh crore for Uttarakhand over the last five years and the state government is working on a war footing to implement them as fast as possible. “Don’t you think we have worked? Don’t you think these projects are going to change your lives and the coming generations?” Modi asked in his characteristic style to loud cheers from the audience at the ground filled to capacity.   He also spoke about building hundreds of kilometres of border roads in Uttarakhand besides implementing OROP, acquiring state-of-the-art defence equipment and “teaching a lesson to terrorists”, saying the people of Uttarakhand all of whom have their kin in the armed forces can understand the importance of these measures better than anyone.   Modi, who also laid the foundation stone of redevelopment projects in Badrinath which are part of its master plan, said the reconstruction work carried out in Kedarnath had led to a record number of footfalls at the Himalayan temple with more than ten lakh pilgrims visiting it before the Corona pandemic struck.“Those who are falling apart throughout the country cannot build Uttarakhand,” Modi said targeting his political adversaries without naming any political party.The double engine government will continue to serve the people of Uttarakhand following its motto of empowering common people and giving them an opportunity to lead a life of dignity as it is doing in every nook and corner of the country,” he said.He said the state has a young leader in Pushkar Singh Dhami besides many experienced senior leaders committed to work for its development.   Striking an emotional chord, Modi recited a poem he had written in praise of Uttarakhand a few years back to conclude his address.“Jahan pawan bahe sankalp liye, jahan parvat garva sikhate hain; jahan unche-neeche sab raste bas bhakti ke sur mein gate hain; us Devbhomi ke dhyan se hi main sada dhanya ho jata hoon; ye bhagya mera saubhagya mera main tumko sheesh nawata hoon ( Where even the winds blow with resolve, where the mountains teach us pride, where roads high and low all sing the songs of devotion; the mere thought of that divine land makes me feel blessed and bow my head to it).

This feat till now was only known to be done by Israel and the US but India also now is in that list."We want peace with everyone... the security of our borders is our top priority and we have given a definite and loud message in this context.""Due to this, India now has a different acceptance in the world," he said.

04-12-2021||Kolkata/Puri/Visakhapatnam||Odisha, Andhra breathe easy as Cyclone Jawad weakens into deep depression||The governments of Andhra and Odisha breathed easy after Cyclone Jawad weakened significantly on Saturday, even though heavy rain pelted both states as well as West Bengal.  The Indian Meteorological Department predicted further weakening.The cyclonic storm weakened into a deep depression and lay centered over west-central Bay of Bengal, about 180 km east-southeast of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, and 330 km south-southwest of Puri, Odisha at 5:30 pm, the Met office said in a statement."It is likely to move north-northeastwards and weaken further into a depression by tomorrow morning. It is likely to reach near Puri around tomorrow noon. Subsequently, it is likely to continue to move north-northeastwards along the coast of Odisha towards the coast of West Bengal and weaken into a well marked low pressure area during the subsequent 24 hours," it said.Saudi Arabia has given the cyclone its name 'Jawad' -- the liberal or merciful.A low-pressure area had developed over the Andaman Sea on November 30.It intensified into a depression on December 2 and further into a deep depression on Friday morning. It turned into a cyclone on Friday noon, the IMD said.The IMD has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Gangetic West Bengal and north Odisha on Sunday, and heavy rainfall at isolated places over Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura on Sunday and Monday.Sea conditions will remain unsafe for shipping and fishermen in the central and north Bay of Bengal till Sunday.The news that the cyclonic storm ‘Jawad’ had weakened significantly came as a relief for Odisha, a state already battered by two cyclones—‘Gulab’ and ‘Yaas’—in the last year.The entire coastal region of Odisha has been experiencing rainfall since Friday night. Paradip recorded the maximum downpour at 68 mm followed by Bhubaneswar (10.4) mm in the last 12 hours, the met office said.IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said the state government had asked district officials to evacuate people living in vulnerable houses and low-lying areas of Ganjam, Khurda, Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara and Niali area of Cuttack district from Saturday.However, there will be no blanket evacuation as the expected wind speed is low in comparison to other cyclones, he said.Jena said nearly 22,700 fishing boats have already returned from the sea and the Chilika lake.“We have also asked the district collectors to shelter fishing boats from Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, which are unable to return to their destination within the stipulated time,” the SRC said, adding, fishermen have been advised not to venture into the sea till December 5.  Andhra Pradesh's government said a teenager was killed as heavy rain lashed Andhra’s Srikakulam district on Saturday. Over 60 relief centres have been opened to lodge people from vulnerable areas, the state government said.Though the weather remained overcast, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts did not experience much rain, data provided by the state government said.Srikakulam district, however, received a downpour of over 11 cm, with the Tekkali revenue division recording the maximum of up to 5.7 cm at isolated places.In Vajrapukothuru mandal, heavy winds uprooted a coconut tree that fell on a teenager Gorakala Indu (16), killing him instantly.State Fisheries Minister Sidiri Appala Raju, who hails from the district, visited the victim's family in the Palasa hospital and promised all help. The Srikakulam district administration opened 65 relief centres where a few hundred people from vulnerable areas were lodged. The Fisheries Minister visited relief camps in Palasa town and later oversaw the sanitation works. District Collector L Srikesh Balaji visited Santabommali mandal and inspected the relief camps and the food being provided to the accommodated persons. He asked them to be cautious and stay indoors till the storm subsided. The South Central Railway cancelled more than 60 Express trains on the east coast route on Saturday and Sunday in view of the cyclonic storm. The West Bengal government evacuated thousands of people in South 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur districts and urged tourists in popular sea resorts to stay away from beaches.The administration in South 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur districts evacuated around 11,000 people from the coastal areas to safer locations, while boats with fishermen returned in Kakdwip, Digha, Shankarpur and other coastal belts, an official said.“The system is likely to move north-northwestwards and reach west-central Bay of Bengal and thereafter is likely to recurve north-northeastwards, move along Odisha coast reaching near Puri around December 5 noon, and weaken gradually,” a met office spokesman said.Rescue teams were seen asking scattered groups of tourists and locals to vacate beaches in Digha, Shankarpur, Tajpur and Bakkhali. A total of 19 teams of the National Disaster Response Force have been deployed in the state in the wake of the cyclone.The met office has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Kolkata, Purba and Paschim Medinipur, North and South 24 Parganas, Jhargram, Hooghly and Howrah districts.Heavy rain is also likely to occur on Monday in the districts of North and South 24 Parganas, Nadia and Murshidabad, it said.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-jawad-likely-to-weaken-into-deep-depression-before-making-landfall-near-puri-on-sunday-346208

The number of flying squads would be raised to 40 within 24 hours, it said.The ban on entry of trucks, excluding those carrying essential goods and those running on cleaner fuel, will continue, it said after perusing the affidavits by the Centre and the Delhi Government.“It is submitted that 17 flying squads have been constituted, which will directly report to the ‘Enforcement Task Force’ of the Commission and the ‘Enforcement Task Force’ itself will exercise powers of taking punitive and preventive measures against the non-compliant or defaulting persons or entities,” the commission said. The flying squads had already started functioning and had conducted surprise checks at 25 sites, it added.The operation of thermal power plants within 300 km of the radius of Delhi shall continue to be regulated in terms of the commission’s November 30 order whereby only five out of 11 thermal plants had been permitted to schedule their operations and the rest had been directed to remain inoperative till at least December 15, the commission stated in its affidavit.The affidavit came a day after the top court set a 24-hour deadline for the Centre to propose concrete measures to check the worsening air pollution situation in Delhi-NCR and pulled up the Delhi Government for exposing children to it by reopening schools.On behalf of the Uttar Pradesh Government, senior counsel Ranjit Kumar said the order with regard to restrictions on non-clean fuel industries would affect sugarcane crushing and harm farmers.As Kumar said UP was on downwind, air was mostly coming from Pakistan, the Bench said, “So you want to ban industries in Pakistan?” The Bench asked the UP Government to approach the commission with its grievance against the directions about industries.During the hearing, the Bench took exception to a section of the media allegedly portraying it as a “villain” wanting to close down schools here.Senior advocate AM Singhvi, representing the Delhi Government, drew the court’s attention to a report in an English newspaper that said the court had threatened to take over the administration.“You can condemn all of this but where do we go? Where did we say that we will take up an administrative role? We cannot interfere with the freedom of speech and expression… A political party can hold a press conference but we can’t,” the court said.Quoting Mark Twain, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “If you don’t read newspapers you are uninformed and if you read them you are ill-informed.”SC snubs UP: you Want to ban industries in pak?As UP said order on non-clean fuel would hit cane crushing and the state was on downwind as air was coming from Pak, the SC asked, “So, you want to ban industries in Pakistan?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/flying-squads-to-curb-pollution-in-ncr-get-going-after-sc-order-346044

We believe the focus should be on strengthening health infrastructure, ensuring adequate availability of beds, adequate supply of oxygen cylinders and essential medicines.”The panel said that with the incidence of highly mutated Omicron strain of Covid virus, the efficacy of current vaccines must be evaluated.“The concerns with regard to the new strain developing immunoescape mechanism need to be critically addressed. We apprehend that the rise in mutations in the virus may lead to reporting of more virulent and transmissible strains of Covid virus in the country. The committee strongly recommends that the ministry should adopt Zero Tolerance Covid-19 Policy and closely track Covid cases across the country,” said the panel, adding that it was “pained to note that although the second wave came almost six months after the peak of the first wave, India’s testing infrastructure remained abysmal and highly insufficient.”The committee is of the opinion that to combat the current pandemic and other future emergencies, India must realise its full testing capacity, the report said, asking the government to ensure that the testing outpaced the growth of cases to arrest future waves early.State to probe lapseKarnataka has ordered a probe into how a South African national who was found Omicron positive was allowed to leave India. The second infected, a doctor, has been shifted to hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/consider-stern-travel-curbs-booster-shot-house-panel-346045

The minister’s reply came moments after the Centre issued another advisory to states flagging the need for aggressive testing, contact tracing and expanded vaccination in the wake of emerging evidence of Omicron’s enhanced transmissibility.“The current evidence, which is evolving, suggests increased transmissibility of Omicron. We must be extra vigilant in enforcing public health measures to contain its spread,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in the letter to all Chief Secretaries.The letter advised states to ensure self-declaration forms of all passengers from “at risk” nations uploaded on the government’s Air Suvidha portal, enhanced testing and tracing. The other measures include testing all contacts of positive passengers within 72 hours.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/evidence-shows-omicron-may-be-more-transmissible-centre-346048

It is the PM’s mistake. Why doesn’t the PM have the decency and dignity to help the affected families?” Rahul asked in a press conference adding that he would place the details of 700 deceased farmers on the table of the LS on Monday. He questioned the government for treating deceased farmers as non-existent and said, “This is not the way a PM should behave. This is an unpleasant, immoral and cowardly way to behave.”He expressed surprise that the government didn’t want to accept people who have died. “You did the same during Covid. You didn’t report deaths as Covid deaths. In Gujarat you said some 10,000 persons died of Covid. We sent our workers to every home and found there were lakhs who died,” said Rahul.He said the arrogance of power was keeping the government from heeding to the suffering families of farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-flays-govt-over-no-record-of-farmers-deaths-during-stir-346050

Request for data on the subject was emailed several times and the last email was sent on November 29. In response, only two states —Punjab and Arunachal — responded,” he said.Punjab emailed that four suspected deaths had occurred due to lack of oxygen at a private hospital in Amritsar.Mandaviya told the House that only 19 states had responded to the ministry’s emails and out of them only Punjab shared the figure on deaths and added that even these were being investigated. He said 22 crore doses of Covid shots were lying unused with the states. Asking the MPs not to ‘play politics on health’, he said, “If all the MPs ensure 100 per cent vaccination in their segments, the entire India will be vaccinated.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/only-pb-reported-four-deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-mandaviya-346052

Admiral Kumar said, “The Navy is wholehearted in its support for reforms and enhancing tri-service synergy. Jointness and integration cannot happen in short time. The thrust for jointness is a complicated process. We are in the third stage of war-gaming.”“The Chief of Defence Staff is the “single-most important higher defence reform” since India’s independence in 1947,” the Admiral said. On China, he said, “The ongoing situation on northern borders has added to security challenges.

They don’t have the energy to fight the BJP. The party is plagued by infighting that it is left with no time to challenge the BJP. The UPA ceased to exist long back,” said the article, titled ‘Congress in Deep Freezer’.“Mamata is at present the most popular Opposition face in the country,” the article said, adding that the responsibility to form an alternative to the BJP had been entrusted to Mamata by opposition parties. Veteran Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya said it was for the opposition parties to decide who would be their leader. State BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar ridiculed both Congress and TMC over their claims.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-in-deep-freezer-oppn-wants-didi-to-lead-tmc-mouthpiece-346057

The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) will head it.Guidelines issued by the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) said: “In the event the domestic industry is not able to supply equipment in the stipulated time-frame, quantity, or where there are inadequacies in the equipment affecting safety of troops, or in case of any other technical issues, such as no valid response to a request for proposal, etc., then specific cases for import could be taken up to meet immediate requirement, based on the recommendations of the DIC”.These guidelines will be applicable prospectively. The DIC will be constituted under the chairmanship of the Secretary, DMA, with members drawn from all stakeholders, the guidelines said.In August 2020, the government notified first of 101 items. In May this year, it notified the second list comprising 108 items.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/year-on-mod-tweaks-equipment-purchase-rules-346059

Hence vaccines are expected to still offer protection against severe disease, and vaccination with the available vaccines is crucial. If eligible, but not vaccinated, one should get vaccinated,” the ministry said today, publishing a frequently asked question list on Omicron.It also did not rule out a third wave due to the new variant, but said such a wave would be mild. To a question whether there will be a third wave, the ministry said: “Omicron cases are increasingly being reported from countries outside of South Africa and given its characteristics, it is likely to spread to more countries including India. However, the scale and magnitude of rise in cases and most importantly the severity of disease that will be caused is still not clear. Further, given the fast pace of vaccination in India and high exposure to Delta variant as evidenced by high seropositivity, the severity of the disease is anticipated to be low. However, scientific evidence is still evolving.”The ministry added that the scientific and medical community is geared up for developing and deploying diagnostics, carrying out genomic surveillance, generating evidence about viral and epidemiologic characteristics, and development of therapeutics.On what precautions to take, the ministry said “The precautions and steps to be taken remain same as before. Mask properly, get vaccinated, keep distance and maintain ventilation and hand hygiene.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-may-decrease-efficacy-but-existing-vaccines-will-still-help-govt-345941

04-12-2021||New Delhi||'You want to ban industries in Pakistan': Supreme Court to UP counsel on air pollution||Amid severe air pollution in Delhi, the Supreme Court has often witnessed either Centre blaming the Delhi government for not doing enough to curb pollution and vice versa. The Delhi government has also blamed stubble burning carried out by farmers in the neighbouring states. But during the hearing on Friday, the Uttar Pradesh counsel, while opposing the closure of industries in UP, blamed the winds from Pakistan.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana and also comprising Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Surya Kant, that if industries were to shut down in UP, it would impact sugarcane and milk industries in the state. Kumar also elaborated on various aspects of sugarcane business and vehemently argued that closure will create a major issue.Kumar said: "Closure of industries may affect sugarcane industries. UP is on down wind, air is mostly coming from Pakistan." The Chief Justice replied, "So, you want to ban industries in Pakistan?" Kumar said if sugar mills are closed then the farmers will suffer. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the government can approach the commission. The top court allowed the Uttar Pradesh government to raise the grievance before the commission for air quality management.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing the petitioner, suggested that the government should look at a long-term solution to curb air pollution. He added that large tracts of land are available in neighbouring states, where solar panels could be installed for generating electricity. The bench said it already told the Centre to examine the aspect of renewable energy. Singh contended solar panels can replace power plants.Concluding the hearing in the matter, the bench said: "For time being in view of particular measures by the government of India and notification dated December 2, we direct the government of India and GNCTD to implement those Measures. We'll keep the matter pending and list it (the matter) next Friday." The top court was hearing a case by a 17-year-old Delhi student Aditya Dubey raising concerns about severe air pollution in Delhi. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/you-want-to-ban-industries-in-pakistan-supreme-court-to-up-counsel-on-air-pollution-345895
