This may not happen every three months, but this could happen every year perhaps,” he observed.According to Paul, drug development will not go out of fashion for the next viral epidemic/ pandemic that the world might face.“And of course, the anti-microbial resistance challenge is also crying for drug solutions,” he added.Noting that there is a need to examine how India’s classical drug industry can have a roadmap and risk-taking attitude, he said,” We are still crying for an effective drug to fight viral diseases, including Covid-19”.Observing that Covid-19 has taught that viruses cannot be taken lightly, he said unpredictability in emerging scenarios of health have to be respected and addressed.“Pandemic is not over, we will continue to deal with uncertainty, even though we hope that we are possibly moving in the direction of endemicity, hopefully of a mild disease, that we can tackle,” he said.Paul, however, added that it cannot be taken for granted. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-task-force-chief-pitches-for-quickly-adaptable-vaccine-platforms-350385

Many landmarks, including the Congress headquarters, are situated along the road.Attempts have been made in the past to rename Akbar Road. In October, members of a fringe right-wing group defaced a signboard of Akbar Road and pasted posters on it, declaring it ‘Samrat Hemu Vikramaditya Marg’.Gen Rawat, his wife Madhulika and 11 other defence personnel were killed in a helicopter crash in Tamil Nadu’s Coonoor on December 8.

14-12-2021||New Delhi||1971 war with Pakistan showed India’s commitment to humanity: Rajnath||India’s 1971 war with Pakistan that led to the birth of Bangladesh showed New Delhi’s commitment to humanity and the surrender of 93,000 Pakistani soldiers was a “historic surrender” in the history of the world, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Tuesday.He made the comments during an interaction with a group of Indian veterans and ‘Mukti Jodhas’ of Bangladesh who fought the war.“This war was a ‘justice war’ due to which a new nation ‘Bangladesh’ was born. This war was a war to show India’s commitment to humanity,” Singh said at the event organised as part of celebrations of the 50th anniversary of India’s victory in the war.The defence minister also touched the feet of the wife of 1971 war hero Col Hoshiar Singh, who was awarded India’s highest military honour, the Param Vir Chakra.“The surrender of 93,000 Pakistani soldiers in the Indo-Pakistani war in 1971 was a historic surrender in the history of the world. India’s victory in the war proved to be one of the most important victory in world history,” he said.The group veterans comprised of 30 ‘Mukti Jodhas’, families of all four Param Vir Chakra award winners and other awardees.In his address, Singh paid rich tributes to the brave soldiers, sailors and air warriors who ensured the victory in 1971 war by making supreme sacrifice while displaying devotion to duty.Terming the victory as a triumph of justice over injustice, Singh said, the war fought against the atrocities on common people showed India’s commitment towards humanity.He remembered the war heroes namely Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, Lt Gen Jagjit Singh Aurora (then General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Command), Lt Gen JFR Jacob and Air Marshal Idris Hassan Latif and others.                                “These heroes included Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Sikhs and one Jew. This is a proof of India’s firm belief towards giving equal respect to all religions,” he said.The defence minister also paid glowing tributes to the first President of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur-Rahman, terming him as the guiding light for the people of his country.Singh said Bangladesh has been making giant strides in the path of development since its liberation.Commending the Armed Forces personnel, including the veterans, for their selfless service, Singh described them as the protectors of India’s unity and integrity.“Today our country is moving forward on the path of progress uninterruptedly. This is because of our brave soldiers who are standing firm at the borders. This country sleeps peacefully because our soldiers are awake,” he said.Noting that no price can be paid for the sacrifices made by the veterans, he extended his gratitude and assured the government’s all possible support to ensure their welfare.“Our every warrior of today is a respected veteran of tomorrow. It is our duty to ensure their well-being. This government understands this very well, which is why, as soon as we came into power in 2014, we fulfilled the long-pending demand of One Rank One Pension,” Singh added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1971-war-with-pakistan-showed-indias-commitment-to-humanity-rajnath-350376

14-12-2021||Kashipur||Kejriwal promises Rs 1k to women, Rs 5k to jobless youths monthly if voted to power in Uttarakhand||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday promised to pay monthly allowances of Rs 1,000 to all adult women and Rs 5,000 to all unemployed youths in Uttarakhand, if the Aam Aadmi Party is voted to power in the state in 2022.He reiterated his promise of giving jobs to youths and vowed to convert Kashipur, Ranikhet, Roorkee, Didihat, Yamunotri and Kotdwar into districts within one month of coming into power.All promises made by the AAP are guaranteed, Kejriwal said and asked the people of Uttarakhand not to vote for the party, if he does not keep them.The AAP leader said women aged 18 and above will be given Rs 1,000 as monthly allowance and unemployed youths will be given an allowance of Rs 5,000 till they find jobs.Initially, Kejriwal did not say whether the unemployment allowance would be given monthly, but later a spokesperson clarified that the allowance would be given every month to jobless youths.“Be it free power, free pilgrimage, jobs for the youth or a monthly allowance for women, I guarantee each of my promises. Throw us out of power, if we don’t fulfil them,” Kejriwal said addressing a rally at Kashipur in Udham Singh Nagar district.“They are not like the meaningless, hollow promises of other political parties made before every election, after which they don’t even show their faces. Kejriwal does what he says,” the AAP national convenor said.Kejriwal has made similar promises in Punjab where he said that Rs 1,000 will be transferred every month into accounts of all women in the state if the AAP is voted to power in the Assembly polls early next year.He said the Delhi model of development, which has seen establishment of good government schools and hospitals there, will be followed in Uttarakhand.“We have given jobs to 10 lakh people in Delhi. Why can’t we give it to you,” he asked.Taking a jibe at his political rivals for going to court complaining that he is guaranteeing freebies, Kejriwal said if corrupt parties can devour public money, why can’t he offer freebies to the common man.“Political leaders get 4,000 units of electricity for free. Then why shouldn’t you be given 300 units of power for free,” he asked.The AAP convener said he doesn’t know politics and all he knows is how to work.He said that AAP’s chief ministerial candidate for Uttarakhand Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd) also doesn’t know politics like him and asked the people to give him five years’ time to deliver.“You gave 10 years each to the BJP and the Congress. They ruined the state, looted it and deposited the money in Swiss banks. Give us five years to serve you and if we fail to perform, throw us out,” he said.

14-12-2021||London||UK court hears Nirav Modi extradition appeal on mental health grounds||The High Court in London on Tuesday began hearing Nirav Modi’s appeal on the grounds of his mental health against extradition to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering, amounting to an estimated USD 2 billion in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan scam case.Lord Justice Jeremy Stuart-Smith and Justice Robert Jay presided over the hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice to determine whether District Judge Sam Goozee’s February ruling in favour of extradition was incorrect to overlook the diamond merchant’s “high risk of suicide”.The court heard of an additional assurance from the Indian authorities on November 13, which reiterates previous commitments of adequate specialist medical care and an ambulance at hand were Nirav to be extradited to Mumbai.“He is at high risk of suicide already and his condition is likely to deteriorate further in Mumbai,” Edward Fitzgerald QC argued as he opened the appeal on behalf of Nirav - who remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March 2019.Fitzgerald went on to lay out before the two-judge bench that the Indian government assurances of medical assistance at Barrack 12 of Mumbai Central Prison on Arthur Road, where the accused is to be held on being extradition, would not be adequate given the “certainty” of deterioration in his mental health. He also sought an adjournment in view of the short time-frame to study the new assurance from India, received last month.The judges referred to the case of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who recently lost his extradition appeal against the US government, with reference to India’s “sovereign assurances” falling within a similar vein.The hearing on Tuesday follows a ruling in August from High Court Justice Martin Chamberlain that arguments concerning the 50-year-old’s “severe depression” and “high risk of suicide” were arguable at a full appeal hearing.A group of Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials have flown in from India for the case, which is being presented in court by the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) barrister Helen Malcolm QC on behalf of the Indian authorities.A judgment on the appeal is expected to be reserved, to be handed down at a later date.The appeal against Judge Goozee’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court ruling to send the case to the Home Secretary was granted leave to appeal in the High Court on two grounds – under Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) to hear arguments if it would “unjust or oppressive” to extradite Nirav due to his mental state and Section 91 of the Extradition Act 2003, also related to mental ill health.Nirav’s “high risk of suicide” and the “adequacy of any measures capable of preventing successful suicide attempts in Arthur Road prison” were deemed as the focal points for the appeal.His legal team have sought to establish that it would be oppressive to extradite him due to his mental condition that could lead to suicidal impulses, given the family history of suicide of his mother, and that he is at risk of “flagrant denial of justice” in India. The lawyers have also claimed the Covid-19 pandemic is “overwhelming” the Indian prison system.The CPS, on behalf of India, has highlighted the “high level of diplomatic assurance” to provide adequate medical attention to the accused on being extradited to face trial in India.At a remote “renewal application” hearing in August, the permission to appeal was denied on all other grounds, including the admissibility of evidence provided by the ED and CBI and against UK Home Secretary Priti Patel’s extradition order. The High Court also noted that the District Judge’s approach to the identification of a prima facie case in the PNB fraud case was “correct”.Nirav is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added to the CBI case.If Nirav wins this appeal hearing in the High Court, he cannot be extradited unless the Indian government is successful in getting permission to appeal at the Supreme Court on a point of law of public importance.On the flip side, if he loses this appeal hearing, Nirav can approach the Supreme Court on a point of law of public importance, to be applied for to the Supreme Court against the High Court’s decision within 14 days of a High Court verdict.However, this involves a high threshold as appeals to the Supreme Court can only be made if the High Court has certified that the case involves a point of law of general public importance.Finally, after all avenues in the UK courts are exhausted, the diamantaire could still seek a so-called Rule 39 injunction from the European Court of Human Rights.

They (crew) say they are awaiting instructions,” Roja earlier said in a short video message sent to the media.The flight finally went to Bengaluru and landed.But, the airline staffers allegedly asked each passenger to pay Rs 5,000 as they took a detour to the Karnataka capital.“We were put through mental torture as we were not allowed to disembark for more than two hours,” the firebrand MLA later alleged.The crew initially said the flight was diverted to Bengaluru due to bad weather but later claimed there was a technical problem.“They put us through a big ordeal and even endangered the lives of passengers,” the film star-MLA lashed out.Veteran TDP leader and Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu and YSRC MLA Jogeswara Rao were among the 70 passengers aboard the flight.After the passengers stoutly refused to pay any extra charge, the airline finally relented and let them disembark in Bengaluru, information reaching here said.There was no immediate reaction from the private airliner regarding the matter. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tirupati-bound-flight-takes-detour-to-bengaluru-passengers-have-a-harrowing-time-350361

Both deputed their leaders—Raut and Baalu—respectively.Earlier in the day, opposition MPs in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha held a protest march from the Gandhi statue in the Parliament complex to Vijay Chowk with Rahul Gandhi alleging that the Opposition is not being allowed to raise issues in Parliament, which is now merely a building and a museum.“Wherever the Opposition is trying to raise issues, they are suppressed. The government does not allow us to raise issues. This is the murder of democracy. We want to raise issues against the government, but we are not allowed to do so,” he told reporters.

14-12-2021||New Delhi||Serum Institute to launch Covid vaccine for children in six months: Poonawalla||Serum Institute of India (SII) plans to launch a Covid-19 vaccine for children in the next six months, the company’s CEO Adar Poonawalla said on Tuesday.Participating in an industry conference, Poonawalla said the vaccine ‘Covovax’ is under trial and would offer protection to children all the way down to three years.Currently, Covishield and other Covid-19 vaccines are approved for people above the age of 18 years.“We have not seen a lot of severe disease in children. Fortunately, the panic is not there for children. However, we will be launching a vaccine in six months for children, hopefully down to the age of three,” Poonawalla said.Already, there are two companies in India who are licensed and their vaccines will be available soon, he added.“I think, yes you should take and get your children vaccinated there is no harm, these vaccines have been proven to be safe and efficacious and all of that. If you feel you want to get your children vaccinated by all means, wait for government announcements on that, and you go ahead with that. Our vaccine Covovax will be launched for children in six months,” Poonawall stated.He also said that Covovax is under trial and has shown excellent data all the way down to the age group of three years.Poonawalla noted that there was enough data to show that the vaccines will work and protect the children against the infectious disease.He pointed out that so far, nothing can be said about the Omicron variant as to how it would impact the children.“I do not know what will happen with Omicron, but so far the children have not been affected very badly with this (Covid-19) virus. I think their body, cells and their lungs recover better,” he stated.On a query about the Omicron variant, Poonawalla said there may be a rise in cases but how severe it would be in terms of disruptions and hospitalisations, nobody is in a position to predict as of now.“India is in a better position with 8,000-10,000 new cases daily of which the majority would be the Delta variant. The point here is that I do not want to make predictions just yet because predictions should not be made till the time we have enough data.“But what we know for certain is that if you boost with three doses, you are definitely enhancing protection in your system, at least for five to six months,” he stated.It will help in reducing hospitalisation if at all there are going to be like what happened with the Delta variant, Poonawalla noted.He said the clarity on Omicron would be coming in a month or so, and it would be known how effective the current vaccines are against the new virus.“One thing is certain that Omicron is definitely more infectious and will spread very quickly across the globe. But how severe it is going to be and how many hospitalisations it is going to cause is something that we are going to wait and watch. The initial reports show that it is quite mild. However, we should not take it lightly,” Poonawalla said.He further said: “We will also get a lot of clarity on how effective are the existing licenced vaccines on Omicron. But one thing is certain that boosting is a proven strategy, which will definitely get your antibodies up and… give you some protection, it is never going to be zero. So, I think the policymakers have to decide… the risk-reward of doing that. There really is no downside to doing it. So, we are waiting on the government decision on how they see this”.Poonawalla noted that preventive steps like booster dose can be thought of in the current situation when there is a lack of clarity about the new variant.He said that the government, on its part, has made adequate provisions for any eventuality.“The world is now better prepared for the third, fourth waves because we have learned what to do and what not to do. So, we are in a far better position today, and I do not think they should be panicking with Omicron and other variants coming about where today already, you are going to see…the sentiment change a little bit, but I do not think we should panic just yet. We should wait and watch how things unfold,” he noted.Poonawalla stressed that it was important to vaccinate the majority of the population to stop more waves in the future. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/serum-institute-to-launch-covid-vaccine-for-children-in-six-months-poonawalla-350355

14-12-2021||Varanasi||PM Modi says zero budget natural farming should become mass movement||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said zero budget natural farming should become a mass movement and people should be made aware of its benefits.Addressing an event marking the 98th anniversary celebrations of Sadguru Sadafaldeo Vihangam Yog Sansthan at Swarved Mahamandir here, he said as the country completes 75 years of independence, “su raj (good governance)” is as important as “swaraj (self-rule)”.Stressing on the importance of zero budget natural farming, Modi said it should be made a mass movement.Zero budget natural farming reduces the cost of agriculture by relying on traditional field-based technologies which lead to improved soil health.Modi also highlighted the development here in recent years and asserted that cities like Varanasi have preserved the seeds of India’s identity, art and entrepreneurship in the toughest of times. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-says-zero-budget-natural-farming-should-become-mass-movement-350349
14-12-2021||New Delhi||Parliament passes bill to extend ED director tenure up to 5 years||Parliament has passed a Bill to extend the tenure of director of Enforcement Directorate to a maximum of five years.The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021, passed in Lok Sabha on December 9, was moved by Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension Jitendra Singh in the Upper House and cleared by voice vote on Tuesday.Read also: Parliament passes bill to extend tenure of CBI director to maximum 5 yearsPrior to the bill being taken up, most of the opposition members had walked out of the House to protest the suspension of their 12 members.The Bill seeks to extend the tenure of the director of the Enforcement Directorate from two years to five years.While introducing the Bill, Singh said the amendments are in the interest of national security and for the stability of the financial structure.“Enforcement director has a very crucial role even in money laundering cases, and is possibly the only agency of its kind available in India. But for India, most of the other countries have a much longer term. And here also, the term is not being made indefinite...,” he said.The clause on tenure which says “not less than two years” is just being amended to “’go up to five years” with a one-year extension on each occasion, he added.

But first remove the accused’s father from the minister’s post. The truth is before you!,” Gandhi said on Twitter, using the hashtags “Lakhimpur” and “murder”.धर्म की राजनीति करते हो,आज राजनीति का धर्म निभाओ,यूपी में गए ही हो,तो मारे गए किसानों के परिवारों से मिलकर आओ।अपने मंत्री को बर्खास्त ना करना अन्याय है, अधर्म है!#Lakhimpur pic.twitter.com/oHo147oL2U  He alleged that the minister tried to kill farmers and the prime minister knew as he was a member of his team.“A minister has tried to kill farmers. The prime minister knows as he is in his team. We raised the issue but we were not allowed a discussion on it even then. We were all silenced at the time after we wanted to discuss the issue,” he told reporters when asked about the matter.“Everyone knows the truth and it is that 2-3 big industrialists are against farmers and Narendra Modi is in the front,” he claimed.Asked if the Congress would raise the issue in Parliament, the former Congress chief said, “We will certainly raise the issue in Parliament but they will not allow us to raise it.”                 In response to another question, he said, “When they ran their jeep over farmers, which forces were behind them? Who gave them the liberty and which force kept them out of jail?”           The SIT urged the CJM to replace IPC sections 279 (rash driving/riding), 338 (causing grievous injuries by negligence) and 304A (causing death by a rash and negligent act) with IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) among others in the case related to the October 3 violence in Uttar Pradesh.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also demanded the sacking of Mishra and asked the prime minister to apologise.“Dear Modi ji, now in Lakhimpur Kheri the conspiracy to kill farmers has come to the fore. Today you should apologise to the farmers from the stage in Uttar Pradesh and sack the minister of state for home. Otherwise it will be proved that the massacre of farmers took place at the behest of the Yogi-Modi government,” he claimed.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also demanded that there should be an inquiry into the role of the minister of state for home in the “conspiracy”...@narendramodi जी किसानों को आपकी खोखली बातें नहीं सुननी हैं। प्रधानमंत्री होने के नाते अपनी संवैधानिक एवं नैतिक जिम्मेदारी निभाते हुए लखीमपुर किसान नरसंहार की साज़िश में गृह राज्यमंत्री की भूमिका की जाँच अविलम्ब शुरू करवाइये एवं उन्हें तुरंत बर्खास्त करिए।प्रेस वक्तव्य pic.twitter.com/VjMBf35wVK  “Due to the court’s rebuke and because of ‘satyagraha’, now even the police is saying that the son of the minister of state for home had conspired and crushed farmers.

Police, however, have not taken action in this regard. In 2018, an Indian sambar was caught from Narowal village bordering India and shifted to the Lahore Zoo Safari.The sambar is a large deer native to the Indian subcontinent, South China, and Southeast Asia.

None of the reporters has spoken to the Controller of Examination, CBSE, in this regard and the board has not taken any such decision. The CBSE, therefore, warns the public not to fall prey to such unverified news in their own interest," it added.In the purported audio message, the controller was saying, "Don't worry students, if you attempt 28 to 31 questions correctly, you will score around 38 marks. The CBSE will award grace marks up to six to the students.”The development came a day after the CBSE decided to award full marks to all students for accompanying questions of a comprehension passage which was dropped following outrage over the board allegedly supporting gender stereotyping and regressive norms.The board also announced setting up of an expert committee to strengthen and review its question paper setting process to avoid such occurrences.

14-12-2021||New Delhi||Corporate India's hiring outlook for next 3 months most optimistic in 8 years: Survey||Indian employers have robust hiring intentions for the next three months, with 49 per cent of companies planning to add more staff in the January-March quarter, as employers are positive about achieving sustained post-pandemic recovery, a survey said on Tuesday.According to the latest ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey, hiring sentiment in India is the strongest reported in eight years, improving by five percentage points in comparison with the prior quarter and by 43 percentage points when compared with this time one year ago.The survey of 3,020 employers noted that 64 per cent expect to increase their staffing levels, 15 per cent anticipate a decrease and 20 per cent do not anticipate any change, resulting in a seasonally adjusted Net Employment Outlook of 49 per cent.The Net Employment Outlook is derived by taking the percentage of employers anticipating an increase in hiring activity and subtracting from this the percentage of employers expecting a decrease in hiring activity."India registered a V-shaped recovery owing to increased consumer spending, educational sector opening up and the government's sustained efforts to accelerate vaccination coverage thereby breaking the virus chain," Sandeep Gulati, Managing Director, ManpowerGroup India, said.Gulati said "the boost in hiring outlook reflects employers' sustained confidence in achieving a post-pandemic recovery. The 'Great Resignation' is additionally impacting the hiring sentiments in companies, especially in the IT and technology sectors."However, due to the skill gap, talent shortage continues to prevail and it has become increasingly difficult for companies to find and hire the right talent, Gulati said, adding, "Coupled with that is the new variant that is seemingly creating volatility for the administrators.”Employers in large organisations report the most optimistic outlook with 51 per cent intending to hire in the first quarter compared to 25 per cent in small companies. Employers in the north report the strongest hiring intentions for January-March quarter followed by south and west.When asked about mandating vaccines, the survey revealed that 91 per cent of employers will mandate double vaccination and require proof for all staff, while 3 per cent would allow individuals to decide.The survey further noted that digital roles are most in demand. IT, technology, telecoms, communications and media reported the strongest outlook (60 per cent), followed by restaurants and hotels (56 per cent) and banking, finance, insurance and real estate (52 per cent).According to the survey, more employers are embracing the blend of work and home. Corporates expect to adopt hybrid working for 51 per cent of finance and accounting and 49 per cent of human resource staff, while 45 per cent of production and manufacturing staff is expected to be at the workplace all the time.

As many as 14 high courts did not have a single judge belonging to SCs/STs. Of the 246 Supreme Court judges, retired and sitting, there have only been eight women judges.  And of the total of 1,113 judges across various high courts and the Supreme Court in 2011, there were only 80 women judges amounting to just 7.9 per cent of the total strength. Five high courts had no women judges at all. "This paints a stark picture and it is imperative to address this gender gap permanently. Not even a single judge from the Schedule Tribes has been appointed as a judge of Supreme Court till date. Where is equality in this nation,” he said. “Judicial diversity is fundamental to the quality of judging. The statistics show that many weaker sections are poorly represented in the higher judiciary. This may mean their rights are not being properly safeguarded. People of this country are afraid that a very narrow, homogeneous group of judges belonging to certain social classes are not necessarily going to reflect the views and values of society as a whole, particularly on issues involving diverse, cultural and generational matters because they would require more perspectives, as the judges would interpret and enforce law based on their own background,” he added.He said that significant over-representation of certain sections as judges calls into question the objectivity of the current system and its inability to recruit from different social groups and ensure social justice and social diversity."There is much to gain from having a judiciary that reflects society in all its diversity. The lack of inclusivity in the judiciary would widen the trust deficit over the higher judiciary and there is always a likelihood of affinity bias.”  He espoused Supreme Court's Bench having adequate representation from all states/union territories, based on the sanctioned strength of the high court of the states.Besides, he made a case for increasing the age of retirement of high court judges from 62 to 65 and that of Supreme Court judges from 65 to 70. He said the vacancies across high courts are alarming.At present, there are about 402 vacancies in high courts out of total 1,098 sanctioned posts.He batted for establishment of permanent regional benches of the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dmk-mp-p-wilson-bats-for-representation-of-all-classes-in-appointment-of-sc-hc-judges-350309

The government does not allow us to raise issues. This is murder of democracy. We want to raise issues against the government, but we are not allowed to do so," he told reporters.Gandhi also said the prime minister does not come to Parliament and "this is not the way to run a democracy"."We have here our suspended members.

They are sitting outside and their voice has been crushed. We are not being allowed to discuss important issues.“This is not the way to run Parliament. The prime minister does not come to the House. Whenever we want to raise an issue, we are stopped from doing so. This is a very unfortunate killing of democracy that is taking place,” he said.The 12 Opposition MPs were suspended from the Rajya Sabha on November 29 for the entire Winter Session of Parliament for their "unruly" conduct in the previous session in August.The Opposition has described the suspension as "undemocratic and in violation of all the Rules of Procedure" of the Upper House of Parliament.

He has been part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him...," the ED had said.Despite being in jail, it said, Chandrashekhar "did not stop conning" people."He (using a cellphone procured illegally in prison) with the help of technology made spoofed calls to dupe people as the numbers displayed on the called party's phone number belonged to senior government officers."While speaking (from prison) to these persons, he claimed to be a government officer offering to help people for a price," the ED had claimed.

The workers also lined up on the three km road leading to Rabri Devi's residence at 10 circular road in the state capital.Following the directions from the party, all 75 MLAs, MLCs, and MPs were present at Rabri Devi's residence on Monday night to welcome the couple.

We will disclose the venue in a few days and will invite people of Bihar to come to the venue and give blessings to us," Tejashwi said.Sources have said that Tejashwi Yadav is aiming to organise a reception in Patna's historic Gandhi Maidan.Last time, Lalu Prasad family had organised a grand party was for the reception of elder son, Tej Pratap Yadav.

Some people tried to create confusion in the public. I don't want to comment on it. People of Bihar knew what his motive was. He is an elder person and I respect him in the past and future also," Tejashwi said.Tejashwi also clarified that his wife's name in Rechal Godhinho but now my father has given her new name Rajshree Yadav.

Whether Omicron’s observed rapid growth rate in countries with high levels of population immunity is related to immune evasion, intrinsic increased transmissibility, or a combination of both remains uncertain. However, given the current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs,” the global body said. As of December 9, cases of human infections with Omicron have been identified in 63 countries across all six WHO regions with the spread picking up pace.The WHO also said more data was needed to understand the clinical severity of Omicron and preliminary findings from South Africa suggest it may be less severe than Delta. All Omicron cases reported in the EU and the European Economic Area to date have been mild or asymptomatic.On vaccine impact of the new variant, the world body said there was limited available data and no peer-reviewed evidence on vaccine efficacy for Omicron.SC notice on PIL for revival of vax PSUsThe Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to the Centre on a petition seeking to revive the vaccine public sector units and exploit their full production capabilities by placing purchase orders.7,350 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS 4,75,636 ACTIVE CASES 91,456 202 deaths in 24 hours||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-likely-to-outpace-delta-world-health-organisation-350034

Whole fraternity is being targeted. Supriya Sule, NCP leaderThe discussions on the Bill saw NCP’s Supriya Sule and Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant hitting out at the Centre over alleged targeting of Bollywood actors on the drug abuse issue and flagged the “misuse of authority” by officials dealing with related cases.Sule said it was “disappointing that farmers’ demands were not debated upon, but a clerical change was being discussed”. “Why is Bollywood put into a corner… as if they (actors) are evil people who only do drugs,” she said.Sawant accused the BJP of trying to play politics on drug abuse during the Bihar Assembly polls. “When the new (Maharashtra) government was formed, some incidents took place... the Sushant Singh Rajput case was quoted. After his death, the whole narrative was drawn that entire Maharashtra is full of drug addicts…” he said.The NDPS (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was passed by voice vote and some amendments moved by Opposition MPs were rejected by the House.Responding to concerns raised by members that the provision for implementing the law with retrospective effect was in violation of Article 20 (1) of the Constitution, Sitharaman said according to the opinion of the Solicitor General, the amendment could be permitted as it was not substantive, but “clarificatory” in nature.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bollywood-on-target-ncp-sena-as-ls-clears-changes-in-ndps-act-350033

The panel said in view of the Finance Ministry’s instructions imposing a ceiling limit on the expenditure that can be incurred in the last quarter and the last month of the financial year (March), it was even more concerned whether the remaining funds would be optimally used by the end of the ongoing fiscal.“The ministry must identify factors that restrict or hinder the utilisation of funds by institutions coming under its purview and draw an action plan accordingly to improve utilisation of funds,” the panel said.The ministry for its part told the committee that the pace of expenditure was slow due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown coupled with expenditure restrictions imposed by the Ministry of Finance in the first three quarters of financial year 2020-2021.“Observations of the committee have been noted for adherence and compliance and necessary instructions will be issued to all organisations and a conscious effort made to utilise the allocation of funds in commensuration with the actual needs,” the ministry assured the committee.The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act was passed by Parliament in December 2013, received assent from the President on January 1, 2014, and came into force on January 16, 2014.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lokpal-has-used-only-30-of-its-sanctioned-budget-panel-350031
