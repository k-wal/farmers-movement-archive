26-12-2021||New Delhi||For now, Covaxin likely to be only Covid vaccine available for children of 15-18 years||Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is likely to be the only Covid-19 vaccine available, for now, for children in the age group of 15-18 years, who will be inoculated from January 3, official sources said.Also, healthcare and frontline workers and citizens above 60 years of age with comorbidities would be administered the third dose of the same vaccine they had been given before.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised address to the nation on Saturday night, announced that vaccination against Covid-19 for children between 15-18 years will start from January 3, while “precaution dose” for healthcare and frontline workers would be administered from January 10.The decisions came amid rising Covid cases linked to the Omicron variant of the virus.The precaution dose will also be available for citizens above 60 years of age and with comorbidities on the advice of their doctor from January 10 next year as well, the prime minister had said.“Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is the only Covid-19 vaccine which will be administered, for now, to children in the age group of 15-18 years who will be inoculated from January 3. The estimated population to be covered in this category is seven to eight crores,” an official source said.The source said that Zydus Cadila’s vaccine ZyCoV-D has not yet been introduced in the country’s inoculation programme, even for adults, though it had received emergency use authorisation from the drug regulator on August 20, making it the first vaccine that could be administered in the age group of 12-18 years in the country.The indigenously developed ZyCoV-D is the world’s first DNA-based needle-free Covid-19 vaccine.The gap between the second and third dose of Covid-19 vaccine, which is being termed as “precaution dose”, is likely to be nine to 12 months.Necessary modifications are being done on the CoWIN portal to register the new category of vaccination.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) granted emergency use authorisation to indigenously-developed Covaxin for children above 12 years with certain conditions on Friday.More than 61 per cent of India’s adult population has received both doses of the vaccine. Similarly, about 90 per cent of the adult population has received the first dose of Covid vaccine.The cumulative Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has exceeded 141 crore. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-now-covaxin-likely-to-be-only-covid-vaccine-available-for-children-of-15-18-years-354710
26-12-2021||New Delhi||Health Secretary to brief Election Commission on Covid-19 situation on Monday||As the Election Commission prepares for assembly polls in five states early next year, its top brass is slated to interact with Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Monday.The commission is likely to seek updates from Bhushan on the Covid-19 situation and the emergence of Omicron, the new coronavirus variant, sources said on Sunday.The terms of Goa, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Manipur legislative assemblies are ending on different dates in March next year while the assembly’s term in Uttar Pradesh will end in May.The Election Commission (EC) is expected to announce election dates next month.The commission may also seek suggestions from Bhushan on improving its Covid-19 protocol for poll campaigning, polling days and the dates of counting.On Tuesday, the chief election commissioner (CEC) and fellow election commissioners are scheduled to visit Uttar Pradesh to take stock of the poll preparedness in the state.An Allahabad High Court bench of Justice Shekhar Yadav had on Thursday urged the government and the poll panel to consider postponing the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections for a month or two and banning all political rallies amid fears of an impending third wave of Covid-19.  When asked about the observation, CEC Sushil Chandra had said in Dehradun on Friday that the EC will be visiting Uttar Pradesh next week and “an appropriate decision as required by the situation will be taken after we review it”.The commission has already visited Punjab, Goa and Uttarakhand as part of its pre-poll stock-taking exercise.

26-12-2021||New Delhi||Night curfew in Delhi likely from Monday||With the Covid-19 positivity rate touching 0.55 per cent, the Delhi government has decided to re-impose night curfew from Monday, according to sources.Officials said the night curfew will kick in under the four-stage Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) if the positivity rate settles at 0.5 per cent for two consecutive days.Delhi reported 290 fresh coronavirus cases on Sunday, the highest since June 10, and one fatality, while the positivity rate rose to 0.55 per cent, according to data shared by the Delhi government’s health department here.Under GRAP, a ‘Yellow’ alert will come into force if the positivity rate settles at 0.5 per cent for two consecutive days, leading to a host of restrictions.Sources said Sunday usually sees a lower number of tests which might affect the positivity rate. Yet night curfew will commence on Monday from 11 pm and last till 5 am.On June 10, the national capital had reported 305 cases and 44 deaths.The cumulative tally has now risen to 14,43,352 while the death toll is 25,105. The number of active cases stands at 1,103, of which 583 patients are in home isolation.States like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Karnataka have also reimposed night curfew.Night curfew, closure of schools and colleges, and shops of non-essential items, and halved seating capacity in metro trains are the other restrictions that will come in place under the yellow alert.GRAP was approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority in July in anticipation of the third wave of Covid-19. It aims to bring in a clearer picture of imposition and lifting of restrictions depending on the coronavirus situation.Curfew from 10 PM to 5 AM will be imposed during Yellow, Amber and Orange alerts. If the ‘Red’ alert is sounded, there will be “total curfew”.The ‘Yellow’ (level-1) alert will be sounded when the positivity rate crosses 0.5 per cent or new cases increase to 1,500 or oxygenated bed occupancy reaches 500. The response will involve allowing construction, manufacturing activities and opening of shops of essential goods.Shops and establishments of non-essential goods and services, and malls will be allowed to open between 10 am and 8 pm based on the odd-even formula. Only one weekly market per zone with 50 percent of vendors will be allowed to open.Restaurants will be permitted with 50 per cent capacity from 8 am to 10 pm while bars can also operate with the same capacity, but from 12 noon to 10 PM. Marriages and funerals will be allowed with 20 people in attendance while all other types of gatherings will be prohibited.The Delhi Metro will run at 50 percent seating capacity while auto-rickshaws and cabs can ferry up to two passengers. Buses will ply with only 50 percent exempted category passengers, according to GRAP.Cinema halls, banquet halls, spas, gyms, outdoor yoga activity, amusement parks, stadiums, swimming pools, schools and colleges will not be allowed if the ‘Yellow’ alert is sounded.Religious places will be open but without visitors. Parks and gardens can open.Private offices can function with up to 50 percent of employees. In Delhi government offices also, barring certain categories of officials, only half of the remaining employees will be allowed.

One Shashi Tharoor is not the Congress. If he falls in line with the party decision, he will remain a part of it and if not, then he will be out.”His comments come in the wake of growing discontent in the state unit against Tharoor’s reluctance to sign a letter prepared by the MPs from the party-led UDF to the Centre against the state government’s semi-high speed rail corridor and his recent open praise of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for his “investment-friendly” initiatives.Responding to criticism by his party colleagues, Tharoor had tweeted that on some issues it is necessary to put political differences aside.He had also said he would reveal his opinion on the Silver Line project after studying it.The KPCC president said everyone is entitled to their own opinions, “but be it Shashi Tharoor or K Sudhakaran, no one has the authority to oppose party directions”.“Such an authority has not been given to anyone in the party, not even an MP,” he added.Sudhakaran said an explanation in writing has been sought from Tharoor and once it is received, a decision would be taken.

26-12-2021||Jammu/New Delhi||Kathua rape-murder case: Parents of victim anguished as two convicts walk out on bail||The parents of an eight-year-old nomad girl, who was brutally raped and murdered in Kathua district of Jammu, are anguished that while their appeal for enhancement of sentence against six people remains unheard, two convicts were released on bail in the case described by a court as a “devilish and monstrous crime”.Mohammed Yusuf, who had adopted the eight-year-old girl, and Mohammed Akthar, her biological father, said they had heard that two culprits—former sub-inspector Anand Dutta and head constable Tilak Raj—had been released on bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which suspended the rest of their sentences pending an appeal.“I am surprised that two accused have been left on bail. Our appeal for enhancement of sentence is still pending while their appeal has been addressed. I wonder whether poor people like us will ever be heard.“I hope the Supreme Court looks into the matter and takes some action as no one is hearing our petition,” Akthar told PTI.Yusuf claims that efforts were being made to dilute the case to the extent that all the culprits were out.“When the accused are out on bail, I fear that one day, I will be booked under some frivolous charge and thrown into jail. They are very powerful people,” he said.“Already rumours have started doing the rounds that the case was going to be re-investigated by the CBI and all the accused will be out on bail,” Yusuf alleged.The case triggered a nationwide outrage when the eight-year-old girl was found murdered on January 17, 2018. After initial hiccups, the case was handed over to the crime branch on January 27 of the same year which unravelled the conspiracy behind the heinous crime where the little girl was kidnapped and brutally raped for four days before being killed in a barbaric manner.The Supreme Court, had in 2018, directed the case to be shifted out of Jammu and Kashmir and ordered the sessions court in Pathankot to hear it on a daily basis.Sanji Ram, the mastermind and caretaker of the ‘devasthanam’ (temple) where the crime took place in January 2018, Deepak Khajuria, a special police officer, and Parvesh Kumar, a civilian, were sentenced to life imprisonment till their last breath for the ghastly crime, while three policemen, Dutta, Raj and SPO Suriender Kumar, were awarded five years’ imprisonment for destroying evidence in June 2019.The Punjab and Haryana High Court, earlier this month, suspended the remaining sentences of Dutta and Raj, pending hearing on their appeals against the verdict.Justices Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Vinod S Bhardwaj said in separate orders that both Dutta and Raj have been on parole for 11 months and nine months respectively.Senior advocate RS Cheema, appearing for the Jammu and Kashmir government, and advocate Manbir Basra had objected to the suspension of the sentence, saying the accused could tamper with evidence and create a law and order situation.However, in a near-identical order in both the petitions, the Division Bench ruled out the apprehension of Cheema about the possibility of a breach of peace, saying it “seems misconceived in as much as the applicant has availed of parole” during the period of his custody.The sentences of the two convicts were suspended, and they were released on bail under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.Both Akthar and Yusuf had approached the high court in 2019 for enhancing the sentences of all the six accused besides challenging the sessions court’s order of releasing Sanji Ram’s son Vishal.“There have been some hearings but because of the Covid-19 pandemic, everything is delayed,” Basra said.A 15-page charge sheet filed in April 2018 said the eight-year-old girl was kidnapped on January 10 that year and was raped in captivity in a small village temple, exclusively manned by Ram, after keeping her sedated for four days. She was later bludgeoned to death, it said.The Crime Branch of the Jammu and Kashmir Police had filed the charge sheet against eight people, including a juvenile. The trial against the juvenile is yet to begin as his petition on determining his age is to be heard by the Supreme Court.Tejwinder Singh, district and sessions judge of Pathankot, had in his 432-page judgment termed the crime “devilish and monstrous”, and said it was committed in the most “shameful, inhumane and barbaric manner” for which “poetic justice” needs to be done to its perpetrators. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/kathua-rape-murder-case-parents-of-victim-anguished-as-two-convicts-walk-out-on-bail-354694
26-12-2021||Pithoragarh (Uttarakhand)||Now, Dalit students in Uttarakhand school refuse mid-day meals cooked by upper caste woman||Dalit students at a government school in Champawat district refused to eat mid-day meals cooked by an upper caste woman after a cook belonging to the Scheduled Castes was sacked.The district administration, however, said on Sunday that the issue has been resolved after members from both communities arrived at a consensus.“I hope the Dalit students will resume eating the food prepared by the new Bhojan Mata (cook) from tomorrow,” Champawat District Magistrate Vineet Tomar said.A Dalit cook at the Government Inter-College, Sukhi Dang, was sacked after 43 children from upper caste communities, studying in classes VI - VIII, refused to eat food cooked by her.The Champawat education department officials, however, cited procedural lapses in her appointment as the reason for her ouster.She was replaced by an upper caste woman.In retaliation, 23 Dalit students of the school refused to consume the mid-day meal prepared by the new cook.Tomar, for his part, said an inquiry has been initiated and the report is expected in a week.After the news about the ouster of the Dalit cook made headlines, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Pradeep Tamta said his party will launch an agitation to restore the woman’s Constitutional rights.Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan said his outfit will gherao Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami if the Dalit woman was not re-instated.

26-12-2021||Lucknow||Want to manufacture BrahMos so that no country has audacity to cast evil eye on us: Rajnath||India wants to manufacture BrahMos missiles not to attack anyone but to ensure that no other country has the audacity to cast an evil eye on it, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday stressing the need to maintain nuclear deterrence.Speaking on the occasion, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the stand of the country is clear that it does not provoke first but also does not “spare anyone who provokes it”.“The BrahMos missile and other weapons we are manufacturing are not to attack any other country. It has never been the character of India to attack any other country or grab even an inch of land of any country,” Rajnath said.“We want to manufacture BrahMos on Indian soil so that no country has the audacity to cast an evil eye on India,” he said referring to the missile that is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.“India should have nuclear deterrents so that no country in the world attacks us, and we have shown this,” Rajnath said after laying foundation stones of the Defence Technologies and Test Centre and the BrahMos Manufacturing Centre here.He also slammed Pakistan of carrying out terror attacks in the country.“There is a neighbouring country. It got separated from India sometime back. I don’t know why its intentions vis-a-vis India are always bad. It committed acts of terrorism in Uri and Pulwama,” the defence minister said.“And then our prime minister took a decision and we went to the soil of that country and destroyed terrorist hideouts and when there was a need for airstrikes, we did that successfully,” he said.“We gave the message that if somebody dares to cast an evil eye on us, then not just on this side of the border, but we can go to the other side and hit them. This is India’s strength,” Rajnath added.India carried out cross-border strikes in September 2016 and February 2019 in response to terror attacks in Uri and Pulwama.The defence minister praised Adityanath for expediting land acquisition for the projects.“When I spoke to Yogiji and expressed the desire to establish this project, he did not take a second and said land will be made available at the earliest. I thank the chief minister for making 200 acres available in just one and a half months,” he said.Rajnath said the projects are important from the security point of view and hoped that Uttar Pradesh will be able to get a special place in terms of defence manufacturing units.“This will provide jobs to people living in Lucknow and in UP. I can see that a new chapter has been added to the economy of Uttar Pradesh,” he added.Rajnath also praise Adityanath for action against criminals.“Yogijee shows large-heartedness in everything but he shows miserliness (‘kanjoosee’) in one thing, he does not give any concessions to the mafia. Everywhere, bulldozers are being run. This is a ‘balle-balle’ (good) time not for the criminals, but for bulldozer owners,” Rajnath said.He said due it, investors from across the globe are coming to UP to invest.Rajnath also praised PM Narendra Modi for revamping Hindu temples.“The Kashi Vishwanath Dham was damaged by invaders. Ahilyabai Holkar revamped it, Maharaja Ranjeet Singh put a cover of gold over it and Modiji gave a grand look to it. Yogiji also played an important role in it,” he said.Adityanath on this occasion said the manufacturing of the Brahmos missiles in Lucknow will help India become self-reliant in the area of defence.“India is the biggest democracy in the world and we have always given the message of friendship and peace to the world,” he said.“This does not mean that we will allow the lives of our 135 crore people come under danger,” he said.“This new India does not provoke (others) but does not spares if it is provoked,” he said.Adityanath added that the project is not only an effort to make India self-reliant but also caters to the defence and security needs of other countries.

26-12-2021||Bhopal||Saregama says ‘will change’ lyrics, name of ‘Madhuban’ song following outrage over Sunny Leone's video||Music label Saregama on Sunday said the company will “change” the lyrics and the name of the song “Madhuban” after Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra alleged that the video of the track has hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.The minister on Sunday had warned actor Sunny Leone, who stars in the video, and singers Shaarib and Toshi to apologise and withdraw their song ‘Madhuban mein Radhika, jaise jungle me nache mor’ within three days or else face action.“In light of the recent feedback & respecting the sentiments of our fellow countrymen, we will be changing the lyrics & the name of the song Madhuban.“The new song will replace the old one across all platforms over the next 3 days,” Saregama, which had released the aforementioned song on its YouTube channel on December 22, said in a brief statement.Mishra, who is also the Madhya Pradesh government spokesperson, had said Hindus worship Maa Radha and the song had hurt the sentiments of the people.“Some vidharmis are constantly hurting Hindu sentiments. The video ‘Madhuban me Radhika nache’ is one such condemnable attempt. I am warning Sunny Leone ji, Shaarib and Toshi ji to understand. If they don’t remove the song after apologising in three days, then we will take action against them,” Mishra told reporters when asked about the song.The song, which was released last week, is composed and sung by Shaarib and Toshi featuring Kanika Kapoor and Arindam Chakraborty.On December 22, Leone had tweeted, “New Song Alert, Party Vibes only with #Madhuban!”, while sharing the video of the song ‘Madhuban me Radhika, jaise jungle me nache mor’.The initial few words of this song match with the iconic ‘Madhuban mein Radhika naache re’ song from the 1960 film “Kohinoor”. That song was sung by late singing legend Mohammed Rafi and featured late actor Dilip Kumar.On Saturday, priests in Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura had demanded a ban on this latest video album of Leone, accusing the Bollywood actor of hurting their religious sentiments by performing an “obscene” dance on the song ‘Madhuban mein Radhika nache’.In October this year, Mishra had issued a 24-hour ultimatum to fashion and jewellery designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee to withdraw an advertisement with “objectionable and obscene” portrayal of mangalsutra or else face statutory action. The designer had later withdrawn this advertisement.Similarly, a few days before that, Dabur India Private Limited had withdrawn its Fem cream bleach advertisement, which showed same-sex couple celebrating ‘Karva Chauth’ and watching each other through a sieve, after the MP home minister termed the ad as objectionable and warned of taking legal steps against the company. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remove-madhuban-mein-radhika-music-video-in-3-days-or-face-action-mp-minister-warns-sunny-leone-singers-354684

26-12-2021||Vijay Mohan||DRDO explores plant-based compounds to tackle muscular impairment at high altitude||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 26The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is exploring the feasibility of using plant-based compounds to counter skeletal muscle  impairments individuals deployed in high altitude areas.Known as polyphenols, certain plant-based compounds have shown anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and appear to mainly act by reversing oxidative stress and cell membrane dysfunction to eventually ameliorate skeletal muscle impairments.Polyphenols, abundantly available in edible plants, have shown great potential in therapeutics and are vital for health as they regulate metabolic disorders, chronic illness, obesity, cancer, etc. Recent research has also portrayed polyphenols as a performance enhancer.“The available literature recommends that bio-active polyphenols with their potential anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties could be a probable solution for high altitude induced skeletal muscle impairments and thereby improving performance,” a study published recently by scientists at DRDO’s Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences has suggested.Pointing out that hypobaric hypoxia induced skeletal muscle responses show a dynamic feature that is dependent on the duration of hypoxic exposure and availability of oxygen percentage, the study observed that skeletal muscles are tolerant to hypoxia to a certain limit, that is, 2,000-3,000 metres. Climbing over 3,500 metres engenders severe oxidative muscle damage and decline in physical performance, which demands a promising therapeutic agent, the study said.Hypobaric hypoxia is explained as a medical condition resulting from deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the body tissues in an environment where the atmospheric pressure is low due to the increase in altitude. Apart from naturally occurring compounds, synthetic or laboratory produced therapeutic agents to mitigate such muscular degeneration are also under investigation.Extreme environmental conditions prevailing in extreme environmental conditions at high altitude induce skeletal muscle atrophy in unacclimatised persons, impair skeletal muscle physiology, decrease regeneration and decelerate physical activity. This is because of lower levels of atmospheric oxygen, which is a very essential ingredient for cellular aerobic respiration, enzyme activity and protein synthesis.Turmeric, red grapes, berries, peanuts, rhodiola and green tea are some of the examples listed in the study which contain significant amounts of polyphenols, like curcumin, catechins, resveratrol, quercetin, salidroside which are believed to have significant therapeutic potential.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-explores-plant-based-compounds-to-tackle-muscular-impairment-at-high-altitude-354675

26-12-2021||Bhopal||OBC quota: MP Cabinet decides to withdraw ordinance related to panchayat polls||In the wake of the Supreme Court order staying the poll process on seats reserved for OBCs in the Madhya Pradesh panchayat elections, the state Cabinet on Sunday decided to withdraw an ordinance brought to annul the process of delimitation and reservation rotation set by the previous government in 2019.The Cabinet’s decision to withdraw the ordinance is likely to pave the way for cancellation of the panchayat poll process in the state. The present BJP government in MP had brought the ordinance last month to annul the process of delimitation and reservation rotation set by the previous Congress-led government in 2019.On the basis of this ordinance, the panchayat election process was started as per the delimitation and reservation rotation of 2014. “After the Supreme Court’s decision, the state cabinet has decided to request the governor to withdraw this ordinance,” MP Panchayat Minister Mahendra Singh Sisodiya told reporters.He accused the opposition Congress of scuttling the process by repeatedly going to the high court and the Supreme Court over the issue of delimitation and reservation rotation.“Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is committed to provide reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs),” the minister said.Notably, the Madhya Pradesh Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution, which stated that no panchayat polls will be held in the state without reservation for the OBCs.CM Chouhan, who is also the Leader of the House, proposed the resolution saying the state government wants every section of the society to get justice.The Supreme Court earlier this month stayed the poll process on seats reserved for OBCs in the panchayat elections in MP and re-notified these seats for the general category.The SC ruling came after Congress leader Manmohan Nagar, president of the Bhopal jila panchayat, approached the apex court pleading that the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh violated the constitutional provisions on reservation rotation and delimitation for the panchayat polls.A day after the SC’s order, the State Election Commission (SEC) had decided to postpone the panchayat election process on the seats reserved for OBCs.Before the SC’s order, a total of 155 posts of members of jila panchayats, 1,273 members of janpad panchayats, 4,058 sarpanchs, and 64,353 posts of panch were reserved for OBCs during this election process.On December 4, the SEC had announced polling for 859 posts of district panchayats across 52 districts in MP, 6,727 posts under 313 Janpad Panchayats, Sarpanchs of 22,581 village panchayats and 3,62,754 posts of Panch members will be held in three phases - on January 6, January 28 and February 16.

26-12-2021||Bengaluru||Omicron scare: Night curfew imposed in Karnataka from 10 pm to 5 am till January 7||Amid fresh COVID-19 concerns, the Karnataka government on Sunday decided to impose “night curfew” for 10 days from December 28, between 10 PM to 5 AM.The government has also banned all New Year parties and gatherings at public places.“From December 28 onwards, for ten days (till January 7 morning) to begin with, we would like to observe by calling a night curfew, from night 10 PM to the next morning 5 AM.....So there won’t be any activities post 10 PM during these days,” Sudhakar said.Speaking to reporters after a high-level meeting of senior Ministers, officials and the COVID technical advisory committee, chaired by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, he said there is a curb on external functions and gatherings for the New Year.“There will be no functions or parties in the external premises, especially for those celebrating with DJs and large gatherings. They have been completely banned in Karnataka,” he said, adding that places like eateries, hotels, pubs, clubs and restaurants can have 50 per cent of their seating capacity.The Minister, in response to a question, further said, the announcements made were the first stage. On analyzing the situation after ten days, the Chief Minister, after discussing with experts, will decide if further measures and curbs are necessary. There has been a steady increase in the number of COVID-19 clusters in the state and in the number of Omicron variant’s infections, with its tally in Karnataka now standing at 38.The government’s order today on additional containment measures said that “in the wake of dynamic situation, it is imperative that additional containment measures be imposed proactively to break the chain of transmission in the state.”  According to the order, all gatherings, meetings, conferences, including marriages, from December 28 should strictly limit the number of participants to 300 people. It mandates organizers to  strictly enforce COVID appropriate behavior.There shall also be intensive patrolling and surveillance at all bordering districts adjoining Maharashtra and Kerala to prevent the spread of virus, particularly the Omicron variant in the state.The order further states that during night curfew, the movement of individuals shall remain strictly prohibited, except for essential activities, patients and their attendants, industries and companies requiring night operations, vehicles carrying goods, bus, trains, metro, air travel, home delivery and e-commerce operations, among others.Employees of companies working during night shifts can move around with a valid ID card. Movement of passengers for the sake of travel through bus, trains and air will be allowed on displaying valid travel documents or tickets.The order also states that only essential staff or employees of IT and ITeS companies shall work from the office, while the rest will work from home.According to the Minister, the meeting discussed threadbare various issues regarding preventive measures of the new variant Omicron, its probable effects and what could be the preventive measures that have to be imposed from now,based on data and studies received.“We have discussed various issues, right from preventive measures, vaccinating the entire eligible community in the state and the preparedness of the health department to combat the pandemic and the new variant if it really expands and increases,” he said.Noting that Karnataka has achieved 97 per cent of COVID vaccination in the first dose and 75 per cent in the second, Sudhakar said, the Chief Minister has directed that the emphasis should now be on achieving 100 per cent in the first dose, at the earliest.“Similarly for the second dose, we will ensure that those districts that are lagging behind will have special measures to ensure ramping up of vaccination in those areas.”  There are about 45 lakh people in the state who have surpassed their due dates of the second dose, he said, adding that the stress, emphasis and the thrust will be on ensureing that they come forward and fully vaccinate themselves.Welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to allow vaccination for children between the age group of 15 to 18 years, the Health Minister said they will get the first dose of vaccination from January 3, and added that the state has estimated about 43 lakh children under this category.“The Chief Minister will launch this vaccination drive in the state, while Ministers and legislators will launch in their respective districts and constituencies...we would like to vaccinate at the earliest,” he said.Similarly as announced by the PM, health care workers, front line workers and those above 60-years with comorbidities will get third dose of vaccination, also called as booster or preventive dose, starting from  January 10.     “We will take this seriously and would like to complete the third dose in a record time.”  On the preparedness of the Health department for any eventualities, Sudhakar said 3,191 ICU beds would be added to the existing about 4,000 beds.“In all we will be having more than 7,000 ICU beds, “he said. Similarly oxygenated beds will also be added to existing 30,000 such beds, the minister said.

26-12-2021||Silchar (Assam)||Miscreants disrupt Christmas celebration in Assam town||Miscreants disrupted a Christmas programme in Silchar in Assam’s Cachar district, demanding that Hindus should shun the celebrations, a senior police official said on Sunday. Seven youths involved in the incident that happened on Saturday evening have been detained so far, she added. Cachar superintendent of police Ramandeep Kaur told PTI that the incident occurred during Christmas celebration in an open field in the town. “Some boys went to the venue and asked other Hindus to not participate in the celebration. They did not object to the Christians celebrating the occasion,” she said.  Kaur further said police have not received complaint against the incident, though it has detained the youths involved. “We are looking into the incident. We don’t have any inputs on involvement of any group so far,” the SP added. Locals however claimed the miscreants were associated with the Bajrang Dal. According to eyewitness reports, the youths were wearing saffron scarfs and chanted ‘Jai Shri Ram’ as they started manhandling people present at the venue. The incident happened at around 9 pm when the venue was crowded with people from across the town joining the celebrations. Many people were busy taking selfies and photographs, when the trouble started. When revellers questioned the youths on why they objected to the celebration, the miscreants reportedly told them that as Hindus they should be celebrating ‘Tulsi Diwas’ which coincides with Christmas Day. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/miscreants-disrupt-christmas-celebration-in-assam-town-354658
26-12-2021||Dang||Teenage girl gang-raped in Gujarat’s Dang; 9 held||Police have arrested six men and detained three minors in connection with the alleged gang-rape a 14-year-old girl in Gujarat’s Dang district, an official said on Sunday.The incident took place around two months back, but came to light recently when a relative of the girl came across a video of the crime on a social media platform. The purported act was recorded by one of the accused on his mobile phone and later circulated on social media, he said.The girl was allegedly raped first by a minor friend in Ahwa taluka while he was accompanying her back home from a neighbouring village after attending a marriage function, police inspector N H Savseta said.Eight other friends of the boy, who were waiting en-route, later took her forcefully to a nearby forest where two of them allegedly raped her, the official said.Out of the nine accused, six are in their early 20s and three are minors, he said.One of the accused recorded a video of the act on his mobile phone before all of them fled on seeing some people coming in their direction, he said.“Before leaving, they threatened the girl not to inform about the incident to anybody. The girl remained silent for about two months. Recently, one of her relatives came across the gang-rape video and informed her parents. They then approached the police and an FIR was lodged on December 23,” the official said.“All the nine accused were arrested on December 24. The guardians of the three minors secured their bail, while the six men were sent to police remand by a court,” he said.The case was registered against the accused under various Indian Penal Code Sections, including 376 (D)(A) (gang rape on minor), 506 (2) (criminal intimidation), 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) and 114 (abettor present when offence committed), he said.The accused were also booked under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Information Technology Act, the official said, adding that further investigation into the case was underway.

26-12-2021||New Delhi||TMC, AAP ‘fracturing’ non-BJP vote in Goa; only Congress has capacity to beat BJP: Chidambaram||The TMC and AAP are “fracturing” the non-BJP vote in Goa, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Sunday and asserted that only his party has the capacity to defeat the saffron party.Chidambaram, who is the Congress’ senior election observer for the Goa Assembly polls, also said that loyalty to the party and the electorate is the first criterion for selecting candidates for the elections and expressed confidence that when elected, they will remain loyal to both the party as well as the electorate.His remarks come days after the party’s state working president, Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, resigned as a Member of the Legislative Assembly, reducing the party’s strength to two in the 40-member House. Lourenco has joined the TMC.Earlier this month, former Goa chief minister Ravi Naik resigned as Congress MLA. A few months back, ex-CM Luizinho Faleiro had also quit the Congress and joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC).In an interview with PTI, Chidambaram said the only party that has deep roots in all the 40 constituencies of Goa is the Congress and the people know that it is only the Congress that has the capacity to defeat the BJP despite the latter’s “money power and misuse of state power”.Asked about the recent resignations from the Congress with some quitting to join the TMC, including Lourenco, and the Mamata Banerjee-led outfit adopting an aggressive pitch in the state, Chidambaram said it is not for him to comment on the motive or strategy of any party, and stressed that only two Congress MLAs have joined the TMC. “Ninety nine per cent of Congress workers remain with the Congress.  I am not unhappy that Mr Reginaldo Lourenco defected to the TMC. The TMC has taken a losing candidate from our hands and, if it fields him in the election, he will remain a losing candidate,” the former Union minister said.The Congress workers and the voters of Curtorim constituency are determined to defeat Lourenco, Chidambaram said.Asked whether he believes that the TMC is helping the BJP and the Mamata Banerjee-led party along with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is acting as the BJP’s B-teams, Chidambaram said, “I do not comment on the motives of any party. In a straight fight between the BJP and the Congress in 2022, the Congress will emerge as a clear winner.”   “The TMC and AAP are fracturing the non-BJP vote. Whether that will benefit the BJP, I cannot say,” he said.On whether the Congress would announce a chief ministerial face ahead of polls, Chidambaram pointed out that he has said that after all the Congress candidates are announced, in consultation with them, “we will take a call whether it is desirable to announce a CM candidate before the election”.That option is open, he added.Talking about the poll preparations and the Congress’ standing in Goa, he said the Congress’ slide took place in 2017 and 2019 when its elected MLAs defected to the BJP.The BJP government in Goa is a government “of defectors, by defectors and for defectors”, Chidambaram alleged.“There is an overwhelming desire for change. The only party that has deep roots in all the 40 constituencies of Goa is the Congress. The people know that it is only the Congress that has the capacity to defeat the BJP despite the latter’s money power and misuse of state power. We hope to do well in the 2022 elections,” Chidambaram said.Asked about the possibility of an exodus of party’s elected leaders following the elections, he said, “Nothing of that sort will happen. We have placed the responsibility of suggesting names of potential candidates on the Block Congress Committees and the Block workers. We have asked them to recommend names based on loyalty, integrity, acceptability to the Congress workers and winnability among the electorate.”    Loyalty to the party and the electorate is the first criterion, Chidambaram asserted.“We will pick a candidate from among the names suggested by the Block Congress Committee of the constituency. We are confident that our candidates, when elected, will remain loyal to the party and the electorate,” he said.On the possibility of alliances, Chidambaram said, “I have found that, in Goa, it is a practice among political parties to talk to each other right up to the elections — and even after the elections!”    “Our Goa PCC leaders have responded to suggestions for talks from other parties including the Goa Forward Party. There are opportunities, risks and bumps. The AICC leadership will take the final decisions,” he said.The Congress had released its first list of eight candidates for the upcoming Assembly elections in Goa last week, fielding former chief minister Digamber Kamat from the Margao constituency.The Congress this week also named Pratapsingh Rane, 82, as the party’s candidate from Goa’s Poriem assembly seat.In the 2017 Goa Assembly elections, the Congress had won 17 seats in the House and emerged as the single largest party. But, the BJP, which had bagged 13 seats, quickly tied-up with some regional parties and independents to form the government in the state.Lourenco’s resignation as Member of the Legislative Assembly on Monday, reduced the party’s strength to two in the 40-member House after a series of resignations over the last few years by the party’s legislators.The AAP had contested the last assembly polls but failed to win a seat. The TMC has entered the poll fray in Goa and has tied-up with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party.

26-12-2021||New Delhi||2021 imprints: SC gets 9 judges, orders probe into Pegasus row; clears decks for Chardham, Central Vista projects||Verdicts ordering probe into alleged use of Pegasus spyware for surveillance, and paving the way for widening of the strategic Chardham highway project near China border and the Central Vista construction were among key imprints of the Supreme Court in 2021.The apex court also for the first time got as many as nine judges in one go including Justice B V Nagarathna, who is poised to become the first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027.The year witnessed change of guard at the top of judiciary with Justice N V Ramana, hailing from an agriculturist family of Ponnavaram village in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district, taking charge as the 48th CJI upon retirement of his predecessor Justice S A Bobde in April. The collegium led by the CJI made a slew of recommendations leading to filling up nine vacant posts in SC and over 100 posts in high courts.For the first time, three women judges—Hima Kohli, Nagarathna and Bela M Trivedi—got the judgeship at the top court. The Justice Ramana-led collegium ended the 21-month-long logjam over appointment of judges to the apex court when nobody was appointed after the superannuation of the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi on November 17, 2019.With the country witnessing an unprecedented second wave of Covid-19, the apex court passed several directions to assuage the miseries of the citizens. But the judiciary lost legal luminary Soli Sorabjee due to coronavirus.  Another sad news came as the top court lost sitting judge Mohan M Shantanagoudar in April.In a significant verdict, the apex court refused to refer to a larger bench to revisit its 29-year-old Mandal verdict, putting cap on quotas at 50 per cent, as it quashed a Maharashtra law granting reservations to Marathas in admissions and government jobs, saying it violated the principle of right to equality.It also said that reservation in favour of Other Backward Classes in local bodies concerned in Maharashtra cannot exceed an aggregate 50 per cent of the total seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and OBCs taken together.Later in the year, it directed the State Election Commission of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to notify the seats reserved for the OBCs in local bodies in these two states for the general category.The Centre got mixed results in 2020 in the apex court which gave the green signal to the strategic Chardham highway project near China border after taking note of security concerns and also junked pleas to stall the ambitious Central Vista Project, covering a three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens’ Delhi.The top court found “no infirmity” in grant of environment clearance and other permissions for the Central Vista and at the fag end, dismissed another plea challenging the change in land use of a plot where new residence of the Vice President is proposed.It also upheld the Centre’s power to extend Sanjay Kumar Mishra’s tenure as Director of the Enforcement Directorate but clarified that extension of officers after the age of superannuation should be done rarely and in exceptional cases.However, it trashed opposition of the government to pleas for probe into alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance and appointed a three-member panel of cyber experts to investigate under the monitoring of former apex court judge R V Raveendran, saying the state cannot get a “free pass” every time the spectre of national security is raised and it cannot be the “bugbear” that the judiciary shies away from.It also intervened to ensure fair probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people including four farmers were killed during a protest as it appointed Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain, former judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, to monitor the investigation of Uttar Pradesh SIT which will also have three IPS officers.The apex court, which took back its 2020 order of extending period of limitation for filing cases due to the pandemic saying the country was returning to normalcy, again found itself in the midst of the brutal second wave and passed a slew of orders on issues ranging from delivery of oxygen, medicines, hospital beds, insurance for frontline workers, helping sex workers, migrant labourers, kids in street situation and those orphaned by Covid-19 and payment of ex-gratia of Rs 50,000 to the next of kin of those who died of the infection.Terming the resurgence of Covid cases as “national crisis”, the CJI even advanced the Supreme Court’s summer vacation and also ordered decongestion of prisons by ordering immediate release of prisoners who were granted bail or parole in 2020.The top court said black marketing of critical Covid-19 drugs and oxygen is a condemnable attempt to exploit peoples’ misery and directed the Centre to consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute offenders.Highlighting the digital divide between rural and urban India, it posed searching queries to the Centre on mandatory registration on CoWIN for Covid jabs, vaccine procurement policy and differential pricing, saying the policy makers must have ears on ground to effectively deal with the unprecedented crisis.At the fag end of the year, the court was dismayed over the poor air quality in Delhi-NCR and asked the Centre-appointed panel to work on finding a permanent solution to the menace.The year also saw the Supreme Court staying till further orders the implementation of three farm laws and constituting a committee to listen to grievances of the protesting farmer unions’, which held an over a year-long protest at Delhi borders, as also make recommendations to resolve the impasse.The three farm laws were subsequently repealed leading to a situation where a clutch of pleas challenging their validity and others against the blockade by farmers in the apex court became infructuous.The much-anticipated corporate battle resulted in a victory for the Tata Group with the top court setting aside appellate tribunal NCLAT’s order which had restored Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of the USD 100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate.In a major victory for US-based e-commerce giant Amazon, the apex court held that Singapore’s Emergency Arbitrator award, restraining the Rs 24,731 crore merger deal of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) with Reliance Retail, is valid and enforceable under Indian arbitration laws.Nine years after taking up cudgels against Supertech, home buyers finally got relief from the top court as it ordered demolition of the under-construction twin 40-storey towers which would have blocked sunlight and fresh air, violating building norms in collusion with NOIDA officials.During the year, it also put the curtains down on suo motu proceedings initiated to probe a “larger conspiracy” behind sexual harassment allegations against former CJI Gogoi in April 2019.It also closed the nine-year-old criminal proceedings that were initiated in India against two Italian marines accused of killing two fishermen off the Kerala coast in February 2012, after Rs 10 crore compensation was paid by Italy to heirs of the deceased and the boat owner.It also said that according to the international arbitral award accepted by India, Italy shall resume further probe in the case against the marines—Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone.In another significant verdict, the top court said the Delhi Assembly and its committee have the power to compel attendance of members and outsiders on grounds of privilege. —

26-12-2021||Amaravati||'Judges appointing judges' a widely propagated myth: Chief Justice of India NV Ramana||The notion that “judges are themselves appointing judges” is a myth as the judiciary is just one of the many players involved in the process of selecting judicial officers, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana said on Sunday.He was delivering the fifth Sri Lavu Venkatewarlu Endowment Lecture on “Indian Judiciary - Challenges of future” at Siddhartha Law College, Vijayawada.He also said that in recent times, physical attacks on judicial officers are on the rise and at times, there are concerted campaigns in the print and social media against judges if parties do not get a favourable order while these attacks appear to be “sponsored and synchronised.” There is a need to liberate the institution of public prosecutors. Total independence must be granted to them and to make them answerable only to the Courts, he further said.“It is nowadays fashionable to reiterate phrases such as ‘judges are themselves appointing judges’. I consider this to be one of the widely propagated myths. The fact is the Judiciary is merely one of the many players involved in the process,” Justice Ramana said.Recently, Kerala MP John Brittas had reportedly said during a debate in Parliament on The High Court and Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill, 2021, that Judges appointing judges is unheard of anywhere.“Many authorities are involved, including the Union Law Ministry, State Governments, Governor, High Court Collegia, Intelligence Bureau, and lastly, the topmost executive, who all are designated to examine the suitability of a candidate. I am sad to note that the well-informed also propagate the aforesaid notion. After all, this narrative suits certain sections,” Justice Ramana said.Appreciating the Centre for its efforts on appointing more judges, he said, some recommendations made by High Courts are yet to be transmitted to the Supreme Court by the Union Law Ministry. It is expected that the government needs to strictly adhere to the timelines laid down in the Malik Mazhar Case.The law enforcing agencies, particularly the specialised agencies, need to deal with malicious attacks on judiciary effectively, the CJI said, adding that it was unfortunate that unless the court interfered and passed orders, the authorities generally do not proceed with the investigation.“Governments are expected and duty bound to create a secure environment so that the judges and judicial officers can function fearlessly,” he said.New media tools have enormous amplifying ability, but appear to be incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad and the real and fake. Media trials cannot be a guiding factor in deciding cases, he further said.He said historically, prosecutors in India have been under the control of the government.“Hence, it is not a surprise that they do not act independently. They do nothing to prevent frivolous and non-deserving cases from reaching the courts. Public prosecutors automatically oppose bail applications without independently applying their mind. They attempt to suppress evidence during trial which could benefit the accused,” Justice Ramana said.A holistic rework needs to be undertaken. In order to insulate the public prosecutors, an independent selection committee may be constituted for their appointment. Best practices should be adopted after a comparative analysis of other jurisdictions, he opined.While making legislations, law makers must also think of providing effective remedies for issues which may arise out of the law and yet these principles seemingly are being ignored, he opined.Citing the Bihar Prohibition Act in 2016 which resulted in the High Court being filled with a lot of bail applications, Justice Ramana said lack of foresight in legislating can directly result in the blockage of courts.

26-12-2021||New Delhi||Gap between 2nd Covid vaccine shot and precaution dose 'likely' to be 9-12 months||The gap between the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine and the third, which is being called a “precaution dose”, is likely to be nine to 12 months, official sources said on Sunday.The nitty-gritty of the gaps for the vaccines currently being used in India’s inoculation programme— Covishield and Covaxin—is being worked out, and a final decision over this will be taken soon, they said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised address to the nation on Saturday night, announced that vaccination against Covid-19 for children between 15-18 years will start from January 3, while “precaution dose” for healthcare and frontline workers would be administered from January 10.The decisions came amid rising Covid cases linked to the Omicron variant of the virus.Modi said the precaution dose will also be available for citizens above 60 years of age and with comorbidities on the advice of their doctor from January 10 next year as well.The precaution dose denotes a third dose of the vaccine for the fully vaccinated but Modi refrained from using the term “booster dose”, as it is generally referred.“The gap between the second and the precautionary dose of Covid vaccine is likely to be nine to 12 months with the immunisation division and the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) discussing on these lines,” a source said.More than 61 per cent of India’s adult population has received both doses of the vaccine. Similarly, about 90 per cent of the adult population has received the first dose.With the administration of 32,90,766 vaccine doses in the last 24 hours, the cumulative Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country have exceeded 141.37 crore, as per provisional reports till 7 am. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gap-between-2nd-covid-vaccine-shot-and-precaution-dose-likely-to-be-9-12-months-354650
