10-12-2021||---||State force should never be used to browbeat political opinion, journalists: SC||New Delhi, December 10State force should never be used to either browbeat a political opinion or journalists, the Supreme Court has said, calling for "introspection from the political class across the country" over debasement in dialogue which is taking place even as it asked scribes to be more responsible in the “Twitter age”.A bench comprising Justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh made these observations while quashing the FIRs against editors of a news web portal and others, in connection with articles published in West Bengal.In a country that prides itself on its diversity, there are bound to be different perceptions and opinions which would include political opinions, the apex court said.That is the very essence of a democracy, it said.“State force should never be used to either browbeat a political opinion or the journalists suffer the consequences of what is already in the public domain. We hasten to add that this does not take away the responsibility of journalists in how they report the matters, more so in the 'Twitter age',” the bench said.The observations came after senior advocate Siddhartha Dave, appearing on behalf of the West Bengal government, informed the bench that the state has decided to withdraw the FIRs registered against Nupur J Sharma, the editor of English language Opindia.com, YouTuber Ajeet Bharti and others including its founder and CEO.The top court said that it was not inclined to let go of the opportunity of saying something that is troubling the society and the court.“It is undoubtedly the debasement in the dialogue that is taking place which needs introspection from the political class across the country. In a country that prides itself on its diversity, there are bound to be different perceptions and opinions which would include political opinions.“The present proceedings in a way emanate from the same. We say so as what the petitioners have done is to reproduce what the political class has stated against each other and which is already in the public domain, an aspect pointed out eminently by senior counsel for the petitioners,” it said.The bench said that no doubt by the very nature of the job required to be performed by the political class, at times their exchanges may get heated.“But it should not explode. We are sure difference in perceptions can be expressed in better language,” it said in its order uploaded today.The top court had earlier stayed further proceedings in a fresh FIR lodged in West Bengal against them.On June 26 last year, the top court had stayed further proceedings in three FIRs lodged in West Bengal against petitioners.In their intervention application, Sharma and others had said that they are constrained to move the top court due to persistent hounding and victimisation by the West Bengal government, who in its endeavour to scuttle inconvenient media reports registered multiple FIRs against them.The application had further said, "That the order dated June 26, 2020, came as a respite to the petitioners whose honour, life and liberty were sought to be repeatedly undermined by the state..." However, "it appears that the respondents are unrelenting in the efforts to persecute the petitioners/ applicants as the petitioners/applicants have recently on August 5, been served with a notice under section 41A of the CrPC from CID, West Bengal concerning FIR registered with Bhadreshwar police station, it had said.It had said that the FIR relates to media reports published in 'opindia.com' about Telenipara communal riots of May 2020 and were registered contemporaneously around the same time as FIRs, which forms the subject matter of the writ petition.The petitioners had said the FIR came to their notice only on the receipt of the notice under section 41 CrPC on August 5 this year requiring them to appear before the investigating officer on August 13, but later the investigating officer through an email dated August 12 asked the petitioner to appear on August 23.They had sought a stay on the investigation emanating from the FIR registered at Bhadreshwar police station and the notice issued to them for appearing before the investigating officer. They had also sought quashing of the FIR.On June 26 last year, the apex court, while staying the three FIRs, issued notices to the West Bengal government and the Centre seeking their replies on the plea.The main writ petition filed by Sharma and others including the founder and CEO of the news portal and the editor of its Hindi language publications claimed that the West Bengal government and its "authoritarian Kolkata Police" are misusing FIRs and "brute police powers" to intimidate journalists."The petitioners are constrained to invoke the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this court under Article 32 of the Constitution against the patently extortionist and mala fide actions of the Government of West Bengal to impose illegal censorship in the state by threatening, scuttling, and gagging honest media houses through misuse of state police," the plea claimed.The petitioners had claimed they were informed that the cause of one of the FIRs lodged by police was an article published by the news web portal on the issue of alleged hiding of data related to COVID-19.The plea had claimed that one of the FIRs lodged pertained to a news report published by the web portal in October last year.It alleged that to undermine the freedom of the press, the state has rather chosen to "hound down" the petitioners by registering multiple FIRs in order to "bargain for deletion of news articles by putting the petitioner's life and liberty at bait".It had claimed the state and the police are not only intimidating the journalists but also threatening their family members to seek deletion of media reports which bring to the public notice "the actual state of affairs in the state of West Bengal during these difficult times".It had also alleged that the police had intimidated some of the petitioners to get the news articles deleted."Accordingly, the officers while insulting and demeaning the petitioner no. 1, asked her to use her influence to get the articles removed or to face the brunt of state's political executives," it had claimed.The plea had claimed that deleting any content from the internet has a nationwide effect and any decision to delete any content has to be left to be taken by the Centre and not by state governments.It had also sought a direction to exclude the role of police in the matter of deletion of content on the internet particularly since there exists a regulatory mechanism for overseeing such content and restricting any mischievous contents. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/state-force-should-never-be-used-to-browbeat-political-opinion-journalists-sc-348740

10-12-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws: No farmer died due to police action during year-long protests, says govt||The Union government on Friday said that no farmer died due to police action during the year-long protests by farmers.Various farmer groups were protesting against three new farm laws, which have now been scrapped. The year-long protest at the Delhi borders was suspended by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Thursday after the Union government accepted their key pending demands, including withdrawal of police cases against the protesters and on Minimum Support Price (MSP).In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said: “The subject of compensation, etc., to the families of the deceased farmers in the farmers movement is with the concerned state governments”.“No farmer died as a result of police action during the farmers’ agitation,” he said.Tomar was responding to a joint question by Congress leader Dhiraj Prasad Sahu and AAP leader Sanjay Singh.The members had asked whether the government is planning to provide or made any provision towards livelihood monetary compensation to the families of the farmers who died during farmers’ protests.Opposition parties, including the Congress, have been raising the issue of deaths of farmers during the year-long protests.The SKM, which suspended the protests after receiving a formal letter from the Union government accepting their key pending demands, on Thursday also said that farmers would celebrate December 11 as ‘Vijay Diwas’ and take out victory marches following which they will head home. The SKM is an umbrella body of 40 farm unions.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, were protesting at various Delhi borders from late November 2020, seeking repeal of the three farm laws.On November 29, Parliament passed a Bill to repeal the three laws.Replying to separate queries on the MSP, Tomar said, “a formal formation of a committee to promote zero budgeting based agriculture, to change crop pattern as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent is under consideration.”     Asked if the government proposes to bring a law to give legal guarantee to MSP for every crop as recommended by Swaminathan Commission, the minister said the government has already implemented in 2018-19 the recommendation made by the National Commission on Farmers (NCF) to fix MSP at at least 50 per cent profit on weighted average cost of production.The Centre fixes MSP for 22 mandated agricultural crops and Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).The MSP for toria and de-husked coconut are also announced based on the MSP of rapeseed and mustard and copra, respectively.

10-12-2021||Oting (Nagaland)||Eerie calm in Oting a week after killing by security forces||There is an eerie calm in Oting village in Nagaland’s Mon district, where despite the approaching Christmas there are no buntings or traditional decorations. Visitors to this remote hilly place are instead greeted with the sight of a lone white banner flapping in the air in memory of the13 hapless young mine workers who fell victim to bullets sprayed at them by security forces a week ago in a botched counter-insurgency operation.The calm speaks of the shock, sorrow, and tension after the brutal killing, and villagers, yet to come to grips with the tragedy, have put restrictions on accessing the site or visitors speaking to the bereaved families for the last two days. What strikes a visitor in this hour of grief is the famed Naga hospitality.A community kitchen has been opened since the incident and all visitors—ranging from government officers, the police, tribesmen and journalists are offered a meal of steamed rice, yellow dal, meat, and pickle besides drinking water and black tea.“It is a massive tragedy. We appreciate the concern shown by everyone. We hope we get justice for the bereaved families,” an elderly inhabitant of the village told PTI on Friday.He is, however, firm on visitors not being allowed to meet the victims’ families.“The people coming from outside insist on meeting them. They make the families recount the horror over and over again. We decided to put a stop to it as there is no point in making them relive the painful loss,” he said.Another villager, who identified himself at Kheatwang Konyak, tries to explain that the villagers are not against people coming to Oting at this time. “We are coordinating with the visitors and providing whatever information or help they need. Earlier, visitors moved around alone, now we are only streamlining it”.He adds: “We lost innocent lives in the incident. Families have been shattered. God knows when we can move on from such a tragedy”. Near the hall where food is being served to visitors, villagers sit huddled in a meeting, to which outsiders are disallowed.When asked, Apo and Alem, who are among the girls of the village who have volunteered to work at the kitchen, said: “We have been busy helping. The impact of our loss as a community is yet to sink in”.Later, Kheatwang, who accompanied this correspondent to the incident site, which is about 10 km from the village, said that the central government’s claim that the youths were gunned down as their pickup van did not stop at check points and that they tried to flee is not acceptable to the villagers.He points to the road, which is practically a mud track connecting the village to the incident site and is barely wide enough to allow the passage of a single vehicle. “You can see for yourself. It is not possible for any vehicle to go beyond 10-20 km per hour on this road”.He vehemently disagrees that the pickup van had not stopped at check points because “there are no check points at all, baring the one at the entrance of Oting village. Besides, the van was coming from the opposition direction”.   Pointing to the lone army vehicle, which escaped being torched by angry villagers on that fateful Saturday evening, Kheatwang said: “The bodies of the six victims who were gunned down were taken from the pickup van and loaded like luggage pieces at the back of this van”. The pickup still lies at the incident site along with three other burnt Army vehicles, including the one used to carry the hapless victims—mute testimonies to one of the worst incidents of killing of civilians by the security forces.The area is naturally cordoned off and a platoon of Nagaland police stands in guard.Local villagers give company to the policemen to ensure that there is no attempt to tamper with any evidence by any person.Besides the six villagers in the pickup van who were killed in the firing on December 4, another seven were killed by the Army in violence involving irate locals at the incident site later that day. One Army personnel was also killed in the melee.Another civilian was killed when a mob attacked an Assam Rifles camp at Mon town on Sunday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eerie-calm-in-oting-a-week-after-killing-by-security-forces-348731

The government has also advised regarding treatment in designated Covid facility with separate earmarked isolation area for Omicron patients, he said.They have been advised to monitor re-infection, breakthrough infections besides ensuring prompt investigation by Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) into new cluster of COVID-19 cases, he said.       Under the Emergency COVID Response Package- II (ECRP-II), states have been asked to assess the availability of healthcare infrastructure, including paediatric, such as ICU beds, oxygen beds etc, the official said.                         They have also been asked to revisit existing home isolation protocol and strengthen monitoring mechanism through special teams, call-centres and e-Sanjeevani, he said.“We have asked states to ensure proper functioning of PSA plants, ventilators, oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and conduct refresher trainings on PSAs, ventilators, rational use of oxygen, PPEs, N-95, etc,” Agarwal said.They have been asked to ensure seamless hospitalisation processes and availability of ambulances, review availability of medicines and maintain buffer stock, he said.“Our focus is to reduce exposure, stop transmission of the disease and stop the mortality in the country. We want to do this with community engagement,” Agarwal said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mask-usage-declining-we-have-again-entered-danger-zone-govt-warns-amid-omicron-scare-348727

His religion, caste, holidays... I am not interested,” the lawyer said.The high court accepted Chinoy’s statement but also made it clear that Malik shall not make any comments on Sameer Wankhede’s past conduct in discharge of official duty. Any comments must be restricted to the present or future, the court said.The court also suggested that counsels of both the parties must advise them to “put an end to this.”  Chinoy said he wished he could, but the issue was “very complex.”  On November 29, the division bench had quashed the November 22 order of a single judge who had refused to restrain the minister from making defamatory statements against the Wankhedes while the defamation suit was heard.Malik then gave an undertaking that he will not make public statements or post anything on social media against the Wankhede family.The court also asked Dnyandev Wankhede to file a rejoinder (additional) affidavit by January 3, 2022.Dnyandev has filed a defamation suit against Malik and sought damages of Rs 1.25 crore, alleging that the NCP leader launched a smear campaign against his family after Malik’s son-in-law was arrested by the NCB in a drugs case earlier  this year.On Friday, HC extended the time granted to Malik to file his affidavit before the single bench up to Tuesday.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nawab-malik-apologises-to-bombay-hc-for-making-comments-against-wankhede-family-despite-giving-undertaking-348707
10-12-2021||---||PM Modi asks democratic world to jointly frame norms for social media, crypto-currency||New Delhi, December 10Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asked the democratic world to join hands in framing norms for social media and crypto-currency so that they are used to empower democracy and not to undermine it.“By working together, democracies can meet the aspirations of citizens and celebrate the democratc spirit of humanity. India stands ready to join the democracies in this nobel endeavour,” the Prime Minister said during his national statement at the Summit of Democracy hosted by US President Joe BIden.The PM noted that different parts of world have followed different paths of democratic development but there is much that each can learn from the other. “We all need to constantly need to improve our democratic practices and systems. And, we all need to continuously enhance inclusion, transparency, human dignity, responsive grievance redressal and decentralisation of power. In this context, today’s assembly provides a timely platform for furthering cooperation among democracies.“India would be happy to share its expertise in holding free and fair elections and enhancing transparency in all areas of governance through innovative digital solutions,” offered the Prime Minister.PM Modi began his intervention by pointing out that the democratic spirit is integral to our civilisational ethos. Elected republican city states such as Licchavi and Shakya flourished in India as far as 2,500 years back. The same democratic spirit is seen in 10th century Uttaramerur inscription that codified the principles of democratic participation.“This very democratic spirit and ethos had made ancient India one of the most the most prosperous. Centuries of colonial rule could not suppress the democratic spirit of Indian people. It again found full expression with India’s Independence and led to an unparalleled story in democratic nation building over the last 75 years. It is a story of unprecedented socio-economic inclusion in all spheres. It’s a story of constant improvements. In health, education and human well being at an unimaginable scale“The India story has one clear message to the world – that democracy can deliver; that democracy has delivered and that democracy will continue to deliver,” he observed.The structural features like multi party elections, independent judiciary and free media are important instruments of democracy. However, the basic strength of democracy is the spirit and ethos that lies within citizens and societies. “Democracy is not of only of the people, by the people, for the people but also with the people, within the people,” said the Prime Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-asks-democratic-world-to-jointly-frame-norms-for-social-media-crypto-currency-348705

One IAF personnel survived the crash and is undergoing treatment in Bengaluru.On Friday, Y Joe Alias Kutty, who on Wednesday recorded the video of the helicopter, said to be the ill-fated one, apparently moments before it crashed, attributed bad weather and poor visibility to the mishap.Kutty (52) is a wedding photographer from the city and had recorded the video on his mobile phone. The video has since gone viral in the social media.He and his friend Nazar, along with the latter’s family, had gone to Katteri area for clicking photographs and out of curiosity, Joe had videographed the ill-fated helicopter.Noting that Nazar had come with his family members on a tour to Udhagamandalam (Ooty) that day, Kutty said they were walking along the mountain train track near Katteri as the women members were posing for photographs and videos.As he heard the sound of the helicopter, Kutty started shooting video and found the chopper disappearing into the fog and soon heard a big sound, the duo told reporters here.Even as they tried to reach the hill, a police team arrived at the spot and stopped them from moving further, they said.Though they tried to reach the officials in the offices of district collectorate and SP that day, they were unable to convey the message.“However, we shared the footage with a police official,” they said.Meanwhile, all shops, commercial establishments and hotels downed their shutters in Nilgiris district as a mark of respect to the departed.Private buses, tourist taxies and autorickshaws also remained off the road, even as the public arranged events to pay floral tributes to the deceased at various place in the district.

We expect the commission will look into this in a week's time," the bench said.The bench decided to dispose of several intervention pleas, including those filed by builders' body, sugar, rice and paper mills against certain curbs imposed by the commission and others including the top court and asked the panel to decide these issues.The bench, at the outset, said that now there is "slight improvement in the quality of air" and the commission may be allowed to decide the issues pertaining to curbs.Senior advocate Vikas Singh said that now things had got better since the crucial period is over and sought vacation of an earlier order by which the ban on construction activities was re-imposed.“We will not entertain these intervention applications. All these applications will be considered by the commission (air quality) and in consultation with the states, the grant of relaxations will be considered,” the bench said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the commission, said that several long-term measures are in contemplation to deal with the issue of air pollution.

10-12-2021||Vijay Mohan||In letter to his alma mater, sole crash survivor had asked students of Chandimandir Army school never to lose hope||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 10Never lose hope, never think that you cannot be good at what you want to be. It will not come easy, it will take effort. It will require sacrifice of time and comfort. Find your calling, it could be art, music, graphic design. Literature, etc. Whatever you work towards, be dedicated, do your best.This is the message Group Captain Varun Singh, the lone survivor of the Mi-17 helicopter crash that killed Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and 12 others in Tamil Nadu on December 8 had for students of the Army Public School, Chandimandir, where he studied.Gp Capt Varun was an alumnus of the school’s 2000 batch, from where he proceeded to the National Defence Academy, Kharakvasla, before joining the IAF as a fighter pilot. His father was an officer in the Army Air Defence.Soon after he was decorated with the Shaurya Chakra for gallantry, he wrote a letter to the school’s principal on September 18, the contents of which he desired to be shared with students, especially the teens to inspire them as they near adulthood with its complexities of societal pressures, academic challenges and sometimes an uncertain and frightening future.“I was mediocre and today I have reached difficult milestones in my career,” he wrote. "It is ok to be mediocre. Not everyone will excel at school and not everyone will be able to score in the 90s. If you do, it's an amazing achievement and must be applauded. However, if you don't, do not think that you are meant to be mediocre. You may be mediocre in school but it is by no means a measure of things to come in life," he said.At NDA, he said, he did not excel either in studies or sports and lacked confidence as he thought he was meant to be mediocre. It was only after being commissioned and posted to a fighter squadron that he realised that he could do well if he put his heart and mind to it. "It was at this point that things started to turn around in my professional and personal life," he wrote.Thereafter, he was selected to undergo the challenging Flying Instructors Course where he bagged two out of the five trophies. Subsequently, he volunteered for the prestigious and rigorous 11-month-long Experimental Test Pilot Course, where only seven out of 59 applicants made it through.Selection to undergo the prestigious Staff College abroad and on return being posted to a newly raised Tejas aircraft squadron, even though he had crossed the seniority bracket, added to his credentials.Last year, he was faced with a grave and critical failure in his aircraft. The standard operating procedures required him to eject and abandon the aircraft.

10-12-2021||---||Things weren't right in SC: Ex-CJI on presser||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 9Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, one of the four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court who took an unprecedented step of addressing a press conference on January 12, 2018, has defended his action saying “given the circumstances, it was the right thing to do”.In his autobiography “Justice for the Judge”, released on Wednesday, Justice Gogoi, however, revealed that he was shocked at the press in full attendance with cameras and OB vans. Describing the press conference as an “infamous and extraordinary event”, he wrote, “January 12, 2018, was a Friday, a miscellaneous day. Immediately after miscellaneous work, around 12 noon, I went to Justice Chelameswar’s residence.“What I saw there shocked me: the press was in full attendance, several cameras were set up on the back lawn of his residence, which was the venue of the meet. Outside, there were several OB vans. I did not expect this; what I had understood by Justice Chelameswar’s expression ‘let us meet the press’ was a meeting with a few journalists,” Justice Gogoi wrote.“Anyway, there was no way out now. I had committed to addressing the press and I believe till today that, given the circumstances, it was the right thing to do.“We strongly felt that things were not right in the Supreme Court and we were proved correct by a slew of remedial steps taken by Justice (Dipak) Misra (the then CJI) himself. Thereafter, he became careful and conscious while exercising the power of allocation of cases,” Justice Gogoi wrote.After taking over as the CJI, Justice Gogoi wrote, he indicated in the list of subject categories allocated to the different Benches that PILs would thereafter be heard by the first five Benches. “The allocation of a particular Bench to hear a particular PIL out of the five Benches earmarked, however, was still required to be done by the Chief Justice. The improvement was that the allocation could not be random. At least a beginning had been made,” he wrote.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/things-werent-right-in-sc-ex-cji-on-presser-348391

Following the government’s intervention, these were now sold for Rs 30,000 each, he said.“We found out the production costs of stents. Then we called the manufacturing companies and told them that even if you sell at 100 per cent profit, the price should not become what you are asking for,” Mandaviya said, explaining how the price of the medical device was brought down.The Health Minister said to promote the sale of generic medicine, more that 8,500 “janashaudhi” centres had been opened in the country, which catered to a total of 10 lakh to 15 lakh people daily.

She said it had been 25 years since a Bill to reserve one-third of all seats for women in the Lok Sabha and the state legislative Assemblies was brought in Parliament “but nothing has happened so far”.BJD MP Pramila Bisoyi (73), who speaks only her mother tongue Odia, raised the issue of women employment following the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.She said many women who lost employment were unable to get jobs back and were confined to working at their homes or farms while men have been reemployed.She spoke in Odia and her party colleague Bhartruhari Mahtab shared the crux of the matter she raised during the Zero Hour.Asked about her educational qualification, Mahtab said it was not much but noted that she was spearheading many self-helf groups. The Lok Sabha website says the Aska MP has studied till primary classes. Birla noted that he personally urged her to speak in the House. She told him she only spoke Odia, he said, adding that her secretariat then helped her.“Now she makes request for speaking in the House regularly. This is India's democracy,” the Speaker said, noting she had given employment to a large number of women.Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal rose to praise the Chair for identifying her potential. Many other members also thumped their desks to laud it. Birla on Thursday also allowed all woman members who wanted to speak during the Zero Hour to raise their issues.“There is a matter of 33 per cent reservation (for women). Therefore today is an opportunity for woman members to speak,” he said light-heartedly.

The formative years of budding talents are spent in a suffocating atmosphere which unfortunately resembles prisons. Holistic development of a child cannot be achieved in such a restrictive environment,” the CJI said in his convocation address at the National Law University, Delhi. “Unfortunately, the focus nowadays is on professional courses to the total neglect of equally important subjects such as humanities and natural sciences…The harsh reality is that even after students enter professional universities, the focus is on classroom learning and not on the world beyond the classroom. I am not sure, who or what is to blame for these changes,” he said.Due to various considerations, most students from these universities end up in corporate law firms, he said. “Even though such law firms are an integral part of the legal landscape of the country, it is unfortunate that a comparable addition is not being made to the ranks of lawyers practicing in courts from the National Law Universities. This is perhaps one of the reasons why National Law Universities are perceived as elitist and detached from social realities.”Noting that lawyers cannot be strangers to socio-economic and political realities, he told the future lawyers to combine idealism with ambition. He also said the legal profession was not about profit maximisation.“While it is not wrong to choose a life of convenience, I hope that you choose a life of service as well, for the future of this nation,” he told the budding lawyers.Talking of National Law Universities, the CJI said, “I thought it would be relevant to highlight something that I find a little troubling. The primary object behind the establishment of National Law Universities in the country was to improve the quality of legal education to produce better trained legal professionals. However, no authoritative study has been conducted to determine whether this has taken place.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/formative-years-in-prison-like-institutes-a-concern-says-cji-348384

The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill, 2021, were passed separately by voice vote after the House rejected various amendments moved by Opposition MPs on the Bills.Adhir: LS misled on Nagaland deathsCongress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Thursday claimed that Home Minister Amit Shah had “misled” the Lok Sabha when he said forces opened fire on civilians in Nagaland after they tried to flee. “Those admitted to hospital have said ‘direct marise’ (they were shot directly),” he said.Congress MPs staged a walkout, saying they weren’t satisfied with MoS (Personnel) Jitendra Singh’s reply.The Opposition alleged the extended tenures would undermine the autonomy of the institutes. The BJP, however, claimed the step was necessary to fight large-scale corruption.Congress MP Manish Tewari said the decision to extend the tenures was “arbitrary, capricious and an exercise of power”.“Over the last seven-and-a-half years, this government has made every attempt to dismantle the system of checks and balances, which are intrinsic to our constitutional scheme,” he said.Tewari pointed out that the Supreme Court had specified a tenure of two years for the heads of these organisations to ensure they were insulated from any kind of governmental interference.Replying to this, BJP’s Rajyavardhan Rathore said it was “easy to maintain status quo... the Modi government isn’t here to maintain status quo but to bring about a change in the country.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oppn-opposes-extended-tenure-for-cbi-ed-chiefs-348380

The copter that took off from Sulur (Coimbatore) at 11.48 am was slated to land at 12.15 pm at Wellington, but the ATC lost contact with the copter at 12.08 pm. Sources said the copter established contact with the ATC to confirm landing in 7-8 minutes.The IAF, meanwhile, has recovered the flight data recorder (black box) of the copter. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder will ascertain what happened between the call to the ATC informing that the copter was descending to land and the crash.The initial assessments from eyewitness accounts suggest that the copter may have hit a “terrain”, in this case the hills. The helicopter debris was strewn over a large area of the valley, suggesting it hit a hill before hurtling down and catching fire, sources said. Weather reports suggest there was sudden clouding in the area. The helicopter took off from Sulur after 11 am — considered a grey zone because of the unpredictable weather in the Nilgiris after 11 am in winter. Also, it will be established if the military plane carrying General Rawat from Delhi to Sulur was delayed, hence delaying the take-off from Sulur beyond 11 am – the grey zone.Investigators will also find out if Chief of Defence Staff General Rawat was told about the possible bad weather en route. A road cavalcade was kept ready for them to use at Sulur.The lone survivor, Group Captain Varun Singh, most likely was thrown out of the aircraft after it hit a “terrain” and started to disintegrate.The ill-fated Mi17V5 helicopter, manufactured by Russian Helicopters’ subsidiary Kazan, had an onboard weather radar and was equipped with the latest generation of night vision devices.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-distress-call-atc-contacted-to-confirm-landing-in-7-minutes-348377
10-12-2021||Amritsar||Army's claim of mistaken identity false: Nagaland body||A Nagaland-based organisation — Naga People’s Movement for Human Rights — rejected the claims of the Indian Army’s counter-insurgency operation as a “mistaken identity” and its retaliatory violence claiming the lives of 14 civilians in Oting village in Mon district of Nagaland.A 12-member delegation of the Nagaland organisation reached Amritsar today to participate in a conclave of minority communities being attended by Sikhs, Kashmiris, Nagas and Tamil people. The event has organised by Dal Khalsa to mark International Human Rights Day on Friday.On Saturday evening, a special unit of the Army mistakenly opened fire at a pick-up van carrying coal miners from the Tiru area to Oting village (about 15 km away), killing six on board. Seven more civilians and a soldier died when villagers, alarmed by the gunshots and the death of their brethren, clashed with the troops about an hour later.Neingulo Krome, secretary of the Nagaland organisation, said though the Centre had expressed grief and termed it as a case of mistaken identity, it was a totally fabricated botched operation that claimed innocent lives.“The ones who lost lives were local labourers who used to take the same route to reach their work place. After killing them, the forces also tried to brand some civilians as militants by planting weapons and dressing them in camouflage and boots,” he alleged.Former secretary general of the organisation Dr Veenuh said after the abolition of Article 370 and 35 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre had turned a blind eye to the rights of Nagaland residents.“In 2015, the Government of India led by PM Modi and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland had entered into an agreement to respect Naga people’s separate identification and existence for sharing the sovereign power to end the violent confrontation once and for all.

10-12-2021||Satya Prakash||'Things were not right in SC': Justice Gogoi on 'infamous' press conference||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 9Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi—one of the four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court who took an unprecedented step of addressing a press conference January 12, 2018 – has defended it saying, “given the circumstances, it was the right thing to do”.In his autobiography ‘Justice for the Judge” released on Wednesday, Justice Gogoi, however, revealed that he was shocked to the press in full attendance with cameras and OB vans.Describing the press conference as an “infamous and extraordinary event”, he wrote, “12 January 2018 was a Friday, a miscellaneous day. Immediately after miscellaneous work, around 12 noon, I went to Justice Chelameswar’s residence.“What I saw there shocked me: the press was in full attendance, several cameras were set up on the back lawn of his residence, which was the venue of the meet. Outside, there were several OB vans. I did not expect this; what I had understood by Justice Chelameswar’s expression ‘let us meet the press’ was a meeting with a few/some journalists,” Justice Gogoi wrote.“Anyway, there was no way out now. Not that I wanted to make a retreat; I had committed to addressing the press and I believe till today that, given the circumstances, it was the right thing to do, though very unusual.“We strongly felt that things were not right in the Supreme Court and we were proved correct by a slew of remedial steps taken by Justice (Dipak) Misra (the then CJI) himself. Thereafter, he became careful and conscious while exercising the power of allocation of cases,” Justice Gogoi wrote.After taking over as the CJI, “I indicated in the list of subject categories allocated to the different Benches that PILs would henceforth be heard by the first five Benches. The allocation of a particular Bench to hear a particular PIL out of the five Benches earmarked, however, was still required to be done by the Chief Justice. The improvement was that the allocation could not be random. At least a beginning had been made. I understand that the next Chief Justice, Justice Bobde, allocated PILs to the first eight Benches,” Justice Gogoi wrote.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/things-were-not-right-in-sc-justice-gogoi-on-infamous-press-conference-348291

There is also no current suggestion that vaccines are ineffective against Omicron, WHO Africa experts said.In a briefing on Thursday, Coordinator for Immunisation and Vaccine Development, WHO Africa Region Richard Mihigo said, “Encouragingly, emerging data from South Africa suggests the Omicron variant may cause less severe disease. Data on hospitalisations across the country between November 14 and December 4 found ICU occupancy at only 6.3 pc, which is very low compared to the same period when South Africa was facing a peak with the Delta variant in July.”Mihigo said this was the preliminary analysis.He also said researchers were working around the clock to determine whether Omicron was more contagious, caused more severe illness or if it had any impact on vaccines and treatment.“There is an assumption that the current vaccines may not protect people against Omicron but so far there is no conclusive evidence that vaccines are ineffective against this new variant. Vaccines have protected people from severe disease and hospitalization due to other VOCs so far and there has been no need for modifying these vaccines so far,” Mihigo assured.The WHO expert said researchers will need two to three weeks to determine the full effects of Omicron.“WHO is improving its genomic surveillance to detect other variants of concern,” he said as South Africa entered the second week since the reporting of Omicron.As of Thursday, Omicron has spread to 60 countries worldwide. Ten of these are in Africa.“Nearly 46 per cent of the 1,000 Omicron cases worldwide are in the African continent. Cumulative Covid 19 cases in the continent are 8.8 million. Over the past week, new cases have risen by 93 pc compared with the week before. Three sub regions of the continent have reported an increase in cases this week, two more than the previous week. Southern Africa has recorded the highest increase with a weekly case rise of 140 pc mainly due to upsurge in South Africa,” Mihigo said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-evidence-yet-that-vaccines-are-ineffective-against-omicron-who-africa-348286

10-12-2021||New Delhi||Farmers turn nostalgic, say protest sites were like home, will be lifelong memory||After spending over a year agitating against the three farm laws at three Delhi border points, many farmers became nostalgic as Samkyukta Kisan Morcha announced that thousands of protesters would start vacating the protest sites from December 11.Read also:Farmers call off agitation after Centre accepts their demands; to vacate Delhi borders from Dec 11Amrik Singh, aged around 65, from Patiala said he felt at home in his tent at Singhu border and thought of the possibility of leaving it with a heavy heart.“I don’t feel like leaving it all behind and all those memories of struggle, moments of joy and friendships we have formed,” he said.“It often occurs to me that I should rent a house here if the protest ends,” Singh added in a lighter vein.Riding hundreds of tractors and other vehicles, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the last week of November 2020 moved towards Delhi demanding repeal of three farm laws of the Narendra Modi government.Since November 26 last year, the farmers have laid siege at highways at Delhi’s border points at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikari setting up makeshift accommodation and arrangements of daily life.Saudagar Singh, a middle-aged farmer from Ludhiana, reminisced his struggles during the yearlong protests, narrating the bonds he forged and how many new friends he found at the protest site.“We thought the government will not listen to us and we will have to stay here. But finally we won and farm laws are gone. Now it’s time to go home and we are feeling awkward now,” he said.Preparing to go home, many farmer protesters said they will dispose of items of daily use and back carrying their personal belongings and vehicles.“There is not much to take back home. Most of it will be given to local people many of whom are regular visitors for us,” Saudagar Singh said.With the Centre repealing the three farm laws and accepting most of their demands, many protesters felt it was time to end the stir and go back home.Most felt their experience of protest at Singhu Border will be a lifelong memory and they will miss the place.“We have demanded a memorial for our farmer brothers who died during the protest. Once the memorial comes up here, we will visit this place again and again,” said another protester Harkeerat at Singhu border.The farmer unions claim over 700 farmers died at different places during the year long agitation against farm laws.The leaders of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) were holding a meeting at Singhi border to consider the Centre’s written assurance to their other demands including withdrawal of police cases and compensation to kin of farmers died during the protests, before taking a call to end their stir.There were many protesters who were ready to stay at protest venue for many more days to come if their leaders wished so.“We have all the arrangements here. Also, we take turns to visit our home and come back again to join the protest. If needed, we can stay year for months and years,” said Kamalapati Baghi from Ayodhya.A young protester Balpreet Singh from Fathegarh Sahib said the protest might end but the struggles over pending issues of farmers will continue.“We gave them (Centre) an example of our resolve and hope they will listen to us more seriously now and meet our other demands, including legal guarantee of MSP of crops,” he said.The SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, on Thursday decided to suspend the farmers’ movement and announced that farmers will go back home on December 11 from the protest sites on Delhi’s borders.Farmer leaders said that they will again meet on January 15 to see if the government has fulfilled their demands.

10-12-2021||---||Farmers call off agitation after Centre accepts their demands; to vacate Delhi borders from Dec 11||New Delhi, December 9The Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Thursday announced the end of farmers’ agitation with the Centre  making a final and decisive outreach to the agitating farmers promising to take back all criminal cases registered against them during the course of the agitation along with a purposeful discussion on ways to guarantee the MSP through representation in the committee Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Gurpurab Day.In the letter dated December 9 to Samyukt Kisan Morcha, Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal has promised the unions that the Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh governments had already committed to retracting all criminal cases against farmers.Read also:Farmers turn nostalgic, say protest sites were like home, will be lifelong memory“All cases filed by the government and government agencies against farmers and their supporters in Delhi and other UTs will be taken back with immediate effect,” the Centre said in the letter.The SKM said it would mark December 11 as victory day and start vacating Delhi borders from that day.The announcement regarding the end of the agitation flows from the union agriculture secretary’s letter which added that the Haryana and UP governments had principally consented to compensating families of deceased farmers, so had the Punjab government.The government also assured stakeholders comprehensive discussions on the Electricity Amendment Bill, including with SKM representatives.“Only after discussions will the bill be piloted in Parliament,” agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal said.He said the liability of farmers regarding stubble burning had already been done away with.On MSP guarantee, the Centre reiterated the Prime Minister’s promise of a committee saying the panel would discuss ways of ensuring MSP and would have SKM representatives among farmers apart from representatives of the Centre, states and agricultural scientists and economists.Agarwal said the government had already assured continued procurement on MSP.“The proposals address the five pending demands of farm unions. There is now no justification to continue the farmers’ agitation. We, therefore, urge you to call off the agitation,” the agriculture secretary said in the letter to the unions on Thursday hours before the SKM withdrew the agitation that started on November 26, 2020 making it the longest in the history of independent India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-centre-sends-revised-proposal-to-farmers-348250
