23-12-2021||Mumbai||India can generate USD 813 billion in revenues from agri, food sector by 2030: Report||With an investment of USD 272 billion in agritech and allied segments by 2030, India can generate USD 813 billion in revenue creating 152 million jobs, making it the largest private sector industry in the country, according to a report.With agriculture continuing to remain the mainstay of economy for the country, investment in agritech and allied segments can transform the face of Indian agriculture with far-reaching implications for food security and sustainable farming solutions, according to a report, titled ‘Investing for Impact: Food, Agri and Agritech’, by Aspire Impact.In the past decade, India attracted about USD 9 billion in FDI investments in the agriculture sector, said Amit Bhatia, founder of Aspire Circle and creator-Impact Future Project.He added that this decade brings an opportunity for India Inc to take advantage of the massive untapped potential this sector holds and transform it to be sustainable and future-ready.“With smart innovations, infrastructure and policy support and newer business models, the top-10 ideas researched by the IFP community can attract USD 272 billion in investments and generate USD 813 billion in revenue, impacting 1.1 billion lives,” he added.The report has been authored by leading agritech experts, industry leaders, academics and thinkers.The report further said India has its share of challenges when it comes to agricultural practices, including mechanisation levels, which is at 40-45 per cent unlike 90 per cent in the developed economies.The country has been estimated to be at the biggest production risk with 68 per cent of the cultivation area being directly dependent upon the monsoon accounting for 40-45 per cent of total agriculture production it noted.With a gap of 3.2 million tonnes in cold storage, the food processing industry incurred a loss worth USD 14 billion in 2018.At the same time, the report stated that 55 per cent of the country’s forests are prone to fire with 70 per cent having no natural regeneration.The demand for key food grains is expected to grow at an annual rate of 3 per cent against the projected population growth of 2 per cent further underlines the challenge that the country faces today.To meet its dairy needs, India would require around 600 million tonnes of milk per year in 2060 and onwards, it said, adding that significant investments in the sector along with a policy push is needed to ensure transformation in agriculture practices and ecosystem.With agritech start-ups and innovative models speculated to dominate the sector, India Inc has already started paving this path to change, it said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-can-generate-usd-813-billion-in-revenues-from-agri-food-sector-by-2030-report-353695
23-12-2021||Bhopal||Covid-19: Night curfew back in Madhya Pradesh||Amid growing concern over the new coronavirus variant Omicron, the Madhya Pradesh government on Thursday imposed a night curfew in the state from 11 pm to 5 am as a precautionary measure and advised people to strictly follow Covid-19 protocols.The curfew comes into force from Thursday night.Madhya Pradesh has so far not reported any case of Omicron, classified as a ‘variant of concern’ by the WHO.“In view of the rapid spread of the Omicron virus in the world, it is the right time for all to remain alert on the issue. The Centre has also issued guidelines to follow social distancing, use face masks and avoid crowded places.“We have also decided to impose a night curfew from tonight (Thursday) in the entire state from 11 pm to 5 am and will take some more measures if required to deal with the situation,” Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said in his address to the people of the state in the evening.Besides, the government has also decided that in case any coronavirus positive case is detected in the state, the patient will be kept in home isolation if there is enough space in his/her home, he said.However, if there is lack of space at home, then such person should be admitted in hospital for treatment for the safety of other family members, the CM said.On Thursday, the state reported 30 new cases of coronavirus, a daily figure not seen in the last several weeks.The continuous increase in the number of coronavirus cases in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi in the last one week is a matter of concern, Chouhan said.“People keep coming from these states to Madhya Pradesh. Last time also cases started increasing in Maharashtra, then Gujarat and also in Madhya Pradesh. People can’t forget the problems faced during the first and the second waves. Whether it was the first wave or the second, it had started from Indore-Bhopal,” he said.The weekly cases in Indore and Bhopal have increased by three times in December as compared to November, the CM said.In view of this situation, it is better for people to take precautions now to avoid the arrival of a third wave and as a precautionary measure, a night curfew will come into force from tonight, Chouhan said.The chief minister said Omicron has already reached 16 states of the country and the possibility of the variant coming to Madhya Pradesh cannot be ruled out.“In the UK, one lakh coronavirus cases are coming up every day, while in the US 2.5 lakh cases are being reported per day. In Europe also, it is spreading very fast and therefore, it is time to remain alert,” he added.The state has so far reported 7,93,581 cases of coronavirus and 10,531 deaths linked to the infection. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-night-curfew-back-in-madhya-pradesh-353690
23-12-2021||New Delhi||‘Is India still a democracy’: Opposition leaders slam alleged ‘hate speech conclave’||Several Opposition leaders, including those from the Congress and the TMC, on Thursday condemned what they said was a “hate speech conclave” held in Haridwar recently and called for strict action against those involved.All-India Trinamool Congress national spokesman Saket Gokhale demanded immediate action against the organisers and speakers of the Dharma Sansad held recently in Haridwar, where “hate speeches” were allegedly made against Muslims.Gokhale lodged a complaint in this connection at the Jwalapur police station in Haridwar district, asking the Station House Officer to register an FIR within 24 hours.At the event, several speakers allegedly made inflammatory and provocative speeches, calling for the killing of people from the minority community.Held at Ved Niketan Dham in Haridwar from December 17-20, the Dharma Sansad was organised by Yati Narasimhanand Giri of the Juna Akhada, who is already under police scanner for making hate speeches and inciting violence against Muslims.Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind chief Maulana Mahmood Madani wrote a letter to Home Minister Amit Shah, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, the National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission for Minorities, over the remarks made at the Haridwar meet, calling on them to take cognizance of the matter and prosecute the perpetrators.Madani said, “They have posed threat to the peace and communal harmony of the country”.“I demand strong actions must be taken against organizers and speakers,” he said.The All India Professionals Congress also condemned in the strongest possible terms the “genocidal statements made by Hindutva leaders” in the “hate speech conclave” organised in the holy city of Haridwar.Will the Union of India and other institutions remain mute spectators, the Congress wing for professionals asked.Reacting to the remarks at the Haridwar meet, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, “This is bloodcurdling stuff. Is it too much to expect. @CMuttarakhand to take action under the existing hate-speech laws?”Congress MP Karti Chidambaram said on Twitter, “Narsinghanand Organises 3-Day Hate Speech Conclave in Haridwar... are the Faux Hindutva Nazis planning an holocaust? Will the Union of India & its institutions be a blind/mute spectator?”Congress spokesperson Shama Mohammed said Munawar Faruqui has been relentlessly punished for alleged jokes which he didn’t even crack, but there is no action against the ‘Dharm Sansad’ members who openly called for “genocide against Muslims in Haridwar!”.“Is India still a democracy!” she said.Kishenganj MP of the Congress Mohammad Jawaid tweeted, “Appalled by the nature of the assembly and hate speech propagated openly in Haridwar. Such events are destroying the secular ethos of India.” He urged Home Minister Amit Shah to take serious and urgent action against the people who were involved in the “implied calls for genocide of Muslims”.Chhattisgarh minister and senior party leader T S Singhdeo said India’s traditional value is—‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbhkam - World is a Family’.“Our Constitutional value is Secularism - Respect for all religions. Our primary Fundamental Right is Right to equality. Such bigoted thoughts & assemblies are against the foundation of India. This is criminal!” he said reacting to the remarks made at the meet.Gaurav Pandhi, a Congress functionary, said that in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “’New India’, sponsored by Ambani & Adani, Comedians are prevented from making people laugh but Hindutwavadis are allowed to give hate speeches, calling for genocide and armed revolt against the nation”.“In Haridwar, a group of Hindutvawadis gathered giving a call for armed violence against Muslims, former PM Dr Manmohan Singh & armed revolt against India. They stressed on CREATING TERRORISTS. Meanwhile, the police, govt agencies, Modi, Amit Shah & Dalal media are fast asleep!” he said.Congress leader Salman Soz said, “Dear Supreme Court of India: #UmarKhalid is in jail for God knows why. Meanwhile, in Haridwar, Hindutva extremists call for Muslim genocide, record it on camera and throw it in our faces.”     “Is this the justice you are supposed to uphold? Act now,” he said.CPI(M), from its official Twitter handle said, “Munawar Faruqui has been relentlessly punished for alleged jokes which he didn’t even crack, but there is no action against the ‘Dharm Sansad’ members who openly called for genocide against Muslims in Haridwar!

23-12-2021||Ahmedabad||Vedic maths to be introduced in Gujarat schools from next year||Vedic mathematics, claimed to be an easier and faster way of solving arithmetic problems, would be introduced in schools in Gujarat from the next academic year, the state government has said.Some experts, however, opined that it should be an additional subject and cannot replace modern math that is currently taught at schools.Education Minister Jitu Vaghani made the announcement on Wednesday on the birth anniversary of the renowned Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887.“Great Indian mathematician Ramanujan’s birthday is celebrated in India as National Mathematics Day. On this occasion, the state government has decided to introduce Vedic math in schools in a phase-wise manner,” Vaghani tweeted late Wednesday night.The subject will be introduced in a phased manner from academic year 2022-23 in standards 6th to 10th to “spread the Indian Knowledge System as envisioned in the National Education Policy,” the minister said.“Vedic math will improve the students’ command of the subject and also make the subject easier to understand. Vedic math will make students take interest in mathematics,” he further said.Vedic mathematics is an ancient Indian method which simplifies mathematics by integrating arithmetic operations into 16 ‘sutras’ or formulae.“It would improve the problem-solving ability of school students and help them solve sums faster. With the use of various formulae of Vedic math, students will not remain dependent on calculators for doing complex sums,” said senior educationist and former school principal Kirit Joshi.“But Vedic math cannot replace modern math. It will remain supplementary,” he added.Bhaskar Patel, former member of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, said it should be an optional subject.“Vedic math can be introduced as an optional subject. It will not prove beneficial if you make it compulsory. I do not know of a single state which has introduced this subject in the regular curriculum.“This should be included as an optional subject or activity, like painting,” said Patel, president of the Gujarat State Shala Sanchalak Mandal.Former president of the Gujarat Secondary School Teachers Federation Pankaj Patel said, “I welcome this decision. Vedic math is a part of our ancient knowledge which will help students in improving their ability to solve math problems in less time.“Even foreign countries have been teaching Vedic math to their students,” he claimed.Proponents of Vedic math claim that it cuts the time needed to solve problems by reducing the steps involved.It also allows multiple approaches to get the answer, it is claimed.

Based on DCGI approval, till now, the Pune-based firm has manufactured and stockpiled vaccine doses.The World Health Organisation had last week issued emergency use listing for Covovax produced by SII under licence from Novavax, expanding the basket of jabs validated by the global health body against the viral disease.In August 2020, US-based vaccine maker Novavax, Inc had announced a licence agreement with SII for the development and commercialisation of NVX-CoV2373, its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, in low and middle-income countries and India. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dcgi-seeks-more-data-from-sii-over-its-application-seeking-emergency-authorisation-for-covovax-353681

Not only urban voters, farmers and rural Punjab will also support us,” they claim. Meanwhile, the BJP is scouting for and gathering “winnable candidates” to contest in the state.After the former SAD leader and president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee Manjinder Singh Sirsa, recently a loyalist of Capt Amarinder Singh and former minister, Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, joined the saffron party after quitting the Congress, accusing it of putting the state’s “security and communal harmony at stake”.Sodhi said “only Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP can save Punjab”.Security and communal harmony in the border state are expected to be among the top leads of the BJP’s narrative for upcoming Punjab elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-aims-for-bigger-role-in-punjab-pm-modi-expected-to-launch-poll-campaign-with-mega-announcements-353677

23-12-2021||New Delhi||Make it must to play Indian music in flights operated by Indian airlines: ICCR, musicians to Scindia||Let’s make it mandatory to play Indian music on flights operated by Indian airlines as well as at airports; such a seemingly small step might go a long way in strengthening our people’s emotional connect with the country’s traditions, according to ICCR and musicians.This is the demand put forward by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) along with various musicians and singers to Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday.In this regard, a letter was handed over to the minister by ICCR president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and others at a meeting held at ICCR premises in the national capital.“... playing Indian classical or light vocal and instrumental music in aircraft being operated in India and also at various airports be made mandatory for all India-based airlines,” the letter said.Sahasrabuddhe said the minister has agreed to look into the matter and think about the demand sympathetically. “We have just given voice to what was in the minds of people,” he added.Scindia, who spoke after receiving the letter, did not specifically mention the proposal.India has an ancient tradition of music and that the country in a way is an incubator in the field of music for the world, he said, adding that in the race for modernisation, the ancient tradition might not have got the required encouragement.The minister also suggested having music festivals like literature festivals to promote music.About the proposal for playing Indian music on Indian flights, singer and music director Kaushal Inamdar said the whole idea is not only about promoting music but also “Indianness”.“Music has the power to evoke emotions. That is why we should play Indian music in our land, in aircraft, because it (Indian music) is one of the best ambassadors for our country,” he emphasised.On making the request to the minister, Inamdar said “if you speak about it, at least the possibility comes into existence”.Music composer Anu Malik said it is a fabulous idea.Vocalist Manjusha Patil Kulkarni said whether it is classical or instrumental or any other form, every airline in India should be playing Indian music.Inamdar, Malik, Kulkarni, Wasifuddin Dagar, Rita Ganguly, Shounak Abhisheki, Malini Awasthi and Sanjeev Abhyankar, among others, handed over the letter to the minister.“It is our considered opinion that this seemingly small change shall go a long way in strengthening the emotional connect of our people to our civilisational traditions in music and arts for music is a language that never fails to strike a chord,” the letter said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-it-must-to-play-indian-music-in-flights-operated-by-indian-airlines-iccr-musicians-to-scindia-353660

23-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC to hear in January Juhi Chawla’s appeal against dismissal of lawsuit against 5G||The Delhi High Court on Thursday listed for hearing on January 25 actor Juhi Chawla’s appeal against an order dismissing her lawsuit against the 5G rollout, saying there was no grave urgency in the matter.A bench headed by Justice Vipin Sanghi stated that there were several other cases listed for hearing before it and the appeal concerned an order that was passed six months ago.“Order is of June. You come now. Six months have gone,” remarked the bench also comprising Justice Jasmeet Singh after the case was initially listed for hearing in February.Senior counsel Salman Khurshid, appearing for Chawla, said that the present case was an “unfortunate” one and urged the court to advance the date of hearing.In June, a single judge had described the lawsuit by Chawla and two others against the 5G rollout as “defective”, “abuse of process of law” and filed for “gaining publicity” while dismissing it with costs of Rs 20 lakh.In her appeal before the division bench of the high court, the actor and other appellants have contended that the single judge dismissed the plea and imposed costs without any jurisdiction and contrary to the settled law.It is claimed that a plaint can be dismissed only after it has been allowed to be registered as a suit. The appellants have further reiterated their concerns surrounding the harmful impact of 5G technology and submitted, “Every day that the 5G trials are allowed to continue constitutes a distinct and imminent danger to the health of the people who reside in the vicinity of the area where the trials are being conducted.”      In the lawsuit, the appellants had claimed that if the telecom industry’s plans for 5G come to fruition, “no person, animal, bird, insect and plant on earth will be able to avoid exposure, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to levels of RF radiation that are 10x to 100x times greater than what exists today”.It had sought a direction to the authorities to certify to the public at large how 5G technology is safe for humans, animals and every type of living organism, flora and fauna.While dismissing the lawsuit, Justice JR Midha had said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was “not maintainable” and was “stuffed with unnecessary scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments” which are liable to be struck down.The single judge had said the suit filed by the actor-environmentalist and others was to gain publicity, which was clear as Chawla circulated the video conferencing link of the hearing on her social media account which resulted in repeated disruptions by unknown persons.

In January 2021, she was placed in low medical category, which made her permanently unfit for flying and she was assigned only ground duties since then.“Thereafter, instead of transferring her to the ground duty branch as per the existing provisions, she was subjected to an Invalidating Medical Board (IMB) in order to release her from service on medical grounds.Meanwhile, the competent authority granted her six months’ maternity leave as she delivered a premature baby in November this year,” her counsel Col Indra Sen Singh (retd) said.The officer had primarily contended that once the officer was sanctioned maternity leave till Narch 2022, it was illegal for the Air Force to prematurely release her on medical grounds in December 2021.“In accordance with leave rules, Air Force women officers are entitled six months’ maternity leave as a matter of right pre/post delivery of child, which has also been upheld by the Supreme Court,” Col Singh said.“Moreover, Section 12 of the Maternity Benefit Act prohibits an employer from discharging or terminating the services of a woman employee during the time she is on leave,” he added.Finding “some force” in the contentions,, the Tribunal’s bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz directed, “As a special case and without setting any precedent in the matter, we direct that the applicant shall be permitted to be on the roll till March 11, 2022 and shall be released only after the maternity leave is over.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/observing-women-cannot-be-discharged-from-service%C2%A0during-maternity-leave-aft-stays-release-of-woman-iaf-officer-353627

AC-3 tier comprises air-conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths.“All classes of train services have incurred losses during 2019-20, except AC-3 tier which could recover its operational cost and earn profit,” stated a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) for the period tabled in the Rajya Sabha session that concluded today.According to the CAG report, Railways incurred maximum loss — Rs 20,449.92 crore — from its ordinary class service during 2019-20, followed by the sleeper class service (Rs 16,000 crore). However, first class service reported the minimum loss (Rs 37.89 crore). Profit by AC-3 tier, though, is showing a decline over the years. The CAG report gave year-wise details of the profits and losses made by the various classes of the passenger services since 2015-16.It showed that from Rs 898.06 crore in 2015-16, the profit of AC-3 service came down to a whopping Rs 64.65 crore in 2019-20.The profit of AC-3 service had risen to Rs 1,040.52 crore in 2016-17, but plummeted to Rs 737.75 crore in 2017-18 and dropped further to Rs 318.03 crore in 2018-19.“The cross-subsidisation in respect of second class, ordinary class and suburban services has increased continuously in the past five years with subsidy on ordinary class being the maximum,” the report stated.The CAG noted that one of the contributing factors for non-recovery of full cost from these classes is free and concessional fare passes or tickets to various beneficiaries. The revenue forgone in passenger earnings due to concessions to various categories of passengers (physically challenged persons, patients, senior citizens, Izzat monthly season tickets, press correspondents, sportpersons and war widows among others) increased from Rs 1,994.83 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 2,058.61 crore in 2019-20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/only-ac-3-tier-earned-rlys-profit-cag-report-353513

The PLA again quickly relocated its troops, tanks and guns after the Indian Army occupied the heights at Rechin La in August 2020. Yet again, there was a PLA movement just as the Quad was getting ready for a physical meeting in the US in September 2021. This time, a division of some 15,000 men moved. In all scenarios, eastern Ladakh was put under pressure.LAC Build-up in 2019China ramped up military-related infrastructure near the border in August 2019, just after the state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two UTs – J&K and Ladakh.Authoritative sources said the speed of the movement indicated advanced planning. Some 170 armoured vehicles had started moving in batches to bolster Chinese positions facing Indian troops stationed in eastern Ladakh.A US department of defence report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” released three weeks ago said: “The build-up and establishment of forward positions along the LAC provided the PLA with valuable real-world operational and tactical experience.” The PLA also fielded integrated units at multiple places to enable lateral and cross-service communication required for joint operations, the report said. An Indian assessment says since China formed theatre commands of its own in 2016, it has had only one exercise in 2018 in Tibet and that focused on long-distance manoeuvres.China has been constantly making improvements in its infrastructure. A substantial reserve force from the Tibet and Xinjiang military districts were deployed in the interior of Western China to provide rapid response.At the height of the border standoff, the PLA installed a fibre optic network in remote areas of the western Himalayas (facing eastern Ladakh) to provide faster communications.From the Indian perspective, two posts near Burtse, that is west of what is called the ‘bottleneck’ in Sub- Sector North (SSN) in eastern Ladakh, are holding back the PLA to its side. At the SSN, which comprises the 970-sq km Depsang Plateau and the Daulat Beg Oldi, India has added numbers, equipment and surveillance.Though both sides have agreed to start the de-escalation process, PLA units are stationed around the Pangong Tso, a 135-km-wide glacial lake. Some 35-40 per cent of the lake bank area is under Indian control while the rest is under Chinese occupation.North of Arunachal, China has increased the number of its military exercises. It has also marginally added troops and troop habitat on its side.The number and the duration of annual training exercises of the PLA have gone up.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pla-padded-troops-at-lac-close-to-art-370-abrogation-quad-meet-353512

A thought is repeatedly occurring to me—Harish Rawat, you have had enough, it is time to rest,” said Rawat, who as AICC general secretary in charge oversaw the ouster of Capt Amarinder Singh.The Congress has not assured Rawat of chief ministership should the party win state elections due early next year. Rahul Gandhi is experimenting with gradual change of guard in major states as he did in poll-bound Punjab by ousting Amarinder and installing Channi as CM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-had-enough-party-turning-back-on-me-says-harish-353509

23-12-2021||---||Government, opposition spar over House disruptions||New Delhi, December 22With the winter session of Parliament becoming the third most unproductive session of the 17th Lok Sabha after the third and the sixth sessions, the government on Wednesday said the Opposition was unable to digest the mandate PM Narendra Modi got in 2019 and was resorting to disruptions out of frustration.Also read: 11 Bills passed; session ends one day ahead of scheduleMPs should debate, discuss, not disrupt, says LS Speaker Om BirlaThe Congress hit back, accusing the government of suspending 12 Opposition MPs in a deliberate ploy to “manufacture a majority in the Rajya Sabha and pass dangerous Bills”.“The Opposition cannot digest the mandate the PM got in 2019. They continue to think their right was snatched. Not allowing the Houses to run is anti-democratic,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said today, rejecting the Opposition’s accusations that the Election Law Amendment Bill was not circulated in time.The Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, meanwhile, said 12 suspensions that led to Rajya Sabha disruptions “were deliberately planned by the government to garner majority in the Rajya Sabha and remove active MPs from the House.”“Non-NDA parties have 120 MPs in the Rajya Sabha and NDA and supporting parties have 118. The government unconstitutionally suspended 12 Opposition MPs on the first day of the session to garner a majority and pass all Bills without debate,” Kharge said.Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh said Kharge had offered to regret on the behalf of all 12 MPs on November 29 evening itself “but the government insisted that every MP should regret individually.”“The government delayed a resolution to ensure a majority in Rajya Sabha and pass Bills as dangerous as the election law amendment which has the potential to disenfranchise several minorities, SCs, STs and women. This Bill is as dangerous as the farm laws,” Jairam said adding that the opposition remained united in the winter session on suspension of MPs and resignation of MoS Home Ajay Mishra for his son’s role in Lakhimpur Kheri killings.The Congress veteran also said the session ended as undemocratically as it began. “The session began with farm laws being repealed without discussions and ended with the Election Law Amendment Bill being passed in 15 minutes in Lok Sabha and zero debate in Rajya Sabha.”Asked why the Opposition didn’t participate in RS proceedings when it knew the government wanted to push Bills in their absence, Jairam said, “Absence from the Rajya Sabha was the collective decision of the Opposition.”Opposition got more time to speak: LS recordsLS records show while BJP MPs got to ask 100 supplementary questions during the Question Hour, opposition MPs raised 158 supplementaries.

The government, however, termed the session a “success” despite the “disruptive strategy” of the Opposition. In all, 11 Bills were passed by the two Houses, including the one to repeal the three contentious farm laws passed by the Parliament last year, and an equally contentious Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021.According to the government, the poll reform legislation provides “linking of electoral roll data with the Aadhaar ecosystem to curb the menace of multiple enrolment of the same person in different places”.Union minister Pralhad Joshi, who said the session concluded a day earlier on completion of essential government business, maintained that everything was done “according to rules and conventions”. The government was willing to hold discussions on every issue, he said, dismissing the allegations of Bills being passed without debate as “baseless”.“The Opposition should have allowed the House to run. They are unable to digest the defeat in the 2019 elections and are therefore continuously disrupting Parliament proceedings,” he added. Today, before the Rajya Sabha was adjourned, Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge urged Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to allow him to raise an “important issue” related to purchase of land by legislators in Ayodhya.Saying that Kharge should have given a notice first, Naidu said: “This is not the way. You have to give a notice.” Joshi also said the three farm laws passed with the “objective of overall development of farmers” were repealed “in view of protests by a group of farmers and in order to take everyone together on the path of inclusive growth and development in the 75th year of India’s Independence”. In all, the session saw 18 sittings spread over a period of 24 days. As many as 13 Bills (12 Bills in the Lok Sabha and 1 Bill in the Rajya Sabha) were introduced and 11 Bills were passed by both Houses of Parliament.Oppn Anti-democraticNot allowing the Houses to run is anti-democratic.

23-12-2021||New Delhi||India currently facing third Covid wave, to hit peak in February: Scientists||A slew of studies by Indian scientists show that amid rising cases of Omicron, the third wave of Covid-19 has set in India from mid-December, and it may hit its peak in February next year.A yet-to-be peer reviewed study led by a team of researchers from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, used a statistical methodology based on the fitting of a mixture of Gaussian distributions -- based on an algorithm for clustering to estimate the parameters.The third wave was forecast using the data on the first two waves of pandemic. The team also utilised the data of different countries that are already facing the third wave, modelling their daily cases data and predicting the impact and timeline for the third wave in India.“The report forecasts India’s third wave of Covid-19 to start around mid-December 2021 and the cases to peak in the beginning of February 2022,” Subhra Sankar Dhar, Associate Professor, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, wrote in the paper.A separate study led by a joint team from the IITs Hyderabad and Kanpur is based on the Sutra model, which tracks the country’s Covid-19 trajectory.According to Professor M. Vidyasagar of IIT Hyderabad and Maninda Agrawal of IIT Kanpur, the daily caseload is expected to rise as Omicron begins to displace Delta as the dominant variant.Meanwhile, India registered 6,317 fresh Covid cases and 318 deaths in the last 24 hours, and the Omicron tally has reached 213, said the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Wednesday. With the addition of 318 new deaths, the death toll has climbed to 4,78,325.However, out of total Omicron positive, 90 have been discharged. So far 15 states have reported Omicron infection, said the ministry. Delhi (57) has the highest number of Omicron cases 57, closely followed by Maharashtra (54).Daily Covid-19 caseload in India is expected to increase once the Omicron starts displacing Delta as the dominant variant, media reports quoted members of the National Covid-19 Supermodel Committee as saying.According to their prediction, the third wave of Covid wave in India is set to begin “early next year”.However, they noted that the infection rate will be milder than seen in the second wave, due to a large-scale immunity and vaccination present in the country now.
