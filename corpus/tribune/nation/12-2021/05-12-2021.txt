05-12-2021||New Delhi||Despite Sino-US rivalry, space for others to influence world: Jaishankar||While drawing attention to greater caution by the US in power projection and the emergence of China with a “different kind of polity”, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said it would be a “serious error to visualise the two developments” as a zero-sum game.“Whether it is the Indo-Pacific, Afghanistan or the Gulf, we are seeing more players, greater localisation and arrangements of pragmatism.“In fact, we are now entering a world of greater pluralism, one that recognises the shortcomings of multilateralism, the limits of bilateralism and the un-tenability of unilateralism from whichever quarter,” he said while delivering the keynote address at the fifth Indian Ocean Conference in Abu Dhabi.As a result of China’s rise, there is now an ongoing debate on the changed nature of power and influence, whether it is connectivity, technology or trade, he said.“Separately, we have also seen a sharpening of tensions on territorial issues across the breadth of Asia. Agreements and understandings of yesteryears now seem to have some question marks. Time will, of course, provide answers,’’ the minister observed.“Put succinctly, Indian Ocean nations are called upon today to take greater responsibilities, fashion better relationships and display more initiative,” he exhorted.The minister said two developments have significantly heightened uncertainties in the Indian Ocean region. One is the American withdrawal from Afghanistan which leaves behind serious concerns about terrorism, radicalism, instability, narco-trafficking and governance practices.The second is the impact of Covid on a region that has thoroughly exposed the dangers of “over-centralised globalisation”.The world needs to develop more reliable and resilient supply-chains as well as in greater trust and transparency, he advocated.The Quad, he said, is a good example of cooperation among nations who have, within a year, developed an agenda over a dozen items, from maritime security to emerging technologies. Jaishankar hoped that the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative being undertaken in the framework of the East Asia Summit at India’s initiative will also gather greater traction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-sino-us-rivalry-space-for-others-to-influence-world-jaishankar-346582
05-12-2021||Gandhinagar||Gujarat: AAP MLA raises question mark over NEP, quality of education in govt schools; BJP hits back||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Atishi on Sunday raised question marks over the quality of education in government-run schools as well as implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) during an event held here, while BJP leaders from Gujarat, who also took part in the function, accused the Arvind Kejriwal-led government of spending crores on advertisements.Atishi said the NEP document is akin to a “wish list” and holds no value in the absence of an implementation plan, while BJP leader Sunil Deodhar alleged that the AAP government in Delhi spends “Rs 600 crore of taxpayers’ money” on advertisements every year.Gujarat Education Minister Jitu Vaghani claimed that due to the improved quality of education and infrastructure, nearly four lakh students of private schools have taken admission in government-run schools.These leaders were invited to share their views on the subject of NEP at the ‘Youth Parliament of India-2021’ event held at Karnavati University, a private university located at Uvarsad village in Gandhinagar district.“When I was reading the new education policy, I felt that though we are good at formulating policies, the bigger question is whether we are able to implement it. This new policy is more like a wish list, just like we wish that India wins the cricket world cup or we people like me wish to remain fit,” Atishi said.There is no meaning of wishing such things if we do not have a plan or a system of implementation, the AAP MLA from Delhi added.“I was appointed as an educational advisor when AAP’s government was formed for the first time seven years back. When I visited a government school, a stinking smell from the toilet welcomed me, that was more or less the situation of government schools across the country,” she said in her address to nearly 1,000 students.She claimed it was Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government in Delhi that showed the “strong will” to change the scenario and allotted 25 per cent of the total budget to the education sector.“Thanks to the Delhi government’s focus on improving the education scenario, government schools are showing better results than private schools. Over 500 students of our government schools got admission into well-known engineering colleges after clearing JEE. We showed how government schools can be revived with a solid plan and political will,” she said.Atishi left immediately after her address and was not there when Vaghani’s turn came.In his apparent response to the AAP legislator, Vaghani said the state-run schools in Gujarat are also offering quality education and infrastructure, which is why nearly four lakh students had quit private schools and have taken admission in government-run schools in recent years.The minister even asked college students present in the hall to visit any government-run school in their area to verify his claims.“Gujarat nearly has 33,000 primary schools run by the government. This is not a state having a size of a city. We have recently launched a Command and Control Centre to supervise the government schools. Officials from other states visit Gujarat to learn about it and implement it in their states,” Vaghani said in his speech.On the occasion, Vaghani announced that all the recommendations of the National Education Policy will be implemented within the next 10 years and a roadmap for the implementation has already been prepared.He also announced plans to set up a ‘Global Career Counselling Centre’ to clear students’ doubts about educational opportunities abroad. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-aap-mla-raises-question-mark-over-nep-quality-of-education-in-govt-schools-bjp-hits-back-346570
05-12-2021||Vibha Sharma||Samajwadi Party claims sitting OBC legislators from BJP joining party; all eyes on December 7 Meerut rally||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 5While the BJP is working hard to build an all-caste matrix for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, sources in the main rival Samajwadi Party claim that many sitting Other Backward Class legislators from the saffron party have shown willingness to switch sides to the party ahead of the 2022 polls.BJP leaders dismissed the possibility of any senior leader making any such move, saying that the ruling party will have to drop several sitting legislators on the basis of their performance and to beat the anti-incumbency factor. So, it is quite natural that those who do not get the BJP ticket will be looking at other avenues, they add.In the previous Assembly elections, the BJP had dropped 15-20% of the sitting MLAs. However, the figure is expected to be higher this time.As stakeholders from across the spectrum aim for the support of the crucial non-Yadav OBC “vote bank”, all eyes are on the December 7 rally of SP supremo Akhilesh Yadav and RLD president Jayant Chaudhary when the two make formal announcement of the alliance.The day may also witness leaders from other parties joining the coalition. Sources say seat-sharing talks between the two sides are in the last stage. Given the importance of the Western UP in the farmer/Jat politics and the repealed farms laws, the BJP is keeping a close eye on the Meerut rally.The Samajwadi Party, which does not have much presence in the nerve centre of farmer politics, is depending heavily on the Jat-dominated RLD. Though it is believed to have been “reasonably successful” in tapping the OBC community in the Purvanchal region following alliance with the Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash RajbharIn 2017, the BJP contested in alliance with the SBSP.The BJP is countering the SP-SBSP alliance with coalition with small caste parties, some of which were earlier with Rajbhar’s Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha.Meanwhile, top leaders of the BJP are also planning rallies in the poll-bound state next week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samajwadi-party-claims-sitting-obc-legislators-from-bjp-joining-party-all-eyes-on-december-7-meerut-rally-346568

05-12-2021||New Delhi||Param Bir Singh not whistleblower, flagged corruption after transfer: Maharashtra to SC||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh cannot be considered as a “whistleblower” under the law as he chose to speak out against alleged corruption involving former home minister Anil Deshmukh only after his transfer, the Maharashtra government has told the Supreme Court seeking dismissal of his plea.A bench headed by Justice S K Kaul had granted a major relief to Singh on November 22 by directing the Maharashtra Police not to arrest him in criminal cases lodged against him and had wondered if he was being hounded for filing cases against police officers and extortionists, “what could happen to a common man”.Seeking dismissal of Singh’s plea for a CBI probe into the entire matter and against any coercive action by the state, the Maharashtra government has filed a reply affidavit in the apex court and said that the ongoing probe in criminal cases against the former top cop not be interfered with.In the affidavit, Joint Secretary of Maharashtra Home Department Venkatesh Madhav said, “Petitioner (Singh) cannot be considered a whistleblower. I state and submit that, contrary to what is stated in the SLP (special leave petition), I deny that petitioner is a whistleblower as contemplated under the Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014 or that the ratio laid down in the case of...applies to the facts of the present case.“As evident from the petitioners own letter dated March 20, 2021, the petitioner cites instances of alleged corruption that took place few months prior to March, but only sought to expose these allegations on March 20, that is three days after he was transferred. Thus it is denied that the petitioner’s letter dated March 20 was issued in public interest or for a bonafide purpose and therefore it is denied that the petitioner is a whistleblower.”In the 83-page reply, the state government said Singh who was recently suspended from the Mumbai Police over allegations of misconduct is indirectly trying to seek a stay on the criminal investigations pending against him through the petition and has failed to disclose material and relevant facts.“At the outset, I say that this court in a catena of judgements...has observed that it must be left to the discretion of the investigating agency to decide the course of investigation and that a court should interfere with an investigation only in rare cases.“The petitioner has filed the SLP against the impugned judgement dated September 16, 2021, passed by the Bombay High Court , but is really seeking a stay of further proceedings into various criminal complaints registered against him and this, with great respect, ought not to be permitted by this court,” the state government said.The state government said that various enquiries against the suspended police officer are pending and being conducted.“The following instances of negligence in performance of service by the petitioner were to be enquired into.... Whether the petitioner failed to control and supervise his subordinate Mr Sachin Waze (who was appointed as the head of the Crime Investigation Unit despite the opposition of the Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), against whom a case has been registered by the NIA in view of his involvement in parking an explosive-laden car near the Antilia building , Mumbai, which was found on February 25, 2021,” it said.The affidavit said that the state government has accorded approval to initiate the disciplinary proceedings against him under the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969.“The statement of articles of charges framed against him along with the statement of imputations of misconduct or misbehaviour and a list of documents...are issued,” it said.The affidavit stated Singh should approach the Central Administrative Tribunal to challenge the departmental enquiry and his plea was rightly dismissed by the Bombay High Court on the grounds of non-maintainability and availability of alternate remedies.“The validity of the order dated April 1 and April 20 including the alleged malafides in issuance of the said order clearly fall within the ambit of ‘service matters’, which can be agitated before and adjudicated by the CAT...,” it said.It said the plea of Singh has become infructuous as the CBI has already issued summons to Sanjay Pande, a police officer, on September 18 and it is evident that the CBI is investigating the conversations that took place between Param Bir Singh and Sanjay Pande.The apex court has fixed the plea of Singh for hearing on December 6.The matter involving Singh and former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, facing probe over corruption allegations levelled by Singh, has become “curiouser and curiouser”, the top court had said, issuing notices to the Maharashtra government, its DGP Sanjay Pande and the CBI on the plea of the former top cop of Mumbai.Singh’s lawyer had said Singh needed protection as he had shown the courage to come to this court and raise the issue of corruption against the former state home minister.The lawyer had said as many as six FIRs have been lodged against Singh for the alleged offences pertaining to years like 2015 and 2016 and submitted as to how a police officer will act if they are hounded at the behest of state for the actions done as police officers on the complaints of bookies and extortionists.The Bombay High Court had dismissed Singh’s petition seeking to quash inquiries initiated against him by the Maharashtra government, and said he can approach the Central Administrative Tribunal.After he was shunted out as Mumbai Police commissioner in March 2021 in the aftermath of the Antilia bomb scare case, Singh, in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, levelled corruption allegations against Deshmukh.In his petition, Singh had also alleged that DGP Pande told him that the inquiries were the fall-out of his allegations against Deshmukh, an NCP leader.

He may be summoned again.The 1988-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer was suspended by the Maharashtra government few days back following registration of police FIRs against him and some other police personnel on charges of extortion.Sources said his statement was “vital” to take the investigation in the case forward. Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and his aides have been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in this case.Singh had in March levelled allegations of corruption and misuse of official position against Deshmukh after he was shunted from the post of the Mumbai police commissioner in the aftermath of Antilia bomb scare incident.He had accused Deshmukh of asking police officers to collect Rs 100 crore a month from restaurants and bars in Mumbai, a charge which the NCP leader denied.Singh, declared absconding by courts in Mumbai and Thane, surfaced in public late last month after being underground for over six months. After he moved the Supreme Court, he was granted temporary protection from arrest. The IPS officer is facing at least five extortion cases in Maharashtra and has similarly deposed various state police investigation units over the last few days. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-records-statement-of-suspended-mumbai-police-commissioner-param-bir-singh-346543

05-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Metro plans to install more anti-smog guns to curb pollution at its sites||With the national capital battling high pollution levels, the Delhi Metro has planned to install more anti-smog guns at its project sites, officials said on Sunday.As part of the various measures adopted to combat pollution at its construction sites, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has already pressed into service 14 anti-smog guns which throw fine mist at regular intervals to check dust pollution emanating from construction work.These anti-smog guns (ASGs) were installed over a period of time in the past.    Construction activities have been halted at the moment in the national capital as per instruction of authorities in view of the increasing level of pollution in Delhi and neighbouring cities."Currently, all construction work apart from those which are non-polluting in nature have been stopped in compliance with relevant directions," said Anuj Dayal, Executive Director, Corporate Communication, DMRC. "While, the DMRC is ensuring complete compliance to all the pollution-related instructions being issued from time to time, these mist guns have been installed as a permanent measure to combat pollution and are employed at the sites round the year," he said."Even when construction work is not going on, mist guns prevent the loose soil or earth stored at construction sites from being air-borne thus reducing air pollution," he added.  In a separate statement issued on Sunday, the DMRC said, "Currently, as part of its Ph-IV corridors, as well as some other construction projects, 12 civil contracts are operational across the national capital. These state-of-the-art ASGs are capable of spraying fine mist up to 70 to 100 m. One ASG is considered adequate for covering an area up to 20,000 sqm." It is ensured that the water used for sprinkling are free from coliforms, viruses and bacteria. High quality nozzles with droplet sizes of 10 to 50 micro m are used for greater impact, it said."With the gradual expansion of construction work in future, more such ASGs shall be introduced at the sites in the days ahead, as needed. DMRC's environment department is conducting regular inspections to ensure that the ASGs are regularly used at the sites by the contractors," a senior official said.Traditionally, ASGs have been used at coal and cement manufacturing sites across the world. In November, 2016, the DMRC became possibly the first construction company in the National Capital Region to use ASGs at its sites as a pilot project, the statement said.Based on the feedback received from the initial use of ASGs at the sites, their use was made "mandatory in the conditions of contract for civil contractors in DMRC's fourth phase of expansion," it added.Now, the Delhi government has also made the use of ASGs mandatory for all construction agencies in the national capital as a tool to combat pollution. Detailed guidelines regarding the use of water droplets, nozzles etc have also been issued in this regard, the DMRC said.The entire northern part of India especially the National Capital Region (NCR) grapples with severe pollution during the months of October to December.Apart from the regular use of ASGs, the DMRC takes a number of other measures to minimise the impact of pollution emanating from its sites, officials said. "To make it more effective daily barricade cleaning and toe dust cleaning is carried out. All construction materials are properly covered with tarpaulin and other materials. Wheels of vehicles leaving the sites are properly cleaned so that they do not spread dust or mud on the streets. The materials carried by them are also adequately covered," the statement said.All roads leading to major construction sites are properly black topped and the construction and demolition waste generated are recycled at specified C&D (construction and demolition) recycling facilities.  Medical care facilities are also available for workers who are involved in the loading and unloading work of such materials. The DMRC accords the highest priority to the issue of protection of the environment as an integral part of its work culture, it added.

The BJP believes that this will create a festive atmosphere with ideological commitment which will send out the message of strong cultural ethos.After the inauguration on December 13 in the evening, the Prime Minister will take a tour of the Ganga river in a boat and perform the 'Ganga aarti'. During this tour, the Chief Ministers of various BJP-ruled states will also be present. The Prime Minister will hold talks with the Chief Ministers and public representatives the very next day.

The people have been instructed to keep the streets and their locality clean and cooperate in the public cleanliness drive.If political experts are to be believed, amid the ongoing Ram temple construction in Ayodhya, the BJP is once again trying to assert power through its ideological plank of Hindutva and its cultural agenda, while raising issues like building of a temple in Mathura.A senior BJP leader involved in formulating the election strategy in Uttar Pradesh and working closely with the party's central leadership said that once again the party is going to celebrate Deepotsav on December 13.Several BJP workers have been asked to make the occasion a grand success.BJP Kashi regional President, Mahesh Chandra Srivastava said, "On December 13, there will be a festive atmosphere in the state.

Also, military justice had adapted in several countries to legal, military and societal changes. While many challenges remain, it become relevant to study and analyze the outcome of decisions, impact and scope to better understand the consequential effects on military courts in democratic settings,” García-Sayán observed.“The book aims to provide information on the diverse course taken by military law, justice and reform in various nations, and generate lessons and learning from these experiences, besides triggering a comparative analysis,” Maj Navdeep said. “It should appeal to those interested in the military, law, politics, public policy, governance and human rights, as well as the general reader,” he added.Navdeep Singh is a lawyer at the Punjab and Haryana High Court and has been a member of a High-Level Committee of Experts constituted by a former defence minister for reducing litigation pertaining to military service and pension-related matters.

05-12-2021||New Delhi||Covid: India's fifth Omicron case detected in Delhi||A 37-year-old man who arrived in Delhi from Tanzania has tested positive for Omicron, making it the first case of the new Covid-19 variant in the national capital and the fifth in the country.The patient, currently admitted to the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) Hospital, has mild symptoms, hospital officials said.“So far, 17 Covid-19 patients and six of their contacts have been admitted to the Lok Nayak Hospital. The Omicron variant has been found in one of the 12 samples sent for genome sequencing so far, according to a preliminary report,” Delhi’s Health Minister Satyendar Jain said.“The patient is an Indian and had returned from Tanzania. He was admitted to the hospital on December 2 with mild symptoms – sore throat, fever and body ache,” Medical Director Suresh Kumar said.“The patient’s travel history is being collated and his contacts are being traced,” he said.The Delhi health minister said banning international flights is the most effective way to contain the spread of the Omicron variant.“It is being reported that the gestational period in case of Omicron could be more than other variants. This means an infected person may go undetected at the airport… All the cases have come from affected foreign countries. The central government should take it seriously,” he said.Jain said that there is a 99 percent chance that the mask can “save people from all Covid-19 variants, be it Alpha, Beta, Delta or Omicron”.“Experts have been saying that the third wave of Covid-19 can hit the country in January-February. It can be prevented if everybody wears a mask,” he said.The minister said more than 90 percent of the eligible population has got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Sixty percent of the people have got the second dose. “We appeal to the remaining people to get vaccinated as soon as possible,” he said.Jain said more than one lakh people are being vaccinated against Covid-19 in Delhi every day. “If we continue at the same speed, everyone will be covered soon.” He pointed out that many people have not received their second dose of Covishield yet due to the large gap (84 days) between the doses.In response to a question on a booster dose, the minister said the city government will follow the notification of the central government and the recommendations of experts. The country reported the first two cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on Thursday in Karnataka—a 66-year-old South African flyer and a 46-year-old Bengaluru doctor with no travel history. Both men are fully vaccinated.   On Saturday, a 72-year-old NRI man from Gujarat and a 33-year-old man from Maharashtra tested positive for the new strain.    All Covid-positive international travellers are being admitted to the LNJP Hospital, where a dedicated ward has been set up for isolating and treating them.   According to the Centre, the countries designated as “at-risk” are European countries, including the UK, and South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.    Under the new norms, RT-PCR tests are mandatory for passengers arriving from the “at-risk” countries and they will be allowed to leave the airport only after the results come.   Also, two percent of the passengers arriving on flights from other countries will be subjected to the test randomly. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-first-case-of-omicron-detected-in-delhi-346512

You ensure the safety of the country... Always remember that by guarding the borders you are ensuring the safety of the country and providing a platform to it globally," Shah told the BSF personnel.He said the government will ensure that the world's best technologies are made available to the BSF."It is the commitment of the government. There was a mention of a growing threat from drones. BSF, DRDO, and NSG are trying to develop an anti-drone technology. I have complete faith in our scientists that we will be able to develop an indigenous anti-drone technology soon," he said.Shah said since 2014, the Modi government has given special emphasis to border security."Wherever there were attempts of incursion on the borders, attack on security forces and CAPFs, we have ensured immediate retaliation.India has ensured that no one can take our borders or soldiers lightly. The central government under (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ensured a strong retaliation in the form of surgical and air strikes after Uri and Pulwama attacks, respectively. The entire world appreciated this action," he said.In order to fill vacancies in the BSF, the government has recruited 50,000 jawans and their training has started, he said."The road construction budget for border areas was Rs 23,000 crore during 2008-14. Between 2014 and 2020, the Modi government increased the budget from Rs 23,700 crore to Rs 44,600 crore.

It is also important to be mindful of the power dynamics that are mired in sexual harassment at the workplace,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said on Friday.Ensure justice to all partiesWe implore courts to interpret service rules and statutory regulations governing the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace in a manner that metes out procedural and substantive justice to all the parties. — SC Bench led by Justice DY ChandrachudDeciding a case under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013, the Bench — which also included Justice AS Bopanna — said courts should interpret service rules and statutory regulations on sexual harassment at the workplace in a manner that metes out procedural and substantive justice.Disapproving of the rising trend of invalidating proceedings inquiring into sexual misconduct by resorting to hyper-technical interpretation of service rules, the Bench said, “We implore courts to interpret service rules and statutory regulations governing the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace in a manner that metes out procedural and substantive justice to all the parties.”Upholding the charges of sodomy against an officer of the Border Security Force (BSF) and the punishment of forfeiture of five years’ services for the purpose of promotion and seven years’ service for the purpose of pension, the top court reversed the order of the Calcutta High Court. The HC had set aside the BSF DG’s order on hyper-technical grounds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-turn-probe-into-punishment-sc-on-harassment-at-workplace-346366

The road is tough, but it will serve the interest of the country and people in a better manner. —Narendra Modi, Prime MinsterIn the past five years, the Centre approved development projects worth Rs one lakh crore for Uttarakhand, he said.Sharing his vision on development, PM Modi said the government should create infrastructure to help people become self-dependent.“There are certain political parties, which do not want the public to become strong. They want people to remain helpless, weak and dependent on government doles,” Modi said.He further said, “Because of these parties, the idea of government as a ‘mai baap’ (provider) has found many adherents. People think that they can make a living only if the government came to their rescue.”He claimed his government had an alternative approach. “People must give up their dependence on the government. The road is tough, but it will serve the interest of the country and people better.”He gave the example of farmers, who have installed solar panels in their fields to generate electricity, to show that dependence on government could be ended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/want-people-to-stop-depending-on-doles-modi-346368
05-12-2021||New Delhi||Ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit, nod to production of AK 203 rifles||The government has given its final approval to a nearly Rs 5,000 crore deal to manufacture over 5,00,000 AK 203 rifles at a manufacturing facility in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, official sources said on Saturday.The mega deal is expected to be formally announced at a summit between PM Narendra Modi and his Russian President Vladimir Putin in Delhi on Monday.The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) headed by the PM cleared the deal on Wednesday, days after it was given the go-ahead by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), the sources said. “In an endeavour to give a big boost to self-reliance in defence manufacturing in India, the government has approved the plan for the production of over 500,000 AK-203 assault rifles at Korwa in Amethi,” another source said.Both Russia and India had given in-principle approval to the deal during Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Moscow last year. The joint venture is also expected to explore the possibility of exporting the Kalashnikov rifles.“The approval reflects the ever-increasing paradigm shift in defence acquisition from buy (global) to ‘Make in India.’ The endeavour also reflects the deepening partnership between the two countries,” the source said. The 7.62 X 39mm caliber AK-203 rifles will replace the INSAS rifles.AK-203 assault rifles, with an effective range of 300 metres, are lightweight, robust and easy to use, and are expected to enhance the combat potential of the troops. The project will be implemented by a special purpose joint venture called Indo-Russian Rifles Private Ltd (IRRPL).The two sides are likely to wrap up the final phase of negotiations for a logistics support agreement which is likely to be signed either during the two-plus-two talks or at the summit.India and Russia are set to renew for the next decade a framework for military-technical cooperation at the summit besides announcing a joint commission on technology and science. The two sides may firm up a number of defence procurement proposals. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-putins-visit-nod-to-production-of-ak-203-rifles-346369

Use this last resort only after exploring the option of ADR — arbitration, mediation and conciliation. Arbitration and mediation are efforts at restoring a relationship,” the CJI said while addressing the ‘Stakeholders’ Conclave’ at the International Arbitration and Mediation Centre, Hyderabad.Citing various reasons for opting for mediation or arbitration over traditional litigation, he said there were several benefits of ADR — fewer delays, less expensive, greater party choice, more control, more comfortable and amicable environment for the parties.Justice Ramana wondered if anyone could even imagine a world without conflicts. “A prudent person tries to find ways to resolve these amicably. Conflicts have a human face and it helps to be humane in our approach to resolve these. One must have the foresight to look beyond the conflict,” the CJI noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/courts-must-be-last-option-cji-346370

He was 67.The last rites of the pioneering television journalist, who was hospitalised with Covid earlier this year and lost his wife, radiologist Padmavati ‘Chinna’ Dua, to the virus in June, will be performed at the Lodhi crematorium here on Sunday, his daughter and actor-comic Mallika Dua said.Vinod Dua, who had been admitted to Apollo’s intensive care unit, was suffering from chronic liver disease, hospital sources said.“Our irreverent, fearless and extraordinary father, Vinod Dua has passed away. He lived an inimitable life, rising from the refugee colonies of Delhi to the peak of journalistic excellence for over 42 years, always, always speaking truth to power.“He is now with our mom, his beloved wife Chinna in heaven where they will continue to sing, cook, travel and drive each other up the wall,” Mallika Dua wrote on her Instagram Stories.Vinod Dua was a pioneer in Hindi broadcast journalism with stints in Doordarshan and NDTV and eclectic interests ranging from politics to cooking. He hosted the popular food programme “Zaika India Ka” for NDTV that saw him exploring distinct food cultures of different cities and towns in India.He also anchored “Jan Gan Man Ki Baat” for The Wire Hindi.Vinod Dua and his wife were in a hospital in Gurgaon when the second Covid wave was at its peak.

05-12-2021||New Delhi||Farmers? protest: SKM forms 5-member panel for talks with govt, wants written assurance on pending demands||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Saturday formed a five-member panel for dialogue with the government on their pending demands, including MSP, compensation to kin of farmers who died during the agitation against the agri laws and withdrawal of cases against the protesters.The development comes after Union Home Minister Amit Shah, according to sources in the SKM, spoke to a senior farmer leader over the phone earlier this week.“The five-member committee will now hold talks with the government on our pending demands. There have been informal talks with the government in the past but we want a written assurance on the remaining issues, including withdrawal of cases and a legal guarantee on MSP,” a farmer leader said.The sources said that in the coming days, the SKM’s state committees are likely to have meetings with the home ministers of states where cases have been registered against the protesting farmers.“We will not end this agitation without a formal response on each of the issues being raised by us. We want to see all the cases foisted against farmers as well as their supporters, who were part of this movement, to be withdrawn and assurance to be made formally,” the SKM said in a statement.Farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ashok Dhawle, Shiv Kumar Kakka, Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Yudhvir Singh were named the members of the committee after a meeting was held by the SKM here on Saturday.Addressing a press conference with other SKM members at the Singhu Border protest site, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said that the next meeting of the Morcha will take place on December 7 at 11 AM to decide the future course of the movement.SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, in the statement said that farm unions have had a “bitter experience” in the past of securing oral assurances and ending their agitation only to find that the government reneges on them.“The Government of India has chosen to work informally and in a piecemeal fashion of responding to some of the issues being raised by the protesting farmers,” the SKM statement said.Protesting farm unions have been pressing for their demands to be considered including withdrawal of cases filed against farmers during the movement, legal guarantee on MSP and compensation to kin of farmers who died during the agitation.SKM leaders, after the meeting, said they will not move from the protest sites until cases filed against farmers are withdrawn, and demanded an assurance in writing.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh under the aegis of various farmers’ unions have been protesting at the borders of the national capital since November 26 last year to demand repeal of the three farm laws.On Monday, a bill was passed in parliament to repeal the three contentious farm laws, one of the main demands of the protesting farmers.But the stalemate continues with the protesters demanding that the government fulfil the other demands also.“The next meeting of SKM has now been fixed for December 7, with the next two days kept for the Government of India to respond to SKM and work along with the 5-member Committee to resolve this agitation to its logical conclusion,” the SKM statement said.Shiv Kumar Kakka, farmer leader and SKM member, said that the five-member panel will be a coordinating agency between the SKM, and Centre. Kaka is a member of the newly formed panel.“It was premature on part of those who were thinking that we will call off our agitation,” he said.Unless the MSP guarantee is ensured and cases against farmers are withdrawn, “we are not going to move from here”, Kakka said.“Once our other demands are met, then we will decide about the further course of the agitation,” he added.The SKM meeting lasted for about three hours and was attended by farmer leaders including Tikait, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Yogendra Yadav, Darshan Pal, Ashok Dhawale among others.Farmer leader and SKM member Ashok Dhawale said that issues of compensation to be given for martyred farmers, “false cases” lodged against farmers and the Lakhimpur Kheri incident were discussed in the meeting.He said that SKM members demanded the dismissal and arrest of Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident case.Dhawale, who is also a member of the farmers’ panel, said that repeal of three farm laws is the biggest victory of all farmers of India.“The three farm laws were anti-farmer, anti-people and pro-corporate. SKM has also been demanding allotment of land to install a memorial to martyred farmers, at Singhu Border, which will be built by the Morcha,” Dhawale said during the press conference after the meeting.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 in an address to the nation has announced the repeal of the three farm laws.On November 21, the SKM had sent a letter to the PM urging him to consider farmers’ six demands including on MSP and compensation.

05-12-2021||Ahmedabad/Mumbai||Covid-19: India's 4th Omicron case detected in Maharashtra||India on Saturday reported two more cases of the Omicron variant of COVID with a 72-year-old NRI man from Gujarat and a 33-year-old man from Maharashtra found infected with the new strain after they came from the “at-risk” countries of Zimbabwe and South Africa, respectively, taking to four the total number of such cases in the country.As states tighten curbs to keep the Omicron variant at bay, the Centre has advised them to undertake enhanced surveillance of international travellers and also monitor emerging COVID hotspots.While Gujarat’s Commissioner of Health Jai Prakash Shivhare confirmed that the elderly Non-resident Indian from Jamnager city has tested positive for the Omicron variant, Maharashtra health department director Dr Archana Patil confirmed that a man from Kalyan Dombivli municipal area near Mumbai was found infected by the potentially contagious variant. It was the first cases of Omicron of variant for the two western states.The country’s first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 were reported on Thursday in Karnataka—in a 66-year-old South African flyer and a 46-year-old Bengaluru doctor with no travel history and both men fully vaccinated.The NRI man had arrived in Gujarat from Zimbabwe on November 28 and had tested positive for coronavirus on December 2, after which his sample was sent for genome sequencing, officials said. He was fully vaccinated against COVID, they said.The man, who hails from Jamnagar, has been living in Zimbabwe since the last many years. He arrived in the state to meet his father-in-law. After he got a fever, his doctor advised him to get an RT-PCR test done. The private laboratory on Thursday informed the civic authorities that his report has come out positive for COVID-19, Jamnagar municipal commissioner Vijaykumar Kharadi said.After that, the man had been shifted to the isolation ward at the Guru Gobind Singh Government Hospital, Kharadi said.The district authorities had already started his contact tracing as per protocols, officials said.Officials in Mumbai said the man from Kalyan Dombivli municipal area near Mumbai had arrived at the Delhi airport from South Africa via Dubai before flying to the western metropolis.The 33-year-old man had arrived in Delhi on November 23 and had given his samples for COVID-19 testing at the Delhi airport. He had then taken a flight to Mumbai, official sources said in Delhi.“After he tested positive, the sample was sent for genomic sequencing and has been found to have the Omicron variant of coronavirus on Saturday,” the sources said, adding he has been isolated and all his contacts have been traced and are being managed as per protocol.“A man from Kalyan Dombivli municipal corporation area has tested positive for the Omicron variant of COVID-19. He is the first official case in the state,” Maharashtra health department director Dr Archana Patil told PTI in Mumbai.“He came with a group of four people. We are tracing and tracking them. Their RT-PCR test as well as genome sequencing will be done as well,” she said. More details are awaited but officials said the affected man had not received any vaccine dose against COVID.As a debate rages over whether India should roll out the booster shots against COVID, scientists say that the country should prioritise double vaccinating its eligible population given the large number of people still to get the base layer of protection against the infection.Concerns over the Omicron variant and waning vaccine-induced protection against the infection have highlighted the need for boosters to protect the most vulnerable. And while many countries have already started giving booster shots, several experts in India said the priority in the country has to be different given that large-scale immunisation programme began only six-eight months ago.In advocating putting boosters on the back-burner for the moment, the experts’ opinion runs counter to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Sequencing Consortium (INSACOG) that has recommended a booster dose for those above 40 years in high-risk and high-exposure populations. The INSACOG is a network of national testing labs set up by the government to monitor genomic variations of COVID-19.“We have a large proportion of our population in the below 18 age-group. Until that is achieved, a uniform policy for second booster, or a third dose, is not advisable,” immunologist Vineeta Bal told PTI, pointing out that large-scale vaccination in India began only in March 2021.What we should focus on, she said, is fully vaccinating all the eligible population in India and pushing for vaccination of the under 18 age group on a large scale.Vasant Nagvekar, a consultant on infectious diseases at a Mumbai-based hospital and a member of the Maharashtra government’s COVID-19 task force, on Thursday said a booster dose of vaccine, even if it works, is just a temporary fix and the emphasis should instead be on mask use..Amid growing concerns over the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, a Parliamentary panel has recommended that the efficacy COVID vaccines must be evaluated and the government conduct more research to examine the need for booster doses to contain the new strain.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health in its report to Parliament also said that concerns with regard to the new strain developing immunoescape mechanism should be critically addressed.Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Friday told Parliament that the Centre will move forward on the rollout of the booster shots only on the basis of scientific recommendations of its two expert groups on vaccine administration. The decision will not be based on economic or financial considerations, he said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), meanwhile, has mandated seven-day home quarantine of the passengers arriving in the city from “at-risk” countries.In an order issued on Friday, the civic body said that during the home quarantine period, the staff from its ward-level COVID-19 war rooms would call these foreign returnees five times a day to ensure that they are following the protocols.According to the Centre, the countries designated as “at-risk” are European nations, including the UK, and South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.The Union health ministry, meanwhile, wrote to the governments of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha and Mizoram to take necessary steps under the ‘Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate-Covid Appropriate Behaviour’ strategy to control the spread of COVID-19 and reduce fatality.The move comes in view of rising cases of the infection, weekly positivity rates and weekly deaths in some districts.Referring to a letter sent to all states/UTs on November 27 in the context of the new Omicron variant, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday said all states have been advised to undertake enhanced surveillance of international travellers, monitor emerging hotspots, prompt contact tracing of positive people, besides sending all positive samples for genome sequencing, early identification of cases and review of health infrastructure preparedness, and most importantly to focus on IEC and community sensitisation.
