16-12-2021||New Delhi||CBI chargesheets former Allahabad HC Judge SN Shukla in corruption case||The CBI has filed its charge sheet against retired Allahabad High Court Judge Justice SN Shukla in a corruption case for allegedly favouring a private medical college in his orders, officials said.The agency has moved with its charge sheet against Shukla after getting a go ahead from the government to prosecute the retired judge, they said.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had booked Justice Shukla with other accused in December 2019 under Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.In its FIR, besides Justice Shukla of the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court, the agency had also named retired Chhattisgarh High Court judge IM Quddusi, Bhagwan Prasad Yadav and Palash Yadav of the Prasad Education Trust, the trust itself and private persons Bhavna Pandey and Sudhir Giri, they said.Several other accused in the FIR have also been named in the charge sheet.It is alleged that Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences was debarred by the Centre from admitting students due to substandard facilities and non-fulfilment of the required criteria in May 2017, along with 46 other medical colleges that were also debarred on similar grounds, the officials said.The decision to debar was challenged by the trust before the Supreme Court through a writ petition, they added.Subsequently, a conspiracy was hatched by those named in the FIR and the petition withdrawn with the court’s permission.Another writ petition was filed before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on August 24, 2017, the officials said.It was further alleged in the FIR that the petition was heard on August 25, 2017, by a Division Bench of the court comprising Justice Shukla and a favourable order was passed the same day, they added.Justice Shukla had allegedly defied the categorical restraint orders passed by a Chief Justice of India-led Bench of the apex court to permit private colleges to admit students for the 2017-18 academic session.The then Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra had taken note and constituted a three-member in-house committee to look into allegations.A three-judge in-house committee of the Supreme Court, comprising Madras High Court Chief Justice Indira Banerjee, Sikkim High Court Chief Justice S K Agnihotri and Madhya Pradesh High Court Judge Justice P K Jaiswal, had concluded there was sufficient substance in the allegations contained in the complaint against Justice Shukla and that the aberrations were serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for his removal.After getting the report, Justice Misra in 2018 had asked Justice Shukla to resign or seek voluntary retirement but he refused to do following which judicial work was taken away from him.On March 23, 2019, Justice Shukla wrote to the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi seeking permission to start his judicial work in the Allahabad High Court.Justice Gogoi then wrote to the prime minister to remove Justice Shukla.When a CJI writes to the President and the prime minister for removal of a high court judge, the Rajya Sabha chairperson appoints a three-judge inquiry committee in consultation with the CJI under the provisions of the Judges (Enquiry) Act, 1968, to look into the allegations.However, the process could not be completed.Sources said the CBI does not need sanction to prosecute Quddusi as he was a retired judge at the time of the commission of the alleged offence and acting in the capacity of a private person.Shukla had joined the Allahabad High Court on October 5, 2005, and retired on July 17, 2020, according to the high court web site.  —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-chargesheets-former-allahabad-hc-judge-sn-shukla-in-corruption-case-351097

16-12-2021||New Delhi/Amritsar||Flights diverted as RVR measuring equipment fails at Amritsar airport||Multiple flights have been diverted from the Amritsar airport in Punjab during the last two days as runway visual range (RVR) equipment, which allows pilots to land flights amid dense fog, has stopped functioning, aviation industry sources said on Thursday.The RVR equipment at the airport is maintained by the Indian Meteorological Department, which has sent its officials to Amritsar to repair it, the sources said.The readings taken from RVR equipment allows an airport to use instrument landing system (ILS), which allows a flight to land when visibility is as less as 50 meters.Multiple flights—domestic and international—have been diverted from the Amritsar airport as the RVR equipment, and ILS system consequently, has not been functioning for the last two days, the sources said.The RVR equipment is likely to be repaired by Friday, they added.The Airports Authority of India (AAI said on Twitter on Thursday, “Due to un-serviceability of Runway Visual Range (RVR) at Amritsar Airport, many flights could not be accommodated.”“We are continuously working towards the rectification of technical issues involved and ensuring the best services in future. Inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.”In Punjab, Lok Sabha MP from Amritsar Gurjit Singh Aujla said flights have not been able to land or take off at the Shri Guru Ramdas International Airport for the past 24 hours.When contacted, airport Director V K Seth confirmed that flight operations remained suspended.He said some instruments were non-functional in the ILS. Due to non-functional CAT I, CAT 2 and CAT 3 systems, it becomes almost impossible to keep the airport operational, Seth added.However, he said the CAT 1 system has become operational Thursday evening allowing domestic flights to land.But the international flight operation cannot be resumed until the CAT 2 and CAT 3 become operational, he added.Seth said the airport will be fully operational on Friday.

16-12-2021||Vibha Sharma||Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni ‘cautioned’ over his outburst against journalists yesterday: Sources||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 16Despite immense pressure, both inside Parliament and outside, the government and the BJP appears to be standing behind the beleaguered Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra Teni, at least for now.Though Mishra has been ticked off by the central leadership for his behaviour with journalists yesterday when he was asked about the additional charges being slapped on his son Ashish, sources add that the government is “weighing options taking in mind all factors”.“What happens tomorrow, one cannot say but the probe is on under the Supreme Court’s directions and a father cannot be punished for the actions of his son,” they say.While one reason, as also expressed by some observers, is to “avoid upsetting Brahmins” in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the sources also point to another factor—the apparent “differences” between Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and “intra-party politics” at play.Surprised at Mishra’s entry in the council of Prime Minister Narendra Modi a couple of months back, a state leader said the new set of charges by the special investigating team of the UP police in the Lakhimpur Kheri case has made his continuation (as the minister in the centre) untenable.Mishra is believed to be close to Home Minister Shah and the development have given Adityanath an edge in UP, they also addMeanwhile, leaders here also claim that the central leadership is not in favour of firing Mishra as the “Lakhimpur Kheri case is sub judice and that the SIT is yet to file its final report”. Mishra’s shocking outburst at journalists yesterday was “wrong”, they say, adding that he has been “cautioned”.The demands for Mishra’s resignation, or sacking, intensified after the SIT said the killing of the farmers was a “planned conspiracy”.Both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha remained disrupted for the second day in a row over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and the demand of Mishra’s immediate resignation.Mishra’ on Wednesday lost his cool with journalists and used foul language and resorted to intimidation when asked about the SIT latest move to raise the charges against his son Ashish Mishra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-minister-ajay-mishra-teni-cautioned-over-his-outburst-against-journalists-yesterday-sources-351084
16-12-2021||---||Lalit Modi family dispute: SC appoints two of its former judges as mediators||New Delhi, December 16In an attempt to amicably settle a long-pending property dispute between former IPL head Lalit Modi and his mother Bina Modi—wife of late industrialist KK Modi, the Supreme Court on Thursday appointed two of its former judges as mediators.A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana – which had on December 7 suggested mediation—approved the names of former top court judges—Justice Vikramjit Sen and Justice Kurian Joseph as mediators to resolve the family dispute.“Ultimately both parties have agreed to mediation under Judges Vikramjit Sen and Justice Kurian Joseph. We suggest parties use facilities of the Mediation Centre at Hyderabad. They can request for online mediation. We direct parties to maintain confidentiality, and request mediators to take undertakings. Mediation to Expedite proceedings preferably within a period of three months,” the Bench said.The Bench was hearing an appeal filed by Lalit Modi challenging a verdict of the Delhi High Court which said that the anti-arbitration injunction lawsuit filed by Bina Modi against her son was maintainable. Bina Modi had earlier sought to restrain the arbitration proceedings initiated by Lalit Modi in Singapore over the dispute.KK Modi died on November 2, 2019 after which the dispute emerged amongst the trustees of the family trust.As per the case, the trust deed was executed at London by KK Modi as settlor/managing trustee and Bina, Lalit, Charu and Samir as trustees, and in pursuance to oral family settlement recorded between them on February 10, 2006.Lalit Modi contended that after the demise of his father, in view of lack of unanimity amongst the trustees regarding sale of trust assets, a sale of all assets of the trust has been triggered and distribution to beneficiaries has to occur within one year thereof, the single judge had noted.On the other hand, his mother and the two siblings contended that on a true construction of the trust deed, no such sale has been triggered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lalit-modi-family-dispute-sc-appoints-two-of-its-former-judges-as-mediators-351082
16-12-2021||Noida||‘Solver gang’ busted in Noida, 5 held||The Noida police on Thursday claimed to have arrested five members of a gang involved in impersonating candidates in a Staff Selection Commission (SSC) exam for recruitment in paramilitary forces.Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said the gang had impersonated a candidate in Wednesday’s SSC (GD Constable) exam held at a centre in Sector 62 here under Sector 58 police station limits.“The gang charged Rs 6 lakh to Rs 7 lakh from candidates for appearing in exams on their behalf and was involved in over a dozen such cases,” Singh told reporters.Those arrested have been identified as Lalit Kumar, Anil Kumar, Yashveer Singh, Rohit Kumar and Rakesh Kumar, all residents of Aligarh, he said, adding the mastermind of the gang has also been recognised but is absconding.Primary investigation revealed that of those arrested, Yashveer is the one who worked as a solver, appearing on behalf of the actual candidates in exams using forged documents. Lalit and Anil worked as mediators between the gang and the candidates, Rohit forged documents like admit cards and Rakesh was incharge of the monetary transactions, the officer said.The police have seized 67 fake admit cards of various exams, several incriminating phone chats and Rs 12,000 cash from the possession of the accused. Two cars have also been impounded, the police said.Singh said several monetary transactions, including some originating in foreign countries like Singapore and the UAE, involving the gang have also been traced.The gang provided solvers for competitive exams like SSC GD, Allahabad High Court Recruitment Exam, Indian Coast Guard, HSSC, Central Airmen Selection Board, UPSESSB TGT exam, etc., the police said.“The gang had been active in several states including Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and its members had been appearing for competitive exams for the past three years. They forged admit cards of the candidates and a solver from the gang appeared in place of the actual candidates,” Singh said.An FIR has been lodged at the Sector 58 police station and further investigation is underway. Teams have been formed to track down the absconding mastermind of the gang, the officer said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/solver-gang-busted-in-noida-5-held-351081
16-12-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh, estranged uncle Shivpal come together before Uttar Pradesh polls||In a crucial development ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Thursday met his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav and announced an alliance with his Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia).The meeting between the two leaders came almost five years after they parted ways following a bitter public power tussle that had led to Shivpal Yadav’s sacking as a minister in the Akhilesh Yadav cabinet in 2016.Sources in the Samajwadi Party said its founder Mulayam Singh Yadav was also present at Shivpal Yadav’s residence before Akhilesh Yadav reached there.“Met national president of PSPL and finalised the alliance. The SP’s policy to take along regional parties is strengthening the party and taking SP and its allies towards victory,” Akhilesh Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi after the meeting at his uncle’s residence.He also shared a photo with Shivpal Yadav, 66.Hundreds of supporters of the parties gathered outside Shivpal Yadav’s residence, raising the slogan of “Chacha-Bhatija zindabad”.After their relation turned sour before the previous Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Akhilesh Yadav became the SP president in January 2017. Shivpal Yadav had successfully contested the 2017 polls as an SP candidate but formed his own party in 2018.The coming together of the two before the assembly polls due early next year assumes political significance as Akhilesh Yadav looks to take along smaller parties to take on the might of the BJP.During the recent panchayat polls, the SP and PSPL had foght together in Etawah, where they won 18 out of 24 wards and the BJP could win one seat there.Though Akhilesh Yadav announced the coming together of the two parties, there is no immediate word on seat-sharing arrangements between them.Addressing a gathering on party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav’s birthday on November 22, Shivpal Yadav had demanded 100 seats (out of total 403) seats from the SP. According to SP sources, the party is not keen to give more than 10.During the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Shivpal Yadav had contested from the Firozabad seat and was at the third place, but secured over 90,000 votes which, many said, led to SP candidate Akshay Yadav losing to the BJP candidate.Shivpal Yadav’s party could not perform well but harmed the winning prospects of the SP candidates on several seats.Reacting to the meeting between the two leaders, BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said it will have no adverse bearing on his party’s prospects in the polls.“The BJP is going to form a majority government again in 2022 by winning over 300 seats. Whether there was a meeting of ‘Chacha’ -Bhatija’ or ‘Bua’ -‘Bhatija’ or SP or Congress or all of them, only lotus (BJP’s election symbol) will bloom,” he said.Shivpal Yadav had earlier meetings with AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and even Congress was in touch with him. But, the meeting during the day ended all speculations.Aggressively positioning himself against the BJP, Akhilesh Yadav has already entered into alliances with the RLD and Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suhaldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP).The uncle-nephew reunion would also help in checking any possible erosion in the support base of the SP among the Yadav caste that constitutes around nine per cent of the state’s population.

16-12-2021||New Delhi||Warning against dangers of pesticides and imported fertilisers, PM Modi appeals to farmers to adopt natural farming||Warning against the dangers of pesticides and imported fertilisers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said small farmers, who constitute about 80 per cent of the farmers of the country, will benefit the most from natural farming.“Those small farmers who have less than two hectares of land. Most of these farmers spend a lot on chemical fertilisers. If they turn to natural farming, their condition will be better,” the prime minister said, addressing the National Conclave on Natural Farming.Union ministers Amit Shah, Narendra Singh Tomar, Governor of Gujarat, chief ministers of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh were among those present on the occasion.While acknowledging the important role of chemicals and fertilisers in the Green Revolution, the prime minister emphasised the need for working on its alternatives simultaneously.He warned against the dangers of pesticides and imported fertilisers which lead to increased costs of inputs and also cause damage to health, calling it the right time to take big steps before problems related to agriculture become even worse.“We have to take our agriculture out of the lab of chemistry and connect it to the lab of nature. When I talk about nature’s laboratory, it is completely science-based,” the prime minister said.“It means connecting with your roots. Who understands this better than all of you farmer friends? The more we water the roots, the more the plant grows,” Modi said.“We need not only to re-learn the ancient knowledge of agriculture but also to sharpen it for modern times. In this direction, we have to do research afresh, mould ancient knowledge into the modern scientific frame,” he said.In this context he also recalled the recent Climate Change Summit, where he called upon the world to make ‘Lifestyle for Environment’, that is LIFE, a global mission. India and its farmers are going to lead in this regard in the 21st century.“Let us take a pledge to make Ma Bharati’s land free from chemical fertilisers and pesticides in the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/warning-against-dangers-of-pesticides-and-imported-fertilisers-pm-modi-appeals-to-farmers-to-adopt-natural-farming-351074

She and Sheena also had financial dispute, the agency said.Sheena’s body was allegedly burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district. The murder came to light in 2015 when Shyamvar Rai spilled the beans when questioned by police in another case.Peter Mukerjea is out on bail in the case.

16-12-2021||New York||Online scammers target prominent Indian female media personalities with promises of jobs at Harvard: NYT||Several prominent female journalists and media personalities in India, including ex-NDTV anchor Nidhi Razdan, have been targeted by online scammers with promises of prestigious jobs at Harvard, the New York Times reported on Thursday.While the identity of the scammers remains a mystery, the incidents have raised questions about why Harvard — despite its reputation for fiercely protecting its brand — “did not act to stop the scam, even after being explicitly warned about it” by one of the victims, the Times said.Another target was a spokeswoman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Nighat Abbass. When the scammers pushed for her passport details and other personal information, she checked directly with one of the Harvard administrators included on the emails.That administrator, Bailey Payne, a programme coordinator in the office of Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs, responded, saying the official invitation that appeared to have been sent from her Harvard.edu email address was fake.When Payne asked Abbass if she would like to share more information, Abbass sent in a trove -- the phone number from the UAE, the emails, screenshots of the fake Harvard documents and hotel booking records. But it’s not clear what action, if any, Harvard took, the Times said.Payne did not respond to requests for comment. Jason Newton, a Harvard spokesman, declined to comment on what the university did with the information Abbass provided, the paper said.The first known target was outspoken female journalist Rohini Singh, who received a Twitter message from someone calling himself Tauseef Ahmad in mid-August 2019.Ahmad invited her to participate in a high-powered media conference. Harvard would pick up all expenses. She, however, grew suspicious after Ahmad connected her to a colleague, introduced as Alex Hirschman, who wrote to her from a Gmail account rather than an official Harvard.edu email address. Singh ceased communication.The next target was another female journalist, Zainab Sikander, who too received a Twitter message on August 22, 2019 from Ahmad, inviting her to participate in a high-powered media conference at Harvard. It was the same message sent to Singh, the Times said.When she asked for a formal invite from a dean, it never came. Sikander then broke off contact as well.The next target was another female journalist working at a prominent Indian publication. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, she said she quickly broke off contact after getting suspicious about the scammer’s UAE phone number.In late November 2019, the hackers were well practised when they reached out to Razdan, a news anchor at the apex of her career.She received the first email on November 14, 2019, from an earnest sounding student - Melissa Reeve - inviting her to a Harvard media seminar. She was then introduced, by email, to another student, Tauseef Ahmad. When he said there might be a journalism job available at Harvard, Razdan let her hopes soar.The next thing Razdan knew, she was interviewing with someone claiming to be Bharat Anand, the name of a real vice provost at Harvard. She never saw him, though. The interview was by phone.“This is where I feel I really messed up,” she said. “I should have insisted it be a video call.” The scammers were taking bolder steps to impersonate Harvard. They bought a website from GoDaddy, HarvardCareer.com, in January 2020 and set up a Microsoft email server that would soon allow them to send messages stamped with Harvard’s name. Unlike earlier owners of the domain, they opted for privacy protection that obscured their names from public registries of website owners, the Times said.Razdan was then asked for references. Each of the people Razdan enlisted received an official looking email from HarvardCareer.com with a web link to upload a recommendation.Harvard says it fiercely protects its trademark, employing software to detect new websites that infringe on its brand, but Newton, the university spokesman, declined to say if it had detected HarvardCareer.com, the Times said.The scammers continued to use it to send emails, capitalising on Harvard’s reputation. They also copied employment documents from Harvard’s official website, using them as fodder as the scam advanced, the Times said.In February 2020, right before Covid-19 exploded across the world, Razdan was told the job was hers. She received a lengthy contract that included everything from arbitration clauses to details about dental insurance. In June 2020, she announced to the world, via Twitter, about her move to join Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences as an Associate Professor teaching journalism.Online classes were supposed to start in September. Right before classes were to begin, she received an email saying there was a delay because of Covid-19. The scammers would use the pandemic many times as an excuse for delays or slip-ups.They also asked her to install Team Viewer, which is software that enables computers to connect to each other. Team Viewer would allow the scammers to access files on her laptop, but Razdan didn’t know that. Trying to be helpful, she downloaded the software.The scammers played off Razdan’s eagerness to connect with faculty members. Several times they invited her to do a video call with Emma Densch, a real dean at Harvard. But the calls kept getting cancelled at the last minute.By December, Razdan began to get annoyed at what she thought was flakiness. She reached out to officials in Harvard’s human resources department. They didn’t write back. She then emailed Densch’s office directly, asking about the cancelled video calls.Densch’s assistant wrote back that Razdan was never on the dean’s schedule. The assistant then asked: Who were you talking to? Razdan sent in a flurry of correspondence, including her signed contract.That’s when she received the shocking email in the middle of the night.Just like Abbass, she urged Harvard to investigate, emailing the university that “Someone/group of people have been impersonating senior Harvard officials and forging their signatures, and must be brought to book.” She said Harvard never wrote back, the Times reported.She turned to Jiten Jain, the director of a cybersecurity firm in India called Voyager Infosec, to perform a forensic analysis of her laptop and devices. Jain, who shared his findings with The New York Times, said Razdan’s email account had likely been hacked. Worse, Jain found remnants of a suspicious installer file on her computer, a sign that malware may have been installed.Razdan has filed an FIR with the Delhi Police which is investigating the hoax. It is still uncertain why Razdan and the other women were targeted, according to the Times report.

16-12-2021||Dehradun||Indira Gandhi took 32 bullets for country but ignored on 1971 War anniversary: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the BJP government of ignoring the role of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the 1971 War as India celebrates the 50th anniversary of the victory, which he said was achieved as the country was united then.Referring to his grandmother and the former PM, he said she took “32 bullets for the country” but her name was not even mentioned at a government event on the 1971 War anniversary in New Delhi.“However, it does not make any difference because I know what she did for the country by giving her blood,” the Congress leader said launching his party’s campaign for the Uttarakhand Assembly polls during a rally at Parade Ground here.     He said the credit for the 1971 War victory, which came in just 13 days, does not go exclusively to the Army, Navy or the political leadership of the day, it goes to the “united fight put up by Indians regardless of their cast or religion”.Lakhs of families donated gold to the government of the day to strengthen the fight against Pakistan, he said.“The country spoke in one voice and the America’s Seventh Fleet was forced to return. Usually, full scale wars take years to conclude. But India won the 1971 War in 13 days because it spoke in one voice,” he said.The Congress leader said helicopters and fighter aircrafts do not strengthen a country.“A country becomes strong when its people are strong,” he said.                              He further said sacrifice defines his relationship with the state from where thousands of people die fighting on the borders for the country.“The way thousands of families in Uttarakhand lose their kin battling for the country’s honour, my family too has made sacrifices. This is my relationship with Uttarakhand,” he said.The Congress leader said while travelling to Dehradun, he was thinking what kind of relationship he has with Uttarakhand.“I thought of the few years I spent here as a student of the Doon School, during which I got a lot of your love. I was also reminded of two dates—October 31—when my grandmother became a martyr and—May 21—when my father was assassinated. And the word that struck me was sacrifice,” he added.Rahul Gandhi said he was at school when he was told that his grandmother received 32 bullet wounds.“Such calls are received by thousands of families in Uttarakhand when their kin make the supreme sacrifice to safeguard the country,” he said.But families that have made no sacrifice for the nation cannot feel this, he said. They cannot feel what it means to lose a father or an uncle, the Congress leader said.He also attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that demonetisation and the GST were the “tools of capitalists”.“Narendra Modi is their implementor,” he said targeting the PM.“Take it from me, the youth in this country will not get jobs until the BJP government in New Delhi goes,” the leader said.Rahul Gandhi claimed that measures like the note ban and the GST destroyed small and medium businessmen.On rising inflation, he said petrol and diesel prices had fallen in the international market but went up in an unprecedented way in the country due to highest tax on fuel.He accused the PM of pulling out Rs 10 lakh crore from people’s pockets and transferring them straight to the pockets of “handpicked billionaire capitalists who do his marketing”.He said the Centre’s farm laws were aimed at “finishing farmers and helping capitalists”.The former Congress president also criticised the Centre for not accepting that 700 farmers died during the course of the agitation against the laws.“The prime minister has apologised to farmers for the agriculture laws which were withdrawn after a sustained agitation by farmers but does not acknowledge their deaths and is refusing to pay compensations,” he said.Rahul said if the Congress is voted to power, it will protect interests of farmers and unemployed youth.Heroes of the 1971 War, Army veterans and families who lost their kin fighting for the country were offered a memento and a shawl as a gesture of honour by the Congress leader, who shared the dais with them at the rally, the first by him ahead of the next year’s Assembly elections in the state.The Congress rally at Parade Ground came days after PM Modi held a rally at the venue.  —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-gandhi-took-32-bullets-for-country-but-ignored-on-1971-war-anniversary-rahul-351067

The situation in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh reported similar action by an equal number of employees.R. Sriram, a leader of the UFBU Telangana, said all the banking services were stopped. These included transactions and the clearing of cheques. ATMs have so far not been affected, but they are bound to go dry during the next few hours as they will not be re-loaded.Employees marched in Abids and other areas of the city carrying placards that read “Privatisation is abandoning social banking, It’s anti-people”, “Strengthen public sector banks, do not privatise them”, and “Stop privatisation of banks”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/strike-paralyses-banking-work-in-andhra-telangana-351063

A short circuit is stated to be the cause of the fire.The overnight bus had left Hyderabad around 10.30 pm and was close to its destination when the mishap happened. It was carrying nine passengers on board as many passengers had deboarded at Narasaraopet and other places on the way. But for the timely action of the driver, the fire could have been fatal, sources said.The police are investigating the incident and believe that the bus did not carry any fire extinguisher, which is a mandatory safety requirement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/miraculous-escape-for-passengers-as-bus-catches-fire-in-andhra-pradesh-351062

The empanelment process for electric kits is under process.In all other cases, the only recourse would be to scrap vehicles which are more than 10 years old (diesel) and 15 years old (petrol).Transport department and traffic police teams are impounding such vehicles and sending them for scrapping by authorised vendors. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-to-deregister-all-diesel-vehicles-that-complete-10-years-on-january-1-351056

They reviewed the progress in the multifaceted and comprehensive bilateral ties.Addressing a press briefing here on Wednesday night, Shringla said, “As far as we are concerned, India and Bangladesh are bound by ties of history, language, spirituality and culture.” He said that the defence issue was discussed during President Kovind’s talks with Bangladesh’s top leadership.“I think the issue of imports of defence related items by Bangladesh, you are aware that we have signed, we have extended the line of credit for defence items for USD 500 million.Under this line of credit, several items have been identified and being fast tracked. They’re in fairly advanced stages of being processed… we will see certain defence items exports from India coming to Bangladesh and this is something that we would like to see,” the foreign secretary said.Sringla said that “essentially the entire gamut of cooperation, whether it is training, exchanges, joint manufacturing in the defence sector, this is something that we would like to see enhanced”.In 2019, India provided USD 500 million Line of Credit to Bangladesh for defence-related procurement in the neighbouring country.Export Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) entered into an agreement on April 11 with Bangladesh’s Armed Forces Division for making available to the latter a Government of India-supported LoC of USD 500 million.The LoC is for the purpose of financing defence-related procurement in Bangladesh.In April 2017 during Prime Minister Hasina’s visit to New Delhi, India committed USD 500 million LoC for Bangladesh’s defence.President Kovind on Wednesday assured the top leadership here that Bangladesh has a “special place” in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and underlined that the bilateral relationship based on sovereignty, equality, trust and understanding is mature enough to handle the “most complex of problems”.

He is a ‘criminal’, action should be taken against him,” Gandhi said, adding that Mishra was “involved” in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.“The minister’s involvement in Lakhimpur Kheri killings has come to light. It has been said that there was a conspiracy. We should be allowed to speak about it,” the Lok Sabha member from Wayanad said as Opposition members waved placards and raised slogans in the Well of the House.The Speaker asked Gandhi to stick to the question related to the MSME sector that was listed against his name.“You are a senior member. You ask the question number 262. You will be given adequate time to ask the question you have listed for Question Hour. You claim that you are not allowed to speak in the House. I will give you adequate time if you stick to the question listed by you,” the Speaker said.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said Gandhi was trying to speak at a time when Congress members were in the Well of the House.“How can this be allowed? Ask him to call the members back to their seats,” Joshi said.BJP members too were up on their feet as Gandhi continued to speak on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.“Your minister here has attacked farmers. He should resign. His involvement is there. There has been a conspiracy. He should be punished for that. He should be removed from the government,” Gandhi said.Congress member Gaurav Gogoi said the minister had misbehaved with journalists on Wednesday.He was referring to the minister losing his cool at reporters in Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday, calling them “thieves” and lunging at one of them when they questioned him on the October 3 violence for which his son is among the accused.With the Opposition members unrelenting, the Speaker adjourned the proceedings till 2 pm.As the Lok Sabha reassembled at 2 pm, Opposition members were in the Well again demanding action against Mishra.BJD leader Bhratruhari Mahtab, who was in the Chair, allowed laying of Parliamentary papers on the table of the House and introduction of the Biological Diversity Bill before adjourning the proceedings for the day. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in October.The SIT has arrested 13 people, including the Union Minister’s son Ashish Mishra, in the first FIR in connection with the death of the four farmers and the journalist.

16-12-2021||Lucknow||No death due to lack of oxygen during Covid-19 second wave: UP Govt||The Uttar Pradesh Government on Thursday told the Legislative Council that no death due to lack of oxygen was reported in the state during the second wave of Covid-19, a claim rejected by the Opposition.The government said the death certificates made no mention of ‘death due to lack of oxygen’ in any of the 22,915 patients who died due to the pandemic.Replying to Congress member Deepak Singh during the Question Hour, Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh said, “No death has been reported in the state due to lack of oxygen during the second wave.”          Raising a supplementary question, Deepak asked whether the government had details on similar cases that were flagged by its own ministers.“Many ministers wrote letters saying deaths are taking place due to lack of oxygen in the state. Apart from this, many MPs had also made such complaints. Many incidents of deaths due to lack of oxygen had come to light. Is there any information with the government about these deaths in the entire state? Has the government not seen the dead bodies flowing in the Ganges and people suffering due to lack of oxygen?”                      Giving clarification, Pratap said a doctor issues death certificate in case a hospitalised patient dies. He said there was no mention of ‘death due to lack of oxygen’ anywhere in the 22,915 death certificates that were issued by the doctors for Covid-19 victims in the state.The Minister said several deaths during the pandemic were due to various other diseases, including terminal ones, and that the government had arranged oxygen from other states when there was a shortage.Samajwadi Party’s (SP) Udayveer Singh had earlier said, “The Uttar Pradesh Government took action against Paras Hospital in Agra because the video of a doctor there had gone viral... half of the patients there were given oxygen and the other half died. Oxygen supply was stopped on the instructions of the District Magistrate.”      He sought to know when the government itself has taken action in the case, how it could make a “false statement” in the House.In response, the Minister said the District Magistrate and Police Commissioner’s investigation report mentioned about a ‘mock drill’ in the hospital and it was during this time that the oxygen supply had allegedly been stopped.Udayveer objected to the Minister’s reply saying the “truth will not change” if the government writes “extinct” instead of “death” in the certificate.  Deepak also argued whether the letters written by the ministers on lack of oxygen, too, were false.Leader of the House Dinesh Sharma said the Health Minister had answered the questions asked.He said the members of the Opposition should acknowledge that major casualties were avoided due to the “promptness” of the Uttar Pradesh Government in ensuring medicines and treatment.Earlier, the House proceedings were adjourned for 15 minutes with the SP members raising the demand for dismissal of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra Teni over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence which had left eight people, including four farmers, dead in October.SP’s Naresh Uttam asked why Mishra had not been dismissed. This was, however, disallowed by Chairman Manvendra Singh.The SP members barged into the Well of the House carrying placards, leading to a brief adjournment.

I have to think, I have to consult...no matter who tries to persuade me, I will weigh the pros and cons. I will consult with the people of my constituency,” she said.Prior to her, Luizinho Faleiro, Ravi Naik recently quit as Congress MLAs, Jayesh Salgaonkar resigned from the Goa Forward Party, while Rohan  Khaunte quit as an Independent legislator.In the 2017 state Assembly polls, the Congress had emerged as the single largest party by winning 17 seats.

Similarly, medicines, drugs and life-saving equipment industries can resume full-time operations while paper and pulp processing industries, paddy, rice industries and textile, garment industries can operate five days a week.The industries closed due for failure to switch over to PNG can now operate eight hours a day, the Commission had told the court, adding resumption of the use of diesel generator sets has been allowed in 44 residential and commercial spaces.During the hearing the CJI pointed out that the air quality was poor on Thursday.Power plants have been allowed to operate keeping in view the demand for power. This was after the Ministry of Power said that the existing plants cannot remain shut anymore and even the six plants located within the 300 km radius of Delhi cannot remain shut beyond December 15.On behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey, senior counsel Vikas Singh submitted that there should be a scientific study of the issue. Noting that shutting down of thermal power plants results in using diesel generator sets, Singh suggested that power plants within 300 km of Delhi should be relocated as a permanent solution to the problem.The top court had earlier passed a series of orders resulting in closure of industries and ban on entry of trucks into the national capital, except those carrying essential goods.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-satisfied-over-air-pollution-measures-taken-by-centre-panel-351033

The rifle ace told The Tribune that Konica was irregular in attending her training sessions for the last 10 days.“This is shocking news to all of us. She was doing okay in practice but of late she was missing her sessions a lot due to one reason or the other,” Joydeep said.“She was to get married soon. I don't really know what happened or forced her to take this step. We are heartbroken,” he added.The rifle ace, who has switched over to coaching since 2012, disclosed that the shooter failed to qualify for the Nationals this time after she was disqualified for target manipulation at the GV Malvankar championships.“That was a serious charge. However, she got over the shock and disappointment and was training well after it. So again I cannot really understand what she did and why she did it,” Joydeep explained.Fourth suicideThis is the fourth death by suicide in the community. Last week, young pistol shooter Khushseerat Kaur Sandhu, who had made her junior India debut at the Junior World Championships in Peru, Lima in October, took her life after registering low scores at the Shooting Nationals.In October, Hunardeep Singh Sohal, a state-level shooter, ended his life because an injury affected his shooting career. In September, Mohali’s Namanveer Singh Brar, who had won a bronze medal at the World University Games took the extreme step.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/aspiring-shooter-konica-layak-who-was-gifted-rifle-by-sonu-sood-dies-by-suicide-351020

But these days when girls are capable of doing so much and the main reason why they are married off is because they are not an income earning member of the family but why do we allow them that feeling," she told PTI."We should give them an opportunity to earn and be equal to a man and she can't become equal at 18 when man has 21 years to do that. Secondly, we took opinions from lots of people but the main people who were most attentive were stakeholders themselves. We conducted assessment calls with young people - universities, colleges and in rural areas where they are still at school or getting out of school and the unanimous opinion of stakeholders was the marriageable age to be 22 or 23. Across all religions everyone had the same opinion which was a very heartening thing," she said.Jaitly said the task force submitted its recommendations to the PMO, Women and Child Development Ministry and NITI Aayog last December.The other members in the panel include Dr V K Paul, member (health) Niti Aayog, secretaries of higher education, school education, health, women and child development, legislative department apart from academicians Najma Akhtar, Vasudha Kamat and Dipti Shah.

But ATMs are expected to function as usual.Public sector lenders, including State Bank of India, had informed customers that services in their branches might be affected due to the strike.However, the private sector, especially new generation private sector lenders, like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, are working as usual.  The strike is against the government's decision to privatise public sector banks which have been playing a vital role in nation building, (AIBEA) general secretary CH Venkatachalam told PTI.AIBOC general secretary Soumya Dutta said that about 7 lakh employees across the country are participating in the two-day strike.It is unfortunate that the working in over one lakh branches of the banks and regional rural banks had been impacted due to the strike due to the government's attitude, Dutta said."All banking services are impacted from cash withdrawals to deposits, business transactions, loan process, cheque clearing, account opening and business transactions,” he said.In the Union Budget presented in February, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the privatisation of two public sector banks as part of its disinvestment plan.

The CMs and Deputy Chief Ministers were accompanied by their wives. Party president JP Nadda, who performed “aarti” and offered prayers at the Saryu Ghat, said all CMs wanted to have “darshan” of Ram Lalla since they were already in Varanasi for the meeting with PM Modi.“We all wanted to see the grand temple being built (in Ayodhya).

The Cabinet also approved the modernisation and commercialisation of Semi-Conductor Laboratory.In compound semiconductors etc., the Centre will extend fiscal support of 30 per cent of capital expenditure to approved units with the government expecting about 15 units to be set up.The Centre also decided to extend the design linked incentive scheme to integrated circuits and IP cores, which provides companies with 50 per cent of eligible expenditure. The government will set up “India Semiconductor Mission (ISM)”, which will drive long-term strategies for developing a sustainable semiconductors and display ecosystem.“In all, the government has committed support of Rs 2.30 lakh crore ($30 billion) to position India as global hub for electronics manufacturing with semiconductors,” said the official news release.These steps will promote higher domestic value addition in electronics manufacturing and will contribute significantly to achieving a $1 trillion digital economy and a $5 trillion GDP by 2025.Implementation of PMKSY extendedNew Delhi: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved extension of implementation of ventures under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) till 2025-26 with an outlay of Rs 93,068 crore, which include construction of national projects, Renukaji Dam in Himachal Pradesh and the Lakhwar Dam in Uttarakhand.

In fact, it is just the opposite... will keep striving to realise the rights of farmers,” said Tikait, halting at several locations during the road journey to accept greetings from indebted farmers.While some presented Tikait with plaques of honour, others showered petals, catapulting the Jat leader into a formidable force no party in UP can ignore.Tikait’s message, as he left Ghazipur border after a “havan”, was of unity, resilience and apolitical nature of the farm movement. The presence of common citizens at Tikait’s farewell showed he had struck a chord.But Gandharva Singh, 90, was too nostalgic to return. He sat near the “havan kund”, his mood pensive. “My family is leaving. I feel distraught. I don’t want to return,” he told this correspondent, his son Devendra Dev standing beside him. Ghazipur resident Manisha Choudhary distributed sweets. She was among the many locals who visited the protesters and fetched them essential supplies. “We will miss the farmers a lot,” said Manisha as farmers left Ghazipur, dancing and singing patriotic songs.90-yr-old refuses to return home||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tears-joy-as-rakesh-tikait-leads-hordes-of-supporters-back-home-after-383-days-350848
16-12-2021||---||Was abruptly removed as ODI capt, says Virat Kohli||New Delhi, December 15Speaking for the first time since he was summarily removed as captain of the Indian ODI team, Virat Kohli has refuted Indian cricket board (BCCI) president Sourav Ganguly’s claim that the BCCI had ‘requested’ him not to give up captaincy of the Indian T20 team.Kohli revealed that he was informed about his sacking only hour-and-a-half before India’s Test squad for the South Africa tour was announced. Speaking in his usual forthright manner, he dismissed reports that he would not be available for the ODI series in South Africa, in which Rohit Sharma would lead India for the first time as regular captain.Ganguly had said last week that after Kohli announced his decision to give up T20 captaincy at the end of the T20 World Cup last month, he was requested to reconsider his decision. But since Kohli was firm on quitting the T20 captaincy, Ganguly said the selectors were left with no option other than to appoint Rohit Sharma as ODI captain as well, since they didn’t want to split the limited-overs captaincy.“He stepped down as T20I captain and the selectors decided not to split limited-overs captaincy, opting for a complete separation,” Ganguly had said.However, today Kohli denied this outright. “I first approached the BCCI explaining my point of view, thought process and reasons (to give up T20 captaincy). And at that point, it was received very well. There was no offence. There was no hesitancy. I was not told to not leave the T20I captaincy — rather it was received as a progressive call,” Kohli said today. “I had also communicated that yes, I would like to continue as the skipper in Tests and ODIs unless the office-bearers or the selectors feel I shouldn’t continue.”Kohli said the news of his removal as ODI captain was given to him in an off-hand manner by chief selector Chetan Sharma, at the end of a phone call in which they discussed the composition of the Test team for the South Africa tour.“I was contacted one-and-a-half hours before the selection meeting on the 8th (of December) for the Test series.There was no prior communication at all since I announced the T20I captaincy decision until the 8th of December, when I got a call before the selection meeting. The chief selector (Chetan Sharma) discussed with me the Test team, to which we both agreed. And before ending the call, I was told the five selectors have decided I will not be the ODI captain, to which I replied, ‘okay, fine’… And in the selection call afterwards, we chatted about it briefly. That’s what happened.”Kohli also said he made no request to be allowed to skip the ODI series against South Africa, and that he was tired of questions about his allegedly ‘strained’ relations with Rohit Sharma. “There is no problem between me and Rohit Sharma. I have been clarifying for the past two years and I am tired,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/was-abruptly-removed-as-odi-capt-says-virat-kohli-350846

Rahul also said Opposition leaders were trying to ensure a discussion in Parliament on the October 3 violence in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh that left eight persons, including four farmers, dead. “We are trying. They (government) are not allowing us to speak, that is why the House is being disrupted,” Rahul said.The Congress leader had earlier given an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha, demanding an immediate discussion on the Lakhimpur violence.“I hereby give notice of my intention to ask for leave to move a motion for the adjournment of the business of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent importance. The UP Police SIT report has highlighted that the massacre of farmers at Lakhimpur was a pre-planned conspiracy,” he said in his notice submitted to the Lok Sabha Secretariat.He added that the government should “immediately sack the MoS and ensure that justice is delivered to the families of the victims”.The Congress members in both Houses raised an uproar, demanding a discussion on the Lakhimpur incident and forced adjournments of the proceedings. Meanwhile, Union Minister and BJP leader Piyush Goyal, talking to reporters, said: “The probe is on under SC’s directions. Such comments (of Opposition) are unfounded.”Asked about the demand for a discussion, he said, “Parliamentary rules dictate that a sub-judice matter is not discussed (in Parliament).”The Leader of the House in the RS also hit out at the Opposition for their continuous disruption of proceedings to seek revocation of suspension of 12 MPs.Angry MoS calls scribes ‘chor’Lakhimpur: Union Minister Ajay Mishra lost his cool here on Wednesday, calling scribes“thieves” and lunging at one of them when questioned on Kheri violence.

Sonia Gandhi, Congress presidentKovind assured the top Bangladesh leadership that the nation had a “special place” in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and underlined that the bilateral relationship based on sovereignty, equality, trust and understanding was mature enough to handle the “most complex of problems”.The Prime Minister will participate in the homage and reception ceremony of ‘Swarnim Vijay Mashaal’, which he had lit on the same day last year from the ‘eternal flame’ at the National War Memorial here.As part of the ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh Celebrations’, PM Modi had also lit four flames that were carried in different directions across the length and breadth of the country, including Siachen, Kanyakumari, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Longewala, Rann of Kutch and Agartala.The flames were taken to key battle areas and also to the houses of gallantry award winners and veterans of the 1971 war. At the homage ceremony tomorrow, these four flames will be merged by the Prime Minister with the ‘eternal flame’.Various events were organised by the Indian Army at several locations in West Bengal and North-East states throughout the year and now a ‘Swarnim Vijay Gatha’ is being organised at Victoria Memorial, Kolkata, which would also mark the culmination of the ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh’ celebrations. ‘Swarnim Vijay Gatha’ will showcase a variety of events to include a customised light and sound show on the walls of Victoria Memorial, depicting the story of the Bangladesh Liberation War.President Kovind held talks with Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka on “issues of shared interest and reviewed progress relating to the bilateral cooperation between the two nations”, said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).The President and Bangladesh PM also recalled the spirit of the 1971 Liberation War and expressed satisfaction at the joint celebrations of Maitri Diwas, said MEA.Why no mention of Ex-PM Indira: AntonyEx-Defence Minister AK Antony said after the 1971 victory, BJP leader AB Vajpayee had described Indira Gandhi as “Durga”. “We are celebrating the 50th year of Bangladesh liberation, but not once have I heard a sentence of praise from the PM about her role,” said Antony.The significance||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-ram-nath-kovind-marks-bangladesh-liberation-in-dhaka-pm-to-lead-1971-war-victory-celebrations-in-delhi-350836
16-12-2021||New Delhi||Cabinet clears electoral reform proposals: 4 turns for youth to register as first-time voters||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday is learnt to have cleared a bill on electoral reforms, including the one to link electoral roll with Aadhaar on a voluntary basis to root out multiple enrolments.According to the bill, the electoral law will also be made “gender neutral” for service voters.An army man’s wife is entitled to be enrolled as a service voter, but a woman army officer’s husband is not, according to provisions in the electoral law. But this may change once the bill gets Parliament’s nod.The poll panel had asked the law ministry to replace the term ‘wife’ with ‘spouse’ in the provision in the Representation of the People Act related to service voters.Another provision of the proposed bill will allow the youth to enrol as voters on four different dates every year. As of now, those turning 18 on or before January 1 of every year are only allowed to register as voters.The Election Commission of India (ECI) had been pushing for multiple cut-off dates to allow more eligible people to register as voters.Currently, for an election to be held in a particular year, only an individual who has attained the age of 18 years as on January 1 of that year or before is eligible to be enrolled in the voters’ list.The EC had told the government that the January 1 cut-off date set for the purpose deprives several youngsters from participating in the electoral exercise held in a particular year.Due to only one qualifying or cut-off date, a person attaining the age of 18 years on January 2 cannot be registered. Therefore, a person who turns 18 after January 1 will have to wait for the next year to get registered.The law ministry had recently told a parliamentary panel that “it is proposed to amend section 14(b) of the Representation of the People Act to insert four qualifying dates (or cut-off dates) — January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1 — of every year”.In March, then law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had told Lok Sabha in a written reply that the poll panel has proposed to link electoral roll with the “Aadhaar ecosystem” with a “view to curb the menace of multiple enrolment of the same person at different places”.He said this would require amendments to the electoral laws.The minister had said the poll panel has informed that it has taken multiple measures for the security and the safety of the electoral roll data platform.“Electoral roll database system does not enter into the Aadhaar ecosystem and the system is used only for the authentication purpose keeping a tight air-gap between the two systems. These measures effectively prevent theft interception and hijacking of the voter system,” Prasad had said.The poll panel has been pressing the government to amend provisions of the Representation of the People Act allowing EC to seek Aadhaar numbers of those applying to be voters and those who are already part of the electoral rolls.According to the EC proposal sent in August 2019, the electoral law should be amended to empower electoral registration officers to seek Aadhaar number of existing voters as well as of those applying to enrol themselves in the voters’ list.In August 2015, a Supreme Court order on Aadhaar had put the brakes on the EC’s project to link UIDAI (Aadhaar) number with voters’ electoral data to check multiple entries in electoral rolls.The poll panel was then collecting Aadhaar number as part of its National Electoral Roll Purification and Authentication Programme (NERPAP).Seeking to check multiple entries in electoral rolls and to make them error-free, the EC had embarked on an ambitious project to link Aadhaar numbers with electoral data.Since the Supreme Court order makes it clear that sanction of law is required to collect Aadhaar number, the commission has proposed changes in electoral law, a poll panel functionary had explained.Yet another proposal cleared on Wednesday will allow Election Commission the powers to take over any premise for the conduct of elections.There were some objections to taking over schools, etc., during the period of elections.The bill on these reforms cleared on Wednesday are likely to be introduced in the ongoing Winter session.
