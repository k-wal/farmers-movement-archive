15-12-2021||New Delhi||After a year, traffic movement allowed at Singhu border||After over a year, the Delhi Police on Wednesday allowed traffic movement as well as opened two carriageways at Singhu border after it dismantled all the barricades that were erected to prevent the protesting farmers from moving towards the national capital.“It has been decided that Singhu border be opened from Delhi side also. It has been opened for all vehicles,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (outer north) Brijesh Yadav said.The Singhu Border on Delhi-Chandigarh highway had been the epicentre of the farmers’ movement against the three central farm laws.Farmers started leaving the protest site on the Delhi-Haryana border on Saturday after the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) suspended the agitation following the repeal of the farm laws and the government conceding to its other demands.“Only one part of the road was opened. The traffic was opened only for smaller vehicles such as bikes as the road needs to be repaired at many parts which has been damaged due to the protest. It is high time the authorities repair the stretch soon and open the traffic properly,” Jitin Dabas, a resident of Singhu village said.A commuter, Ashwani Tiwari, however, said it was a welcome move for those travelling to Haryana and Punjab.“One had to make a detour to reach Haryana and Punjab. Even if one wanted to go to Murthal, one had to take peripheral highways. Opening of traffic on the stretch will now save time and money of commuters,” Tiwari, a resident of Azadpur, said.Besides the Singhu border, farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, had laid siege to Delhi’s Tikri and Ghazipur borders on November 26 last year.The roads have already been cleared for commuters at the Tikri border and traffic is plying on the stretch, police said.However, the traffic is yet to be started at Ghazipur border.A senior police officer said that the road is still close for the traffic movement.

15-12-2021||Dhaka||Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina calls on President Kovind; discusses issues of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation||Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday called on President Ram Nath Kovind in Dhaka on the first day of his three-day visit here and the two leaders discussed several issues of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation.President Kovind arrived here earlier in the day on a maiden three-day State Visit during which he will hold talks with his counterpart M Abdul Hamid and attend the golden jubilee celebrations of Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971.“Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh called on President Ram Nath Kovind in Dhaka. Both leaders discussed several issues of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation between India and Bangladesh,” the Rashtrapati Bhavan said in a tweet.Both sides reviewed the progress in the multifaceted and comprehensive bilateral ties. The two leaders also recalled the spirit of the 1971 Liberation War and expressed satisfaction at the joint celebration of Maitri Diwas on December 6, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr A.K. Abdul Momen separately called on President Kovind and “apprised him of the excellent progress in bilateral cooperation and of future joint projects, including in the area of connectivity,” he said in another tweet.“FM Dr. Momen called on the Hon’ble President of India @rashtrapatibhvn and discussed bilateral issues. The dignitaries reiterated their wish to further consolidate the existing friendly ties between the two countries. Among others, SM @MdShahriarAlam and FS MB Momen were present,” Bangladesh Foreign Ministry tweeted.Briefing the media briefing after Prime Minister Hasina’s meeting with President Kovind, Foreign Minister Momen said that she told the Indian leader that the two countries by now resolved several pending bilateral issues and expected the rest to be settled as well through discussions.“This cooperation will ensure the stability in both the countries,” Hasina said.She said that Dhaka-New Delhi collaboration ensured peace in the region. “Peace is prevailing in the region as the two countries are working together,” she said.Momen said that the prime minister told the Indian President that Bangladesh was pledge-bound to uphold interfaith harmony in the country in line with its long standing tradition as “we do not consider any (religious) community as a minority group”.“He (Kovind) particularly appreciated the Bangladesh motto that ‘dharma jar jar, utsab sabar’ (the religion is a matter of individuals, but the religious festivals are universal),” the minister said.Junior foreign minister Shahriar Alam, who accompanied Momen during the premier’s call on, said Kovind brought with him specially made sweets and cakes for Prime Minister Hasina and requested her to taste them.President Kovind, he said, appreciated mangoes sent earlier by the Bangladesh premier for him, saying those were “very tasty and sweet”.Earlier, President Hamid along with his wife Rashida Khanam received President Kovind at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. He was accorded a red carpet welcome upon his arrival.Several senior ministers along with civil and military officials were present at the airport to receive Kovind—the only foreign head of state invited to join the celebrations.Bagchi earlier termed President Kovind’s visit to Bangladesh a “grand beginning”.“A grand beginning! In a special gesture, President HE Md. Abdul Hamid & First Lady Ms. Rashida Hamid welcomed President Kovind @rashtrapatibhvn & First Lady Smt. Savita Kovind, as they arrived in Dhaka. Accorded a red carpet welcome, a 21-gun salute, and a Guard of Honour,” Bagchi said on Twitter.The Bangladesh Army, the Navy and the Air Force personnel offered him a guard of honour as part of the welcome ceremony at the airport from where he was escorted to the National Memorial at Savar on the outskirts of the capital in a motorcade.Later in the day, Sheikh Rehana, youngest daughter of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, received President Kovind at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum and showed the visiting dignitary around it.Rehana showed him different parts of the museum, originally Bangabandhu’s private residence, where he was killed in an abortive coup on August 15, 1975 along with most of his family members.The two sisters – Hasina and Rehana - survived the putsch as they were on a visit abroad.“President Kovind @rashtrapatibhvn pays homage to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, the place which bears testimony to the life & work of the beloved Father of Bangladesh. Particularly poignant given the ongoing celebrations of Mujib Borsho,” Bagchi tweeted.“I am honored to be at Jatiya Smriti Shoudho, which stands as a symbol of valour and conviction of the people of Bangladesh against tyranny and oppression,” Kovind wrote in the visitors’ book.He is the only foreign head of state invited to join the celebrations which also coincides with birth centenary celebrations of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 50 years of Dhaka-New Delhi ties.It is President Kovind’s first trip abroad since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. He will represent India as the guest of honour in Bangladesh’s 50th Victory Day celebrations here.In a reflection of close ties, India is also hosting a number of events to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1971 India-Pakistan war that led to the liberation of Bangladesh.

15-12-2021||Washington||Biden's nominee for next envoy to India says he fully supports 'law of the land'||US President Joe Biden's nominee for next envoy to India has assured American lawmakers that he would "fully support the law of the land" and the implementation of CAATSA as he underlined that the waiver provision is part of the tough law. During his confirmation hearing as US Ambassador to India on Tuesday, 50-year-old Eric Michael Garcetti, a close confidant of President Biden, also said that the growing defence trade between India and the US is one of the major success stories of the bilateral relations.Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act or CAATSA is a tough US law which authorises the administration to impose sanctions on countries that purchase major defence hardware from Russia in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections. Responding to a question on enforcement of CAATSA sanctions on India now that New Delhi has started receiving delivery of the S-400 missile system from Russia, Garcetti, currently the Mayor of Los Angeles, said he fully supports the law of the land and the implementation of CAATSA as law."I don't want to prejudge the Secretary's decision about sanctions or a waiver. And I do want to tell the Chairman, Ranking Member (and) all the members (of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee). I do fully support the law of the land, the implementation of CAATSA as law here and part of that is the waiver provision,” said Garcetti.In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system S-400, notwithstanding warning from the then Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may trigger US sanctions under CAATSA. Alexander Mikheyev, the head of Russia's state-run military firm Rosoboronexport, said last month that Moscow has started delivery of the components of the S-400 air defence missile systems to India.Garcetti said, if confirmed, he would advocate the continued diversification of India's weapons systems, and the threats to US own weapons systems."If that diversification doesn't occur because we have to protect our data and our systems,” he said, adding that he would work towards growing the India-US Major Defence Partnership. Amid a looming threat of US sanctions on India over its procurement of S-400 missile systems from Russia, India has said that it takes sovereign decisions based on threat perception and to keep the armed forces in a state of readiness to meet the entire spectrum of security challenges.Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt, replying to a question in Lok Sabha on December 3, said the government is aware of all developments that may impact procurement of defence equipment.Bhatt said the S-400 missile is a potent system and India's air defence capability will be significantly enhanced following its induction.During the confirmation hearing, Garcetti praised the increasing defence trade between the US and India.“I think it is one of the great success stories of the last few decades from zero to USD 20 billion in procurement, the intelligence sharing that we have, the interoperability, the exercises, the maritime work that we're doing,” he said.India is the only designated Major Defence Partner of the United States.Having concluded four major defence enabling agreements since 2016, the United States and India have made significant progress as Major Defence Partners and America looks forward to further increasing information sharing, bilateral and multilateral exercises, maritime security cooperation, liaison officer exchanges, and logistical cooperation.Responding to questions related to human rights in India, Garcetti assured the lawmakers that he would personally be talking to various stakeholders in India on this issue.“I would not only just bring it up, but it would not be something at the end as an obligation. It will be a core piece of what I'll be engaging my Indian counterparts have confirmed with,” he said."There's no question that the US India relationship should be underpinned by our common commitment to democracy, human rights and to civil society...If confirmed, I will actively raise these issues. I'll raise them with humility. It's a two-way street on these, but I intend to engage directly with civil society,” he said."There are groups that are actively fighting for the human rights of people on the ground in India that will get direct engagement from me. We know that democracies are complicated and we can look at our own and at India's, but it's a cornerstone of our shared values,” Garcetti said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bidens-nominee-for-next-envoy-to-india-says-he-fully-supports-law-of-the-land-350741
15-12-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata Durga puja bags UNESCO heritage tag; Modi, Mamata hail move as 'proud moment'||The UNESCO on Wednesday accorded heritage status to Kolkata's Durga puja festival, bringing glory to the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee lauding the move. "Durga Puja in Kolkata has just been inscribed on the intangible heritage list. Congratulations India," the organisation said in a tweet attaching a photo of the goddess with the hashtag ‘living heritage'. Modi has hailed UNESCO's decision as a "matter of great pride and joy for every Indian". "Durga Puja highlights the best of our traditions and ethos. And, Kolkata's Durga Puja is an experience everyone must have," he said. The chief minister underlined that Durga puja was not just a festival, but an emotion. "Proud moment for Bengal! To every #Bengali across the world, Durga Puja is much more than a festival, it is an emotion that unites everyone. And now, #DurgaPuja has been added to the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. We are all beaming with joy!" she tweeted  The Ministry of Culture, too, took to the microblogging platform to extend its wishes to the residents of the city on this achievement. "Overjoyed that 'Durga Puja in Kolkata' joins the @UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Many congratulations! It is a confluence of the rich heritage and culture of the county's art, crafts, rituals and practices. Jai Maa Durga!" the ministry wrote. The department of state information and cultural affairs in Bengal issued a statement to congratulate the people of the state as well as the country. "The 16th Committee of UNESCO for safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) in its meeting held on 15th December 2021 in Paris has inscribed Durga puja in Kolkata on the representative list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity," it said. The department also noted that this was the "first festival in Asia" to get such recognition. "It is a red letter day for us. In real sense Bengal is now Biswa Bangla. Our congratulations to all the people of Bengal, country and the world. We convey our thanks and gratitude to UNESCO for the recognition bestowed on this great festival as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity," the statement maintained. Suvaprasanna, the chairman of West Bengal Heritage Commission, said the annual Red Road carnival, which displays the craftsmanship that goes into the making of Durga Puja pandals, have made more people across the world aware of the grandeur that is synonymous with the festival. "It was Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who started the Red Road Carnival to showcase the artwork, culture and traditions associated with the festival. Durga puja is being celebrated for decades, but the festival got a new dimension with the carnival," he stated. Welcoming the development, indologist and academician Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri said Durga puja is a "universal festival" binding millions of people. He, however, claimed that the festival should have been accorded the status much earlier. The annual Red Road carnival, organised ahead of the immersion ceremony, was last held in 2019. The event was cancelled this year as well as in 2020 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Soumen Dutta, one of the officials of Forum for Durgotsab---an apex body of community Durga puja committees in the city---said organisers of the ten-day gala have finally got their due credit. "Our hard work over the years has yielded the desired result. The magnitude of Durga puja celebrations in Bengal has no parallel in the entire world," he underlined.  On its website, UNESCO said the "festival has come to signify home-coming or a seasonal return to one's roots”. "Durga Puja is seen as the best instance of the public performance of religion and art, and as a thriving ground for collaborative artists and designers. The festival is characterised by large-scale installations and pavilions in urban areas, as well as by traditional Bengali drumming and veneration of the goddess," it added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kolkata-durga-puja-bags-unesco-heritage-tag-modi-mamata-hail-move-as-proud-moment-350740
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||First-ever anthropometric survey to design body protectors for female security personnel||In the first-ever anthropometric survey of women personnel in security forces, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed a female-specific sizing system for a full-body protector (FBP) that overcomes the limitations and hazards posed by using protectors designed for males.Initially, Indian female personnel had to wear the male FBP, which was ill-fitting and posed glaring problems. Instead of safeguarding them and letting them give their best in pressing conditions, the ensemble was a hindrance to their mobility and protection. FBP is the basic requirement for police and security troops, especially in riot conditions, and body armour that does not fit properly poses a problem when shooting, moving and communicating.“When it comes to designing a female-specific body protector, there are some design challenges like fitting the curved armour plates to fit the female form, while for men, covering the somewhat barrel-like shape of an average male torso is a comparatively uncomplicated design procedure,” the researchers said..As many as 28 anthropometric variables relating to girths of chest, abdomen, thigh, hip and calf, arm scye, arm length, upper arm length, outside leg length and inside leg length were among the variables that were analyzed among female personnel aged between 21 to 54 years to design a new female specific protector .Pointing out that currently available ensembles do not incorporate gender-specific design inputs, the study states that very frequently extra-large sizes of male body protectors were given to female troops for accommodating their bust size. However, this being too large for the target user population, caused several issues during operational manoeuvres, like the front plates pushed against the chin while sitting, difficulty in bending at the waist while getting in or out of vehicles.“This is the first comprehensive anthropometric survey conducted to develop a sizing system in Indian paramilitary personnel for their full body protector design. The outcome is an enhanced fit of FBP and a guideline for a proper sizing system and sizing designation,” the study said.The findings of the study, undertaken by six scientists at DRDO’s Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS), New Delhi, on a request from the Central Reserve Police Force, were published by DRDO in October 2021.The study observed that among US personnel who had served in Afghanistan, 20 percent of musculoskeletal injuries in females were associated with body armour, compared to only four percent for men.When female soldiers in the US military wore body armour designed for men, several problems were encountered like impeding the wearer’s range of movement, affecting their aim with a firearm and ability to swiftly get in and out of a vehicle. Moreover, during hand-to-hand combat the ill fit creates gaps that an opponent can grab onto.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-ever-anthropometric-survey-to-design-body-protectors-for-female-security-personnel-350737

We have also told them don’t register cases at the drop of a hat,” he told PTI.Debroy had approached the NHRC with his complaint that since the BJP-IPFT government came to power in the state in 2018 many scribes had been attacked and many newspaper offices had been vandalised.The other two states, whose representatives were present at the meeting, were also directed to do the same.“I have told the chief secretaries (of the three states) this (Wednesday) afternoon and they have taken note of the direction,” he said.The Commission recommended compensation of Rs 7 lakh to a minor who was raped by a paramilitary trooper in Tripura. In another case top government officers of the state were directed to provide proper medical care and treatment to a handicapped person.Kumar said the Commission has also asked the Mizoram government to pay as compensation Rs 7 lakh to the next of kin of a person who died in police custody, while Meghalaya government have been asked to submit proof of payment of Rs 3 lakh to the next of kin of a victim who died in a police encounter.Two cases in connection to the death of labourers in illegal coal mines in Meghalaya were heard and the state government was directed to give Rs five lakh as compensation to the kin of each victim, he said.In all 19 cases were heard during the two day-public hearing here. Ten of the cases were from Tripura, six from Meghalaya and 3 from Mizoram.NHRC general secretary Bimbadhar Pradhan said that the Commission is extensively using the NHRC  portal for ensuring easy and quick submission of reports and action taken reports from state governments on 22 advisories issued earlier. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-register-cases-against-scribes-at-the-drop-of-a-hat-nhrc-to-3-ne-states-350732
15-12-2021||Hyderabad||Investigative journalism vanishing in Indian media, says CJI NV Ramana||The concept of investigative journalism is vanishing in the Indian media landscape, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said on Wednesday.In a virtual book launch function, he said newspapers earlier used to expose scandals creating ripples in society and there are hardly any such explosive stories nowadays.“I am taking the liberty to share a few thoughts of the present-day media. The concept of investigative journalism is, unfortunately, vanishing from the media canvas. It is true at least in the Indian context,” Justice Ramana said.“When we were growing up, we eagerly (used to) look forward to newspapers exposing big scandals. The newspapers never disappointed us in those days. In the past, we had witnessed newspaper reports on big scandals and misconduct creating waves leading to serious consequences. Barring one or two, I do not recall any story of such magnitude,” he further said.The collective failures of individuals and institutions need to be highlighted by the media, he said.Media needs to make the people aware of the deficiencies in the system, justice Ramana added.Speaking about the book “Blood Sanders” written by city-based journalist U Sudhakar Reddy, he said Red Sander trees which mostly grow in Seshachalam forest area of Andhra Pradesh need to be protected. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/investigative-journalism-vanishing-in-indian-media-says-cji-nv-ramana-350731
15-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC refuses to entertain PIL on removal of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb content from NCERT book||The Delhi High Court Wednesday refused to entertain a PIL seeking a direction to NCERT to remove and rectify its Class 12 history textbook which states that grants were issued during the reign of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb for repairing temples destroyed during wars.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said it would impose costs and asked if the petitioners, who claimed to be “hardworking and sincere students”, wanted the court to review the policies of the Mughal rulers by way of its “so-called PIL”.“You are saying you have a problem that Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb had no such policy for giving the grants for temple repair etc? ...You want us to decide about the policies of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb? The high court will decide?” the bench questioned.The court remarked that the petition was wasting judicial time and subsequently allowed the petitioners to unconditionally withdraw the plea.The petitioners Sanjeev Vikal and Dapinder Singh Virk claimed that the NCERT has no record or information regarding the content being taught to students and wrongly projected the acts of the Mughals.“Para 2 to page 234 of the ‘Themes in Indian History Part 2’ textbook, was published without any valid source of information and was inserted just to glorify the reign of Mughal Emperors Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb,” the petition stated.“It is well known fact that most of the Mughals emperors levied heavy taxes upon the performance of the religious ceremony and pilgrim tours from the people who belong to Hindu religion. It is not a new fact that the Mughal Emperors also compelled the non-Muslim people to get converted to Islamic religion,” it added.The petitioners claimed that they even filed an RTI application before the public information officer of NCERT who stated that no information was available in their files with respect to the “source from which NCERT concluded” the statement in question.

15-12-2021||New Delhi||Shiv Sena pioneer of Hindutva politics, BJP ran away after Babri demolition: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena, a key ally of the Congress, on Wednesday staked claim to the Hindutva plank and asserted that its founder Balasaheb Thackeray had ensured that “Hindus cast their vote in the name of religion”.Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut took a swipe at former ally BJP and said his party’s commitment to Hindutva was not limited to politics or elections but to ensure people get access to food, clothes and shelter.“When Babri was being demolished in Ayodhya, those espousing the Hindutva vote bank today had run away. It was the Shiv Sainiks and Balasaheb Thackeray who stood firm in favour of Hindus and were proud of Shiv Sainiks who had demolished Babri,” Raut told reporters here.He was reacting to Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil’s claim that Chhatrapati Shivaji was the first person to have created a Hindu vote bank.“I do not know whether Chhatrapati Shivaji created the first Hindu vote bank, but he established the first Hindavi Swaraj in the country.“The teachings of Chhatrapati Shivaji were nurtured by Balasaheb Thackeray and earlier by Veer Savarkar in Maharashtra and across the country,” Raut said.Raut recalled that late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan had said that Balasaheb Thackeray had ensured that Hindus of the country cast their votes as Hindus.“Balasaheb had demonstrated for the first time that a Hindu vote bank existed in the country and ensured that Hindus cast their vote in the name of religion,” Raut said referring to the Maharashtra Assembly bypolls held after the demolition in Ayodhya.He said Shiv Sena MLAs were suspended from the assembly when they asserted that they had won the elections on the Hindutva issue.“We fought against the suspension and won. I do not recall any BJP MLA facing similar action,” Raut said.“Our Hindutva does not teach us to be scared. We stand firm, we fight and we win. Our Hindutva is not just for politics and elections. It is not limited to temples,” he said.“Our Hindutva is for ensuring that people get food, clothes and shelter,” Raut said.The Shive Sena leader’s remarks came days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi denounced Hindutva politics, saying “Hindutvadis” have a lust for power and want it at any cost.In remarks made on Tuesday, Patil had said, “The development of a vote bank dates back to sant-mahants and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

15-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi court stays FIR against Sambit Patra for posting Arvind Kejriwal’s doctored video||A Delhi court on Wednesday granted interim relief to BJP leader Sambit Patra and stayed an order directing registration of an FIR against him for allegedly posting a doctored video of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal supporting the farm laws.Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Sharma stayed the November 23 order of Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor who had directed Delhi Police to register an FIR and conduct a thorough investigation against the BJP Spokesperson, while allowing the application of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Atishi.Patra had then moved the court challenging the magistrate court’s order.“The operation of the impugned order dated November 23 is stayed,” the sessions judge said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 10, 2022.The magistrate earlier, while allowing Atishi’s plea for registration of FIR, had noted that the alleged doctored video may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation.He had said, “The fact that the video was published on the Twitter handle of proposed accused with the caption (Counting the benefits of the three farm bills) ‘teeno farm bills ke laabh ginate hue... Sir jee’, prima facie proves that same was circulated with no intention but to cause the farmers to believe that Kejriwal is supporting the farm laws, which may have perpetuated the state of outrage with the protesting farmers and may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation.”Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor had further stated that a “thorough investigation” was required to be conducted considering the seriousness of the allegations and directed the SHO to register the FIR against Patra and initiate the investigation.The directions had come on Atishi’s plea which claimed that the alleged video contained statements that were diametrically opposite to the stand taken by the Delhi CM and the Aam Aadmi Party in respect of farm laws and caused discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of farmers.

15-12-2021||Lakhimpur Kheri (UP)||WATCH: 'Turn your phone off': Ajay Mishra Teni 'abuses' journalists; video viral||Union minister Ajay Mishra lost his cool at reporters here on Wednesday, calling them “thieves” and lunging at one of them when they questioned him on the October 3 violence for which his son is among the accused.A memorandum submitted by reporters also accused the Minister of State for Home Affairs of scuffling with them and snatching a reporter’s mobile phone.The opposition has renewed its demand for the minister’s dismissal after a special investigation team (SIT) told a local court that the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed was a “pre-planned conspiracy.”       The court on Tuesday also allowed the SIT to add the attempt to murder charge in the FIR against the minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, and 12 others booked in the case, replacing it with lesser charges.The charge under section 302 (murder) is retained in the FIR.A video clip purportedly shows the minister getting angry when asked about these developments by a reporter from a television news channel.“Don’t ask questions like a fool. Have you lost your mental balance (‘Dimag kharab hai kya’)?” he is heard saying in Hindi. “What do you want to know? You turned an innocent person into an accused. Aren’t you ashamed?”      He is also heard calling the media “chor”, or thieves, and angrily asking a journalist to switch off his mobile phone.The clip shows him moving aggressively towards a reporter.The confrontation took place at a government health centre, 15 kilometres from the Lakhimpur Kheri district headquarters, where he had gone to inaugurate an oxygen plant.The hospital falls in Mishra’s Kheri parliamentary constituency, from where he has been elected twice.In the brief interaction with reporters, the minister earlier took questions on the government efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic.A journalists’ delegation later submitted a memorandum to the district magistrate, addressing it to the President and seeking security for themselves and action against the minister.The minister had on Tuesday met his son at the district jail. As scheduled, he headed for Delhi on Wednesday.The opposition has intensified its protest over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence after the Uttar Pradesh SIT’s accusation that it was a “pre-planned conspiracy”.On Wednesday, the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day after opposition members raised slogans and waved placards demanding that the minister should be sacked.Outside the Lucknow Assembly, Samajwadi Party members staged a demonstration making the demand.On October 3, four farmers and a journalist were allegedly crushed to death by a speeding SUV.  Angry farmers then allegedly lynched two BJP workers who were in the car and their driver. --- PTI  A video, purportedly of MoS Home Ajay Mishra lashing out at journalist has surfaced. pic.twitter.com/hSqyK1RkqN  ABP reporter on MoS Home Ajay Mishra Teni abusing journalists over question of Teni's son being now accused of mowing down farmers in a premeditated attack. pic.twitter.com/xMFVKVa6VF||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/watch-turn-your-phone-off-ajay-mishra-teni-abuses-journalists-video-viral-350710

Shirsat concurred that since the case is now taken over by SIT Delhi, the (Friday compulsory appearance) condition could be modified to the extent as and when he is summoned by the SIT.In a sensation, the Mumbai NCB Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede and his team raided the luxury ship, Cordelia Cruise on October 1 and detained Aryan Khan, along with others.The following day (October 2), he and seven others were arrested sparking off a massive furore with allegations and counter-allegations from various quarters vis-a-vis Wankhede's action.Though no drugs were recovered from him, Aryan Khan spent almost four weeks in NCB and judicial custody till he was granted bail on October 28, and later the case was handed over to the agency's SIT Delhi for further probe.During the subsequent NCB investigations, a total of 20 persons were arrested in the same case and a majority are now enlarged on bail.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-hc-aryan-khan-need-not-attend-ncb-office-on-fridays-350706

Heartfelt thanks to the citizens of the country,” tweeted Tikait, a prominent face of the farmers' fight for repeal of the three farm laws that had triggered the protests on Delhi's borders last year.Whenever prodded about ending the protest over the past one year, Tikait, the younger brother of BKU president Naresh Tikait, often responded, "Bill wapsi se ghar wapsi hogi."After continued protests at Delhi's border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last month announced that the three laws would be repealed.BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said Tikait would be visiting Soram, the headquarters of the sarv-khap, in Muzaffarnagar before returning home in Sisauli.While the farmers returning from protests got a hero's welcome on their way, Sisauli, the native village of the Tikait family and BKU's headquarters, also got decked up overnight for their reception."Sweets in large quantities have been prepared and the village decorated with flowers. The 'kisan bhawan' in Sisauli looks no less than a wedding bride,” Malik said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghar-wapsi-for-tikait-supporters-from-delhi-border-after-383-days-350700

We have so far recovered nine bodies, including five female passengers and the driver Appa Rao,” Rahul Dev said.Meanwhile, the state government announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of the deceased.Transport Minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) said the government would take care of the medical expenses of the injured persons.APSRTC Managing Director Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao rushed to Jangareddygudem to supervise the rescue operations.Biswa Bhusan Harichandan and Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed anguish over the bus mishap.The Governor extended his condolences to the bereaved families.The Chief Minister, too, offered his condolences to the bereaved families and directed West Godavari district Collector Kartikeya Misra to ensure better medicare to the injured passengers.Telugu Desam Party chief N Chandrababu Naidu, state Congress president Sake Sailajanath and BJP state general secretary S Vishnuvardhan Reddy too expressed grief over the accident.

In the absence of central census data, proportional representation of OBCs can’t be done in the local bodies, it had submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-rejects-maharashtras-plea-seeking-access-to-socio-economic-caste-census-2011-data-350688

15-12-2021||Washington||Growing defence trade one of great success stories of India-US ties: Eric Garcetti||The growing defence trade between India and the US is one of the major success stories of the bilateral relation, US President Joe Biden’s nominee for next envoy to New Delhi has told lawmakers.Eric Michael Garcetti, 50, is currently serving as the Mayor of Los Angeles and is a personal confidant of Biden.Garcetti, during his confirmation hearing as US Ambassador to India, said that he fully supports the law of the land, the implementation of CAATSA and part of that is the waiver provision.He was responding to a question on enforcement of CAATSA sanctions on India now that New Delhi has started receiving delivery of the S-400 missile system from Russia.“I don't want to prejudge the Secretary's decision about sanctions or a waiver. And I do want to tell the Chairman, Ranking Member (and) all the members (of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee). I do fully support the law of the land, the implementation of CAATSA as law here and part of that is the waiver provision,” Garcetti said.The Los Angeles Mayor said, if confirmed, he would advocate the continued diversification of India's weapons system, the threats to US own weapons systems.“If that diversification doesn't occur because we have to protect our data and our systems,” he said, adding that he would work towards growing India-US Major Defence Partnership. “I think it is one of the great success stories of the last few decades from zero to USD 20 billion in procurement, the intelligence sharing that we have, the interoperability, the exercises, the maritime work that we're doing,” he said.India is the only designated Major Defence Partner of the United States.Having concluded four major defence enabling agreements since 2016, the United States and India have made significant progress as Major Defence Partners and America looks forward to further increasing information sharing, bilateral and multilateral exercises, maritime security cooperation, liaison officer exchanges, and logistical cooperation.Responding to questions related to human rights in India, Garcetti assured the lawmakers that he would personally be talking to various stakeholders in India on this issue.“I would not only just bring it up, but it would not be something at the end as an obligation. It will be a core piece of what I'll be engaging my Indian counterparts have confirmed with,” he said.“There's no question that the US-India relationship should be underpinned by our common commitment to democracy, human rights and to civil society...If confirmed, I will actively raise these issues. I'll raise them with humility. It's a two-way street on these, but I intend to engage directly with civil society,” he said.“There are groups that are actively fighting for the human rights of people on the ground in India that will get direct engagement from me. We know that democracies are complicated and we can look at our own and at India's, but it's a cornerstone of our shared values,” Garcetti said.

15-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi's annual average nitrogen dioxide level way beyond safe limit since 2013: Report||Delhi has not been able to meet the CPCB's annual average safe limit of nitrogen dioxide – 40 micrograms per cubic metre – since 2013, according to a new analysis by air pollution policy tracking platform NCAP Tracker.From 2013 to 2020, Delhi's average annual NO2 levels ranged from 61 micrograms per cubic metre to 73 micrograms per cubic metre.Also read: Cloaked in smog, Haryana & Delhi-NCR air quality 'very poor' againThe capital recorded an annual average NO2 concentration of 61 micrograms per cubic metre in 2020, the lowest in the last eight years.This shows that despite the complete nationwide lockdown which halted all transport, industrial activity and many other NO2 emitting sources for three months, the year's average could not be anywhere close to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) safe limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre.Nitrogen oxides are a family of toxic, highly reactive gases which form when fuel is burned at high temperatures. NOx pollution is emitted by automobiles, trucks and various non-road vehicles like construction equipment, boats, etc.Industrial sources of NOx are essentially fossil-fuel-based power plants, incineration plants, wastewater treatment facilities, glass and cement production facilities and oil refineries.Delhi recorded a gradual increase in average annual NO2 levels from 2015 to 2018, with 2018 and 2019 recording 73.66 micrograms per cubic metre and 71 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.The analysis also revealed that NO2 emission reduced significantly (by up to 290 per cent) during the Covid lockdown period from March 25 to April 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 due to the reduced operating capacity of the thermal power plants in areas surrounding Delhi.During the lockdown, the NO2 in the city outflow was also significantly reduced due to restrictions on traffic movement.An analysis of the monthly average nitrogen dioxide levels for all 40 monitoring stations in Delhi established that 25 locations in the national capital recorded NO2 concentration above the safe limit of 80 micrograms per cubic metre in November.Anand Vihar - one of the 13 pollution hotspots in Delhi - recorded a monthly average NO2 concentration of 131 micrograms per cubic metre in November this year.“Clearly local sources like the Inter-State Bus Terminus, the Ghazipur landfill site and the NH24 highway in the area are transporting emissions from heavy vehicles and other sources to this monitoring site,” the report said.Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range recorded133 micrograms per cubic metre NO2 monthly average levels.More locations that recorded November averages for NO2 levels in triple digits are East Arjun Nagar (125), IGI Airport (111), Dilshad Garden (105), Jawaharlal Nehru University (109), Nehru Nagar (108) and Pusa Road (114).These levels are also juxtaposed with parts of the city with much lower NO2 levels, like CRRI Mathura Road (19), North Campus (5), Siri Fort (10) and Lodhi Road (15).Prof SN Tripathi, Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme, said: “NOx is showing an increasing trend in different cities of the country and particularly for Delhi-NCR. Daily exceeding values for any particular period of time, and overall average levels in NCR indicate that NOx values are far greater than annual safety limits prescribed by CPCB, leading to both short term and long term exposure to people.“This can have serious health implications. Therefore, these need to be urgently looked into and corrective and mitigative measures need to be taken so that NOx values can be brought within control in Delhi NCR and other parts of the country.”Dr Arun Sharma, Director, National Institute for Implementation Research for Non-Communicable Diseases, said: “NO2 as a gas has not so serious effects on the health of the people but its secondary effects through an increase in PM2.5 concentrations and augmentation of ozone formation are a matter of concern.”The maximum concentration is seen either in densely populated urban areas or those with a heavy concentration of industries, where habitation in poorly ventilated low-income housing is predominant, he said.Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, said focusing on such information should allow state governments, the Centre and citizens to know where to act.“Having year-long above-average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide which is evident in busy traffic or high-density industrial areas shows where action should be,'' she said.

Four farmers and a journalist were among eight persons killed.Stringent sections slappedCase now crystal clearThe case is now crystal clear. It wasn’t an accident, but a deliberate attempt with an intention to kill. — SP Yadav, Senior Public ProsecutorCongress seeks PM’s apologyModi ji, it’s time to apologise again, but first remove the accused’s father from the minister’s post. — Rahul Gandhi, CongressThe Opposition Congress and the BKU have demanded the minister’s ouster.Lakhimpur Kheri Chief Judicial Magistrate Chinta Ram on Tuesday allowed the special investigation team’s application to drop IPC sections on accidental deaths, rash and negligent driving. The court ordered the addition of pre-planned conspiracy and attempt to murder charges through Sections 326, 307 and 34 along with Sections 3, 25 and 30 of the Arms Act.“The case has now become crystal clear. It wasn’t an accident, but a deliberate attempt with an intention to kill,” Senior Public Prosecutor SP Yadav told The Tribune, pointing to SIT evidence on the use of “deadly weapons and deadly means (four protesting farmers and a journalist were run over by SUVs)”.While Section 326 has been invoked on the basis of “evidence” that the 13 accused, including Ashish Mishra, “voluntarily caused grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means”, Section 307 covers the accused who act with an intention to kill.SIT chief investigator Vidyaram Diwakar, probing the violence at Tikunia village in Kheri, had on Monday moved an application before the CJM stating that the evidence gathered so far pointed to the October 3 act being a “pre-planned conspiracy”. The MoS and his son have so far maintained innocence in the matter.Ashish is accused of being seated on the left front seat of a Mahindra Thar, the first of the three SUVs that allegedly mowed down protesters.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi demanded Mishra’s resignation and an apology from PM Modi. BKU’s Tikait, who will lead his supporters in a massive show of strength on Wednesday to vacate the Ghazipur farmers’ protest site, also sought Mishra’s ouster.Rahul earlier said, “A minister tried to kill the farmers.

Yes, I am under stress. Being the Chief Justice is stressful. I cannot avoid. I have to deal with it.”During the function, there was a demand from women lawyers for higher representation of women beyond 50 per cent on the Bench.Taking note of the under representation of women in judiciary, the CJI said, “I promise to take up your demand with my brothers in the collegium.”He said, “I also believe that it is essential to promote women in law and litigation. I also think that the focus should be from the very beginning — by increasing the number of girls choosing to study law after school. This is why I had recommended last time for some form of uniform policy of reservation for girls for entry into law colleges across the country.”Justice Ramana said, “Representation of women in all levels within the profession is quite low. I had mentioned some statistics in an earlier speech which I think merits repeating. Women constitute only around 30 per cent of the judges in our lower judiciary on average. Some states have a good number of women judges, whereas in other states the representation is abysmal.“In high courts, the percentage of women judges is mere 11.5 per cent. In the Supreme Court we have four sitting women judges, out of 33 in office. The situation of women lawyers in the country is not any better. Out of 1.7 million advocates registered, only 15 per cent are women,” the CJI said.“All these issues cannot be solved in a day. Many will take years, and even generations. But it needs to be done. There can be no denying that the inclusion of women as judges and lawyers in the country will substantially improve the justice delivery system. Women can bring a different perspective to the law which will enrich the legal field,” he noted.As a person who had his education in Telugu medium till he joined law course, the CJI appealed to all women lawyers that as mothers they should encourage their children to speak in mother tongue. “This will help them think better and learn better,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/being-chief-justice-is-stressful-says-cji-nv-ramana-350383

15-12-2021||New Delhi||No official estimation of black money in foreign accounts in last five years: Govt in Parliament||There is no official estimation how much worth of black money is lying in foreign accounts over the last five years, however, Rs 2,476 crore has been collected as tax and penalty under the one-time three months compliance window during 2015, government said in Parliament on Tuesday.As many as 648 disclosures involving undisclosed foreign assets worth Rs 4,164 crore were made in the one-time three months’ compliance window closed on September 30, 2015 under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha.He said the amount collected by way of tax and penalty in such cases was about Rs 2,476 crore.“There is no official estimation regarding the amount of black money in foreign accounts during the last five years. However, the government has taken various steps against the black money abroad which have led to positive results,” Chaudhary said.He was responding to a query on details of black money brought back to India from foreign countries since 2014 till 30th November, 2021 (year and country wise), being asked by Members of Parliament Sukhram Singh Yadav and Vishambhar Prasad Nishad.Bringing back black money stashed abroad was one of the key poll planks of the current government led by BJP, which assumed power in May 2014.The minister said that undisclosed income of more than Rs 8,466 crore has been brought to tax and penalty of more than Rs 1,294 crore has been levied on account of deposits made in unreported foreign bank accounts in “HSBC cases” so far.Sustained investigations conducted in the cases revealed by International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) have led to detection of more than Rs 11,010 crore of credits in the undisclosed foreign accounts so far, Chaudhary said.With relation to a question on action taken against persons and companies whose names were published in Panama Papers till date, he said total undisclosed credits amounting to Rs 20,353 crore have been detected with respect to 930 India linked entities in the Panama and Paradise Paper Leaks.“Taxes collected so far amount to Rs 153.88 crore in the Panama and Paradise Paper Leaks. Further, in 52 cases of Panama and Paradise Paper Leaks, criminal prosecution complaints have been filed under the black money act.Besides, 130 cases proceedings have been initiated under the act.Chaudhary said the government has taken various steps against the black money stashed abroad which have led to positive results.Multi-lateral regime for proactive sharing of financial information, setting up a special investigation team (SIT) on black money in May 2014, enactment of the stringent new law on black money that came to effect from July 2015 are among the measures taken by the government to curb black money, the minister added.The government has taken pro-active and effective steps whenever any credible information has been received with regard to black money stashed abroad, whether in HSBC cases, ICIJ cases, Paradise Papers or Panama Papers.These steps include constituting a multi agency group in relevant cases, calling for definitive information from foreign jurisdictions, bringing the black money to tax under relevant law, launching prosecutions against the offenders, he said.

15-12-2021||New Delhi||Parliament passes bills to extend up to 5 years CBI, ED directors' tenure||Parliament on Tuesday passed two bills to extend the tenure of the chiefs of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate to a maximum of five years from the earlier two years, with Rajya Sabha approving them by voice vote amid a walkout by the opposition.Lok Sabha had on December 9 cleared the two bills which were brought to replace ordinances issued last month in this regard.Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh moved ‘The Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill, 2021’ for consideration in Rajya Sabha to extend the maximum duration of the CBI director’s tenure to five years on Tuesday.  Most of the opposition parties, however, soon walked out over the issue of the suspension of their 12 members.Immediately after the passage of the bill by a voice vote, Singh tabled the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to extend the tenure of ED director to up to five years from two years which was also passed by voice vote. Earlier, the Minister of State of Parliamentary Affairs V Muraleedharan proposed for a joint debate on bills but it was opposed by several members following which Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh decided to take them separately.While moving the bill on the CBI chief’s tenure extension, Singh said the government is working to check corruption and to ensure and enhance transparency.In recent years, he said, the nation is faced with the triple menace of corruption, black money and international crime that is linked to drug trafficking, terrorism and criminal offences, and all these are a threat to the security and financial structure of the country.The methodology of crime has changed and is highly sophisticated and structured which makes crime investigation a far more difficult task, he said, stressing that the bill will help maintain the pace of probe.“These amendments have been brought in also because the financial action task force, of which India is a member country, also expects us to improve the resources for financial crime investigation and international crime,” he said.The minister underscored that each one-year extension of tenure will have a reason put on record and “we will go through the same selection process”.During his speech, Singh was interrupted by the opposition members who were protesting against the suspension of 12 members.While introducing the CVC (Amendment) Bill, 2021, Singh said the amendments are in the interest of national security and for the stability of the financial structure.“Enforcement director has a very crucial role even in money laundering cases and it is possibly the only agency of its kind available in India. But for India, most of the other countries have a much longer term. And here also, the term is not being made indefinite...,” he said.The clause on tenure which says “not less than two years” is just being amended to “go up to five years” with a one-year extension on each occasion, he added.The minister questioned the motive of the opposition in not participating in the discussion on the bill.He said that “incidentally but not insignificantly” most of the laundering cases being investigated by the agency belong to the 10-year tenure of the UPA 1 and UPA 2 governments and “involves some of the high and mighty of those times”.“To that extent, I can say it is a sad day in the history of Parliament that a principal opposition party has chosen not to side with those who are working against black money but to side with those who are the beneficiaries of black money,” Singh said.Participating in a discussion on the bill, BJP member GVL Narasimha Rao said the bills to extend the tenures of CBI and ED directors ensure that both institutions will work more efficiently.“Properties worth Rs 89,547 crore were attached under PMLA cases and (attachment of properties worth) Rs 50,945 crore has already been confirmed by the adjudicating authorities,” he said.Narasimha cited several observations of the Supreme Court in various cases, including the appointment of Central Vigilance Commissioner P J Thomas, to attack the opposition parties.Republican Party of India leader and Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale spoke in favour of the bill.“Corruption should end. Black money should end and more money should come into the national treasury,” Athawale said.Sushil Kumar Modi of the BJP said the government has taken a number of initiatives over the past few years in its relentless fight against corruption.The government has brought in a law to stop black money from being routed through Mauritius, Cyprus and Singapore. It has also brought the fugitive economic offenders law to empower law enforcement agencies to confiscate the assets of economic absconders, he said.Other initiatives such as online auction of coal blocks and direct benefit transfer have plugged leakages in the system and ensured transparency, he added.Suresh Prabhu of the BJP said there may be a debate on whether it should be five years or three years or seven years, but it is absolutely important that the tenure should be long enough to discharge duty efficiently.Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) MP Subhash Chandra Bose Pilli, TDP member Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar, AIADMK member M Thambidurai and BJP MP Rakesh Sinha also participated in the debate.

15-12-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court allows widening of roads under Char Dham Project||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 14The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed construction of all-weather 10-meter wide road under the Char Dham Road Project in Uttarakhand in view of its strategic importance for armed forces and the recent developments on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.A Bench ld by Justice D Y Chandrachud -- which had on November 11 reserved its verdict on the issue -- said it has struck a delicate balance between requirement of widening strategic roads crucial to national security and deep-rooted sustainable development principle crucial to environment.Some of the roads under the Char Dham road expansion i.e. double lane paved shoulder (DLPS) -- are strategic feeder roads leading to India-China border.Noting that recent past has thrown up serious challenges to national security along the borders, the Bench said, "This court can't second-guess infrastructural needs of armed forces."The Bench -- which had wondered if environmental concerns can override national security -- modified its September 8, 2020 order that restricted the width of Chardham projects - Rishikesh to Mana; Rishikesh to Gangotri and Rishikesh to Pithoragarh. It allowed the three strategic roads to be DLPS -- crucial for the armed forces.However, it set up an oversight committee headed by Justice (Retd) AK Sikri to report to court on the project. The panel has been asked to ensure that all remedial measures are taken in the interest of environment and recommendations of the high power committee are implemented while widening the roads under the project. It clarified that the panel will not do any fresh environmental assessment of the project.The project has been in the news following clashes between Indian and Chinese armed forces on the LAC last year. It is meant to connect the four holiest places in Uttarakhand through 900-km all-weather roads and the Centre has contended that it will facilitate rapid deployment/movement of Armed Forces along India-China border.Citing environmental concerns, petitioner Citizens for Green Doon – an NGO -- had challenged the widening of roads in the eco-sensitive Himalayan area.However, highlighting the Chinese military build-up on the other side of the LAC, Attorney General KK Venugopal had said the court should allow widening of the road that would serve as feeder roads for the border roads."The army will have to take Brahmos, which is 42-feet long in case of a confrontation. How do we go if the roads are not wide enough?" Venugopal had submitted.In view of a 2018 notification mandating a 5.5 meter limit for road width in hilly terrains, the Supreme Court had in September 2020 asked the government to comply with it in the Char Dham project. However, the Government amended the notification in December 2020 and sought the top court’s permission to construct 10 meter wide roads.“All development has to be sustainable…But sustainable development has to be balanced with defence of the nation. We can’t deny the fact…We are really in a terrain and altitude where the defence of the nation is extremely important. Can we, therefore, say we will override the concerns of the armed forces or the defence?” it had said on November 9.While hearing the NGO's PIL challenging the Stage-I forest clearance and wildlife clearance granted for the improvement/expansion of roads under Char Dham Project, resulting in felling of trees in Dehradun, Justice Chandrachud had earlier underlined the limitations of judicial activism in such cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-centres-plea-for-double-lane-roads-on-chardham-highway-project-350307
