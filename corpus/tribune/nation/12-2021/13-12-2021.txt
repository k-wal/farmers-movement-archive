And we will do so at the right place, the UNFCCC,” he said.He also asserted that developed countries must provide climate finance of USD 1 trillion at the earliest, saying it is necessary that climate finance be tracked with the same diligence as climate mitigation.“The developed countries have fallen well short of their promises,” he added.

13-12-2021||New Delhi||Last batch of farmers leaves Singhu; earth movers deployed to remove concrete barricades||After over a year, the Singhu border, which was the epicentre of the farmers’ agitation, now bears a deserted look with the last batch of demonstrators leaving for their home states on Monday.Farmers started leaving the site on the Delhi-Haryana border on Saturday after the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) suspended the protest following repeal of three farm laws and the Centre conceding to its other demands, including a panel for legal guarantee on MSP for crops and withdrawal of police cases registered against them.The border which was till recently home for thousands of agitators living in tents and having their meals at langars, now has earth movers and cranes working through the day removing concrete barricades and boulders, which were put by police to prevent farmers from moving into the national capital.Farmer leaders said that the Ghazipur border protest site will be cleared by Wednesday morning as small batches of protestors are still there.Besides Singhu, farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, on November 26 last year had laid siege also on the Tikri and Ghazipur borders of Delhi to protest against the three laws and demand their repeal.“The protesting farmers have cleared the Singhu border site now after over a year long struggle. The last batch of protesting farmers left for their homes today (Monday),” said a functionary of the SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions which was spearheading the stir.He added that some NGOs, farmer groups and police were carrying out the work to clear the road stretch where the protest took place.On November 29, the laws were repealed by Parliament and a few days later, the Centre agreed to the pending demands of the farmers, including those on MSP and police cases.“Barricades, concrete boulders and other obstacles are being removed from the highway (at Singhu), which was home for thousands of protesters for over a year, with the help of earth movers and cranes, and volunteers,” the SKM functionary said.The Tikri border stretch on Rohtak Road was opened for vehicular movement on Sunday evening.Delhi Police officials said that the work of dismantling concrete barriers and other obstacles, which were put to prevent protesting farmers to move ahead, will be completed by Tuesday.They said this work was started on Saturday evening.Some farmers are still at Ghazipur due to which barriers are still there, another official of Delhi Police said.“Temporary barricades at Ghazipur border are still placed. The police are waiting for the farmers to leave the site,” the official said.However, farmer leaders said only a small batch of protesters remain at the Ghazipur protest site.“They are waiting for farmer leader Rakesh Tikait’s arrival. Tikait is likely to reach Ghazipur border site on Tuesday evening. Protestors will then leave for their homes on Wednesday morning,” a farmer leader said.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and the Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 were repealed on November 29, but farmers refused to end their protest.They demanded that the government fulfil their other demands, which have now been accepted. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/last-batch-of-farmers-leaves-singhu-earth-movers-deployed-to-remove-concrete-barricades-349904

Worldwide for Uber they have been considered as workers, she added.As the Bench talked about the Social Security Code 2020 passed by Parliament last year that has a chapter on the welfare of gig workers, she said under existing law, the gig workers would fall under the unorganised worker.“The Respondents’ companies herein have been claiming that there exists no contract of employment between them and the petitioners and that their relationship with the petitioners is in the nature of partnership. If such a claim were to be accepted, this would be inconsistent with the purpose of social-welfare legislations...,” the petitioners submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-demanding-social-security-for-gig-workers-349901

Whether Omicron’s observed rapid growth rate in countries with high levels of population immunity is related to immune evasion, intrinsic increased transmissibility, or a combination of both remains uncertain. However, given the current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs,” the global body said.As of December 9, cases of human infections with Omicron have been identified in 63 countries across all six WHO regions with the spread picking up pace.WHO also said more data were needed to understand the clinical severity of Omicron and preliminary findings from South Africa suggest it may be less severe than Delta.All Omicron cases reported in the EU and the European Economic Area to date have been mild or asymptomatic.On vaccine impact of the new variant the world body said there was limited available data and no peer-reviewed evidence on vaccine efficacy for Omicron. “There is some preliminary evidence that the incidence of reinfection has increased in South Africa, which may be associated with antibody-mediated immune evasion,” WHO said.It added that the diagnostic accuracy of routinely used PCR and antigen-based tests did not appear to be influenced by Omicron and current therapeutic interventions are expected to remain effective.“However, monoclonal antibodies will need to be tested individually, for their antigen binding and virus neutralization and these studies should be prioritized,” said the WHO which had declared Omicron a VOC on November 26.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-will-likely-outpace-delta-who-to-member-nations-349894

Primer sets targeting these unique mutations in the S gene were designed for the specific amplification of either the Omicron variant or other currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 and tested using real time PCR,” a senior IIT Delhi official said.“Using synthetic DNA fragments, the assays were optimised to distinguish the wild-type from the Omicron variant in a dynamic range. Currently, the identification or screening for Omicron is done worldwide using next-generation sequencing based methods, which require over 3 days. By using this RT-PCR based assay, it will be possible to test for the presence of the Omicron variant within 90 minutes,” the official added.IIT Delhi was the first academic institute in India to have obtained ICMR approval for a real-time PCR-based diagnostic assay. The institute developed a method to detect Covid-19 which significantly reduced the cost of testing, making it affordable for a large population in the country.Following approval from the ICMR, the kit was successfully launched in the market.The Omicron variant was first detected in India in Bengaluru with two people testing positive for it.Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Chandigarh reported their first Omicron case on Sunday, while Maharashtra and Karnataka each recorded one more case of the COVID-19 variant, taking the tally in the country to 38.Cases of Omicron, which is categorised as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation, have been detected in about 60 countries.

CBSE has dropped a passage and accompanying questions which were asked in English term 1 paper for class 10 as it was not in adherence with guidelines issued by the board for external paper setters.“CBSE regrets the unfortunate incident and is setting up an expert committee to thoroughly review and strengthen the question paper setting processes to avoid such occurrences in future,” the board said in an official statement.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had referred the matter to subject experts on Sunday and sought their feedback.In the Class-10 exam conducted on Saturday, the question paper carried a comprehension passage with sentences such as “emancipation of women destroyed the parents’ authority over the children” and “it was only by accepting her husband’s way that a mother could gain obedience over the younger ones”, among others.Raising the issue in Lok Sabha, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday condemned the “blatantly misogynist” and “nonsensical” questions, saying those reflected “extremely poorly” on the standards of education and testing.She demanded an apology from the government and a review into this “gravest lapse”.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also took to Twitter to raise the issue.Excerpts from the passage have gone viral on social media platforms with users calling out the board for supporting “misogynistic” and “regressive opinions” and the hashtag “#CBSEinsultswomen” trending on Twitter.

He came to power through our mandate. Merely because you have political differences, you cannot challenge this. Why are you ashamed of our PM? 100 crore people don't seem to have an issue with this, so why do you. Everyone has different political opinions, but he is still our Prime Minister. You are wasting judicial time," said the judge.When the petitioner's counsel pointed out that other countries do not have such a practise, the judge said, "they may not be proud of their Prime Minister, but we are proud of ours. You should be proud that your vaccination certificate carries the photograph of our PM."The court also pointed out that the petitioner was the state level master coach at the Jawaharlal Nehru Leadership Institute, which is named after a Prime Minister. "Why don't you ask the university to take that down as well."The petitioner's counsel continued to defend the petition and finally the court said that it will go through the pleadings in detail with an open mind and decide if it has any merits before dismissing it.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-are-you-ashamed-of-pms-photo-on-vaccine-certificate-kerala-hc-asks-petitioner-349886

It reported the first such case on December 5 when a 37-year-old fully-vaccinated man, who arrived in the city from Tanzania, tested positive for Omicron.The second case was reported last week when a fully-vaccinated individual with a travel history to Zimbabwe and South Africa tested positive for the new Covid variant."If need be, we will impose restrictions. At present, these is no need for restrictions. We are in constant touch with experts and if any restriction is to be imposed for the safety of the people of Delhi, we will do that," Kejriwal told reporters on the sidelines of an event where he launched the "Dilli Ki Yogshala" initiative.Asked about possible restrictions or crowd-control measures in view of Christmas and New Year, he said, "We will do that after consulting with experts. If there is a need to clamp restrictions, we will take a decision in accordance with the suggestions of the experts."       The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said he has been closely monitoring the situation in the aftermath of the detection of the new coronavirus variant and adequate arrangements, including those related to hospital beds and medicines, will be made available."The government is fully prepared.

It has to be taken on a mission mode and the zero budget natural farming also. Very soon in near future, it (the committee) will be set up,” Agrawal told the media here.Agrawal was briefing about a three-day national event with focus on natural farming to be held at Anand, Gujarat, from December 14. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address virtually the valedictory function on December 16.Gujarat Chief Secretary Pankaj Kumar was also present virtually during the press conference.Asked what aspects of natural farming and if the outcome of the national event will be discussed in the proposed committee to be set up soon, the secretary said that the contours of the panel has not yet been decided.Modi on November 19 while announcing repeal of the three controversial farm laws, which had triggered a massive farmer protest at Delhi borders, had also said the government will set up a committee to make MSP more effective and transparent as well as suggest ways to promote zero budget natural farming.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh had staged relentless protests at Delhi borders against these three laws for over a year.The three farm laws were repealed in Parliament on November 29 but the stalemate continued as farmers sought government assurance on their other demands such as legal guarantee on MSP, compensation to families of farmers who died during the movement and withdrawal of cases against them.Protesting farmers agreed to suspend their agitation and return to their homes on December 11 after the government promised to fulfil their remaining demands.

On one side they say they don't do such things and on the other side they oppose (the bill), they have ambiguity, not us," Kumar said in response to a question.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the winter session of Karnataka legislature that began today in this border district, he said, "We had been stating from the beginning that the BJP government will bring in anti-cow slaughter and anti-conversion law, we are committed to it. I will go a step ahead and say that in the days to come we will bring a law against love jihad." The government had earlier enacted the anti-cow slaughter law in the state; it is now preparing to table the anti-conversion Bill during the ongoing winter session.Regarding a law against 'love jihad', the government had earlier this year said that officials have been directed to gather information on an ordinance promulgated in Uttar Pradesh in this regard.Defending the proposed anti-conversion Bill, the Minister said, religious conversions are taking place in a big way targeting poor and weaker sections, either by force or through inducements, and hence it was considered necessary to bring in a law to stop such activities."Let Congress say, as to why they are opposed to it, we are ready to debate and respond," he said, adding that the proposed bill is keeping in mind the entire society and not targeted at any particular religion or community.

She took out her mobile phone that had been kept in an inner pocket and first sent her GPS location to her mother through WhatsApp and then called her informing what had happened and that she was in trouble.Her family, relatives and the police tracked her location to a house in Mathura Nagar, Rawatpur, and rescued her safely.The two teenage girls and a boy, Saurabh Sharma aka Ramji, were later detained by the police.An FIR has been registered against the accused under the relevant IPC sections and the statement of the girl has also been recorded.ACP Nazirabad Santosh Kumar Singh, said, “The detained girls will be questioned after recording their statements to ascertain the motive behind the kidnapping.”—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kidnapped-up-girl-uses-gps-to-save-herself-349877

13-12-2021||New Delhi||CBSE should consider problem of students who scored less marks in Class 12 improvement exams: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said the CBSE should consider the problem of those students who had appeared in the examinations this year for improving marks in class 12 but obtained lower numbers, as it will affect the admissions secured by them for higher studies.The students who appeared in the improvement exams have taken admissions based on their original results and that should not be disturbed, the apex court observed.A Bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar was informed that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has filed a counter affidavit stating that the previous result of the students, who failed subsequently in the improvement examinations, would be considered and they would have the opportunity to retain it.“The only difficulty is with the students who have scored less marks in improvement examinations. They have also taken admission on the basis of their previous result. So, they should also be given the liberty to keep their original result that was published on the basis of the evaluation policy,” the counsel appearing for the petitioners told the Bench.The top court was hearing a plea filed by some students, who had appeared in the CBSE examinations this year for improving their marks in class 12, seeking a direction to the board to maintain their original results.The Bench told the counsel appearing for the CBSE that such students, who have scored less marks in improvement examinations, have taken admissions on the basis of their original marks.“This will have an impact on the admission which has been given,” the Bench observed, adding, “Their admission will be affected immediately.”          “You will have to consider this. This is only a one-time arrangement. This is not a permanent policy,” the Bench told the CBSE’s counsel, who said he would take instructions on this aspect.The Bench further observed, “You either say yes or no. We will issue direction otherwise. The admission should not be disturbed. That is all what we will say.”  The top court asked the board’s counsel whether he had discussed this issue with the concerned officials as this would be a problem which the students, who have appeared in the improvement examination, would face.“This is a problem which is faced by the students. How will you reconcile with that,” the Bench said.The CBSE’s counsel said he would take instructions on this after which the Bench posted it for hearing on January 7.The top court was hearing a plea filed by 11 students who were declared passed in the original results by the CBSE on the basis of the evaluation policy of 30:30:40 and were subsequently allowed to appear in the improvement exams held in August-September this year.The plea said the petitioners have been either declared failed or awarded very less marks in the improvement examinations and they apprehend that their original results, in which they were declared pass, will be cancelled.It has sought a direction to the CBSE not to declare as fail the class 12 students who were already declared pass in the original results on the basis of the evaluation policy.The plea has further sought a direction to the concerned authorities to maintain the original result of the petitioners instead of the improvement examination result.As per a press statement of CBSE, 34,317 regular students had appeared in the offline examinations for the purpose of improvement of their marks, it said.On June 17, the top court had approved the assessment schemes of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and the CBSE, which had adopted the 30:30:40 formula for evaluation of marks for students of 12th standard based on results of class 10, 11 and 12 respectively.The CBSE had earlier said it would evaluate class 12 students for theory based on 30 per cent marks from class 10 board, 30 per cent from class 11, and 40 per cent from marks based on the performance in the unit, mid-term, and pre-board tests in class 12.It had said that marks obtained by class 12 students in practical and internal assessment on an actual basis as uploaded by schools on the CBSE portal would be also considered in deciding final results. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-should-consider-problem-of-students-who-scored-less-marks-in-class-12-improvement-exams-sc-349872
13-12-2021||Mumbai||Defamation case: Javed Akhtar seeks non bailable warrant against Kangana||Veteran scriptwriter-lyricist Javed Akhtar on Monday moved a plea before a court here seeking issuance of a non-bailable warrant against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut in a criminal defamation case filed by him against her.The application, moved by Akhtar’s lawyer Jay Bharadwaj, listed the number of exemptions Ranaut has sought for one reason or another since March this year.She had last appeared before Andheri metropolitan magistrate RR Khan on September 20.“It can be clearly deciphered from the conduct of the accused that from the time of issuance of process by this court (Andheri metropolitan magistrate court) she has been deploying all possible tactics to cause inordinate delays in the matter,” the application said.It also mentioned the actor was making “false and incorrect statements” before the court.As per Akhtar’s application, Ranaut, on the last date of hearing, which was on October 21, had sought exemption claiming she was suffering from high temperature and body ache.The application said Ranaut claimed she was unwell but her Instagram handle updates of November 15 showed she was “actively involved” in the shooting of her forthcoming films.The actor had also submitted, through her lawyer, that she was in the process of challenging the chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) court’s dismissal order of her transfer petition.The application stated that Ranaut had not filed any plea as yet challenging the CMM court’s order.“In other words, the present case could not proceed further after the issuance of process owing to the wilful and deliberate absence of the accused solely designed to derail the proceedings and to cause incalculable hardships to the complainant,” the application further said.The court has kept the application pending and asked Kangana’s lawyer to file their reply on January 4, the next date of hearing. The court also directed her lawyer to ensure the actor’s presence on the next hearing.Earlier, a chief metropolitan magistrate had rejected Ranaut’s petition seeking transfer of the criminal defamation case. She had moved the plea saying she had “lost faith” in the magistrate’s court hearing the case, as it had indirectly “threatened” to issue a warrant if she failed to appear before it in a bailable offence.Akhtar (76) had filed the complaint in the Andheri court in November, 2020 claiming Ranaut had made defamatory statements against him in a television interview. He claimed the actor had dragged in his name while referring to a “coterie” existing in Bollywood, following the alleged suicide by actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year.

13-12-2021||Kolkata||Nagaland firing incident proves high time AFSPA is repealed from NE: Irom||Rights activist Irom Sharmila, who was on a 16-year hunger strike against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), feels the recent killing of civilians in firing by security forces in Nagaland should be an eye-opener to repeal the controversial security law from the northeast.Sharmila said the AFSPA is not only an oppressive regulation, it tantamounts to gross violation of basic human rights.  The AFSPA empowers security forces to conduct operations anywhere and arrest anyone without prior warrant. In the northeast, it is in force in Assam, Nagaland, Manipur (excluding Imphal Municipal Council Area) and some districts of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering Assam.                “The Nagaland incident has once again shown why the draconian AFSPA should be withdrawn from the northeast. It should be an eye-opener. Human lives are not so cheap.“For how long will the people of the region suffer because of it? In the name of battling insurgency, you can’t take away people’s basic rights. There are other ways to tackle it,” Sharmila, who ended her marathon hunger strike in 2016, told PTI in a telephonic interview.At least 14 civilians and a soldier were killed in a botched anti-insurgency operation and retaliatory violence on December 4 and the following day in Nagaland’s Mon district. “After the passing of the Act in 1958 and subsequent implementation in the northeast, did it achieve the desired purpose? If not, what is the use of thrusting it on the masses? It’s high time the Centre and state governments sit together and take a relook at AFSPA,” she said.Critics maintain that the AFSPA has failed to control insurgency despite giving armed forces powers to act with impunity, sometimes leading to human rights violations.Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio and Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma have also demanded that the law be repealed.Asked if its withdrawal from the northeast would worsen the law and order situation in the area, Sharmila replied in the negative. “There are other ways to tackle insurgency. In Chhattisgarh, there have been several Maoist incidents; so did the government impose AFSPA there? The answer is no. The security forces are tackling it in that state, and they have been successful. The same can be done in the northeast,” she said.Claiming that people from the northeast have to face discriminatory treatment in other parts of the country, Sharmila, who unsuccessfully contested the 2017 Manipur assembly elections, said the “rampant violation of human rights in the name of AFSPA stems from that discrimination”. “We are harassed and humiliated… You have to change your mindset and treat the people of this part of India as your own,” she said.The ‘Iron lady of Manipur’ also said she has realised that her lengthy hunger strike did not achieve its purpose.“All my life, I believed in the Gandhian principles of non-violence. My fast was a non-violent way of registering my protest and press for the people’s demand. But after 16 years, when I ended my hunger strike, a lot of people misunderstood me. It failed to accomplish any purpose,” she said.Sharmila said she has nothing against the armed forces, but politics and political parties have failed the people of the Northeast.She condoled the demise of Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat, saying his death is a loss for the entire nation. The 49-year-old rights activist, who got married in 2017 and is now settled in the southern part of the country with her family, also said she is not interested in giving another shot at politics. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nagaland-firing-incident-proves-high-time-afspa-is-repealed-from-ne-irom-349861

13-12-2021||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut’s social media post on farmers: Won’t arrest her till Jan 25, Mumbai Police tell HC||The city police told the Bombay High Court on Monday that they will not arrest actor Kangana Ranaut till January 25, 2022, over her social media post that allegedly linked farmers’ protests to a separatist group.The police made the statement after a Bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal said the issue involved the larger question of Ranaut’s fundamental right to free speech and that the court will have to grant her some ad-interim relief.Ranaut approached the HC earlier this month, seeking that the FIR registered against her in November this year at Khar police station Mumbai, following a complaint by a Sikh organisation, be quashed.In her plea filed through advocate Rizwan Sidiquee, Ranaut said while the complainants took objection to her Instagram post made on November 21, there was no legal case made out against her.The FIR was registered against the actor following a complaint made by some members of a Sikh body that claimed Ranaut, through her Instagram post, had portrayed the farmers’ protest on Delhi borders as a Khalistani movement.The police then booked Ranaut on charges of deliberately hurting the community’s religious sentiments under Section 295-A of the Indian Penal Code.On Monday, Ranaut’s counsel told the HC that to invoke charges under section 295-A, an accused must have made the offensive comment with the deliberate and malicious intent of hurting a particular person or a community’s religious sentiments. However, in the present case, the actor had no such intention, her counsel said.The bench went through Ranaut’s social media post in question and agreed with her counsel’s submission.“Where is the deliberate and malicious intent here? Section 295 says that should be the sole and dominant object,” the HC said to the prosecution.The bench then asked the police if they intended to arrest Ranaut in the case.Chief Public Prosecutor Aruna Pai, who appeared for the police, said the Khar police had issued a notice to Ranaut, asking her to appear before them for questioning, but the actor hadn’t responded to it yet.“We have issued a notice to her (Ranaut) under Section 41A of the CrPC on December 1, but she hasn’t responded. She isn’t cooperating,” Pai told the HC.A notice under Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) is issued to an accused in cases where immediate arrest is not necessary, but the accused’s presence is required at police station for questioning.Ranaut’s counsel told the HC that she was willing to appear before the police, but apprehended her arrest in the case.The HC then told Pai that the Khar police will require to make a categorical statement on whether they intended to arrest Ranaut or not.“There is also the larger question of the protection of freedom of speech here. Unless the police make a statement of not arresting her (Ranaut), we’ll have to grant some relief,” the court said.Ranaut’s counsel said the actor will appear before the Khar police on December 22.Pai then made a statement on behalf of the investigating officer in the case that the “police will not arrest her (Ranaut) until the next date of hearing in the HC.” The court accepted the police’s statement and posted the matter for further hearing on January 25, 2022.The HC also granted time to the complainants till the next hearing to file a reply to Ranaut’s plea.

13-12-2021||Mumbai||Non-BJP parties should avoid vote split in UP; NCP in talks with Congress over Goa polls: Nawab Malik||Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik on Monday said his party NCP is of the view that there should be no division of votes among like-minded parties to take on the BJP in the forthcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.The NCP is also in talks with the Congress over the forthcoming Goa Assembly polls and pitching for unity among the anti-BJP parties, but “there has been no response yet”, Malik told reporters.The Assembly polls in UP and Goa, both currently ruled by the BJP, are due early next year.“We should support the party which is contesting the election with all its might in Uttar Pradesh. It is our view that there should be no division of votes (among non-BJP parties) in Uttar Pradesh,” said Malik, who is the NCP’s national spokesperson.The NCP is discussing the same with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (key opposition party in Uttar Pradesh), said the minister, whose party shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra.In the case of Goa, Malik said senior NCP leader Praful Patel has held discussion with Congress’ in-charge for the neighbouring state, Dinesh Gundu Rao, over unity among like-minded parties as they face polls there, “but there has been no response yet”.“Definitely, we are for the unity of all (non-BJP) parties. It can happen if the Congress takes an initiative. The Congress is a big party there. It is the responsibility of the Congress to take all together…Our position will be decided once the Congress takes its decision,” Malik said.In the 2017 Goa Assembly polls, the Congress had emerged as the single largest party by winning 17 seats in the 40-member House, but failed to form government.The BJP, which had won 13 seats, forged an alliance with some regional outfits and independents to form government in the coastal state.

Bigotry doesn’t,” Gandhi said.Congress chief Sonia Gandhi also raised the issue in the Lok Sabha.In the Class-10 exam conducted on Saturday, the question paper carried a comprehension passage with sentences like “emancipation of women destroyed the parent’s authority over the children” and “it was only by accepting her husband’s way that a mother could gain obedience over the younger ones”, among others.Various excerpts from the passage have gone viral on social media with users calling out the board for supporting “misogynistic” and “regressive opinions” and hashtag “CBSE insults women” trending on the microblogging site Twitter.

13-12-2021||---||Apologise for blatantly misogynistic Q passage: Sonia Gandhi to Education Ministry, CBSE||New Delhi, December 13Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday demanded an apology from the Ministry of Education and the CBSE for a “blatantly misogynistic passage” in English reading and comprehension section of the Board exam held on December 11, and sought a probe to ensure such “egregious material doesn’t find its way to examinations again.”Raising the issue in Zero Hour today, Sonia Gandhi drew the attention of the House to the outrage against the objectionable passages.CBSE drops question in Class 10 English paper after outrage“I want to draw the attention of the House to the nationwide outrage regarding a shockingly regressive passage in the reading comprehension section of the Grade-10 CBSE exam held on December 11.“The passage contains atrocious statements,” Sonia said.The two passages in question read: “Women gaining independence is the main reason for a wide variety of social and family problems” and “Wives stopped obeying their husbands and that’s the main reason children and servants are indisciplined.”Noting that the entire passage is riddled with “such condemnable ideas and the questions that follow are equally non-sensical”, Sonia said, “I add my voice to the concerns of students, parents, teachers and educationists and I raise strong objection to such blatantly misogynistic material finding its way into an important examination conducted by the CBSE.”She said the development reflects extremely poorly on the standards of education and testing and goes against all norms and principles of a progressive and empowered society“I urge the Education Ministry and CBSE to immediately withdraw this question, issue an apology and conduct a thorough review into this egregious lapse to ensure this is never repeated again. I also urge the ministry to conduct a review of gender sensitivity standards of the curriculum.”Earlier today, Rahul Gandhi said most CBSE papers so far were too difficult and the comprehension passage in the English paper was downright disgusting.“Typical RSS-BJP ploys to crush the morale and future of the youth. Kids, do your best. Hard work pays.

13-12-2021||Varanasi||PM Modi inaugurates first phase of Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the first phase of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham here, a project which is spread over five lakh square feet and connects the temple premises to the River Ganga besides providing several facilities to devotees.After arriving in the holy city, also his parliamentary constituency, Modi paid obeisance at the Kaal Bhairav Temple and then took dip in Ganga from where he collected holy water for worship at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.People chanted hymns as the Prime Minister’s carcade rolled through the city. Modi also stopped at some places to accept felicitation.Before the inauguration, Modi attended a prayer ceremony and later showered workers involved in building the project with flower petals in a gesture to acknowledge their work. He also sat with them for a group photograph.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP President J P Nadda and a large number of saints from across the country attended the ceremony.The earlier Kashi Vishwanath premises was limited to just 3000 square feet. Now 23 new buildings have been constructed that will provide diverse facilities to the pilgrims and devotees.The inauguration of the state-of-the-art infrastructure, built at the cost of Rs 339 crore, surrounding the historic Kashi Vishwanath Temple near the iconic Dashashwamedh Ghat comes ahead of the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh early next year.The gateways and other structures have been built with stones and other material using traditional craftsmanship.The new buildings will provide a variety of facilities to pilgrims, including ‘yatri suvidha kendras’, tourist facilitation centre, vedic kendra, mumukshu bhavan, bhogshala, city museum, viewing gallery, food court among others.The project involved purchase and acquisition of more than 300 properties around the temple.Addressing the gathering, Modi lauded the civilisational heritage of Varanasi, and said many sultanates rose and collapsed but Benaras remained.“Invaders attacked this city, tried to destroy it. History is witness to Aurangzeb’s atrocities, his terror. He tried to change civilisation by the sword. He tried to crush culture with fanaticism. But the soil of this country is different from the rest of the world. Here if an (Mughal Emperor) Aurangzeb comes, a (Maratha warrior) Shivaji also rises,” Modi said.“If a Salar Masud marches ahead, warriors like Raja Suhaldev make him realise the power of our unity,” he said.Modi said the whole new complex of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham is not just a grand building, but a symbol of the “Sanatan culture” of India, our spiritual soul and India’s antiquity and traditions.The temple area here, which was only 3000 square feet, has now spread to about five lakh square feet, Modi said.Now 50,000-75,000 devotees can come to the temple premises, he said.He said “new history” was being created and “we are fortunate to have witnessed it”.Modi also spoke in local dialect during his speech.

Fourteen persons, most of them security personnel guarding the Parliament complex, were killed in the attack.Marking the 20th year of the attack, President Kovind said, “I pay homage to the brave security personnel who laid down their lives on this day in 2001, defending Parliament of the world’s largest democracy against a dastardly terrorist attack. The nation shall forever remain grateful to them for their supreme sacrifice.”PM Modi in his message paid tributes to all those security personnel who were martyred in the line of duty during the Parliament attack in 2001.“Their service to the nation and supreme sacrifice continues to inspire every citizen,” the PM said.Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla also paid floral tributes to the deceased in the Parliament House complex and later through obituary references in the houses saluted the security personnel who died that day.“Eight secure personnel died and one officer too. This house pays tributes to the brave-hearts who died guarding the Parliament,” Birla said.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and other senior ministers also paid floral tributes today.Five heavily armed terrorists had stormed the Parliament complex on this day 20 years ago.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/20-years-of-parliament-attack-president-kovind-pm-modi-lead-tributes-349834
13-12-2021||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha adjourned till 2 pm amid protests over suspension of 12 MPs||Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned again till 2 pm on Monday amid unrelenting Opposition protests over the issue of suspension of 12 MPs.As soon as the House reassembled at 12 noon, Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh began the Question Hour and called out a member to ask supplementary queries.While the Opposition members were standing and protesting, the Leader of the House Piyush Goyal rose to respond to some of the “allegations and wrong statements” made by Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge.Goyal said, “They should not think that we have not responded. We constantly tried speaking to the Leader of the Opposition and members but they are making statements that they will not apologise as they have not done anything wrong.”Holding that the Opposition members have let down the dignity of the Upper House, he said they are not feeling sorry for their conduct displayed in the previous session.They had insulted the chair, staff, marshals, the House and the entire country, he said.The Opposition continued with this behaviour despite the Chair requesting them to keep the House in order.“Today the irony is that they (opposition members) are alleging that the Chair was not heeding to their requests,” he said.As the Opposition protests intensified, the Chair adjourned the House till 2 PM.Earlier, proceedings of the Rajya Sabha were disrupted till 12 noon as the Opposition insisted that the government should take the initiative to resolve the issue of suspension of 12 members.The Opposition stressed that they were keen on smooth functioning of the House, but alleged the government was adamant.As many as 12 Opposition MPs were suspended from the Rajya Sabha on November 29 for the entire Winter Session of Parliament for their “unruly” conduct in the previous session in August, even as the Opposition termed the suspension as “undemocratic and in violation of all the Rules of Procedure” of the Upper House.Raising the matter during the morning session, Kharge said the Opposition was “repeatedly requesting” the government to find a solution.“The government cannot dictate what should (we) do, what should (we) not do? They are repeatedly refusing to concede our request and they are putting blame on us. So it is not good. Therefore, I can say that government is adamant and...they are provoking us to disrupt the House. So, in protest of that, we will walkout,” Kharge said.As members started moving out, some opposition MPs continued to argue the matter forcing Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to adjourn the House at around 11.10 AM till 12 noon.Before adjourning the proceedings, the Chairman remarked that he does not want to run proceedings with members standing.“Don’t further complicate the matter. You are defending the undefendable...The House is not able to function. So I adjourn the House till 12 PM,” Naidu said.Earlier, veteran Congress leader Anand Sharma said the Chairman had last week urged the government and the Opposition to find a constructive solution to the matter which is acceptable to both the sides.Noting that the Leader of House was present in the House, Sharma said, “We urged the government now to respond”.DMK’s Tiruchi Siva supported Sharma, and said the Opposition was interested in the smooth functioning of the House, but it is the government’s responsibility.“Since they had moved the resolution (for suspension of the 12 MPs), let them find a way out to end the logjam,” he said.To this, Chairman Naidu said if both the sides could come together and find a way out, then the House can go on smoothly.“I hope everybody will understand,” he said.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-adjourned-till-noon-349833

That would have meant Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing joining Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand and Sri Lanka for the Republic Day celebrations. This would not have gone down well with the international community, which is keeping him at an arm’s distance.This year’s Republic Day parade resulted in a no-show as the chief guest, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, could not leave his country due to a surge in Covid cases.India has frequently touched base with leaders of Central Asian countries, both in stand-alone mode as well as through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).At a recent SCO meet, Jaishankar had outlined why these countries were important as India sought to develop a route into Afghanistan and beyond without transiting through Pakistan. India, he had said, was taking steps to operationalise the Chabahar port in Iran.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/republic-day-india-to-invite-central-asian-nations-349570

He said states had to make it clear whether they trusted the CBI or not, or whether they trusted the agency selectively as they continued to give selective consent in cases which suited them.Asking the states to “rethink” their decisions to withdraw general consent, the minister said the governments continued to refer cases to the CBI under public pressure which indicated that the people had greater trust in the agency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/minister-urges-states-not-to-trust-cbi-selectively-349567

I am a Hindu and not a Hindutvadi. Everyone in the gathering is a Hindu and not a Hindutvadi. Mahatma Gandhi was a Hindu and Godse a Hindutvadi,”said Rahul.Seeking to explain his construct, Rahul said while a Hindu, come what may, would pursue the path of truth like Mahatma Gandhi, a Hindutvadi cared only for power.“Mahatma Gandhi wrote ‘My Experiments with Truth’ and spent his life searching for truth. In the end, a Hindutvadi pumped three bullets into his chest,” Rahul said, adding that a Hindutvadi would spend his life yearning for power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-belongs-to-hindus-not-hindutvadi-rahul-in-jaipur-349566

India’s approach in this region can be anchored on the concept of SAGAR, implying security and growth for all. —Admiral Sunil Lanba, Former chief of naval staffPointing out that the Indo-Pacific region is characterised by multi-layered and multi-faceted diversity in political, demographic, economic, environmental and strategic arenas, Admiral Lanba said recent political developments in some key countries indicated a significant shift.“Everything around us suggests that we are in the grip of a global transition which is leading to a state of strategic uncertainty,” he said.The economic resurgence in the Indo-Pacific region had raised its strategic significance, increasing the competition among regional and extra-regional powers, said Admiral Lanba.The world’s largest militaries are present in this region.“We are witnessing a re-balancing of global economy. The largest economies in the future will be led by India and China,” the former Navy Chief said.The impact of the aggressive relationship between India and China, and China and the US did not augur well for the Indo-Pacific region, which had emerged as a global economic powerhouse, accounting for about 60 per cent of the global GDP and having a major share in sea-borne commercial traffic, he said.Meanwhile, Gp Capt CS Sandhu, a Vir Chakra recipient who had commanded 110 Helicopter Unit during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, and Sqn Ldr PK Vaid, a Vir Chakra recipient who was a pilot in the unit, discussed special heli-borne operations in the eastern sector.It was for the first time that the special heli-borne operations at night were carried out.Sqn Ldr Vaid spoke about his experience of dropping troops in the battle zone at night. “My helicopter, with top senior Army commanders on board, came under enemy fire. Though the chopper had 39 bullet holes, no one was killed. The pilot suffered a bullet injury,” he recalled.He added the use of helicopters was a masterstroke and helped shorten the war because choppers allowed quick movement of troops.A ‘Bravehearts motorcycle ride’ to commemorate India’s historic victory in the 1971 war was held here today. About 525 riders from more than 20 clubs participated in the event.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/regional-cooperation-must-for-maritime-security-navy-ex-chief-349564
