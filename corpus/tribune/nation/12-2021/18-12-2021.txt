18-12-2021||---||Row over EC’s meet: Centre says letter was for secretary or an official representative, not CEC||New Delhi, December 18Amid a controversy over a government communication reportedly calling the Chief Election Commissioner to a meeting, the law ministry Saturday said the letter was meant for a secretary of the poll panel or a representative of the CEC, and the subsequent virtual interaction with the CEC and two ECs was to iron out differences over electoral reforms.In a statement, the law ministry said the Prime Minister’s Office had written to the cabinet secretary, the law secretary and the legislative secretary for a meeting on November 16 on common electoral rolls.“It was not addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner. Since Election Commission of India has the necessary expertise and mandate regarding electoral roll and in the light of the previous letters of the Chief Election Commissioner addressed to the Law Minister, Secretary, Legislative Department thought it appropriate to invite officials of Election Commission to this meeting,” the statement read.                        The letter by the legislative department was addressed to Secretary and the final operative paragraph of the letter also requested Secretary, Election Commission of India to attend the meeting, it said.“After receipt of the letter by the ECI, the Chief Election Commissioner spoke to Secretary, Legislative Department expressing his displeasure over the expression in the middle part of the letter which gave an impression that it was expected of the CEC to attend the meeting. Secretary, Legislative Department clarified that the letter was for Secretary or a representative of the CEC familiar with the subject to attend the meeting,” the statement said.The November 16 meeting was to finalise the cabinet note on some of the reforms and it was held virtually, the ministry said. “The subsequent interaction with the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners was an informal one and meant for ironing out two or three aspects for the final proposal,” the statement said.The opposition has hit out at the government, claiming that by “summoning” CEC to the PMO, the government has undermined the autonomy of the poll panel.The Congress is likely to move a notice Monday for adjournment of proceedings in Lok Sabha over the issue. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/row-over-ecs-meet-centre-says-letter-was-for-secretary-or-an-official-representative-not-cec-351796

Though, some of our workers are definitely part of the government. The government does not give assurances of any sort to our swayam sevaks. People ask us what we get from the government. My answer to them is that we may even have to lose what we own.”Highlighting the ancient Indian practices in medicine, he said, “What saw us through were our traditional Indian remedies such as kadha, kwath (herbal formulations) and hygiene. Now, the world looks up to India and wants to emulate the Indian model. Our country may not become a world power, but it can certainly be the world guru.”          The RSS chief observed a minute’s silence in memory of Chief of Defence Staff Late Bipin Rawat and 13 others who died in the chopper crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu recently.Calling for unity, he said the undivided land of India lost several battles with foreign invaders over the centuries as the local population was not united. Quoting social reformer BR Ambedkar, he said we are never defeated by anyone’s strength but by our own weaknesses.Bhagwat is on a five-day tour to Himachal Pradesh and is likely to meet Tibetan spiritual leader The Dalai Lama, sources said.

18-12-2021||New Delhi||India, Pakistan gear up for meetings on Afghanistan||India and Pakistan are gearing up for their respective meetings of Foreign Ministers on Sunday in which Afghanistan will be prominently discussed but with a different focus.All five Central Asian Foreign Ministers arrived in Delhi by Saturday evening, giving a miss to the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) meet in Islamabad.The OIC meet promises to be a much bigger gathering, restricted not just to its members and observers but also has Special Envoys to Afghanistan from all the five UNSC permanent members—the US, the UK, France, China and Russia—as also from Germany and the EU.The main theme for the OIC meeting is humanitarian assistance. The Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also in Islamabad to sharpen the pitch on the issue as well as seek the freeing of Afghan forex reserves in the US.The New Delhi meeting of the Central Asian Foreign Ministers with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as the host will cover a wider palette. It will also firm up the invitation to the leaders of the five countries as Guests of Honour for next year’s Republic Day parade.On Afghanistan, they are likely to pick up the threads of the November 10 meeting of NSAs hosted by Ajit Doval which was attended by his counterparts from all five Central Asian countries, Iran and Russia. The focus would be more on the overspill of terrorism and drug trafficking from Afghanistan.A US report on terrorism released on Friday corroborated India’s apprehensions of terrorism from Af-Pak area. It noted that many terrorist groups with regional or transnational ambitions continue to operate freely from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, whose diaspora extends into Afghanistan, are unhappy with the rough treatment given to Afghan leaders sharing their ethnicity. Their interest in having a representative government intersects with those of India.They will also discuss connectivity which is of vital interest to them as most of these countries are double-landlocked. Central Asia also has reserves of oil, gas, uranium and other rare metals. All the Foreign Ministers Mukhtar Tileuberdi (Kazakhstan), Sirojiddin Muhriddin (Tajikistan), Ruslan Kazakbaev (Kyrgyzstan), Abdulaziz Kamilov (Uzbekistan) and Rashid Meredov (Turkmenistan) had arrived here.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-pakistan-gear-up-for-meetings-on-afghanistan-351791
18-12-2021||New Delhi||ED arrests NBFC CEO in probe against Chinese-backed loan apps||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday said it has arrested the CEO of a non-banking financial company (NBFC) in connection with a money laundering investigation against fintech firms “backed” by Chinese funds.Pavitra Pradip Walvekar, promoter, director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Kudos Finance and Investment Private Limited, an NBFC, was taken into custody on Friday.He was later produced before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Hyderabad that sent him to 15 days’ judicial custody, the agency said in a statement.The action is linked to the ED’s investigation against a number of Indian NBFCs which are in the business of instant personal loans through mobile apps (applications).“Various fintech companies backed by Chinese funds have made agreements with these NBFC companies for providing instant personal micro loans of term ranging from seven-14 days,” the statement said.“Kudos NBFC purportedly engages fintech (digital lending partners) companies as a service provider to assist in identifying prospective customers, verifying their eligibility, collection of information/documents, conducting due diligence, collecting pre-disbursement documents, arranging execution of the loan agreement, assisting with collections/recovery of principal and interest payments and attending service requests or product related queries for the retail loans offered by the company,” the agency said.Although it is projected that the NBFC is engaging fintech (short for financial technology) companies for these activities, the ED said, “In reality, they are allowing the fintech companies to misuse the valuable NBFC licence of Kudos.”  “Kudos has a paltry net owned fund (NOF), but it is taking huge amount as security deposits and then opening separate merchant ID (MID) with payment gateways for each fintech app and then depositing these security deposit in the MID of the respective fintech app,” the agency alleged.The company, Kudos, it said, has no mobile app of its own.“It is not involved in the lending business at all. It has miniscule staff and is blindly allowing fintech companies to operate at the back of MoUs between self (NBFC) and fintech mobile app companies.“Thus, the entire lending operation is being done by the fintech app from its own funds,” it alleged.The accused NBFC is only lending its licence and the fintech apps are the ones acting like the “real NBFCs” and doing end-to-end micro-lending and “reaping “majority benefits”.“In return, Kudos is taking a commission without doing any due diligence or hardwork,” the ED alleged.

On the other is Hindutvawadi. On one side is truth, love and non-violence and on the other is falsehood, hatred and violence.“Hindutvawadi bathes alone in Ganga, but a Hindu will bathe with crores of others,” Gandhi said at a public gathering, taking a swipe at the prime minister who recently inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi after taking a holy dip.“Narendra Modi Ji says I am a Hindu, but when did he protect the truth.... (Is he) Hindu or Hindutvawadi,” Gandhi said at a public gathering, raising the issue of jobs, China’s incursions and farm laws.The former Congress president and his sister and party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took out a padyatra (foot march) from Jagdishpur to village Harimau where Rahul Gandhi addressed a public meeting.“There is a lot of talk about religion in the country, about Hindu religion. “The fight in India today is between Hindu and Hindutvawadi. On one side are the Hindus who tread the path of truth, and on the other side are Hindutvawadis, who spread hatred and can do anything for snatching power,” Rahul Gandhi said.He was a Member of Parliament from here for 15 years. He is visiting Amethi for the second time after losing the seat, which had been a pocket borough of the Nehru-Gandhi family, by 55,120 votes to BJP’s Smriti Irani in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.There are five assembly seats in Amethi parliamentary constituency, out of which Amethi, Jagdishpur, Salon, Tiloi are held by the BJP. The Gauriganj seat is with the Samajwadi Party.The Congress is trying to regain its turf in Amethi and Uttar Pradesh in the upcoming assembly polls.Rahul Gandhi said they have family ties with Amethi and “this relationship will never break”.“A Hindu spends his entire life finding, understanding and fighting for truth. Hindu faces his fears and never lets it turn into hatred, anger or violence but Hindutvawadi only indulges in politics of lies and has nothing to do with the truth. He only uses lies to snatch power,” Rahul Gandhi said.Invoking Mahatma Gandhi, he said a Hindu fights against injustice while a Hindutvawadi is like Nathu Ram Godse.The leaders were taking part in the ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan-Bhajapa bhagao, mahgai hatao pratigya padyatra’ organised against the policies of the Modi government.Congress workers accorded a warm reception to their leaders. Cutouts and reception gates were set up at various points to welcome them.

18-12-2021||New Delhi||Impress upon ministries to undertake review of grievances raised in media: Parliament panel to DARPG||A Parliamentary panel has asked the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) to impress upon central government ministries to regularly review grievances raised in print and electronic media.In its report titled "strengthening of grievance redressal mechanism of government of India", the panel noted that in their eagerness to comply with established instructions, grievances are increasingly being disposed of by some departments or organisations simply with the suggestion to approach another agency, sometimes a subordinate office."In some cases, the grievance is being re-sent to the agency against which the complaint is made and in some others, the online grievances are being disposed with the advice to take the grievance to the portal of the agency or some complaint committee," it said. The committee noted that DARPG has instructed the ministries/departments to give valid reasons for closure."However, in many cases this is not being done. The Committee impresses upon the ministries/departments to strictly comply with the instructions issued by Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances from time to time in respect of grievance redressal,” the report said.The panel recommended that a dedicated portal on public grievance redress run by the DARPG should play the role of facilitator for the public without impinging on the nature of federalism.The committee has observed that many grievances received on Centralised Public Grievances Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) are related to state governments and in several of these cases, the petitioner was asked to approach the state government and the grievance was disposed rather than forwarded. "There was no redressal," it said, recommending that the CPGRAMS play the role of facilitator for the public without impinging on the nature of federalism.The performance of states on the portal can be left to them but the facilitation responsibility of the Centre cannot be shed when a public grievance is registered, and there is a jurisdictional conflict involved, said the report by the Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances and Justice headed by BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi."The Committee recommends DARPG to impresss upon ministries/ departments to undertake a regular review of grievances, which are raised in print and electronic media and include the analysis in the quarterly report submitted to the DARPG," it said.It should also ensure that the review undertaken by them and the action taken on the suggestions are put on its website, the report said.The committee noted that CPGRAMS has not been uniformly operationalised in all organisations. "Besides, wide variations are apparent across the ministries/ departments and other organisations in respect of the extent of commitment, framework and processes instituted and the capacity to handle grievances. Some organisations have not taken any initiative in this regard," said the report tabled in the Parliament on December 10. Efficiency and effectiveness of the administrative processes and polices are directly dependant on the state of public grievances in any organisation, it said. "Timely ventilation and redressal of grievances are necessary for any citizen friendly administration. Therefore, the Committee recommends that there should be an overall review/evaluation of the procedure of handling grievances of the ministries/ departments/ organisations in the government of India," the report said.The committee recommended the DARPG to strengthen public interface mechanisms for redress like ‘lok adalats' and ‘jan sunvais', wherever feasible, taking it to the doorstep of the people needing redress, it said.It also recommended that feedback and suggestions on the performance of grievance redressal system should be taken from the public in order to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and credibility of grievance redress mechanism and grievance prevention possibilities. "Best suggestions should be rewarded and their implementation and value addition should be highlighted for improving the credibility of the system," the report said.The panel was pleased to note that DARPG is gradually making way for one nation –one grievance redressal portal. However, the committee recommends the department to ensure that certain features are incorporated while integrating CPGRAMS with state portals, namely, identifying right stakeholders for redressal, facility of auto forwarding delayed or specific kind of grievances to right team/person, among others, it said.

18-12-2021||Shahjahanpur/ Lucknow||Modi praises Adityanath's crime elimination legacy, calls him 'UPYogi'; useless, counters SP's Akhilesh Yadav||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday used a new coinage UPYOGI or ‘UP plus Yogi bahut hai upyogi’ to praise Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath for “eliminating” mafias and undertaking a lot of developmental work in the state.Modi said poor law and order triggered exodus of people from Uttar Pradesh earlier, but during the past four and half years bulldozers have razed unauthorised properties of mafias, causing pain to those patronising them.“UP plus Yogi bahut hai upyogi” (Uttar Pradesh plus Yogi have great utility), he said, expanding U.P.Y.O.G.I.The prime minister was addressing a rally after laying the foundation stone of 594-km-long Ganga Expressway in this Uttar Pradesh district.The BJP has already declared that Adityanath will be its face in the upcoming polls in the political heartland of the country.“You are well versed with the situation here and the law-and-order situation in western Uttar Pradesh before the Yogi Adityanath government came. In the earlier days, as the sun set, people flashing ‘katta’ (country-made pistols) used to come on the streets to make the lives of people hell,” Modi said, adding the “culture of katta” has ended now under the Adityanath government.Hailing the state government’s action against mafias, he said “Aaj jab mafia par bulldozer chalta hai...bulldozer to gair kanooni imaraat par chalta hai...par dard usko ‘palne-posne’ wale ko hota hai” (today when bulldozers raze unauthorised properties of mafias, the pain is felt by those patronising them).Intensifying his attack on the opposition ahead of the crucial assembly elections, the prime minister said, “There are some political parties, which have problems with the country’s heritage and development. They have problems with the heritage, as they are more bothered about their vote bank. They have problems with development, as the dependence of the poor and common man on them is reducing day by day.”        “These people have problems with cleaning of river Ganga. These are the people who raise questions on the action of the Army on terrorists. These are the people who bring the made-in-India coronavirus vaccine under the scanner. They have a problem with the grand dhaam of Baba Vishvanath in Kashi, and these people have a problem with the grand temple of Lord Ram in Ayodhya,” Modi said, hitting out at his rivals.Emphasising on the benefits of a double engine government, he said, “If you remember the condition of the state five years ago, barring a few areas of the state, electricity could not be found in other cities and villages. The double engine government not only gave 80 lakh free power connections, but every district is getting more electricity than before.”          He said more than 30 lakh poor people got pucca houses in Uttar Pradesh and this campaign will continue to cover all the remaining entitled beneficiaries.Built at a cost of Rs 36,230 crore, the six-lane Ganga Expressway will give a fillip to multiple sectors including industrial development, trade, agriculture, tourism etc. It will provide a big boost to the socio-economic development of the region.The prime minister also said that the priority of the government is to strengthen those who are lagging behind in the society or are backward, and make the benefits of development reach them.“This feeling is also visible in our agriculture policy and the policy related to the farmers,” he said.Modi said that in terms of giving MSP (laabhkaari mulya) of sugarcane, Uttar Pradesh is one of the leading (‘agrani’) states, and it is also ahead when it comes to making payments (to the farmers).“Today, when all of Uttar Pradesh moves ahead together, the country also moves ahead. Hence, the focus of the double engine government is on the development of UP.“With the mantra of ‘sabka saath’, ‘sabka vikaas’, ‘sabka vishvaas’ and ‘sabka prayaas’, we are making honest efforts for development,” he said.He also invoked freedom fighters Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq-ullah-Khan and Thakur Roshan Singh, hailing from Shahjahanpur, during his speech. PTI NAV SNS ‘Yogi un-upyogi’Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav took a dig at the coinage and at the chief minister, whom he called “unupyogi” (useless) and cited instances of crimes against Dalits and women under his rule.He made the remark in a tweet, punning on the Hindi word “Up-Yogi” (useful) as Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him earlier in the day.n his tweet Akhilesh said, “The daughter of Hathras, the farmers of Lakhimpur, the trader of Gorakhpur, women who are feeling insecure, unemployed youths, the Dalits, and the backward class (people) are saying for UP, the current government is not useful, it is useless”.“UP is today saying that it does not want the BJP,” he added.Akhilesh headed Samajwadi Party government in the state from 2012-17 and was succeeded by Adityanath.The war of words between BJP and SP continued ahead of crucial assembly elections scheduled early next year in the state.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-praises-adityanaths-crime-elimination-legacy-calls-him-upyogi-useless-counters-sps-akhilesh-yadav-351776

18-12-2021||New Delhi||Rohini court blast: DRDO scientist arrested for ‘planting explosives to kill neighbour’||A senior DRDO scientist has been arrested for allegedly planting an improvised explosive device (IED) in a tiffin box with an intention to kill his neighbour in the Rohini district court here earlier this month, police said on Saturday.The IED that triggered a low-intensity explosion in courtroom number 102 on December 9 had left a person injured.The accused, Bharat Bhushan Kataria (47), was arrested on Friday, police said.According to Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana, Kataria, who is a senior scientist at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), entered the court premises at 9.33 am on the day of the incident with two bags and left one of those behind inside courtroom number 102. The accused left the court premises at 10.35 am.Kataria had planted the IED in a tiffin box and left the bag containing the tiffin box inside the courtroom as he wanted to kill his neighbour, who is a lawyer, police said.“Both the parties had lodged several cases against each other. They live in the same building. Prima facie, it seems that Kataria had a grudge against the lawyer,” a senior police officer said.The lawyer lives on the ground floor of the building while the accused lives on the third floor. Five civil cases were filed by Kataria against the lawyer, while the latter had filed seven civil cases against the accused, police said.Teams from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) and the National Security Guard (NSG) had visited the site of the explosion and it was found that the materials used in making the IED were easily available in the market.The IED was not properly assembled due to which only the detonator exploded, police said.The details of around 1,000 cars that had entered the court premises on the day of the incident were checked and the CCTV footage obtained from the court was analysed by the investigating officers, they added.

18-12-2021||Mumbai||Is Modi ‘scared or ashamed’ to utter Indira Gandhi's name, asks Shiv Sena||In a sharp attack, the Shiv Sena on Saturday pointedly asked whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi is "scared or ashamed" of uttering the late PM Indira Gandhi's name during the recent 50 years celebrations of the liberation of Bangladesh.The Sena also took note that President R. N. Kovind visited Dhaka for the victory celebrations but did not even mention the name of Bangladesh's creator, Indira Gandhi there."By ignoring Indira in such a manner you can write neither the history of India nor the world. But who will explain this to such narrow-minded rulers of our country. Its an insult to woman-power," the Sena asked in a stinging edit in the party newspapers, 'Saamana' and 'Dopahar Ka Saamana'.The Sena said its 50 years since the Bangladesh War of 1971 was won by India, and the sacrifices of our brave soldiers was remembered, but Modi "did not show the courtesy" of even making a mention of Indira Gandhi on December 16."If Indira Gandhi had not shown guts, Pakistan would never have been taught a lesson of a lifetime. She divided Pakistan into two pieces and effectively avenged the Partition of India in 1947," the edit said.Even the then leader of the Jan Sangh, and later the PM, Atal Behari Vajpayee, hailed Indira Gandhi as a 'Durga' and the entire world saluted the bravery of Hindustan."After Bangladesh, she emerged as a powerful world leader, with a clear warning that if you look at India with crooked eyes, we shall break you into pieces. When she achieved the feat, the current ruler in New Delhi may have been kids in bed," the Sena said lavishing praises on Indira Gandhi's prowess.Taking another swipe at Modi, the Sena said a ruler can build temples or buildings and clean up a river, "but cannot dismember Pakistan to create a Bangladesh" which only Indira Gandhi had the courage to do."Instead of indulging in 'surgical strikes', Indira Gandhi ordered a direct attack by the Indian Army to teach Pakistan a lesson. Even the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy were used, Karachi Port was destroyed," the Sena added.Finally, 90,000 Pakistani soldiers surrendered before India on December 16, 1971, and it was only Indira Gandhi who was the 'power' behind that victory, and nobody could ever attempt a pathetic defeat of Pakistan since then, hence forgetting her is akin to ignoring Mother India, the Sena said.On the other hand, the Kargil War (1999) took place on Indian soil and to drive out the Pakistani infiltrators, 1,500 of our soldiers were sacrificed in their motherland, "yet we celebrate it as 'Vijay Divasa'," the Sena pointed out."Today, the Chinese Army has entered Ladakh and we are unable to push them back, while in 1971, the entire world was stunned by the valour displayed by a Hindu woman who made even the US retreat when it came to help Pakistan.""The 1971 War bestowed the 'real identity of India' to the world. It was pettiness on the part of the current leaders not to acknowledge the courage of Indira Gandhi. You may have ideological differences with the Congress, but showing hatred towards leaders who built the country is not the sign of a 'true Hindustani'," the Sena said."The edits showed how the BJP sought votes in elections by beating the drums of surgical strike, but now China has entered, Nepal, Afghanistan are also our adversaries and the country is surrounded by guns on all four borders.At such a time, it's the memory of Indira Gandhi's historic victory in the 1971 Bangladesh War that will always serve to inspire," the Sena said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/is-modi-scared-or-ashamed-to-utter-indira-gandhis-name-asks-shiv-sena-351762

18-12-2021||Panaji||Goa Assembly elections: Congress announces pre-poll alliance with Goa Forward Party||The Congress and the Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Saturday announced a pre-poll alliance for the upcoming state Assembly elections due in February next year.Notably, the GFP had earlier shared power with the BJP in Goa, but withdrew its support in July 2019 after its all three MLAs, including party president Vijai Sardesai, who was then Deputy Chief Minister in the Pramod Sawant-led government, were dropped from the Cabinet.Addressing a press conference here, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Goa Dinesh Gundu Rao said the Congress and the GFP have entered into an alliance for the forthcoming elections in the coastal state."After (GFP chief) Vijai Sardesai met our leader Rahul Gandhi in Delhi and expressed his support to the Congress saying that he wants to work with us to defeat the communal and corrupt BJP government in Goa and to bring about a change in Goa, we welcomed his move," Rao said.More interaction took place in Goa between the two parties, he said, adding, "We ironed out whatever small issues were there between us and we are looking for a new beginning." "Whatever happened in the past, has happened. In politics, there is always a scope for friendship, alliances, and we have mutual trust and confidence in each other," the Congress leader said. During the talks held so far, the issue of how to go about carrying out the poll campaign was also discussed, he added. "We will be going to the elections together and I expect that this alliance will drive more people towards joining the Congress. I am sure that in this election, the people have decided to reject the BJP as they want a stable government in the state," he added. Rao said that the details of seat sharing between the two parties would be announced later. Talking on the occasion, Sardesai said this alliance will liberate the state from the "autocratic" government. "The current government in Goa is in the politics of acquisitions and takeovers that is poisoning democracy and there is a need to start a new movement to re-liberate Goa from the corrupt, communal BJP," he said. There is a need for the like-minded people to come together, he said, adding, "What began at the residence of Rahul Gandhi has culminated here on an auspicious day." Sardesai said that the people of Goa are against the BJP, but elected representatives are joining that because of the "high-handedness of the Central leadership of the party. "We are sure that political strategists who are of the view that any alternative to BJP cannot be done without a Congress as principal opposition party, he said adding that this is also the view of poll strategist Prashant Kishor. After the Assembly polls in 2017, the GFP, which had won three seats, had extended support for the formation of the then BJP-led state government under the leadership of Manohar Parrikar.

18-12-2021||New Delhi||US, Russia, others conveyed that equipment for Indian forces has to be produced in India: Rajnath Singh||India has very clearly conveyed to the US, Russia, France and many of its partner countries that military platforms and equipment required by the Indian armed forces to deal with myriad security challenges have to be manufactured in the country, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday.Referring to regional geopolitical developments, Singh said that God has given India some neighbours who do not feel good seeing its growth and that the one born out of the Partition is becoming weak worrying about India's development.In an address at the annual convention of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), he said most of the countries in the world are friends of India, including the US, Russia and France.In this context, he said, India, at the same time, made it clear to them that the military hardware required by the Indian armed forces would have to be produced in the country.“We have told every friendly country that we want to produce the military platforms, weapons and ammunition in India itself keeping in mind the security of the country,” he said."We have conveyed this message to the US, Russia, France and others as well and we do not hesitate to communicate this message," he added.The defence minister said the message to the countries producing military equipment has been that: "Come Make In India, Come Make for India and Come Make for the world."Citing an example, Singh said following his talks with French Defence Minister Florence Parly on Friday, it was agreed that a major French company would produce "an engine" in India by joining hands with an Indian company under the strategic partnership model. He, however, did not elaborate.Singh said India would maintain friendship with these countries but at the same time would not hesitate to push for the production of key platforms on Indian soil."We will maintain the friendship but at the same time make it clear that whatever military equipment, weapons and ammunition are needed have to be produced in India," the defence minister said."I tell it very clearly and with confidence. And you will be happy to know that I get a positive response from them," Singh said.The defence minister also referred to the government’s decision not to import 209 military equipment under a staggered timeline to promote the domestic defence industry and indicated that the items under the list might touch 1,000.

If the pages of history are turned back, then one is reminded of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, when the British fired (at people) from the front.“But the BJP ran over the jeep on them from behind. No action has been initiated against the accused. The Union Minister of State for Home (Ajay Mishra) has not been removed so far. For those who are accused, bulldozers have not been run over their house. This government is working in a discriminatory manner,” the SP chief said.Violence had erupted in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 when farmers were protesting the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to Mishra’s native place. Four agitating farmers were allegedly run over by a vehicle while four others, including a journalist and two BJP workers, were also killed in the violence that ensued.Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, has been named as accused.The SP chief also said as the elections approach, the BJP puts up a lens of religion, and sees everything from that perspective.Yadav reiterated that in the BJP regime, people have faced ‘dikkat’ (problems), ‘killat’ (shortage) and ‘zillat’ (humiliation), which they have not faced in any other government.He also said people are feeling insulted today, and the BJP, which is in power, is insulting the people.

18-12-2021||New Delhi||Urgent need to scale up public health, social measures to curtail spread of omicron, says WHO||With seven countries in the South-East Asia Region confirming cases of new Covid variant omicron, the World Health Organisation on Saturday stressed on urgent scale up of public health and social measures to curtail its further spread.Countries can and must prevent the spread of omicron with proven health and social measures, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, Poonam Khetrapal Singh, said."Our focus must continue to protect the least protected and those at high risk,” she said in a statement.The overall threat posed by omicron largely depends on three key questions – its transmissibility; how well the vaccines and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection protect against it, and how virulent the variant is as compared to other variants."From what we know so far, omicron appears to spread faster than the delta variant which has been attributed to the surge in cases across the world in the last several months," Singh said.Emerging data from South Africa suggest increased risk of re-infection with omicron, she said, adding that there is still limited data on the clinical severity associated with omicron.Further information is needed to fully understand the clinical picture of those infected with omicron, she said.“We expect more information in the coming weeks. Omicron should not be dismissed as mild,” Singh said, adding that even if it does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm health systems.Hence, health care capacity including ICU beds, oxygen availability, adequate health care staff and surge capacity need to be reviewed and strengthened at all levels, she stressed.“We must continue to do it all. Protect yourself and protect each other. Get vaccinated, wear a mask, keep a distance, open windows, clean your hands and cough and sneeze safely. Continue to take all precautions even after taking vaccine doses,” Singh said.On the impact of the new variant on vaccines, she said preliminary data suggest that vaccines may likely have reduced effectiveness against infections by the omicron variant.However, studies are under way to better understand the extent to which omicron may evade vaccine and/or infection derived immunity and the extent to which current vaccines continue to protect against severe disease and death associated with omicron, she said.Globally, the pandemic is driven by the delta variant, against which vaccines continue to provide a robust level of protection from severe disease, hospitalisation, and death. Hence, efforts to scale up vaccination coverage must continue, the WHO official said.“Vaccines are an important tool in our fight against the pandemic, but, as we know, vaccines alone will not get any country out of this pandemic. We must scale up vaccination and at the same time implement public health and social measures, which have proven critical to limiting transmission of Covid and reducing deaths,” Singh said.

The mandate given to him (Air Marshal Manavendra Singh) is to investigate every single angle and look into every single aspect of what could have gone wrong and come out with the suitable recommendations and findings,” he said.He was replying to a query on the details related to the investigation and the situation and circumstances of the chopper crash that killed General Bipin Rawat, India's first Chief of Defence Staff, his wife and 12 other armed forces personnel, at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu on December 8.“I would recommend that I do not make any announcement in haste about what could have been the cause or what are the remedial actions that we are going to institute. So, we will just have to wait for a few more weeks till he completes the court of inquiry. Let me assure you that it is a very, very fair process, the entire court of inquiry,” he said.Subsequent to the tragedy, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had informed Parliament that a tri-services inquiry team led by Air Marshal Manavendra Singh started investigation into the helicopter crash.Earlier in his address during the passing-out parade, the Air Force chief said the nature of warfare is undergoing fundamental changes and India's security dynamics involved multifaceted threats and challenges which would require building multi-domain capabilities.He also said the Air Force is on the cusp of transformation into a highly potent air force with many new injections such as Rafale jets, Apache helicopters and a wide variety of sophisticated systems.“The nature of warfare is undergoing fundamental changes. New technology and radically new doctrines have emerged in the last few years. India's security dynamics involve multifaceted threats and challenges. It will require us to build multi-domain capabilities and execute all our operations simultaneously and in shortened timeframes,” Chaudhari said.Expressing grief over the untimely demise of General Rawat, his wife and other armed forces officials, he said the parade chose to cut down many events as a mark of respect.

We will assess the promises and intent of each party,” he said.“Farming has been reduced to an unprofitable occupation. Attempts are being made to corporatise the sector and give away vast tracts of land to industry. We will not let this happen. We believe in fair dealings. But Delhi is unfair and non-transparent,” Tikait declared as farmers spoke of rising power bills, pending cane dues and stray animal menace.He said the “ongoing discrimination against the local panchayat in the district council” would not be condoned. “The administration must put its house in order.

Make a list of such vendors and train them in digital transactions. This will facilitate bank finance for them on much better terms.”As many as 120 mayors are participating in the conference. The PM exhorted them to build their political career using the opportunity they had got the serve the people.He said the political journey of Sardar Patel, who rose to become the Deputy PM, had also started with the post of Mayor of Ahmedabad. “The post can be a stepping stone for a successful political career,” he said.

You told us there is no need to order...,” the Bench asked senior advocate AM Singhvi, representing the West Bengal Government.“I had conveyed the need for restraint but the commission is not controlled by me.... They didn’t work till your orders were out...,” Singhvi responded.“We understand your predicament,” the Bench told Singhvi while staying all further proceedings of the Justice Lokur Commission.As advocate ML Sharma, one of the petitioners in the case, said it amounted to “gross contempt of court”, the CJI said, “We will see.”Noting that citizens need to be protected from violation of privacy, the SC had on October 27 set up an expert committee led by former top court judge RV Raveendran to look into allegations of snooping on journalists, activists and politicians using Pegasus.

The resolution calls governments to meet their responsibility to keep citizens secure while travelling by air. The report said in 2020, there were multiple reports in the media and from the NIA of suspected cases of online terrorist radicalisation, particularly in southern Indian states.In addition, India continued to face terror threat from Pakistan, which failed to take action against known terrorists such as JeM’s Masood Azhar and the 2008 Mumbai attack “project manager” Sajid Mir, both believed to be in Pakistan, it said.Some madrasas in Pakistan continued to teach violent extremist doctrine, it said. The major groups targeting India were LeT, JeM, Hizbul Mujahideen, ISIS, al-Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, it said.The report conceded, “Pakistan took steps in 2020 to counter terror financing and restrain India-focused militant groups from conducting attacks. Pakistan convicted LeT founder Hafiz Saeed and other senior LeT leaders in terror funding cases.”The US report was unstinting in its praise for the National Investigation Agency. “The NIA examined 34 cases related to ISIS and arrested 160 persons, including 10 alleged al-Qaeda operatives from Kerala and West Bengal, in September,” it noted. However, no foreign terrorist fighter (FTF) was repatriated to India during 2020.The report faulted the Union Home Ministry for not having a national policy for countering violent extremism (CVE) as a result of which efforts in this direction were “uneven” and led by local police departments.

Rightly was she called ‘Durga’ by the great Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Having said all this, I must admit that I did feel she let Zulfikar Ali Bhutto off the leash rather generously,” Singh, the former Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, said in a statement.Singh, the only surviving member of the Indira Gandhi Cabinet at the time of the war, said there could be no doubt whatsoever that without the late PM”s leadership the country would not have achieved this victory.“Our armed forces under such outstanding soldiers as Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, Gen JS Aurora, Gen JFR Jacob, Gen Sagat Singh and many others created history by their brilliantly planned and coordinated campaign. Then Chief of Naval Staff Admiral SM Nanda and Chief of Air Staff Gen PC Lal also deserve full credit for the significant role played by the Air Force and the Navy,” said Singh.He said it was often forgotten that during that year Indira Gandhi did make genuine efforts to encourage a political solution in the conflict between East and West Pakistan. “In a brilliant master stroke, she signed The Treaty of Friendship with the USSR, which played an important role in preventing China or the United States from intervening during the Liberation War,” he said.Singh also recalled the day India emerged victorious in the war, saying, “I have vivid memories of that day in the Lok Sabha, Indira Gandhi, who seldom showed any emotion, was clearly overjoyed and almost ran into the House and took her seat. My seat happened to be immediately behind hers. As soon as she entered, the House immediately felt silent. She got up and said Mr Speaker, Dhaka has fallen to the Indian Army and the Mukti Bahini. The House exploded in joy and had to be adjourned.”Let him off the hook generouslyShe let Zulfikar Ali Bhutto off the leash rather generously. Although the (1971) war was not directly linked with Jammu and Kashmir, she could perhaps have used the opportunity to pressure Bhutto. — Karan Singh, Congress veteran||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/indira-couldve-pressured-bhutto-on-jk-karan-singh-351582

They must also avoid mass gatherings, and New Year celebrations need to be at low intensity, the government said.Giving details of Omicron cases in India, it said Maharashtra has reported 32 cases of the variant, Delhi (22), Rajasthan (17), Karnataka (8), Telangana (8), Gujarat (5), Kerala (5), Andhra Pradesh (1), Chandigarh (1), Tamil Nadu (1) and West Bengal (1), the government said.Citing the World Health Organization (WHO), it also said that the Omicron variant is spreading faster than the Delta variant of the coronavirus in South Africa, where Delta circulation was low.It is likely that Omicron spread will outpace Delta variant where community transmission occurs, the government said citing the WHO.On the COVID-19 situation in the country, it said 19 districts are reporting weekly positivity between 5 and 10 per cent and five districts over 10 per cent.Districts with over 5 per cent Covid case positivity rate need to ensure restrictive measures until it is below 5 per cent for at least two weeks, the government said.It assured that sufficient systematic and strategic sampling is being undertaken for genome sequencing for detection of Omicron cases in India.On COVID-19 vaccination, the government said that India has so far administered 82.8 crore first doses and 53.72 crore second doses.More than 136 crore doses have been administered in the country which is 2.8 times the total doses administered in the US, it said.

India's longstanding defence relationship with Russia extends to counterterrorism issues, the US State Department report added.The US report, meanwhile, pointed towards the “gaps” in the interagency intelligence and information sharing.It said that the “Indian security agencies are effective in disrupting terror threats, although gaps remain in interagency intelligence and information sharing”.“The Indian Multi-Agency Centre (MAC) collaborates with the US on exchanging terrorist screening information. In the absence of a National Counter Terrorism Center, the MAC conducts real-time collation and sharing of intelligence among federal and state security agencies.“Several Indian states have established state-level MACs to disseminate terrorism information to law enforcement,” the report said.It also said that Indian security forces demonstrate limited capacity to patrol and secure extensive maritime and land borders.“India is implementing UNSCR 2396 to improve detection and deterrence of terrorist travel by using watchlists, implementing biographic and biometric screening at ports of entry, and expanding information sharing,” it said.The United Nations Security Council Resolution 2396 (2017) requires Member States to develop and implement systems to collect biometric data in order to identify terrorists responsibly and properly. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isis-has-66-known-indian-origin-fighters-us-report-on-terrorism-351446
18-12-2021||New Delhi||PMO holds 'informal interaction' with Election Commissioners; Congress says govt treating EC as a 'subservient tool'||Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra and fellow Commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anoop Chandra Pandey recently held an “informal interaction” with the Prime Minister’s Office to bridge gaps in understanding of key electoral reforms between the poll panel and the Law Ministry, with EC sources insisting on Friday that no impropriety was involved in doing so.The Commission had been pushing for reforms in electoral laws and related issues, and the virtual interaction in November was held to “bridge the gaps in understanding the points of views of the Law Ministry and the Election Commission (EC)”, they said.Reacting to the development, the Congress on Friday hit out at the government, alleging that it was treating the EC as its “subservient tool”.Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala charged that the government has fallen to a new low in destroying institutions in the country.“Cat is out of the bag! What was whispered till now is a fact. PMO summoning ECI was unheard of in independent India. Treating EC as a subservient tool is yet another low in Modi government’s record of destroying every institution,” Surjewala said.The EC sources said amid a series of correspondence between the government and the poll panel on electoral reforms, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) took the lead in organising the “informal interaction” with the three commissioners.Responding to a news report published on Friday that the Law Ministry had sent a letter to the EC saying that the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister will chair a meeting on common electoral roll and “expects the CEC” to be present, the sources said the three commissioners did not attend that formal meeting.Responding to the news report, former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) S Y Quraishi said it was “absolutely shocking”. When asked to explain his remarks, he said his words have summed up everything.The sources said senior EC officials attended the formal meeting, besides officials from the Law Ministry.The Legislative Department in the Law Ministry is the nodal agency for EC-related matters.The sources said the result of the informal interaction with the PMO resulted in the Union Cabinet on Wednesday clearing various electoral reforms that the EC had been insisting be brought in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament.One of the reforms is linking Aadhaar with electoral rolls on a voluntary basis. The other will allow eligible young people to register as voters on four dates every year. As of now, there is one qualifying date—January 1 of every year—to register as a voter for those who have turned 18 or above on January 1.The sources pointed out that crucial electoral reforms have been pending for the last 25 years.The EC had been writing to the government for pushing reforms and the Law Ministry had been seeking clarifications.The informal interaction, the sources said, helped bridge the gaps in understanding on key issues. “Reforms have to be done like that,” a senior EC functionary said.There is no impropriety in pushing for reforms, the sources asserted.They reminded that CECs have written letters to law ministers, including Ravi Shankar Prasad and incumbent Kiren Rijiju, seeking their help in implementing electoral reforms.Usually, law ministers and legislative secretaries have been meeting the commissioners on various issues at the Nirvachan Sadan. The commissioners never call on the ministers as part of protocol since the EC is an independent Constitutional body.Congress leader Manish Tewari on Friday submitted a notice to move an adjournment motion in Lok Sabha on the “summoning” of the EC for a meeting in the PMO to discuss electoral reforms.In the notice, he raised questions on the autonomy of the poll panel, but Lok Sabha was adjourned amid uproar over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. The former information and broadcasting minister said he will submit the notice to move the adjournment motion again on Monday.“Why was the Election Commission summoned summarily and whether it is a fact that the commission took umbrage to the manner in which they were virtually compelled to attend the meeting in the Prime Minister’s Office,” Tewari said.
