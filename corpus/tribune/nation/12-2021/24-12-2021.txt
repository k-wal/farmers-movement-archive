24-12-2021||Kolkata||Former GJM leader Binay Tamang joins TMC||Months ahead of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) election, former GJM leader Binay Tamang, who had quit the Hills-based party earlier this year, joined the ruling TMC on Friday.Rohit Sharma, an ex-legislator of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), also followed suit.Both of them were handed over TMC flags by state ministers Moloy Ghatak and Bratya Basu.Asked about his stance on the Gorkhaland issue, Tamang said development of Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills tops the list of his priorities.“Development of hills is my top priority. The BJP is trying to use the statehood issue to fool the people of the Darjeeling and Kalimpong. Since 2009, the party has been saying that it supports the Gorkhaland demand, but no step was so far taken in this regard.“They (BJP leaders) have also tried to divide Bengal, but this will not be allowed. We are united. We are joining the TMC to work for the development of the hills,” he said.Describing Mamata Banerjee as a “dynamic and visionary leader”, Tamang said he would like to see her as a “prime ministerial candidate in 2024”.Tamang further said that “if GJM founder Bimal Gurung, former party leader Anit Thapa and others want to join the All India Trinamool Congress, they are most welcome”.Gurung had earlier this year pledged his support to the TMC.Welcoming the two into the party, Ghatak said the move made by Tamang and Sharma would significantly impact the politics of the hills.Reacting to the development, the BJP said it was on expected lines as Tamang had been working with the state’s ruling party for the last few years.The picturesque Darjeeling has repeatedly witnessed violent agitation over the demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland, the latest being in 2017, when a 104-day-long strike over the issue brought the region to a standstill.The strike also led to a split in the GJM, with Binay Tamang, once a deputy to the outfit’s supremo Gurung, taking over the party’s reins and expelling the boss.Although the GJM faction led by Gurung continued to align with the BJP, the other camp, headed by Tamang, joined hands with the ruling TMC in the state.Gurung, who had been in hiding for three years, however, resurfaced in Kolkata in October last year to lend its support to the TMC after quitting the NDA.Polls to the 45-member GTA are likely to be held early next year.The last election to the semi-autonomous council was held in 2012.Tamang’s joining the TMC comes at a time when a section of BJP leaders have renewed the demand for Gorkhaland and also sought to carve out north Bengal as a centrally-administered Union territory, citing disparity in development and injustice to the people of the region. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-gjm-leader-binay-tamang-joins-tmc-354064
24-12-2021||---||Opposition lying over reasons for Rajya Sabha stalemate: Govt||New Delhi, December 24The government on Friday attacked the Opposition, especially ‘senior members’ of the Congress over their version of the stalemate in the Rajya Sabha following the suspension of 12 members of the Opposition.“It it is both astonishing and saddening that members of the Opposition, especially senior members of the Congress Party, have deviated from the well-known truth about what transpired in the recently concluded session, in the Rajya Sabha,” said Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhlad Joshi in a statement.The Opposition appeared committed to hampering the running of the House, he noted while pointing out that the Opposition has “made a kind of practice” to bring to the sittings of the House.In fact the Opposition appears to use every means to not let the House proceedings carry on. It was painful, when some members of the opposition reduced the temple of democracy to a theatre of street fight, he said in a statement carried on the government’s official website.The Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, “deeply pained”, reached out to the Opposition to break the stalemate.But the Opposition came back in multiple voices which were unclear and contradictory at the same time.“Duplicitousness was obvious beneath some weak conciliatory overtures. When the Chairman reached out in a concrete manner, the response proved that the intention beneath the conciliatory talk was that the House not run,” he alleged.In this respect, he accused senior Congress leaders such as Jairam Ramesh of trying to “somehow create the opposite narrative”, by casting aspersions on the functioning of a Constitutional authority.“We would urge the members of the Opposition to accept their role of opposition with grace, participate in the smooth functioning of our democracy and not make factually and morally incorrect statements,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-lying-over-reasons-for-rajya-sabha-stalemate-govt-354063

We will remember this injustice. Allah will destroy you through his strength. Things will change. Who will come to save you then? When Yogi will return to his mutt and Modi will retreat to the mountains, then who will come?” he said.Owaisi said the edited one-minute clip of his 45-minute speech was being circulated to divert the attention from the alleged hate speeches made at a Dharma Sansad in Haridwar which he alleged as “genocidal meet”.“I did not incite violence or give threats. I talked about police atrocities.... I said we will remember these police atrocities. Is this objectionable? Why is it offensive to remember how police have treated Muslims in UP? I asked cops: who will come to save them when Modi-Yogi retire? Indeed, who will? Do they think they’ve lifetime immunity?” Owaisi tweeted while clarifying his position.Taking on Owaisi over his remarks, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi compared him to Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and said AIMIM leaders are used to making such mischievous remarks.“...soul of Jinnah resides in Owaisi,” Trivedi said, adding that the Hyderabad MP’s remarks are similar to that of Jinnah made in 1946, a year before partition, while talking about direct action.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted, “Owaisi, like (Mughal emperor) Aurangzeb and Jinnah, is the face of civilisational battle that Sanatan Dharma has faced for millennia. Balance of power is the need of the hour.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aimim-president-owaisis-remarks-trigger-controversy-bjp-compares-him-to-jinnah-354042

Nineteen of these patients have already been discharged.A senior doctor at the hospital said around 90 per cent of the patients are “asymptotic” and the rest showed mild symptoms like “sore throat, low-grade fever and bodyache”.“The treatment included only multi-vitamins and paracetamol tablets. We didn’t feel the need to give them any other medicine,” he said.The doctor said most of the patients are those who tested COVID-19 positive at the airport upon arrival from foreign countries.Barring one, all are fully vaccinated and around two-thirds of them have taken the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Three have even taken booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine, he added.The patients included an MP of an African country, a member of a royal family from a north Indian state, and family members of bureaucrats, a source said.According to data from the Union Health Ministry, Delhi has logged 67 Omicron cases so far, of which 23 have been discharged.Besides the LNJP Hospital, Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital, Max Hospital Saket, Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj and Batra Hospital in Tughlakabad have also set up facilities for isolating and treating suspected cases of Omicron following orders from the Delhi government.Genome sequencing of samples of all COVID-19-infected people in Delhi is being conducted since December 22 to ascertain if the new Omicron variant has spread in the community.The Delhi government-run labs at the Lok Nayak Hospital and the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences can sequence 100 samples each day. Two Centre-run labs in Delhi can sequence 200-300 samples a day, according to city Health Minister Satyendar Jain.Anticipating a surge in Covid cases due to the fast-spreading Omicron variant, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said his government has made preparations to handle one lakh patients and conduct three lakh tests daily, and to ensure availability of enough manpower, medicines and oxygen.He stressed that the latest variant of the coronavirus spreads rapidly and claimed that it causes “very mild” infection, fewer hospitalisations and deaths.Therefore, the government has been focusing on strengthening its home-isolation module, and directions have been issued to hire agencies for treating patients at their homes, he said.

The cyber wing of the state police has been asked to intensify its surveillance in all districts to check such propaganda,” he said.Not just those directly involved in the murders, but also its perpetrators, those who provided them weapons, phones and logistics support would be nabbed at the earliest, he said, adding that action would be taken to find the source of money of criminal gangs.The DGP also directed to prepare a list of criminals and history-sheeters belonging to both groups on a district-level basis, arrest absconding criminals and also ensure that those released on bail are not violating the bail conditions.     Police on Thursday said that as many as 30 cases had been registered across the state in the last five days against some people for spreading provocative messages through social media platforms in a manner that incites communal hatred.One person was arrested in a case registered by the West Police in Kollam district in this regard, an official statement said.   Shan, the state secretary of SDPI, was killed by a gang on Saturday night while he was on his way home in Alappuzha, while the BJP OBC Morcha state secretary Sreenivas was hacked to death in front of his family by some assailants in his house on Sunday morning in the same district.Meanwhile, ADGP (Law and Order) Vijay Sakhare, who is heading the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the two separate cases, said as all those directly involved in the crime had managed to escape outside the state, Kerala police has sought assistance from their counterparts in the neighbouring states  to nab them.Not only those took part in the larger conspiracy of the murders but also those who provided the killers any kind of help would be booked for conspiracy, he said.“We cannot divulge the details like in which states they are hiding. Wherever they go, we will chase and catch them. Cyber investigation has also intensified in this regard,” Sakhare told reporters in Alappuzha.Amidst criticism from Opposition parties about the alleged breakdown of law and order situation, State Minister for Fisheries and Cinema, Saji Cheriyan visited the houses of Sreenivas and Shan on Friday.“Real culprits and the perpetrators, involved in the murders, will be booked by the police. That’s the government’s stand also. All those directly involved in the crime have been identified. Several persons have been arrested and remanded. There is no need for any concern in this regard,” he told reporters after visiting Sreenivas’s house.Strongly condemning the murders, he said it was an example of sheer “communal madness”.The back-to-back murders were the proof for the existence of trained extreme mindsets who deliberately try to create communal hatred in the society.“These communal and extremist forces should be rooted out completely from the state,” the minister added.

Sources though say that the election schedule may be announced around ‘Makar Sakranti’.Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra said the Election Commission will take a call on postponing the UP Assembly elections and banning all political rallies only after a review of the current situation. “I will be visiting UP next week. An appropriate decision as required by the situation will be taken after we review it,” the CEC was quoted as saying on the High Court’s observationMeanwhile, a day after Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh also announced night curfew from 11 pm to 5 am, starting tomorrow. The UP Government said only 200 persons will be allowed to attend marriages and social functions at which all necessary Covid-safety protocols must be followed. Officials have also been asked to ensure that all those arriving in UP from abroad and other states are tested for Covid, especially at railway and bus stations.A bench of Justice Shekhar Yadav yesterday urged the government and the poll panel to consider postponing the UP Assembly elections for a month or two and banning all political rallies amid the fears of an impending third wave of Covid.Interestingly, soon thereafter BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy hinted at postponement of polls, which are otherwise scheduled around February next year. He also predicted the President’s Rule in the state.“Don’t be surprised by a Lockdown for Omicron and postponement of UP elections to September under President Rule in UP. What could not directly be done earlier this year can be then done indirectly early next year,” the senior BJP leader tweetedThe prediction came on the heels of a massive political showdown over reports of relatives of BJP leaders and government officials allegedly “usurping” land near the upcoming Ram Temple in Ayodhya. While the BJP has rubbished the allegations, rivals SP, Congress and AAP are mounting pressure, demanding an SC-monitored probe. Observers say such allegations are bound to “dent the image of the saffron party”.

Hindus-Muslims-Sikhs-Christians pay its price. But not anymore!” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi with hashtags  ‘India Against Hindutva’ and ‘Haridwar Hate Assembly’.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also demanded the strictest action against those spreading hatred and violence.“Strictest action should be taken against those who incite hatred and violence of this kind.

24-12-2021||Chennai||Tamil Nadu doctors reportedly taking Covid-19 vax booster doses in secret||Several doctors in Tamil Nadu are reportedly taking booster doses of coronavirus vaccine---yet unauthorised by the government---in secret, sources said.Sources in the Health Department told IANS that many doctors are taking booster doses from private hospitals, while some of them are taking the boosters from government hospitals themselves using the vials that remain unused.Talking to IANS, a senior doctor at a private Chennai hospital said: "Global studies in latest medical journals reveal that the antibody levels even after the second dose of vaccines are much less and hence, booster doses are necessary." Some doctors also said that it was the doctor community who had taken the first dose of the vaccine and the duration of Covishield vaccines was "low".However, state's Director of Public Health, Dr. T.S. Selvavinayagam, told IANS that the Central Government has approved only two doses of vaccine and "taking more doses will be a violation of the Government of India norms".On the other hand, doctors say that they have co-morbidities and have for long been waiting for government approval. "We have waited for long for the government approval to booster doses. This will lead to us curtailing our work as we have several co-morbidities and require a booster dose," a senior doctor, who is the former Head of the Department of Medicine at a leading state government medical college, told IANS. Many doctors are taking Covishield as a booster dose if they had taken Covaxin earlier and vice versa. Doctors said that mixing two different vaccines has increased the antibody levels of the person and immunology studies conducted by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) have also shown that mixed vaccines have a better effect.--- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tamil-nadu-doctors-reportedly-taking-covid-19-vax-booster-doses-in-secret-354024
24-12-2021||New Delhi||Third Covid wave in India may peak in early Feb: IIT-Kanpur study||The third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India may peak by February 3, 2022, claims a modelling study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.However, the forecast is based on the assumption that India will follow the trends of rise in cases seen in many countries globally driven by the Omicron variant of coronavirus.The yet-to-be peer-reviewed study, posted on the preprint repository MedRxiv on December 21, used a statistical tool named the Gaussian Mixture model to forecast the third wave.In their study, the researchers used data from countries such as the US, UK, Germany, and Russia that are already facing the third Covid-19 wave.They modelled the daily data of cases in these countries to predict the impact and timeline for the third wave in India.The study also used the data from the first and second waves in India, considering the number of cases with respect to time.The model forecasts India's third wave of Covid-19 to peak in the beginning of February 2022."The cases start rising around 15 December 2021 and the peak of the third wave will occur on Thursday, 3 February 2022,” they wrote in the research paper.The authors of the study noted that the conclusions are based on the assumptions that “a third wave of Covid-19 may hit the country, and will follow the trends happening around the world.However, the researchers noted that the exact peak number of cases cannot be estimated accurately with the study as it did not consider the vaccination data of the population.The research team comprised of Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai, Subhra Sankar Dhar, and Shalabh, all from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at IIT Kanpur.The authors noted that the vaccination campaign by the union government is a good initiative but it will take some time to reach "100 per cent efficacy"."In many countries like the US, UK, Germany, Russia, the majority of the people have been vaccinated but still they are currently facing the third wave," the authors explained."So, India and other countries have to build up the defences and be prepared for another wave so that it is not as devastating as the earlier ones," they added.According to the National Covid-19 Supermodel Committee, the third wave of Covid-19 is expected to peak in early next year but would be milder than the second wave.The members of the committee said last week that daily caseload in India is expected to increase once Omicron starts displacing Delta as the dominant variant.India on Friday recorded 122 cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in a span of 24 hours, the highest so far, pushing its tally in the country to 358.Overall, the country reported 6,650 fresh Covid-19 cases, increasing the country's caseload to 3,47,72,626, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/third-covid-wave-in-india-may-peak-in-early-feb-iit-kanpur-study-354023

24-12-2021||New Delhi||World is witnessing 4th Covid surge, we cannot lower our guard: Govt cautions people as India's Omicron tally reaches 358||Noting the world is witnessing a fourth surge in Covid cases, the government on Friday cautioned people against lowering the guard, particularly during year-end festivities, even as it underlined that infection due to Omicron does not necessarily lead to severe symptomatic disease.Addressing a joint press conference, ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava said Delta continues to be the predominant strain in India, including in the recently identified clusters.“Therefore, we need to continue with the same strategy of following Covid-appropriate behaviour and ramping up vaccination,” he said.Asserting the Omicron variant of coronavirus does not necessarily lead to severe symptomatic clinical disease, Bhargava said in India, about a third of all the detected cases were mildly symptomatic, and the rest were asymptomatic.“I want to emphasise that the treatment for Omicron-infected symptomatic individuals remains the same. It does not change from that for Delta, Alpha or the Beta variant,” the ICMR DG said.At the press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had a word of caution. “The world is witnessing the fourth surge of COVID-19 cases and the overall positivity is 6.1 per cent. Therefore, we have to be on guard and we can’t afford to slacken,” he said.Explaining the Covid trend, including that of all its variants in different continents, Bhushan said that while Europe, North America and Africa were seeing an increase in infection week-on-week since November 26, Asia is still witnessing a decline in cases.In India, the number of daily cases has been below 10,000 for the last four weeks. “While these numbers are low, we must be vigilant and keep up the guard,” the Union health secretary said.He said India has seen two surges in cases—one in September 2020 and another one in May this year. Even as the country’s overall cases and deaths are on the decline currently, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka and Mizoram are still reporting a very high number of infections, Bhushan said.The very high case positivity in Kerala (6.1 per cent) and Mizoram (8.2 per cent) is a cause of concern, he observed.In 20 districts, including nine in Kerala and eight in Mizoram, the weekly case positivity rate is between five and 10 per cent, and in two districts it is over 10 per cent.“So, these 22 districts are a cause of concern for us. We are constantly in consultation with the states while central teams are visiting there to give technical support,” Bhushan said.Of the 358 cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus reported in India so far, 183 were analysed and it was found that 87 of them were fully vaccinated with three having received booster doses and 70 per cent were asymptomatic, the government said.Two were partially vaccinated, seven people were unvaccinated while 16 were ineligible to receive vaccine doses in the country’s national vaccination programme. The vaccination status of 73 is still unknown, Bhushan said.He said, 121 cases had foreign travel history, while in 44 cases the infected had come in contact with foreign travellers and information about 18 people were still not available.About the country’s Covid preparedness, the health secretary said 18,10,083 isolation beds, 4,94,314 oxygen-supported beds, 1,39,300 ICU beds, 24,057 paediatric ICU beds, 64,796 paediatric non-ICU beds have been readied.Also, 50 per cent of the amount under the Emergency Covid Response package (ECRP-II) have been released to states and Union Territories. Using the fund they are reading additional 96,913 oxygen-supported beds, 20,475 ICU beds and 9,574 paediatric non-ICU beds, he said.On medical oxygen supply, Bhushan said, “Based on global and South Africa’s experience, Omicron patients so far did not have additional requirement of oxygen. But we need to be proactive.”During the first wave of Covid infections in the country, the highest requirement of oxygen in a day was 1,000 MT which shot up to 10,000 MT during the second wave.“There was a ten-fold increase in demand for medical oxygen. We were able to address that because of the collective efforts of Central and state governments and managed to supply 10,000 MT of medical oxygen. Today, we have created a capacity of 18,800 MT of medical oxygen daily,” Bhushan said.Quoting WHO’s December 17 guidance, he said that Omicron has a significant growth advantage over Delta, spreading fast through communities, with a doubling time of between 1.5 and three days. Higher risk of transmission compared to Delta has been confirmed by household and contact studies in the United Kingdom, he said.About vaccination coverage, the health secretary said 89 per cent of India’s adult population have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine while 61 per cent have been fully vaccinated.More than 140 crore doses have been administered so far.In 19 states and Union Territories, first dose coverage was over 90 per cent while in Odisha, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Puducherry, Uttar Pradesh, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Manipur, Punjab and Nagaland the coverage of first and second shots of vaccine was below the national average, he said, adding that it was a cause of concern.

24-12-2021||Dehradun||FIR lodged over 'hate' speeches at Dharma Sansad in Haridwar||Dehradun, Dec 24 (PTI) No arrest has been made yet in connection with alleged hate speeches delivered at a "Dharma Sansad" held in Uttarakhand's Haridwar recently to incite violence against the minorities, police said on Friday.An FIR has been lodged against Jitendra Narayan Tyagi, who was earlier known as Waseem Rizvi, and others in connection with the event on the basis of a complaint filed by a Jwalapur resident, Haridwar Kotwali Station House Officer (SHO) Rakinder Singh said, adding that an investigation in the matter is underway.Tyagi changed his name from Waseem Rizvi after converting to Hinduism earlier this month, he said."We have also received some footage of the event from the complainant, which are being looked into," the SHO said.Asked whether arrests are likely to be made, he said that may happen only after the conclusion of the probe.Superintendent of Police (city), Haridwar Swatantra Kumar also said the investigation in the case is on.The FIR has been registered under section 153A of the Indian Penal Code (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), he said.Extremely provocative speeches were allegedly made by the participants at the three-day event held at the Ved Niketan Dham in Haridwar last week.  On Thursday, a senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader demanded immediate action against the organisers and the speakers of the event.TMC's national spokesperson Saket Gokhale submitted a complaint at the Jwalapur police station, asking the SHO to register an FIR in the matter within 24 hours.Gokhale, who shared a copy of his complaint on Twitter, also set a deadline of December 27 for the police to arrest the organisers of the "Dharma Sansad" and those who allegedly delivered inflammatory speeches against Muslims and other minorities at the event.If an FIR is not registered against those involved within 24 hours, a plaint will be submitted to the judicial magistrate, the TMC leader said in his complaint to the SHO.At the event, several speakers allegedly made inflammatory and provocative speeches, calling for the killing of the members of minority communities and asking people to take up arms and shoot a former prime minister of the country.Gokhale also shared links on Twitter of video clips purportedly of the hate speeches delivered at the event.The "Dharma Sansad" was organised by Yati Narasimhanand Giri of the Juna Akhada, who is already under police scanner for making hate speeches and inciting violence against the minorities in the past. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fir-lodged-over-hate-speeches-at-dharma-sansad-in-haridwar-354012

24-12-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury ||BJP losing plot in West Bengal as its performance in successive elections goes down||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 24Having emerged as a strong player in state politics, the BJP appears to be fast losing the plot in West Bengal with its performance in successive elections going down.The new state committee of the BJP was announced by its state unit president Sukanta Majumdar a day after the BJP was trounced in the Kolkata civic polls by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and six months after the saffron camp secured only 77 of the state’s 294 Assembly seats against the TMC’s 213.After the spectacular show in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, which saw the BJP tally in West Bengal shoot up to 18 from the two seats it had won in 2014, the saffron party has been on a steady decline in the eastern state.While the BJP’s score rose to 77 seats in the 2021 Assembly elections from only three it had won in 2016, the tally fell far short of the majority. The results of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections announced on December 21 have thrown light on the BJP’s fast shrinking support base in the eastern metropolis.While the TMC won a landslide victory having secured victory in 134 of the 144 wards going to the KMC polls, the CPI (M) led Left Front emerged as the second largest force in terms of vote share in the polls.Ward-wise vote count of the 17 Assembly constituencies that fall in Kolkata municipal area showed the Left Front candidates emerging as runners-up in seven Assembly segments, Congress in four segments while the BJP securing the runners-up position in the remaining six segments.In the Assembly elections held in March-April this year, BJP candidates were the immediate rivals of the victorious TMC candidates in all 17 Assembly constituencies.In October, Assembly bypolls were held on four seats in West Bengal, including Dinhata and Santipur, constituencies that were won by the BJP candidates at the time of the general election. In both seats, the BJP nominees were trounced by the TMC candidates.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-losing-plot-in-west-bengal-as-its-performance-in-successive-elections-goes-down-354006
24-12-2021||Pune||Wrestler Nagesh Karale dies after being repeatedly shot in public view in Pune; video surfaces||In a shocking case, a wrestler was shot multiple times leading to his death as he was preparing to sit in his vehicle, police said here on Friday.The incident happened around 10.40 p.m. on Thursday in Chakan on the outskirts of the city when the victim Nagesh Karale was getting into his SUV to go somewhere.Suddenly, his vehicle was surrounded by a gang of at least four and they started firing bullets at him, hitting him several times, before disappearing from the crime spot.The entire incident was captured on local CCTV cameras in which the assailants are also clearly seen shooting the 37-year old well-built wrestler.Several people are said to have witnessed the chilling crime near the road with Karale lying in a pool of blood in the vehicle, and someone later called up the police who rushed there.The wrestler was immediately taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead by the doctors.The Pune Police have formed four special squads to apprehend Karale's killers who may have fled the city or are hiding in the district.As per initial investigations, Karale's killing may have resulted out of some old business rivalry, but police have collected some clues and are probing from all angles.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/pune-wrestler-nagesh-karale-dies-after-being-shot-multiple-times-in-public-view-video-surfaces-354004
24-12-2021||Jaipur||Almost half the complaints of crime against women in Rajasthan are fake: Gehlot||Almost half the complaints of crime against women in Rajasthan are fake, said Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in an email interview to IANS.As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, Rajasthan recorded the highest number of rape cases in the country last year followed by Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.The crime data for 2020 released by the NCRB showed Rajasthan reported the highest number of rape cases among the states. A total of 5,310 rape cases were registered in various police stations across the state.However, the CM in an exclusive interview with IANS, said, "It is a matter of concern that a lot of people are maligning this policy. 45.88 per cent of the FIRs lodged for crimes against women in 2019, 45.23 per cent in 2020 and 47.56 per cent in 2021, till June, were found to be fake. This means that almost half the complaints received for crimes against women are fake. The state is being maligned due to people misusing the law in this manner. And you already know how FIRs are lodged in other states."He further said, "It is written at the beginning of the NCRB report that crime is a result of various circumstances prevailing in the society. We should avoid comparing states solely on the basis of these figures due to various state specific policies and procedures. Some people make a mistake by assuming that increase in crime and increase in registration of crime are the same thing. The media and the Opposition are also making the same mistake.”"Our government implemented the policy of mandatory registration of FIRs in 2019. Earlier, the police used to write a report on a blank paper and lodged an FIR when they found any evidence. But the women and the marginalised communities used to face trouble a lot of times due to this and they weren't heard. Now everyone's FIR is registered due to which every case is taken to its logical end. This has provided much relief to the common man.”"Earlier, 33 per cent FIRs in rape cases were lodged through courts under CrPC section 156(3). Due to a policy of free registration, this figure is now just 15 per cent. Not just this, in 2019, our government set up a special unit for investigation of crimes against women under an officer of Deputy SP rank in every district -- this was promoted to Additional SP. Due to this, the investigation in heinous cases such as rape has decreased from 274 days in 2017-18 to 73 days. We have also appointed legal officers in courts and have made such an arrangement that the culprit isn't let off by the courts either. This is the reason why you keep reading in newspapers now that the accused is getting punishment in ten days or that a decision is being made within a month," he added.According to the NCRB data, the year 2020 was the second consecutive year when the state registered the highest number of rape cases. In 2019, around 5,997 rape cases were registered in various police stations of the state.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/almost-half-the-complaints-of-crime-against-women-in-rajasthan-are-fake-gehlot-354002
24-12-2021||New Delhi||Court pulls up Delhi police for staging dog fight in suspect's house||A court here has pulled up Delhi Police over an alleged incident of dog fight staged by police officials at the residence of a robbery suspect in Rohini area of the city, in which his pet dog was severely wounded and later succumbed to its injuries, and asked to file an FIR against the officials concerned.The suspect's family had released a video of the incident that took place on December 8 which went viral on social media. As the matter reached the higher-ups, a probe was ordered.Later, the Metropolitan Magistrate of Rohini Court also ordered an inquiry to be conducted by Joint CP, Northern range of the Delhi Police.In the latest order, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Babru Bhan noted that the court has found truth in allegations of the complainant against the accused.Further, the Court directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) of Rohini district to lodge a First Information Report (FIR) against the concerned Station House Officer (SHO) and erring police personnel for offences under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 342(Wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (intending to insult the modesty of any woman), 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle), 166 (Public servant disobeying law) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other relevant provisions."Since the FIR is directed to be registered against the concerned SHO, therefore, the concerned Joint Commissioner of Police (CP) shall ensure that investigation is conducted by such an agency and officer that fairness in the process of investigation can be ensured," the court said.The matter has been listed for filing a compliance report on January 3, 2022. In the order, it was stated that it is apparent that neither the accused was arrested at the time nor in the manner alleged by the police. "Further, the injuries are apparently a result of calculated assault after overpowering the accused," the court said.The audio-video clip shared by the wife of the accused clearly belies the theory of a stray dog entering the house of the accused and fighting their dog, the court noted and pointed out that the video shows a furious dog being incited by some persons in police uniform." Some females of the house can be heard begging for mercy. So, the explanation put forth by the police is not in consonance with the material produced by the complainant i.e. the wife of the accused and the visuals in the video and medical records," the order said."Whatever may be the argument, if police resorts to violence to apprehend the accused and adopts custodial atrocities to gather evidence, it is accountable for the violation of fundamental rights as law nowhere permits custodial atrocities for the purpose of collection of evidence during the investigation," it contended.The court noted that the bruises on parts of the accused were so serious that the same was present even on December 16. It said that such injuries cannot be caused in a free fight, as alleged by the police."Such injuries are possible only when someone is completely overpowered and blows with a blunt object are repeatedly given at the same spot, which is not possible in one-to-one fight, " the court said.According to police, on December 8, they reached the house of the suspect at around 10:11 p.m., but the family was not even answering the door to let them enter. "The robbery suspect was present inside the house but the family was repeatedly denying it," police said. Later, they entered the house after much effort and apprehended him.In the meanwhile, one stray dog also entered the house and the dogs started fighting, and thereafter, the dogs ran away. After all the efforts, the accused was apprehended at 03.00 a.m. He was brought to Police Station and arrested at 06.30 a.m.," the police stated.However, the court noted that the SHO had admitted the fact before the Duty MM during judicial proceedings that the accused was apprehended at 11.00 pm on December 8, 2021. At this juncture, this court has no reason to ignore the said judicial record, the order copy read.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/court-pulls-up-delhi-police-for-staging-dog-fight-in-suspects-house-354001

24-12-2021||Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh)||I-T raid at premises of two UP businessmen; Rs 150 crore found||Tax evasion worth crores of rupees has been detected during Income Tax raids on two businessmen in the city.The I-T raid was underway at the house, factory, office, cold store and petrol pump of perfume trader Piyush Jain in Kanpur, Kannauj, Mumbai and Gujarat.Along with the I-T raid, on specific intelligence inputs, officers of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Ahmedabad initiated searches in Kanpur on Thursday at the factory premises and the premises belonging to a pan masala manufacturer and a transporter (whose identity has not been shared so far) who was involved in transportation of goods under the cover of fake invoices, without generating e-way bills.The Income Tax team first reached the Anandpuri residence of Piyush Jain in the city along with the currency counting machine.Similar raids were underway at Jain's establishments in Mumbai and Gujarat.According to officials, a case of tax evasion of about Rs 150 crore has come to the fore. This tax evasion was mainly done through shell companies.Piyush Jain, a resident of Anandpuri, basically belongs to Chhipatti in Kannauj. He also owns a house, perfume factory, cold store, petrol pump in Kannauj.Piyush Jain also owns a house, head office and showroom in Mumbai. His companies are also registered in Mumbai itself.The raids began on Thursday morning simultaneously in Kanpur, Mumbai and Gujarat and ended late in the night. Cash worth Rs 150 crore was reportedly found during the raids.A Mumbai team led the raid and under its supervision, the team of Income Tax officials of Kanpur also conducted the raids.According to officials, Piyush Jain has around 40 companies, including two in the Middle East. "He is mainly into the perfumery business with its base in Kannauj, while the group owns a showroom in Mumbai from where perfumes are sold all over the country and abroad," the officials said.During the raid, it also came to fore that the company took loans in the name of shell companies. The company's foreign transactions are also huge.An I-T official, meanwhile, said, "Documents related to income and tax are being scrutinised. The process of counting currency notes is still going on with the help of SBI officials. It may get concluded by Friday. It is proposed to seize it for further in-depth investigations."Similarly, raids were also conducted at the factory premises and the premises belonging to the pan masala manufacturer and a transporter involved in transportation of goods under the cover of fake invoices, without generating e-way bills.The transporter used to generate multiple invoices in the name of non-existent firms, all below Rs 50,000 for one truck load, to avoid generation of e-way bills. The officers successfully intercepted and seized four such trucks outside the factory premises.More than 200 fake invoices used in the past for transportation without payment of GST have been recovered from the warehouse of the transporter. Further, physical stock taking in the factory has resulted in detection of shortage of raw materials/finished goods.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-t-raid-at-premises-of-two-up-businessmen-rs-150-crore-found-353994

24-12-2021||Panaji||Ex-Goa MLA quits TMC months after joining it; dubs it as 'communal' party trying to 'disturb secular fabric'||Nearly three months after joining the Trinamool Congress (TMC), former Goa legislator Lavoo Mamlatdar on Friday resigned from the party, accusing it of being communal and trying to create a divide between Hindus and Christians for votes ahead of the state Assembly polls.The former Ponda MLA had joined the Mamata Banerjee-led party in the last week of September. He was among the first few local leaders in the state to join the TMC, which has decided to contest all 40 seats in the Goa Assembly polls, due in February 2022.He also alleged that the TMC was collecting the data of people in the name of rolling out a welfare scheme for women in the state if it is voted to power after the elections.Talking to reporters after resigning from the party, Mamlatdar said, "I had joined the TMC because I was fully impressed with Mamata Banerjee-led party's performance in West Bengal (Assembly polls held earlier this year). "I was under the impression that the TMC is a very secular party. But from whatever I have noticed in the last 15-20 days, I came to know that it is worse than the BJP," he alleged.The TMC has forged a pre-poll alliance with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), of which Mamlatdar was an MLA between 2012 and 2017.He alleged that the TMC was trying to divide Hindu and Christian votes."As part of their pre-poll alliance, they want that the Christian votes should go to the TMC and Hindu votes to the MGP...The TMC is a communal party, which is trying to disturb the secular fabric," he alleged.He accused the TMC of trying to collect the data of people in the name of its Griha Laxmi scheme."We have found that under its Laxmi Bhandar scheme introduced in West Bengal, only Rs 500 is given, while here they are promising Rs 5,000 to women under the Griha Laxmi scheme, which is next to impossible. The promise of the scheme is entirely to collect data from Goa," he said.

24-12-2021||Lucknow||UP couple charged with fraud to be extradited from UK||The Uttar Pradesh Police Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has finally got the nod for the extradition of a businessman couple from the UK in connection with multiple cases of fraud against them in Delhi and UP.Swapnil Mamgain, Superintendent of Police, EOW, said the couple had allegedly pulled off Rs 1.76-crore export fraud in Bulandshahr district.This is the first time that the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Uttar Pradesh Police has secured extradition permission.Earlier, EOW of the Uttar Pradesh police was also the first agency to get a red notice issued by Interpol and had the offenders arrested abroad.The couple, he said, conned banks and farmers out of another Rs 800 crore. They were arrested in London in October 2019. Interpol had issued a red notice against them.Later, the EOW moved the Westminster court for the deportation of Vir Karan Awasthi, 51, and Reetika Awasthi, 49, who were residents of Saket Nagar, Delhi.Mamgain, said a company in Bulandshahr registered the case against Bush Foods Overseas Pvt. Ltd, owned by the Awasthis, on September 11, 2015, and the state government handed over the investigations to EOW in March 2016.According to the complaint lodged by the victim Lokendra Singh, owner of Saurabh & Co., Bush Foods purchased from his firm Rs 1.76-crore worth of paddy for export, but never paid any money.The FIR charged the Awasthi couple with cheating, criminal breach of trust, forgery of valuable security and criminal intimidation."During investigations, we also found that the (export) fraud is only the tip of the iceberg. The (total) fraud is worth over Rs 800 crore. In January 2016, the Supreme Court allowed the couple to visit London for the treatment of Vir Karan Awasthi on a personal surety of Rs 86 lakh and they did not return since then," Mamgain said.A London court allowed the couple's extradition after much persuasion by the EOW through the country's nodal agency for extradition -- Central Bureau of Investigation -- and soon they will be brought to India to be prosecuted in cases registered against them here, he said.

Supreme CourtA Bench of Justice DY Chandrachud also said: “… there are accepted defences to this principle. The well-recognised exception to this rule is that the duty to accommodate must not cause undue hardship or impose a disproportionate burden on the employer — the interpretation of these concepts may vary in each jurisdiction.”It set aside a 2018 judgment of the Gauhati High Court that restored inquiry proceedings against CRPF Assistant Commandant Ravinder Kumar Dhariwal who had pleaded mental disability in disciplinary proceedings. A person with a disability was entitled to protection under the new law as long as the disability was one of the factors for his discriminatory act leading to such an inquiry, it said.“The appellant is also entitled to the protection... of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 in the event he is found unsuitable for his current employment duty. While re-assigning the appellant to an alternate post, should it become necessary, his pay, emoluments and conditions of service must be protected,” the top court said.Providing reasonable accommodation to such employees is “sacrosanct” as the “one-size fits all approach” can never be used to identify disability which was an “individualistic conception”, it noted. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/explore-all-options-before-sacking-employee-claiming-disability-sc-353820

The draft policy envisages that existing legislations affecting women will be harmonised in accordance with constitutional provisions and international commitments to enhance their effectiveness,” the WCD Ministry said in one of its assurances. In the works since December 2015, the draft policy was approved by the Group of Ministers in 2018 and submitted for Cabinet approval which never came.Requesting the committee on government assurances to permit it to drop all promises about the policy, WCD Ministry said the Cabinet Secretariat was no longer considering the draft National Policy for Women 2017.“A Cabinet note on the national policy for women was sent to the Cabinet Secretariat for consideration. The Cabinet Secretariat intimated that it is no longer under consideration of the secretariat. However, the Ministry of Women and Child Development may, if considered necessary, forward an updated and a revised note. It is submitted that review of policies is a continuous process and based on the recommendations the government takes appropriate measures to amend the laws from time to time,” the WCD ministry said in its request to the committee.The draft policy was prepared when Maneka Gandhi was WCD Minister. It addressed diverse needs of women through the identified areas, including food security and education.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-policy-for-women-junked-353818

Cow can be a sin for some people, for us it is mother, sacred. — Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterHe also took a swipe at Opposition parties, saying those making jokes on cows and buffaloes forget that livelihood of crores of people depends on “pashudhan” (livestock). In an apparent attack on the main rival Samajwadi Party, PM Modi said their mindset contained ‘mafiavad’, ‘parivarvad’ and illegal occupation of property whereas for the BJP the priority was ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’.Paying tribute to former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh, a top Jat leader from western UP, on his birth anniversary today, he said Charan Singh devoted his entire life for development of villages and farmers in the country.On an inauguration spree ahead of the high-stake elections next year, this is PM Modi’s second visit to his constituency in the past 10 days. A frequent visitor to the poll-bound UP in the past two months, especially the purvanchal or the eastern region, the PM was here on December 13 to inaugurate the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor.Doing well in Purvanchal, in specific, is important for it to return to power. The home turf of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is also a bastion of Samajwadi Party.Meanwhile, the PM said strengthening India’s dairy sector was one of the top priorities of the government. He also lauded the people of UP for making it the largest milk-producing state in the country.Spread across 30 acres, Banas Dairy Sankul would process about 5 lakh litre milk a day and strengthen the rural economy, officials said.The PM also digitally transferred a bonus into bank accounts of milk producers associated with the Banas dairy and laid the foundation stone for a biogas-based electricity generation plant for a Milk Producers’ Cooperative Union facility.He also virtually distributed rural residential rights record ‘Gharauni’ under the Swamitva scheme of the Union Ministry of Panchayati Raj, to over 20 lakh residents of the state. This, he said, would open new vistas of development and dignity for rural poor and would make them part of the development story.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-varanasi-pm-launches-2k-cr-projects-353817

24-12-2021||Belagavi (KTK)||Karnataka Assembly passes 'anti-conversion Bill'; aimed at getting rid of menace of conversion, says CM||The contentious “anti-conversion Bill” was passed by the Karnataka Legislative Assembly on Thursday, amid din, with Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai terming it as both constitutional and legal, and aimed at getting rid of the menace of religious conversion.Opposing the “Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, 2021”, tooth and nail, the Congress dubbed it “anti-people”, “inhuman”, “anti-constitutional”, “anti-poor” and “draconian”, and urged it should not be passed for any reason and that it be withdrawn by the government.JD(S) too expressed its opposition to the Bill, which was introduced in the Assembly on Tuesday.The Bill provides for protection of right to freedom of religion and prohibition of unlawful conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means.It proposes an imprisonment from three to five years with a fine of Rs 25,000, while for violation of provisions with respect to minors, women, SC/ST, the offenders will face imprisonment from three to ten years and a fine of not less than Rs 50,000.The Bill also makes provisions for the accused to pay up to Rs five lakh as compensation to those who were made to convert, and with regards to cases of mass conversion there shall be a 3-10 year jail term and a fine of up to Rs one lakh.It also states that any marriage which has happened for the sole purpose of unlawful conversion or vice-versa by the man of one religion with the woman of another, either by converting himself before or after marriage or by converting the woman before or after marriage, shall be declared as null and void by the family court.Wherever the family court is not established, the court having jurisdiction to try such case, on a petition presented by either party thereto against the other party of the marriage.The offense under this Bill is non-bailable and cognisable.The Bill was passed by a voice vote on Thursday, even as Congress members were protesting from the well of the House, demanding continuation of the debate on it that began earlier in the day.They were also expressing their anguish against some remarks made by minister KS Eshwarappa, during his intervention in the debate.However, the Congress seemed to be on the back foot with the ruling BJP alleging the Bill was actually “initiated” by the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah led administration, and placed documents to support its claim before the House.Though Siddaramaiah, now the Leader of Opposition, denied it, later on went through the records in the Speaker’s office and accepted that as the CM he had then only asked the draft Bill to be placed before the Cabinet and no decision was taken in this regard. Hence it cannot be seen or projected as the intention of his government.With Siddaramaiah alleging RSS’ hand behind the Bill, Chief Minister Bommai said, “RSS is committed to anti conversion, it is not a hidden secret, it is an open secret. Why did the Congress government in 2016 initiate the Bill during its tenure following the RSS’ policy? It is because Congress CM in Himachal Pradesh Virbhadra Singh had brought a similar law. You are a party to this Bill.” Bommai said the Bill is both constitutional and legal, and aimed at getting rid of the menace of religious conversion.  —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-assembly-passes-anti-conversion-bill-aimed-at-getting-rid-of-menace-of-conversion-says-cm-353678
