In the evening, the complainant called back Kumar and the officer told him to pay the first installment of Rs 5 lakh along with instructions to route it through a particular ‘angadia’ (courier) firm and middleman in Delhi.After getting the information, the CBI laid a trap and the middlemen were arrested. It was followed by detention of the two officers in Ahmedabad, officials added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-apprehends-two-ed-officials-in-gujarat-for-demanding-rs-75-lakh-bribe-277270
02-07-2021||New Delhi||Pregnant women should be informed about benefits, risks and likely side-effects of Covid vaccine: Govt||Pregnant women should be informed about benefits, risks and likely side-effects of Covid-19 vaccine to help them make an informed decision on taking the jab, the Union Health Ministry said on Friday as it allowed their inoculation.The ministry released an ‘Operational Guidance for Covid-19 Vaccination of Pregnant Women’.Experts have suggested that the Covid-19 vaccine may be offered to the pregnant women if no contraindications exist, it said.The intent is to weigh risk versus benefit on individualised basis so that a pregnant woman can take an informed decision.“The full impact of Covid-19 disease on pregnancy outcomes for mother and fetus as well as for newborn is still unclear. Therefore, pregnant women require special considerations and systematic reporting of adverse events following immunization (AEFI),” the guidance document said.Obstetrician and gynaecologist, pediatrician or neonatologist to be included in AEFI committees.All serious and severe adverse events following vaccination of pregnant women should be reported immediately, it stated.The investigation of all such cases to be expedited. Cytopathological examination of aborted/ perinatal death if any occurring in vaccinated women may be done, the document said.“The adverse event and the pregnancy outcome must be noted on the ANC/MCH card. Pregnancy registry can be used to track such cases and to determine pregnancy outcome. All antenatal, post-natal and other relevant clinical records must be sought for and collected during investigation and gathered from the treating physician,” it said.Causality assessment of all adverse events following vaccination of pregnant women to be expedited.During vaccination, the vaccinator or medical officer must consider the fact that women in reproductive age group might be unaware of the pregnancy at the time of vaccination.Therefore, the vaccinator must inform her for immediate reporting of AEFI, if any. In such cases, women will need to report immediately to the vaccinator or nearest health facility, the document said.States would undertake an orientation of programme managers at district, block and sub-block levels and other stakeholders.The document also contains a fact-sheet to guide the medical officers for counselling pregnant women, according to which pregnancy does not increase the risk to Covid-19 infection, but current evidence indicate that pregnant women are at an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19 compared to non-pregnant women in case they get infected.Additionally, pregnant women with Covid-19 are at increased risk for pre-term birth and might have an increased risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes, including higher chances of neonatal morbidity.Most pregnant women will be asymptomatic or have mild disease, but their health may deteriorate rapidly and that might affect the foetal outcome. It is important that they take all precautions to protect themselves from acquiring Covid-19, including taking vaccination.The WHO recommends vaccination in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks, such as pregnant women at high risk of exposure to Covid-19 and pregnant women with comorbidities that place them in a high-risk group for severe Covid-19 disease.It is, therefore, advised that a pregnant woman should take Covid-19 vaccine, the document said.The fact sheet further mentions that although most (more than 90 per cent) infected pregnant women recover without need for hospitalisation, rapid deterioration in health may occur in a few.Symptomatic pregnant women appear to be at increased risk of severe disease and death.Compared with pregnant women without Covid-19, those with symptomatic Covid-19 are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including admission to the ICU, iatrogenic pre-term birth, pre-eclampsia-like symptoms, Caesarean section and death.On how does Covid-19 infection of pregnant women affect the baby, the document said most (over 95 per cent) of newborns of positive mothers have been in good condition at birth.However, Covid-19 in pregnancy increases the chances of pre-term birth, increasing the possibility of hospitalization for the neonate and in some cases even death.Risk factors for developing complication after infection during pregnancy are: Pre-existing co-morbidities, advanced maternal age, and high body mass index.Pregnant women with certain high-risk conditions have greater risk of severe illness from Covid-19 such as pre-existing medical conditions e.g. Diabetes, Organ transplant recipients, chronic respiratory conditions like COPD, Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis and homozygous sickle cell disease among others.In case a woman has been infected with Covid-19 infection during the current pregnancy, then she should be vaccinated soon after the delivery, the document stated.On side effects of vaccines that can either harm the pregnant women or her foetus, the fact-sheet stated the available jabs are safe and vaccination protects pregnant women against Covid-19 illness/disease like other individuals.Based on current knowledge, experts believe that Covid-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or foetus.Like any medicine a vaccine may have side-effects which are normally mild. After getting the vaccine, she can get mild fever, pain at injection site, or feel un-well for 1-3 days. The long-term adverse effects and safety of vaccine for foetus and child is not established yet.On any specific contraindications for vaccination in pregnancy, the fact-sheet stated as for the general population, pregnant women should avoid vaccination in conditions such as anaphylactic or allergic reaction to the previous dose of Covid-19 vaccine, anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to vaccines or injectable therapies, pharmaceutical products, food-items, etc. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pregnant-women-should-be-informed-about-benefits-risks-and-likely-side-effects-of-covid-vaccine-govt-277269

Since I was already in a pre-scheduled meeting in my chamber, my staff requested him to sit in the waiting room of my office building and offered him a cup of tea.“When my meeting was over and thereafter my PPS informed me about his arrival, I requested my PPS to convey to Mr Adhikari my inability to meet him and apologise as he had to wait. Mr Adhikari thanked my PPS and left without insisting to meet me. The question of my meeting with Mr Adhikari therefore did not arise,” Mehta said in a statement.Earlier, three TMC MPs wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Mehta’s removal from the post of Solicitor General for meeting Adhikari, an accused in the Narada scam case being probed by the CBI, saying it amounted to conflict of interest.They alleged that Adhikari faced criminal cases of cheating, illegal gratification and bribery and was caught on camera taking bribes in a sting operation.Pointing out that Solicitor General is the second highest law officer who advises government and its agencies on crucial legal matters, the MPs demanded that necessary steps should be taken for Mehta’s removal to avoid any doubt in the minds of the public regarding the integrity and neutrality of the office of Solicitor General.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/solicitor-general-tushar-mehta-denies-meeting-adhikari-but-says-he-did-come-to-my-residence-277266

This is the reason why the death rate inthe state is yet to decrease,” he said.Without understanding this, the government has triedto save its face by reducing the death toll, the BJP leader added.These allegations were refuted by George in her press conference on Friday where she said the deaths were being reported by doctors according to the guidelines laid down by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).On Thursday, she had said the state government had nothing to hide with regard todeaths due to Covid-19.A new transparent and decentralised online system hasbeen put in place to report deaths due to the virus, George had said, a day after the Supreme Court directed the NationalDisaster Management Authority to issue guidelines in six weeksfor ex-gratia compensation to families of those who died of Covid.Kerala is a state where 100 per cent births and deathsare reported, she had said and added that it is not as if the state decides on which death to be categorised as due to Covid or not.As per government figures, 13,505 people have lost their lives to the virus, while Congress and BJP have claimed that the actual number might be double that.

Also, to protect the interest of consumers, the duty of CPO has been cut by 5% from 30th June 2021 until 30th September 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-control-prices-of-essential-commodities-centre-imposes-stock-limits-on-pulses-277261

He also used the word to take an apparent dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.A Twitter user reached out to Tharoor, saying she was waiting to learn a new word and the former Union minister was quick to oblige.“My friend Rathin Roy, the economist, taught me a new word today: pogonotrophy, which means ‘the cultivation of a beard’. As in, the PM’s pogonotrophy has been a pandemic preoccupation…,” he said in a tweet.Tharoor’s tweet left many bemused with a Twitter user saying, “If the world has Oxford dictionary Why not India has Tharur Dictionary (sic)?”“Thanks for sharing this one from Tharoorictionary,” said another user.This is not the first time Tharoor has sent Twitterati scurrying for their dictionaries.In May, Tharoor engaged in a friendly banter with TRS working president KT Rama Rao over Covid-19 medicine names and threw in another head scratcher—floccinaucinihilipilification.Oxford dictionary describes floccinaucinihilipilification as the action or habit of estimating something as worthless.Tharoor has been a man of many words earlier too.In the past, he has stumped people with rarely used English words such as “farrago” and “troglodyte”. While farrago means a confused mixture, a troglodyte means a person regarded as being deliberately ignorant or old-fashioned.Tharoor has also started a new weekly column on words in the Weekend Magazine of the ‘Khaleej Times’ of Dubai.

02-07-2021||New Delhi||India’s Maldives envoy seeks more protection after disparaging social media posts||The extreme bonhomie between India and Maldives has come under attack by a few journalists in Male.It has led to sparks flying over the Indian High Commission’s letter to the Maldivian Foreign Ministry seeking enhanced protection for its diplomats and to take action against individuals or media outlets critical of India.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) opted to let the High Commission and Male sort out the issue by declining to comment on the developments.“I think today the Maldivian Foreign Ministry has issued a statement. The Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) has also issued a statement. Let us leave it at that,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi while replying to questions on the issue at the weekly media briefing on Friday.The leaked Indian High Commission letter to the Maldives Foreign Ministry spoke of “recent, recurring articles and social media posts attacking the dignity of the High Commission, the Head of the Mission, and members of diplomatic staff”.It said the attacks were “motivated, malicious, and increasingly personal” and believed they were undertaken to create enmity and hatred between the Maldives and India.The ruling MDP came out in support of the Indian High Commission by expressing deep concern over the “disparaging and ill-founded remarks” about Indian diplomats and called on the website co-founder to refrain from dragging in the Maldives’ diplomatic partners and allies into “petty political vendettas”.The continuous barrage of anti-India vitriol appears to be a “well-funded, well-orchestrated and pre-meditated political campaign with the express purpose of whipping up hatred against the Maldives’ closest ally, India,” it said.The MDP felt such campaigns of hatred carry real security concerns for the safety and security of diplomats in our country and condemned the propaganda “which is only motivated by the desire to sow discord and animosity”.A timeline of prominent actors disparaging India’s close ties with Maldives on social media showed them posting celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China (CPC).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-maldives-envoy-seeks-more-protection-after-disparaging-social-media-posts-277259

02-07-2021||New Delhi||People in states with high PM2.5 levels more likely to get Covid-19: Study||People living in the national capital and in states such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are more likely to contract Covid-19 due to prolonged exposure to high concentration of PM2.5, according to a new pan-India study.Sixteen major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune, Ahmedabad, Varanasi, Lucknow and Surat, reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases, and PM2.5 emissions are also higher in these areas due to fossil fuel-based anthropogenic activities, it said.PM2.5 refers to fine particles which penetrate deep into the body and fuel inflammation in the lungs and respiratory tract, leading to the risk of having cardiovascular and respiratory problems, including a weak immune system.The study conducted in 721 districts across India establishes a strong relationship between the PM2.5 emission load and Covid-19 infections and resulting deaths, according to one of the authors, Gufran Beig, who is the director of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).Researchers from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune; National Institute of Technology, Rourkela and IIT-Bhubaneswar studied data related to emissions, air quality and Covid-19 cases and deaths in these districts till November 5 last year.This study provides the first practical evidence for India that “cities having pollution hotspots where fossil fuel emissions are dominating are highly susceptible to Covid-19 cases”, the findings read.The study has been named ‘Establishing a link between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) zones and Covid-19 over India based on anthropogenic emission sources and air quality data’.Higher numbers of Covid-19 cases have been found in Delhi and states such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Bihar, Karnataka, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh with prolonged exposure to the high concentration of PM2.5, the report said.If the trend of good correlation coefficient persists then communities living in these areas are more likely to get affected by Covid-19, according to the study.According to the study, bad air quality days have a visible relationship with the number of Covid-19 casualties.“There’s an exponential increase in the number of casualties once the bad air quality days cross the value of 100,” it said.Delhi, which witnesses 288 bad air quality days per year on an average, reported 4,38,529 coronavirus cases and 6,989 deaths due to the disease till November 5 last year.Mumbai, which records 165 bad air quality days a year on an average, reported 2,64,545 cases and 10,445 deaths during the period. Pune, which records 117 bad air quality index days a year, reported 3,38,583 cases and 7,060 fatalities.However, there are some anomalies – Srinagar that records 145 bad air days a year had 20,413 cases and 375 fatalities till November 5, while Bengaluru, which witnesses just 39 bad air quality days in a year, reported 3,65,959 cases and 4,086 deaths.“The study shows the correlation coefficient between PM2.5 emission load and Covid-19 cases is high but not 100 per cent. In such a case, there will be some anomalies which could be attributed to several confounding factors, including the number of tests,” Beig explained.The researchers also said that residential emissions from biofuel burning (emissions from cooking, heating etc) “emerged as a crucial sector in elevating PM2.5 load over the country even during the lockdown situations and correlating with Covid-19 cases rise”.

The attempt failed of course. The assets were not damaged. Two explosives were used,” he said in an interactive session at a think tank.Explosives-laden drones were used to carry out an attack on the Jammu Air Force station on Sunday in the first such instance of suspected Pakistan-based terrorists deploying unmanned aerial vehicles to strike at vital military installations in India.The Chief of Air Staff said a detailed investigation into the attacks was under way and that all sets of measures would be on the table based on the findings of the probe.“We have gone over the subject in terms of the implications of this kind of capabilities in the hands of non-state actors and the kind of effect the armed drone capabilities would have in future conflicts,” Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said.He said the IAF analysed a large extent the requirements in terms of planning and required systems and infrastructure to enhance its abilities to go for “soft kill” and to have a counter-drone system.“It should be possible to react in the short notice; detect, quickly react and be able to target it and that targeting is essentially directed energy kind of targeting in terror attack kind of a situation,” the IAF Chief said.“All these issues have been looked at and many of the projects have already been undertaken and some of the systems were already fielded,” he said.He said the Jammu Air Force station did not have critical assets and systems to detect drones were not fielded there.Referring to the attacks, he said there was no visibility when the incident took place.“Very soon we will have enough systems and we will target.. we will find ways to tackle this threat,” the Air Chief Marshal said.

02-07-2021||Kolkata||Chaos in Bengal Assembly as protesting BJP MLAs compel Governor to cut short Address||In an unprecedented development, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar was on Friday forced to cut short his inaugural Address at the newly formed Assembly amid ruckus by Opposition BJP MLAs, who took offence after finding “no mention” of post-poll violence in the speech.Dhankhar, who arrived at the Assembly in the afternoon to deliver the inaugural address, could barely speak for four minutes as BJP MLAs, carrying posters and pictures of alleged victims of post-poll violence, rushed to the Well of the House to stage a protest.According to Assembly sources, the Governor began his speech at 2 pm and ended it at 2.04 pm, as his voice became inaudible amid the ongoing commotion. He then tabled the speech and left for the day.Dhankhar was escorted to his car by Speaker Biman Banerjee and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari, while talking to reporters, said BJP legislators “had no option but to stage a protest after finding no mention of post-poll violence in the Governor’s speech”, copies of which were circulated among the legislators.“The speech, drafted by the TMC dispensation, said there has been no case of any violence, rape or attack on women after the party formed its new government in the state.“All incidents of violence, according to the speech, took place before the new government was sworn in. We had to protest against this blatant lie,” Adhikari maintained.Lauding the Governor for raising his voice against cases of post-poll violence in the state over the past one month, the BJP leader claimed that the TMC government was “trying to suppress the truth”.“We don’t blame the Governor. He was forced to read out the speech prepared by the state government,” Adhikari said, adding that his party wants to hold day-long discussions in the House on post-poll violence and the recently held fake vaccination drive in the city.“During an all-party meeting, we had put forth these demands, but none of them was addressed. We will continue to hold protests if our demand for discussion is not met with,” he said.Reacting to BJP’s protest, the TMC said the saffron party has set a “new precedence in anarchy”.“What they (BJP MLAs) did today is unprecedented and unacceptable in a parliamentary democracy,” TMC chief whip Nirmal Ghosh pointed out.According to Raj Bhavan sources, Dhankar had raised a few questions over the inaugural speech, to which Banerjee said that the state cabinet has approved the draft.Dhankar, who has, on occasions, criticised the TMC government over post-poll violence, also sought the inclusion of the matter in the speech, but his request was apparently turned down.The business of the House, which began with the governor’s address on Friday, will continue till July 8. The state budget for 2021-22 is likely to be placed in the House on July 7.The Assembly’s inaugural session during the day also saw the Chief Minister and her bete noire Adhikari coming face-to-face for the first time since the elections.In the March-April hustings, the TMC pocketed 213 seats and the BJP 77. One seat was bagged by the newly formed ISF.Once considered a protege of Banerjee, Adhikari switched over to the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls and defeated the Chief Minister from the high-profile Nandigram seat by a slender margin.Banerjee has, however, moved the court challenging the election result in Nandigram.

02-07-2021||New Delhi||Second wave of Covid-19 not over, cannot lower guard: Govt||The government on Friday stressed on vaccination and following Covid-19 protocols as it noted that the second wave of the pandemic is not over yet.Addressing a press conference on the pandemic situation, an official said people cannot and should not lower their guard.Seventy-one districts reported Covid case positivity rate of more than 10 per cent in the week from June 23 to 29, the government said, adding that the second wave of Covid-19 is not over.On the ongoing vaccination drive, the government said India is vaccinating on an average 50 lakh individuals daily since June 21, which is equivalent to inoculating the entire population of Norway every day.Till date, 34 crore people—the equivalent of the entire population of the US—have been vaccinated with at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine since the drive began on January 16, the government said.Nearly 80 per cent healthcare workers and 90 per cent frontline workers have been administered both doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the country, it said.India saw a single-day rise of 46,617 new coronavirus infections, taking the tally of COVID-19 cases to 3,04,58,251, while the national recovery rate has crossed 97 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 4,00,312 with 853 daily fatalities.

02-07-2021||Guwahati||‘My case proves gross misuse of UA(P)A, NIA Act’: Assam MLA Akhil Gogoi||Describing the Special NIA Court’s verdict clearing him of all charges pressed by the investigating agency as “historic”, Assam MLA Akhil Gogoi on Friday said his case proved the gross misuse of the UA(P)A and the NIA Act.Labelling the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as a “mere political tool” of the BJP government at the Centre, the Independent legislator from Sibsagar constituency said the judgment will be a landmark for those arrested through the misuse of the two anti-terror laws.“My case proves the gross misuse of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the NIA Act. The verdict will be a milestone for those arrested through the misuse of the two legislations,” the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act activist told PTI in an interview after 567 days of imprisonment.Gogoi, who walked free on Thursday after being arrested on December 12, 2019, for his alleged role in violent anti-CAA stir in the state, said that the Special NIA Court’s verdict is historic because it exposed the NIA, which has become a “political agency” like the CBI and the ED.“Even on Thursday, the NIA wanted to slap a fresh case but by the time they reached the court with the appeal, the verdict was already out,” he said.In an additional chargesheet filed by the NIA on June 29, Gogoi alleged that “false charges of honey trapping, cow smuggling and training at a Maoist camp” were brought against him.The Raijor Dal chief alleged that the NIA had offered him instant bail if he agreed to join the RSS or the BJP, a charge levelled earlier by him in a letter written from the prison in May.“When they took me into custody, their only question was whether I would join the RSS. Not once had they asked anything about my alleged links with Maoists. My CIO D R Singh never spoke about red rebels before me. He said that if I joined the RSS, I would be released in 10 days.“When I replied in negative, he offered me to join the BJP and become a minister. I refused that too. He then said that I would be jailed for 10 years,” Gogoi said.He said the Special NIA Court’s judgment is a “turning point” in the judiciary as it shows that the “pressure of the executive” is not permanent.The court of Special NIA Judge Pranjal Das observed that there was nothing to indicate that the “talk of blockade” threatened the country’s economic security or was “a terrorist act.”In a strongly worded judgment, the court said that in the interest of justice, it has found the conduct and approach of the investigating authority in this case to be “discouraging”, to say the least.“The court has high expectations from a premier investigating agency like the NIA, entrusted with the profoundly important task of protecting our country and us, citizens from the menace of terrorism.“The court hopes and expects that, such high standards will be upheld, for sake of the country and this one will be just an exception,” Special NIA Judge Pranjal Das said in his order copy.Gogoi became the first person in Assam to win an Assembly election from behind the bars in the recently concluded polls.

02-07-2021||---||‘There is no vaccine for virus of arrogance and ignorance’: BJP, Health Minister slam Rahul||New Delhi, July 2The ruling BJP on Friday slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for raising questions over the Covid vaccine availability in the country, with Health Minister Harsh Vardhan saying that “There is no vaccine for the virus of arrogance and ignorance”."Just yesterday, I put out facts on vaccine availability for the month of July. What is @RahulGandhi Ji's problem? Does he not read? Does he not understand? There is no vaccine for the virus of arrogance and ignorance!! @INCIndia must think of a leadership overhaul!" Vardhan tweeted.Earlier in the day, Gandhi had said in a tweet in Hindi that July had come but vaccines had not.Vardhan also urged leaders making “irresponsible statements” to spend “more energy in planning and not in creating panic”.Later, addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said 41.60 lakh doses were administered on July 1, while a total of 6.85 crore jabs had been given between June 21 and July 1 with a daily average of over 62 lakh.The government is working on a “war footing”, he said, adding that the pace of vaccination will gather more speed in the coming days. “Is there any country with a better average in the last 11 days,” Bhatia asked, adding that India, by administering over 34 crore doses, had surpassed countries like the US and Canada“You may hate Modi but why hate people. Is spreading confusion the undeclared policy of the Congress?” he questioned while hitting out at the alleged corruption and irregularities in Covid management in the Congress-ruled Punjab and Rajasthan and questioned party chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi about it.Lashing out at Gandhi over his ‘Movid’ remark, he said, “We could also have called it ‘Rovid’, that ‘Rovid’ is spreading negativity in the country”. He cited media reports to accuse the Congress government in Rajasthan of buying oxygen concentrators at an exorbitant rate and alleged that many of them were defunct. Bhatia claimed that even Congress leaders in Maharashtra had alleged corruption by the coalition government in the state.He also lauded the Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh and expressed confidence that the BJP will win the Assembly polls, to be held next year, with “a bigger margin than 2017”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-is-no-vaccine-for-virus-of-arrogance-and-ignorance-bjp-health-minister-slam-rahul-277214

02-07-2021||New Delhi||'Total nonsense': Dominica PM on claims that his govt was involved in Mehul Choksi's abduction||Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit has termed "total nonsense" the claims that his government was involved in alleged abduction of diamantaire Mehul Choksi, wanted in Rs 13,5000 crore scam in Punjab National Bank, from neighbouring Antigua and Barbuda, local media there reported.In his weekly "annou palay" show, Skerrit said his government will allow the court to carry out its process regarding Choksi and gave the assurance that his rights and obligations will be respected, Dominica News Online reported.Skerrit refuted the allegations of a plot between India and Dominica government to kidnap Choksi from neighbouring Caribbean country Antigua and Barbuda, where he was staying since 2018 as a citizen, after fleeing from India, and bring him to Dominica, the news portal reported."To say that the government of Dominica and the government of Antigua along with India colluded in any way, give me a break, that's total nonsense. We don't get involved ourselves in those kinds of activities, those practices, not at all. I mean that is absurd and we reject it and it is unfortunate that anybody would want to propagate this unsubstantiated claim by a gentleman who is before the courts," he was quoted as saying by Dominica News Online.He further said "whether it would be fair for a local who commits murder in Dominica and flees to another country, is allowed to roam free or instead be apprehended and sent back to Dominica to face his charges".Citing the case of a Dominica citizen wanted by the United States whose extradition proceedings are going on in courts to counter opposition on Choksi, Skerrit said the country cannot treat people differently depending on who they are or how much money they may have."All of us are subjected to the laws irrespective of our position or how much money we may have or how much we don't have. And I believe that in this circumstance…Dominica has a right and obligation to apprehend this person and bring the person before the courts and let the courts determine," he said."We here in Dominica with the opposition talking about Choksi but there is a young boy from Grand Bay…Where there is an extradition request by the United States government on allegations that he committed a crime in St Thomas and we are mandated and obligated to apprehend him."And the police acted on the instruction of the DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions) arrested the young man and he is remanded at the state prison awaiting his extradition hearing. His lawyers will fight his case. If the courts believe that there is no reason to extradite him to the United States then he will go freely," Skerrit said.Choksi's lawyer in Dominica Justin Simon claimed that United Kingdom's Metropolitan Police, known as Scotland Yard, has started looking into allegations of torture and kidnapping of Choksi as citizens there were allegedly part of the plot, the news site reported.Simon told media that there will be international implications if Dominica or Antigua turns out to be involved in the alleged plot, it said.

02-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||Monsoon likely to pick up pace in Northwest by July 10: IMD||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 1A slight respite from “markedly above normal” temperatures prevailing in the plains of the Northwest is expected around July 2/3 with moisture-laden southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea “reducing intensity and area coverage” of the prevailing heatwave.Crucial for cropsHowever, according to IMD Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, “due to increase in humidity association with these winds the human discomfort level will continue”.Temperatures in Haryana, Delhi, Punjab and northern parts of Rajasthan are recording six to seven degrees above normal.Currently passing through a “break phase”, the monsoon is expected to revive in the second week around July 10. Though the complete revival can only be expected around July 15.“Normally, the seasonal rains cover the entire country by July 8, which is not expected to happen this year,” Mohapatra said. The seasonal rains have covered most parts of the country this year, except Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and parts of Rajasthan.Enumerating the reasons behind the suffocating heat in the NW and “break period”, the IMD DG said heat energy from neighbouring Pakistan is being transferred via mid-level westerly winds. Further, the absence of low-pressure areas in Bay of Bengal and unfavourable Madden Julian Oscillation are the other reasons why the monsoon has not progressed since June 19.Though from tomorrow, relatively cooler and moisture-laden winds from the Arabian Sea are expected to cool down the temperatures in some parts.“Progress of monsoon has been quite good in most parts of the country, covering them by June 19, except Northwest which has been the most affected,” Mohapatra said, sounding a cautionary note regarding agriculture operation-sowing, transplantation, irrigation and power supply in the region.Paddy transplantation in Punjab and Haryana happens mostly in July, when much rains are not expected in the first half.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-likely-to-pick-up-pace-in-northwest-by-july-10-imd-277075

On an average, breakfast was skipped for 10 days in a month, slightly more in rural areas. Only two-thirds reported being imparted health education on NCD risk factors in their schools and colleges,” Mathur said. “Overall, 1,402 households and 1,531 adolescents completed the survey,” says Prashant Mathur, the lead author.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/adolescents-skip-breakfast-10-days-in-month-277086

The case relates to an alleged assault on the then chief secretary, Anshu Prakash, during a meeting at Kejriwal’s official residence on February 19, 2018. Besides Kejriwal and Sisodia, 11 AAP MLAs were named as accused in the case.Kejriwal, Sisodia and nine AAP MLAs were granted bail in October 2018, while the other two MLAs — Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal — were given bail earlier by the high court.The top court said the high court’s order supported liberty and “we support it”. Moreover, as per the basic principles of natural justice, there must be a robust common sense that the accused must have a copy of the witness’s statement, it said.On behalf of the police, Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi said if the high court order was not set aside, it would have some serious repercussions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-delhi-police-plea-against-hc-order-in-2018-cs-assault-case-277087

It recognises AstraZeneca doses made in Europe, US, South Korea and China, but not those made in India.However, sources cautioned against panic and pointed out that the EU (European Union) Covid digital certificate had a six-week phase-in period, meaning it would be insisted upon by all EU nations for crossing their international borders sometime in mid-August. A large number of them have still not opened their borders to Indians.The Serum Institute of India (SII), they pointed out, was confident that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would recognise the AstraZeneca doses made in India. It currently recognises AstraZeneca doses made in Europe, US, South Korea andChina, but not those manufactured by the SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer. The EU digital certificate, which recognises only four vaccines and none of those produced in India, is recognised by all 27 EU member states, plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Of these 31 countries, nine have decided to accept Covishield as and when they open their borders to citizens of countries hit by deadly Covid variants. India is one of the countries on the list. These countries are EU members Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, Ireland, Spain and Estonia, plus Switzerland and Iceland.India and the powerful 55-nation African Union have called upon the EU authorities to accept the Indian version of AstraZeneca vaccine called Covishield. A similar demand has been raised by some West Asian countries such as the UAE. These countries had received Covishield through commercial contracts or as part of a WHO-sponsored vaccine distribution program called Covax.The EU said it’s working to ensure its digital certificate is compatible with similar products in non-EU countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-reciprocity-nudge-7-eu-nations-to-allow-indians-with-covishield-shots-277020

We have to factor this as we make our plans,” he said.On China, he said the developments along the northern borders during the past year were a stark reminder that “to preserve our territorial integrity, the armed forces need to continually prepare and adapt to the exigencies of modern wars”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/readying-hi-tech-drones-to-counter-threats-indian-army-chief-277022

Though the complete revival can only be expected around July 15.Normally the seasonal rains cover the entire country by July 8, which is not expected to happen this year, Mohapatra said. The seasonal rains have covered most parts of the country this year, except Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Rajasthan.“Every monsoon is unique, we can expect an increase in rainfall in the second half of the second week, around July 10,” the IMD DG said.Enumerating the reasons behind the suffocating heat in the NW and “break period”, the IMD DG said heat energy from neighbouring Pakistan is being transferred via mid-level westerly winds. Further, the absence of low-pressure areas in Bay of Bengal and an unfavourable Madden Julian Oscillation are the other reasons why the monsoon has not progressed since June 19.”Though from tomorrow, relatively cooler and moisture-laden winds from the Arabian Sea are expected to cool down the temperatures in some parts. “Progress of monsoon has been quite good in most parts of the country, covering them by June 19 except Northwest which has been the most affected,” Mohapatra said, also sounding a cautionary note regarding agriculture operation-sowing, transplantation, irrigation, and power supply in the region. Paddy transplantation in Punjab and Haryana happens mostly in July, when much rains are not expected in the first half. “Agriculture operations, sowing, irrigation facilities, and power requirements need to be monitored and regulated,” he said.Meanwhile, prevailing neutral El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions are likely to continue over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. But there is an enhanced possibility of the development of negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions over the Indian Ocean from July to September. Since sea surface temperature (SST) conditions over the Pacific and the Indian Oceans are known to have a strong influence on the Indian monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring their evolution, Mohapatra said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/seasonal-rain-expected-to-pick-up-in-northwest-only-around-july-10-imd-276765

He was booked for rioting and sedition by Delhi Police for Republic Day violence and has since been on the run. Police have announced a bounty of Rs 1 lakh to anyone who can provide information that could lead to his arrest.“I went with my friends to participate in the farm protest at Delhi borders only. On January 26, the farm unions communicated to conduct a march on the Ring Road only. There was no pre-planned programme to go to Lal Quila, but as everyone was in high spirits, I too went there with the flow of sangat,” he said.  He added that the fellow protesters who could not climb the flagpole to hoist the ‘Khalsa flag’ asked him (Jugraj) to climb the flagpole and then he agreed to do so. “Without considering its repercussions, I just did it out of ‘josh’. It was a bare pole with no flag on it, as was being wrongly projected earlier,” he said.When asked about Deep Sidhu who was charged as main conspirator, he said, “I had never heard about him or met him. We were a group of friends and were in high spirits then.”On June 30, SGPC awarded the family of Jugraj Singh. In a social media post, SGPC wrote, “SGPC honoured the family of Sikh youth Bhai Jugraj Singh who hoisted the Kesri Flag on Red Fort with Rs 1 lakh. SGPC member Bhai Manjit Singh handed over this appreciation amount to the family of Bhai Jugraj Singh.”On June 29, the Delhi Police had arrested Buta Singh (25) from Talwandi Sabo.

The trial court convicted Rauf under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), 392 (robbery) and 397 (causing grievous hurt in robbery) of the Indian Penal Code and section 27 (possession of arms) of the Indian Arms Act.Rauf subsequently appealed against the conviction, while the state government filed an appeal against the acquittal of Taurani.On Thursday, the high court dismissed the state government's appeal and upheld the acquittal of Taurani.The bench, however, upheld the conviction of Rauf and also the life sentence imposed on him, but quashed and set aside his conviction under sections 392 and 397."The acquittal of another accused Abdul Rashid Merchant is quashed. Rashid is convicted under sections 302, 120(b) of the IPC and section 27 of the Indian Arms Act. The accused is sentenced to life imprisonment. He is directed to surrender forthwith to the trial court or the D N Nagar police station," the high court said in its order.The bench also said Abdul Rauf Merchant would not be entitled to remission, considering his conduct during the trial."The appellant (Rauf) shall not be entitled to remission considering his criminal antecedents and in the interest of justice and public at large, he is not entitled to any leniency,” the court said.The court noted that after the killing, Rauf had absconded and was arrested only in 2001. "In 2009, he (Rauf) was granted furlough, but he did not surrender and had to be arrested in 2016 again,” the bench said.The court said if Rashid fails to surrender, then the sessions court can issue a non-bailable warrant.

02-07-2021||Ajay Banerjee||No infiltration across LoC after February ceasefire with Pak: Army Chief||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 1Four months after India and Pakistan announced to “strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire” along the LoC, Army Chief General MM Naravane on Thursday said there had been a marked change since the ceasefire agreement as there had been no infiltration from across the LoC and all parameters of violence had dropped.Speaking at a seminar, he touched upon the ceasefire understanding reached by Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan on February 26.He said there would be forces that do not want peace to prevail. Since the latest ceasefire all parameters of violence like terror incidents in the valley had come down, he said, adding that sporadic incidents had occurred.General Naravane, without referring to the recent drone attack on the air base at Jammu, said the offensive use of drones had changed the war scenario for the infantry, artillery or the armoured. Israel, he said, had credited its success against Hamas to artificial intelligence (AI).The Indian Army, he said, had identified technology that is being followed up. We showcased the capability of 75 pre-programmed drones of attacking ‘targets’. “We are working to operationalise this capability to work at varying altitudes and at longer ranges.”“AI is good but we have such peculiarities like unsettled land borders, so we need to have a mix-and-match option. We need to evolve as a technology-oriented Army but will have ‘boots on ground’ – a euphuism for having troops at important positions.He said the advent of drones and counter drone systems had radically altered the way we would fight future wars. “Drones can be easily accessed and used by both state and non-state actors. We have to factor this in as we make our plans. We are fully seized of the issue of making sure that we are not found wanting in this regard,” the General said.On China, the Army chief said the developments along our northern borders during the past year are a stark reminder that in order to preserve our territorial integrity the armed forces needed to continually prepare and adapt to the exigencies of modern wars.“It is in the backdrop of this contemporary security environment that I approach today’s topic ‘Applications of Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning’,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-infiltration-across-loc-after-february-ceasefire-with-pak-army-chief-276733

02-07-2021||New Delhi||Some European Union nations to permit entry to Covishield-vaccinated||Pressed by nations, including India, whose citizens have taken shots of Covishield vaccine, at least 10 European countries have decided to permit them entry.However, sources cautioned against panic and pointed out that the EU Covid digital certificate has a six-week phase-in period, meaning that it will be insisted upon by all EU nations for crossing their international borders sometime in mid-August.And, anyway a large number of them have still not opened their borders to Indians.The Serum Institute of India (SII), they pointed out, is confident that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will recognise the AstraZeneca doses made in India.It currently recognises AstraZeneca doses made in Europe, US, South Korea and China but not those manufactured by SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer.The EU digital certificate, which recognises only four vaccines and none of those produced in India, is recognised by all 27 EU member states plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.Of these 31 countries, nine have decided to accept Covishield, as and when they open their borders to citizens of countries hit by deadly Covid variants. India is one of the countries on the list.These countries are Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Spain, Switzerland and Estonia.India and the powerful 55-nation African Union have called upon the EU authorities to accept the Indian version of AstraZeneca vaccine called Covishield.A similar demand has been raised by some West Asian countries such as the UAE. These countries had received Covishield through commercial contracts or as part of a WHO sponsored vaccine distribution program called COVAX.The EU said it’s working to ensure its digital certificate is compatible with similar products in non-EU countries. If it is satisfied that a non-EU certificate complies with EU “standards and systems”, it can decide to accept it across all 27 nations plus four.At the same time, the government has told the EU that it plans to institute a reciprocal policy for recognition of the EU Digital Covid Certificate.If and when Covishield and Covaxin are included in the EU Digital Covid Certificate, India will reciprocally exempt the concerned EU member state from mandatory quarantine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/some-european-union-nations-to-permit-entry-to-covishield-vaccinated-276728

02-07-2021||Bengaluru||India’s Zydus Cadila seeks emergency use approval of Covid vaccine||Indian drugmaker Zydus Cadila said on Thursday that it had applied to the country's drug regulator for emergency use approval of its Covid vaccine, which showed a 66.6 per cent efficacy against positive cases in an interim analysis.The candidate, if approved, would become India's second successful home-grown Covid shot and help ease the country's severe vaccine shortage.Coronavirus cases in India have dropped from a devastating peak in April and May; however, experts warned of a third wave and reiterated that widespread vaccination remains one of the best defences against the pandemic.Zydus said the vaccine, which is a three-course regimen, showed safety and efficacy in a late-stage trial with more than 28,000 volunteers across the country, including about 1,000 subjects in the 12-18-year age group.The drugmaker said it is also evaluating a two-dose regimen for the shot and the immunogenicity results of the shorter course had been found to be comparable with the three-dose regimen."This will further help in reducing the full-course duration of vaccination," the drugmaker said, adding that it planned to manufacture up to 120 million doses of the shot annually.An approval for the vaccine, ZyCoV-D, would make it the fifth shot authorised for use in India. The country has already approved vaccines from Moderna, AstraZeneca and partner Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech, and Russia's Gamaleya Institute.Zydus said the study was carried out “during the peak of the second wave of Covid” in India and reaffirmed the vaccine’s efficacy against new mutant variants, especially, the Delta variant. However, it did not disclose efficacy rate against those variants. Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-zydus-cadila-seeks-emergency-use-approval-of-covid-vaccine-276694
