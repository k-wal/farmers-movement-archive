He had also invited Director of Delhi-based Tibet House Geshe Dorji Damdul for an interaction with representatives from civil society groups.“The 14th Dalai Lama is not a mere religious figure, but a political exile who has long engaged in anti-China separatist activities and is trying to separate Tibet from China,” Zhao said when questioned on Blinken’s meetings.China firmly opposes any form of contact between officials of any country and the Dalai Lama, he added. The last significant meeting was between then US President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama in Washington in 2016.“We urge the US to honour its commitment to stop meddling in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Tibetan affairs, and offer no support to Tibet independence forces to engage in anti-China separatist activities,” added Zhao.Blinken met representatives of the Dalai Lama about three weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly greeted the Dalai Lama on his 86th birthday.Significantly, Xi Jinping visited the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) earlier this month, the first Chinese President to do so after over 30 years.China has further riled Tibetan sensitivities by stating that it chose the successor to the Dalai Lama through drawing lots with candidates approved by the central government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-upset-over-us-secretary-of-state-blinkens-meeting-with-tibetans-290114
29-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to confer Bharat Ratna on Sunderlal Bahuguna||The Delhi Assembly unanimously passed a resolution on Thursday, urging the Centre to posthumously confer the Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian honour, on noted environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna.Participating in a debate on the resolution on the first day of the assembly’s Monsoon Session, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said although the House is passing this resolution, the entire country wants that the Bharat Ratna be conferred on Bahuguna.“I think it will be an honour for the Bharat Ratna if the highest civilian award goes to Bahuguna,” he said.Kejriwal pointed out that Bahuguna, who led the pioneering Chipko movement, not only protected the environment but also worked for many other social causes.Opposition BJP, too, supported the resolution.The chief minister had earlier written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard.Bahuguna’s life has been commemorated in the Vidhan Sabha premises and his portrait installed in the gallery, he said. “Bahuguna started working to protect the environment when he was just 13. He raised his voice against untouchability. He made hostels for Dalits. Like Babasaheb Ambedkar struggled to ensure entry of Dalits in temples, Bahuguna ji too kept struggling for that cause in his area. He worked towards the cause of de-addiction extensively,” Kejriwal said.“I am delighted that the entire house and all parties are unanimously passing this resolution. I hope the central government will pay heed to the demand of the country and honour Bahuguna. The resolution reads that he be honoured for his contribution to the environment. I feel that he has contributed to all spheres of life and was not only limited to the environment,” the chief minister added.The Chipko movement, started by Bahuguna at the foothills of the Himalayas in 1973, was a forest conservation movement in India. It later became a rallying point for many environmental movements across the world.

29-07-2021||New Delhi||BJP slams Left for attending Chinese embassy event; Left hits back||The presence of Left leaders at an online event organised by the Chinese embassy to mark the centenary of the Communist Party of China has triggered a row with the BJP accusing Left parties of having a long tradition of opposing the national interest and harbouring extraterritorial loyalties.The Left, however, defended the decision noting that the government itself is engaged with China on several issues and accused the BJP of raising it to divert attention from its government’s failures.The Chinese embassy said that it had organised an online seminar on July 27 to celebrate the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury, CPI’s D Raja, DMK MP S Senthilkumar and All India Forward Bloc’s G Devarajan were among those who attended and addressed it.BJP MP and its West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh hit out at the Left parties for attending the event at a time when India is engaged in a border standoff with China.He said he had seen communist agitations for decades and noted that they would raise slogans and carry out protests in support of Vietnam when the US had invaded it, and alleged that they also had loyalties towards Russia and China but not India.“They also have had extraterritorial loyalties. They used to say that China’s chairman is our chairman,” Ghosh told reporters.Taking a swipe at the Left parties, Ghosh said people have rejected them for these reasons and noted that they do not have a single Lok Sabha MP or MLA from West Bengal now despite ruling it for decades till 2011.Hitting back, Raja said no one should teach the communists about national interest.“The communists were in the forefront in fighting the British as well as the Portuguese. We made supreme sacrifices for the independence of the country... No one can challenge us. What was the role of the BJP, Jana Sangh or RSS in the fight for India’s independence? Now, they are raising this issue to divert attention from their failures in Parliament,” said Raja.Raja also said the government itself is engaged with China on several issues.“The government is participating in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, BRICS meetings and its economic cooperation with China is ongoing,” he said.CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the programme organised by the Chinese embassy had nothing to do with India-China relationship.“We have always supported the Government of India and the PM’s stand on China. The programme organised by the Chinese Embassy was on party building and for communist parties to understand each other. It had nothing to do with India-China relations,” said Yechury.

29-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt to take over management of top private school for ‘arbitrary’ fee hike||The Delhi government will take over the management of a top private school in Rohini over alleged arbitrary fee hike and has received the required approvals from the lieutenant-governor’s office, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Thursday.“Delhi government had issued orders several times to withdraw the arbitrarily increased fees by the school, but the school management has failed every time to comply with these orders. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had approved the proposal of the DoE to take over the management of Bal Bharati School. This file was sent to the LG, which has now been approved,” Sisodia said.“If any school increases fees arbitrarily then strict action will be taken against them,” he added in an official statement.In its reaction, the school said it was yet to receive any communication from the DoE and asserted that it has always functioned within the provisions of the Delhi School Education Act and Rules (DSEAR) and followed all court judgements.“We are getting to know about all this only through media. We are yet to receive any communication from the DoE and will consider the entire issue once we receive any direct communication,” Principal Geeta Ganwani said.“Bal Bharati Public School has always functioned within the provisions of DSEAR and followed all the judgements given by Hon’bl High Court of Delhi on related issues in the past and will continue to do so in future also. We will like to assure parents of our students that we will always protect the interests of our students,” the principal added.According to DoE officials, the department had conducted an in-depth inspection of the financial statements of Bal Bharati School for the financial years 2016-2017 to 2017-2018.“During the detailed inspection of the records, it was found that the total funds with the school for the year 2017-2018 were Rs 23.81 crore. Out of this amount, Rs 20.94 crore was estimated to be spent. Even after spending Rs 20.94 crore the school management had a net surplus of about Rs 2.87 crore.“After this, the Directorate of Education came to the conclusion that there is no need for the school management to increase the fees. In this regard, the DoE refused to accept the fee hike proposed by the school for the academic session 2017-2018,” a senior DoE official said.The official further noted that apart from this, the fees increased by the school in 2017-18 had to be adjusted further. But, in the meantime, the Delhi government again received complaints from the parents that the school had increased the fees several times in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and further asked them to deposit arrears.“Consequently, we issued a notice to the school on May 10, 2019 asking why the recognition of the school should not be cancelled or why the government should not take over the management of the school. The reply received by the school was not satisfactory.“In view of this situation, the Delhi government has decided to initiate the process of taking over the management of the school, and the file was sent to LG for approval. This file was therefore approved by LG and further proceedings are in progress,” the official added.The Delhi government had yesterday approved taking over of management of Apeejay School in Shekh Sarai over the same issue. The school management had denied all charges and maintained that the matter is sub-judice.

29-07-2021||New Delhi||‘Kisan Sansad’ discusses one of 3 agri laws, passes resolution demanding its repeal||The ‘Kisan Sansad’ being held by farmers at Jantar Mantar here on Thursday held discussions on one of the three agri laws against which they have been protesting for over eight months and demanded its repeal, terming it “unconstitutional”.On the sixth day of the ‘Kisan Sansad’, the farmers passed a resolution to repeal the Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act that was introduced last year, according to a statement by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions spearheading the protest.The protesters said the act was “unconstitutional and pro-corporates”.“The ‘sansad’ unanimously rejected the ‘Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020’ as being unconstitutional, anti-farmer and pro-corporate, and declared that the act stands repealed.“It was resolved that the act is meant for resource grabbing by corporates from farmers, and was in fact brought to promote corporate farming,” the SKM statement said.During the ‘sansad’, the farmers pointed out how various sections of the legislation showed that it exempted corporations from regulatory purview of various laws, while it did not provide any protective provisions to farmers who enter into contract farming.The ‘Kisan Sansad’ that is being held parallel to the Parliament’s Monsoon Session is part of the latest strategy of the farmers who have been protesting the Centre’s three contentious agri laws at multiple Delhi borders since November last year.The farmers have been protesting the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The farmers have expressed fear over the laws which they say will eliminate the Minimum Support Price system, and leave them at the mercy of the big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.As part of these ‘Kisan Sansad’ sessions, 200 farmers from the protest sites participate in a mock Parliament session at Jantar Mantar during which issues concerning the farming community are discussed.The ‘Kisan Sansad’ also resolved and appealed to the President of India to ensure that “the supremacy of Parliament remains intact”.“The Narendra Modi-led BJP government has failed miserably to conduct the Parliament proceedings according to rules and constitutional provisions during this government’s tenure.“People’s anguish, pain and pressing issues, including of life and death matters, were not allowed to be discussed in both Houses of Parliament,” the SKM statement said.

China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation,” it said.On the joint press release making a reference to the “so-called” China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Bagchi said, “We have consistently conveyed to both China and Pakistan that the so-called CPEC is in India’s territory that has been illegally occupied by Pakistan.’’“We resolutely oppose any attempts by other countries to change the status quo in areas illegally occupied by Pakistan as also to Pakistan bringing up any material change in Indian territories under its illegal occupation. We call upon parties concerned to cease such actions,” he said.Speaking further on Pakistan’s attempt to bring about “material changes”, the MEA spokesperson described the elections in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir as “nothing but an attempt by Pakistan to camouflage its illegal occupation and the material changes undertaken by it in these territories”.India has lodged a strong protest with the Pakistani authorities on this “cosmetic exercise”, which has been protested and rejected by the local people.“Such an exercise can neither hide the illegal occupation by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation, and denial of freedom to people in these occupied territories. Pakistan has no locus standi on these Indian territories. We call upon Pakistan to vacate all Indian areas under its illegal occupation,” Bagchi observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-opposes-kashmir-reference-cpec-in-china-pak-joint-statement-290091

29-07-2021||New Delhi||‘Some elements’ reducing parliamentary panel on IT to ‘ping pong match’: Tharoor||With the BJP members of a parliamentary panel opposing his decision to question government officials on the Pegasus row, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who heads the committee, took a swipe at them on Thursday, saying “some elements” have chosen to reduce it to a “ping pong match” that is not in the spirit of Parliament.Asked about reports of BJP MP Nishikant Dubey moving a “privilege motion” against him, Tharoor told reporters that it has no “validity” as no constituted procedure was followed in introducing the motion that requires the Speaker to get the leave of the House before it can be introduced.Hitting back, Dubey said the Congress MP is unaware of the rules and has gone into “frustration” as he is focussed more on becoming the leader of his party in Lok Sabha in place of Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.Official sources said Dubey has moved a “privilege notice” in the Speaker’s office against Tharoor for allegedly misusing his power as the head of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Technology. It will be for Speaker Om Birla to decide the fate of the notice.The panel that was set to question government officials on Wednesday on the Pegasus spyware issue was postponed due to lack of quorum.BJP members of the panel who were present in the meeting room didn’t sign the attendance register in protest leading to a lack of quorum required for holding the meeting.Tharoor said he was very disappointed with the development.“I am very disappointed that some elements on some issues have chosen to reduce this committee to some sort of a ping pong match which I dont believe is in the spirit of Parliament or parliamentary committee,” he said.Asked about divisions among the panel’s members along political lines, the former union minister noted that when he was the chairman of the parliamentary committee on external affairs for five years where its members worked in an extremely amicable and cooperative spirit. That committee also had a strong BJP majority, he added.He also expressed his ignorance about Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra allegedly calling Dubey a “Bihari gunda” when the panel members had assembled for the meeting.“How can I tell you about a meeting which never happened? I am completely unaware if somebody allegedly said something at a meeting that never took place to somebody who was not there. How am I to be concerned about it?” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/some-elements-reducing-parliamentary-panel-on-it-to-ping-pong-match-tharoor-290065

The strategy is to showcase maximum content across screens to meet the pent-up demand. So, with big-ticket Bollywood and Regional films awaiting announcement by producers and internationally released Hollywood content as cinemas open up post the second wave, we expect the movie going habits to return among patrons,” he said in a statement.“The focus now will be to encourage vaccination alongside introducing our new offerings as we begin to win back the confidence of our audience back to big screen entertainment,” he added.In addition to vaccinated staff, PVR will continue to maintain stringent hygiene protocols, social distancing and food safety measures, along with minimal human contact across all touch points.Chequered seating with only 50 per cent occupancy as per state government protocols, social distancing marked queuing, digital contactless transactions, operating 50 per cent of the restroom facilities, installation of fibre and glass shields and regular sanitisation of its premises are some of the safety initiatives that it follows.The company has also motivated its staff to come forward and vaccinate themselves and their dependents by reimbursing the cost of vaccination following the national vaccination drive to ensure they are 100 per cent vaccinated before cinemas reopen.Gautam Dutta, CEO of PVR Limited, said the company is excited to welcome customers back to theatres and offer them the “real cinema experience”.“It is a very heart-warming development for us and ensuring the safety and security of our customers and employees is our foremost responsibility.

29-07-2021||Guwahati||All you need to know about Assam’s border disputes with NE states||The division of Assam and creation of the predominantly tribal states of Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh left a residue of boundary problems, which continue to bedevil relations between the neighbours.Each of Assam’s border disputes has its own legacy of claims and counter-claims:  Meghalaya: The problem between Assam and Meghalaya started when the latter challenged the Assam Reorganisation Act of 1971, which gave Blocks I and II of the Mikir Hills or present-day Karbi Anglong district to Assam. Meghalaya  contends that both these blocks formed part of the erstwhile United Khasi and Jaintia Hills district when it was notified in 1835. At present there are 12 points of dispute along the 733-km Assam-Meghalaya border.Meghalaya bases its case on survey maps of 1872 and 1929 and certain notifications of 1878 and 1951 while Assam wants to go by the recommendations of the Churachand Committee which in turn has been rejected by Meghalaya. Joint surveys of the disputed border segments have been undertaken in part and the Chief Ministers of both the states are scheduled to meet again on August 6 at Guwahati to discuss ways to resolve the dispute.Arunachal Pradesh: Arunachal’s grievance is that the re-organisation of North Eastern states, unilaterally transferred several forested tracts in the plains that had traditionally belonged to hill tribal chiefs and communities to Assam. After Arunachal Pradesh achieved statehood in 1987, a tripartite committee was appointed which recommended that certain territories be transferred from Assam to Arunachal. Assam contested this and the matter is before the Supreme Court.Mizoram: Prior to 2020, though a border dispute existed, the situation along the Assam-Mizoram border had remained relatively calm, barring a few instances in 1994 and in 2007. Following a border incident 2007, Mizoram declared that it does not accept the present boundary with Assam and that the inner line of the Inner Line Reserved Forest as described in the 1875 notification under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation (BEFR) of 1873 should be the basis for delineating the border and not the 1933 district boundary demarcation which Assam wants to be enforced.Following recent violence in which seven people, including six policemen, were killed, Assam government has said that it will file a suit in the Supreme Court.Nagaland: The longest-running border dispute in the North East is between Assam and Nagaland, which began soon after Nagaland became a state in 1963. The Nagaland State Act of 1962 had defined the state’s borders according to a 1925 notification when Naga Hills and Tuensang Area (NHTA) were integrated into a new administrative unit. Nagaland, however, does not accept the boundary delineation and has demanded that the new state should also have all Naga- dominated area in North Cachar and Nagaon districts.Since Nagaland did not accept its notified borders, tensions between Assam and Nagaland flared up soon after the latter was formed, resulting in the first border clashes in 1965. This was followed by major clashes between the two states along the border in 1968, 1979,  1985, 2007 and 2014.The Assam government had filed a case in the Supreme to  resolve the border dispute and for a permanent injunction restraining Nagaland from encroaching areas within the constitutional boundary of Assam. In 2005, the Supreme Court instructed the Central government to constitute a boundary commission to settle various inter-state boundary problems in the North East.The Centre had earlier constituted two commissions, the Sundaram Commission (1971) and the Shastri Commission (1985), to settle the Assam-Nagaland border dispute. These commissions, however, failed to resolve the matter as the concerned states did not accept their recommendations.Inter-state borders:Assam-Arunachal Pradesh: 804.1 km bordering eight districts of Udalguri, Sonitpur, Biswanath, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Charaideo, Tinsukia and Dibrugarh.Assam-Mizoram:  The two states share a 164.6-km border between the Assam’s districts of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj, and Mizoram’s Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl districts Assam-Nagaland: The two states share 512.1 km bordering four districts of Sivasagar, Charaideo, Jorhat and Golaghat.Assam-Meghalaya: The two states share 884.9 km bordering West Karbi Anglong, Dima Hasao, Morigaon, Kamrup Metro, Kamrup Rural, Goalpara, Dhubri and South Salmara.

29-07-2021||Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh)||A pond where turtles thrive on devotion||In a nondescript corner of Kanpur, a pond near a Shiva temple has become home to a thriving turtle population.At a time when water bodies in India are either shrinking or vanishing, the pond surrounded by a concrete jungle in Kanpur is thriving mainly due to the religious beliefs of the Hindus.Hindu devotees ensure that nobody harms the turtles and visitors to the temple feed them regularly.Turtles are an endangered species and possessing or catching one is banned under India's Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.According to Rajesh Pathak a local resident, "The temple was built about 200 years ago and the pond is much older. There is a possibility that the turtles may also be very old but things are yet to be verified by a wildlife expert. Till date, no expert has visited the pond."According to him, some of the turtles have shells that are three feet long.Pathak says he once tried to lift them but found them too heavy. "Going by their size and weight, I think they are quite old," he said.Pathak is not sure about the number of turtles in the pond. "There may be hundreds in number," he said.The surface of the pond looks blackish green and going by the colour, it is hard to believe that the pond supports a rich aquatic life.The turtles have started responding to human voices. On Tuesdays, a large number of devotees gather at the pond because Tuesday is considered an auspicious day for feeding turtles.The people shout, "Aah, aah, aah...."Ripples break the calmness of the surface. Then, there is some disturbance on the surface close to the bank. Finally, with a splash, a turtle appears, perhaps the biggest and the boldest one -- its pink mouth wide open.It hungrily devours the cottage cheese that people are offering. Soon, another one appears. Then, a third. In less than a minute the bank is lined with turtles.Once the stock of cottage cheese gets exhausted, people start throwing loaves of bread at them. But the turtles have apparently developed a taste for cottage cheese and ignore the bread.One by one, they start returning to the depths of the pond and soon the surface is once again calm."The turtle is much revered in the Hindu mythology. It is mentioned in some texts that the earth rests on the back of a giant turtle. In some, it is written that the turtle is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Many Hindus believe feeding turtles will help them in getting salvation. Hence people feed them," said Pathak."Whatever may be the reason, it is good that if the people are feeding the turtles. Try to imagine what would happen if people stop feeding them. They may starve to death," he added."It is not unusual if a small turtle sneaks into a home but it is safely returned to the pond," said Pathak.In the past, some people have tried to poach the turtles but were chased away by locals.A retired forest official said a turtle population flourishing in a pond in a straggling, unplanned city was no less than a miracle."Where in Kanpur can a person today see a turtle? Either in the zoo or in the Ganga," he said."Once, Kanpur had hundreds of ponds. Most of them have disappeared over the years. But if there is a pond that supports a big population of turtles, then it is something very unique. And we must remember that till date no government or any organisation has protected the pond or the turtles. Still, both have survived for such a long time. Steps must be taken to preserve the pond and the lives in it," the official added.Rain is the only source of water for the pond at present. Pumps are installed that draw water from the ground and fill the pond. The water level in the pond will then remain constant throughout the year," said Pathak.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-pond-where-turtles-thrive-on-devotion-290037
29-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly passes resolution against Rakesh Asthana's appointment||The Delhi Legislative Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution against the Centre's decision to appoint Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner.Questioning his appointment, AAP legislators raised this issue under rule-55 of the Delhi Assembly on the first day of its monsoon session. Sanjeev Jha, AAP MLA, who was the first to speak, said appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the new Delhi POlice Commissioner was the "violation of a Supreme Court judgment"."In 2019, the SC ruled that no officer with less than six months of tenure left should be named for a top job. In fact, Asthana was the front-runner for being the CBI Chief in May, 2019, but was dropped after the top court pointed the same in its ruling," said Sanjeev Jha, who is MLA (AAP) from Burari.Two other AAP legislators who spoke on this issue in the Assembly were Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, Somnath Bharti and Satyendar Jain.Leader of Opposition and senior BJP leader Ramveer Singh Bidhuri, however, defended the Centre's decision highlighting several extraordinary works done by Asthana during his long service tenure, saying he was once given the President award in 2009."This House must welcome Rakesh Asthana as Delhi police commissioner. His service period and works have set an example in this country. He will work for the betterment of Delhi. Those who are honest should not worry from Asthana's appointment because he takes tough action against those who are corrupt," Bidhuri said.The Union Home Ministry announced the appointment of Asthana as the new Delhi Police Commissioner on Tuesday evening, three days before his retirement as the Director-General of the Border Security Force (BSF). — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-assembly-passes-resolution-against-rakesh-asthanas-appointment-290036

Shilpa and Ripu are the promoters of Viaan Industries.The order follows a probe conducted between September 2013- December 2015 to ascertain violation of Prohibition of Insider Trading (PIT) norms by the entities.In October 2015, Viaan Industries made a preferential allotment of 5 lakh equity shares to four persons and 1,28,800 lakh shares each, amounting to Rs 2.57 crore each, were allotted to Ripu and Shilpa in the allotment.In this regard, they were required to make timely requisite disclosure to the company in terms of PIT norms since the transactions exceeded Rs 10 lakh in value."It is on record that the relevant disclosures under the PIT Regulations were made by the Noticees with a delay of more than three years," Sebi noted."Therefore, considering these facts and circumstances, I hold that this case deserves imposition of monetary penalty upon the Noticees," said adjudicating officer Suresh B Menon in an order.

The application is dismissed as withdrawn,” the court said.Chawla had moved the application seeking that her lawsuit against 5G roll out be declared “rejected” instead of “dismissed”.Chawla's counsel argued that the plaint, which “never went up to the level of suit”, could only be rejected or returned in terms of the Civil Procedure Code, and not dismissed.The court had then also granted a week's time for deposit of Rs 20 lakh costs after Chawla decided to not press the application for its waiver. Application for refund of court fees was also withdrawn by Chawla. In June, the court had described the lawsuit by Chawla and two others against 5G roll out as "defective", "abuse of process of law" and filed for "gaining publicity" and dismissed it with costs of Rs 20 lakh.Justice J R Midha said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was "not maintainable" and was "stuffed with unnecessary Scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments" which are liable to be struck down.The court said the suit filed by actress-environmentalist and others was to gain publicity which was clear as Chawla circulated the video conferencing link of the hearing on her social media account which resulted in the repeated disruptions thrice by unknown miscreants who continued disruptions despite repeated warnings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/juhi-chawla-withdraws-hc-plea-over-dismissal-of-her-suit-against-5g-roll-out-290016

Before that, BJP's Devendra Fadnavis was the chief minister for five years.Shukla had moved the HC, challenging an FIR filed by the Mumbai police's cyber cell in a case of illegal phone tapping and alleged leaking of sensitive documents related to police postings.She is currently serving as additional director general of the Central Reserve Police Force's (CRPF) South Zone and is posted in Hyderabad The alleged tapping of phones had taken place when Shukla headed the Maharashtra intelligence department.BJP leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had cited a letter purportedly written by Shukla to the then DGP about alleged corruption in police transfers.The letter also had details of intercepted calls, leading to an uproar with leaders of the Shiv Sena-led ruling coalition alleging that Shukla tapped phones without permission.Before the registration of the FIR, Sitaram Kunte had alleged in a report submitted to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that it appears that Shukla herself had leaked the confidential report (to Fadnavis).

29-07-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||2 arrested for 'deliberately' killing judge in Jharkhand road accident; matter raised in SC||Two people were arrested after an Additional District Judge (ADJ) of Dhanbad district died after being hit by a vehicle while he was out for a morning walk, reports NDTV.The driver of a tempo that hit the judge has been arrested along with an associate, NDTV quoted the police as saying.The Supreme Court Thursday said the Chief Justice of Jharkhand High Court has already taken up the matter related to the alleged killing of a judicial officer of Dhanbad and concerned officers in the case have been asked to be present before it.A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant said this after senior advocate Vikas Singh, who is also the president of Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), mentioned the matter and said this is a “brazen attack” on the independence of the judiciary.Singh said the investigation in the case must be entrusted to the CBI as the killing of a judicial officer, apparently for not granting bail to a gangster is an assault on the judicial system.“We are aware of the incident and we appreciate the efforts of SCBA. I have spoken to the Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court. He has taken up the case and has asked the officers to be present there. The matter is going on there. Leave it there,” the CJI told Singh.Interference by the apex court in the matter at this stage may not be necessary as the high court has already taken it up on the judicial side, the bench said.Singh, while saying that video of the incident was also shot, told the bench that if somebody is killed for not granting bail to a gangster, then there will be “no judiciary in the country”.On Wednesday morning, a judicial officer was killed in Jharkhand's Dhanbad district after being hit by a vehicle, police had said.District and Sessions Judge-8 of Dhanbad court, Uttam Anand, was out on a morning walk when the incident happened at Randhir Verma Chowk near the district court in the Sadar police station area, a senior police officer had said.Around 5 am, a vehicle hit him from the rear and fled, Senior Superintendent of Police Sanjiv Kumar had said.The judge was found to be lying in a pool of blood by an auto-rickshaw driver, who took him to the Shahid Nirmal Mahto Medical College and Hospital where he succumbed to the injuries, the officer had said.Prior to mentioning the matter before the CJI-led bench, Singh mentioned it before a bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud.Singh termed the incident “shocking” and said the apex court should take cognisance of the matter.Justice Chandrachud told Singh to mention the matter before the CJI.When Singh said mentioning may not be allowed before the CJI, Justice Chandrachud assured him that he would use his "good office" to bring the matter to the notice of the CJI.After mentioning the matter before the CJI, Singh appeared before Justice Chandrachud-led bench to argue another case that was listed for hearing.Justice M R Shah, who was part of the bench headed by Justice Chandrachud, asked Singh why was the video of the incident was shot as it could be used as evidence.Singh said persons involved in this wanted to terrorize people by shooting the video.  “This is tyranny. This was brazen and they wanted to terrorize people. The video is not shot from any CCTV cameras but from a video camera as people can be heard talking and it was even zoomed in several times,” he said.When Justice Shah said what could be the reason behind the incident, Singh said the judicial officer had passed unpleasant bail order against some gangster."Anyway, I have mentioned this before the CJI, who said that he has talked to the Chief Justice of Jharkhand High Court. The chief justice of high court is taking up the matter on the judicial side," Singh said. --with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-arrested-for-deliberately-killing-judge-in-jharkhand-road-accident-matter-raised-in-sc-290004

Placards were also held by some of them."Khela Hobe," chants were also part of the slogans, including against the Union government.They ignored repeated warnings by Deputy Chairperson Harivansh Singh, presiding over the proceedings, of action against those blowing whistle."Using a whistle is against the decorum and dignity of the House. The Members will be named," Harivansh Singh said.The Treasury Benches and the NDA MPs, however, continued with Question Hour with an apparent air of nonchalance. The Ministers of External Affairs, Women and Child Development and The Tribal Affairs, S Jaishankar, Smriti Irani and Arjun Munda, respectively, among others, fielded supplementaries regarding their ministries.This frayed the tempers among the Opposition Benches, resulting in more tenor and texture to their intensified slogans.The Members were more strident when Irani was on her feet. She said the present government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was most attuned to the welfare of children and women.With the House in disorder, Harivansh Singh reminded the Members of its resolution passed by it which reinforced the idea of its proper functioning. This too had no effect, he adjourned the House amidst the chaos.Earlier, House Chairman Venkaiah Naidu had adjourned the House after the customary laying of papers on the Table.The Opposition Benches erupted in protest immediately after Naidu announced that he had turned down their notices given to him under Rule 267.The rule enjoins suspension of the other businesses of the House for a discussion on an emergent issue.The notices were for discussion on the alleged Pegasus spy case on which the Opposition Members.The Opposition benches have been adamant for a discussion, which has become a sticking point between them and the government.Before the adjournment, Naidu remonstrated with the protesting Members not to force themselves on the House.The Members, who were up on their feet, ignored the Naidu's to maintain discipline.They wanted to raise a point of order to oppose the rejection of their notices."There can be no point of order on disorder," Naidu said in the context of ruckus in the House.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-adjourned-till-2-pm-amid-protests-by-opposition-members-289998

Money was further siphoned off through multiple layers by a complex web of group entities,” the source added.The ED had raided several premises linked to Gehlot and several others on July 31 last year.Gehlot is also being probed by the CBI.The Punjab and Haryana High Court had directed the CBI to probe the case for the alleged illegal construction of a commercial building on approximately 18.98 acres of land in Gurugram by blatantly flouting the building by-laws and statutory provisions in collusion with others.It was alleged that the land where the Ambience Mall was built was meant for a housing project.The CBI has registered a case against a private person, Gehlot, Ambience Ltd and Ambience Developers and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and unknown officials of HUDA, Town and Country Planning Department and unknown private persons on the orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.The ED and CBI had carried out searches at several locations of Gehlot last year.

Three bundles of papers were flung at the chair, at us, at the media. Is this right or wrong? You don’t even want to apologise? Is this the way to behave?”Earlier, the Speaker said the House would have to collectively decide how to preserve its majesty.“Indian Parliament is accountable to people. You are not just individuals, you are institutions. If you feel right, let’s together decide to work on ways to raise the dignity of the House.Some MPs are repeating unparliamentary acts, acts that undermine dignity of the House. If this doesn’t stop I would need your help to act against such MPs,” said the Speaker.Earlier, the Government asked the Speaker for action against the errant MPs unless they apologised.Adhir, however, said, “To maintain dignity of the House all parties are cooperating and because of that you are able to talk of parliamentary dignity. We have made a record of productivity of the House under your chairmanship. You are seeing that due to arrogance of the government we are unable to speak in the House.”The government told the opposition to keep matters of agenda separate for discussion in the business advisory panel and take responsibility for their conduct on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-even-want-to-apologise-for-misconduct-govt-asks-opposition-289977

India will again preside over the Council in December next year, the last month of its two-year tenure. A feeling of great pride and humility as I take my place in the @UN #SecurityCouncil as PR of #India.#IndiainUNSC @MEAIndia pic.twitter.com/QxzAlUgheT  “India has consistently kept the spotlight on combating terrorism, both inside the Council and outside as well," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti told PTI in an interview. "We have not only strengthened the efforts to combat terrorism, especially for example in the financing of terrorism, we have also prevented efforts to dilute the focus on terrorism,” he said.During its Presidency, India will focus on the themes of maritime security, peacekeeping and counter-terrorism and preside over high-level signature events on these issues.Tirumurti stressed that in the Security Council, India has highlighted terrorism-related issues and “will also host a signature event during our Presidency in the context of the Secretary-General's report on ISIL/Da'esh.” The next report of the Secretary-General on the threat posed by ISIS (Daesh) to international peace and security is expected in the coming days. Earlier this year, India had said that the Secretary General's report on ISIL should also cover activities of proscribed terrorist entities under ISIL and Al Qaeda Sanctions regime like Lashkar-e-Taiba and other Pakistan-based terror groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad and frontal organisations that raise funds for their activities. “The world is fully aware that these groups also perpetrate terrorist activities from safe havens in Pakistan, including through violent attacks in Afghanistan that have disrupted the peace process," Tirumurti had said in February during a Security Council briefing when the UN body had considered the 12th report of Secretary-General on the threat posed by ISIL (Da'esh) to international peace and security."We are also witnessing the relocation of terror groups to Afghanistan, especially in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, across the Durand line. To not name them in this report is doing a disservice as it gives only a partial and a biased view of the situation in the region,” he had said.The report had said that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan (ISIL-K) is currently assessed to have between 1,000 and 2,200 fighters in Afghanistan spread across several provinces and is expected to continue to target Kabul and provincial capitals in future attacks.Highlighting the role of India in recent months on terrorism-related issues, Tirumurti said that on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, India played an extremely active role in the shaping of the final outcome of the strategy. "We ensured that there was a stronger focus on threats posed by new financing methods and new technologies to support terror. We prevented countries from diluting the global fight against terrorism by dividing terrorists into “your terrorists” and “my terrorists” by introducing several sub-categories of terrorism,” he said.At the adoption of Resolution on 7th Review of Global Counter Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) this month, Tirumurti had said that it is essential for all member states to ensure that “we do not give the slightest opportunity to provide excuses or justification for terrorism, thereby diminishing our collective fight." India had also prevented attempts to dilute the fight by bringing in religious and other issues, he said, adding that during the High-Level Week on Counter-Terrorism, India and France along with the UN hosted an important side event on “Countering financing of terrorism”. In his remarks to the side event, Tirumurti had said that preventing terrorists from accessing financial resources is crucial to successfully counter the threat of terrorism. "India has been a victim of terrorism, particularly cross-border terrorism, over the last several decades," Tirumurti had said.He noted that while some states lack the legal-operational frameworks and necessary capacities for countering the financing of terrorism, "there are other states that are clearly guilty of aiding and supporting terrorism, and wilfully providing financial assistance and safe havens to terrorists." In response to a question on whether there can be a briefing on the situation in Afghanistan under India's Council Presidency, against the backdrop of the US withdrawing its forces from the war-torn country ahead of the August 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden, Tirumurti said the situation in Afghanistan, especially the continuing violence, is a matter of deep concern. “As you know, for India, we would like to see an independent, neutral, unified, peaceful, democratic and prosperous Afghanistan. We have been calling for an immediate cessation of violence and to ensure that neighbours are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism," Tirumurti said."We have consistently underlined that the gains of the last two decades, especially with respect to women and minorities, should not be lost,” he said, adding that “I believe these are common concerns of members of the Security Council.” Tirumurti said there is, as such, no mandated meeting on Afghanistan in August, though there is one that is mandated for September. “However, we cannot discount the possibility of the Security Council meeting to take stock of the situation depending on how it evolves,” he said.

As the producer of 60 per cent of the world's vaccines, India is critical to the global fight against Covid, and if confirmed, I would work with India to end this devastating pandemic. And I commit to working with India and our partners to tackle the climate crisis,” Lu said in his testimony.Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that America's relationship with India is growing, bolstered by a vibrant Indian-American community here in the United States.“I expect our diplomats to deepen this relationship while remaining true to our core values and raising concerns as necessary. In Bangladesh, I continue to advocate for labour rights and the establishment of unions to ensure that workers in every sector can work in safe conditions,” he said.

States and UTs have been advised to expedite the construction of sanctioned houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated period,” MoS for Housing Kaushal Kishore said.The ministry said 45,70,834 of total sanctioned houses had been constructed in five years. That comes to 40.44 per cent of the target. Of over 45 lakh houses built, 40,393 are in Punjab, 42,158 in Haryana, 5,180 in HP, 9,340 in J&K, 6,475 in Chandigarh and 359 in Ladakh.In a related question on whether state governments had released the central assistance to eligible beneficiaries, the Centre said under the beneficiary-led individual house construction component, states and UTs are required to release central assistance along with state share within 15 days to implementing agencies, who should release funds to beneficiaries within 15 days.At the national level, 75 per cent of central assistance sent to states has been released to beneficiaries.

If you want to comply, do it wholeheartedly...I am giving you a long rope, but the court won’t do it forever,” Justice Rekha Palli said after perusing Twitter’s affidavits and posted the matter for further hearing on August 6.Giving you long rope, but not foreverI don’t know what your company wants to do. If you want to comply, do it wholeheartedly...I am giving you a long rope, but the court won’t do it forever. Justice Rekha PalliThe rules mandated appointment of a key managerial person or a senior employee as CCO, but Twitter appointed a “contingent worker” through a third party contractor, the court said, rejecting the company’s affidavit as “unacceptable”.“He (CCO) is categorical (in his affidavit) that he is not an employee. This itself is in the teeth of the rule. There has to be some seriousness about the rule. Some sanctity has to be given,” Justice Palli told senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, who represented Twitter.Poovayya said while the CCO was a contingent worker appointed via a third party contractor, he had undertaken to perform all functions and responsibilities under the IT Rules.Stating that the nodal contact person was yet to be appointed, he sought two weeks for the appointment.However, the court expressed reservations about use of the term “contingent worker” by Twitter in its affidavit especially when it was not clear who the third party contractor was.“File a better affidavit.

To claim an exemption from the application of criminal law would be to betray the trust which is impressed on the character of elected representatives as the makers and enactors of the law,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.“Consequently, acts of vandalism cannot be manifestations of the freedom of speech and can’t be termed as ‘proceedings’ of the Assembly. It was not the intention of the drafters of the Constitution to extend the interpretation of ‘freedom of speech’ to include criminal acts by placing them under a veil of protest. Hence, the Constitution only grants the members the freedom of speech that is necessary for their active participation in meaningful deliberation without any fear of prosecution,” it clarified.The order came on the Kerala Government’s petition seeking permission under Section 321 of the CrPC to withdraw cases against CPM leaders, including state Education Minister V Sivankutty, for alleged vandalism on the floor of the state Assembly in 2015, when the party was in the opposition.The Kerala Assembly had witnessed bedlam on March 13, 2015, as LDF members tried to prevent then Finance Minister KM Mani from presenting the state Budget.Must have time limit on arguments: SCFaced with protracted arguments and written submissions running into hundreds of pages, the SC has sought to streamline the process by prescribing a limit on time and number of pages. “How do we dispose of an appeal pending for 10 years? How do we justify to a litigant that suits that began 85 years ago are pending? Some of the current matters are given priority and they go on for hours,” a Bench said. tns||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-above-law-sc-rejects-kerala-plea-to-drop-cases-against-mlas-289600

Among the many issues the two looked at, Afghanistan, the Indo-Pacific and the Gulf were the most prominent. “It is essential that peace negotiations are taken seriously by all parties. Unilateral imposition of will by any party will never lead to stability nor indeed can such efforts ever acquire legitimacy,” noted Jaishankar.On Afghanistan, Blinken told his Indian interlocutors that the US would remain engaged in the country even after the troop withdrawal as it was concerned about the Taliban advances. “There are reports of them committing atrocities in Afghanistan. It’s deeply troubling. It certainly doesn’t speak well about their intention for the country,” he said.Calls on PM, discusses security with DovalBlinken took up issues related to security with NSA Doval and rounded up his engagements by calling on PM Modi.Meets Dalai Lama aide; Beijing bristlesUS Secy of State met civil society leaders, including Dalai Lama representative. He warned of threats to democracy, an oblique accusation slammed by China.Announces $25 mn to assist vax effortsBlinken announced $25 million assistance to support vaccination efforts in India.Jaishankar said a solution needed to be worked out through dialogue and not on the battlefield since a unilateral imposition of will could never lead to stability in Afghanistan.In a departure from his predecessor Mike Pompeo, Blinken touched on democracy and human rights with Jaishankar telling him that “it is the moral obligation of all polities to right wrongs done historically”.Apparently responding to criticism of the government’s actions on Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act, Jaishankar pointed out at a media interaction that “many of the decisions and policies fall in that category”.Blinken, in fact, had opened the day with a carefully curated set of civil society leaders. They included a representative of the Dalai Lama, Ngodup Dongchung, and Dr AK Merchant from the Bahai community which faces persecution in Pakistan. The US Secretary of State was careful in his responses to the media on human rights. “We recognise that every democracy starting with our own is a work in progress. When we discuss these issues, I certainly do it, from the starting point of humility. We have seen challenges our democracy has faced in the past and faces today. This is common to all democracies,” he observed.Blinken also met NSA Ajit Doval and discussed strategic issues related to security, defence, economic and technology. He rounded up his engagements by calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The leaders also discussed closer cooperation in the defence and security spheres. Jaishankar said another issue was the “expanding Indian footprint, be it in Africa, South-east Asia, Caribbean or the South-Pacific (that) has naturally broadened the shared agenda”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/few-relationships-globally-more-vital-than-us-partnership-with-india-says-blinken-289602

Since then, it continues to face technical issues. Practitioners claim the portal has not been working since its launch in June, the peak time of filing returns.Even as the deadline for filing the I-T returns is September 30, many want to file it well on time to avoid the last minute rush. There are others who want to avail home or other loans for which the latest ITR is mandatory. Also, taxpayers from whom excess TDS was collected usually file their returns early to get refund on time.Working on it: FMInfosys is closely working with the ICAI as well as the Finance Ministry. At least from what I hear, there is definitely a lot of improvement. —Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance MinisterSolution by next monthCBDT sources said the department expected the website to function normally by mid-AugKeshav Garg, a city-based tax practitioner, said, “Taxpayers, mainly those who need loans, are facing a tough time. They are unable to complete the paper work for processing of their applications.”“I couldn’t file my I-T return owing to technical glitches,” said Ravi Bhateja of Mohali. He said due to improper functioning of the portal, taxpayers were not even able to file reply to assessment notices.Sources claimed there were many taxpayers whose return for the previous year had not yet been processed. “The portal has major glitches even till date. Our work is severely hampered,” said another tax consultant. The sources said even the software provider on which CAs were dependent was not able to offer any solution. It seemed that there was a delay in releasing API (Application Programming Interface) by the department, they said. In 2019, Infosys was awarded the contract to develop the new I-T portal to reduce the time for processing returns from 63 days to one day and expedite refunds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/glitches-bug-income-tax-portal-users-harried-289610

29-07-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus fallout: IT panel meet put off after BJP MPs boycott, preventing quorum||The Pegasus snooping controversy cast its shadow inside and outside Parliament on Wednesday with the meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology scheduled to discuss the spying matter put off in the absence of the quorum after 14 BJP MPs of the 32-member panel refused to sign the attendance register.The BJP MPs led by Jharkhand’s Nishikant Dubey earlier today moved a notice of privilege against Congress’ Shashi Tharoor, who heads the IT panel, and expressed “no confidence in him”, urging Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to remove Tharoor.All 14 BJP members of the IT Panel signed the notice of breach of privilege Dubey submitted to the Speaker today.Dubey later said that Tharoor had violated all norms of parliamentary committee discipline by publicly talking about the agenda to be taken up by the panel even before the said agenda had been taken up and seen by the committee members.“Needless to say the gentleman has not only disrobed the democratic functioning of an august committee but also exhibited extreme high level of sycophancy towards his political masters who still have a false notion of ruling our country and its democratic institutions by destroying them bit by bit and also creating a ruckus through their cronies like the present chairperson of the Information and Technology Committee.”Tharoor recently wrote on Twitter and gave media statements saying Pegasus row would be taken up in the IT committee on priority. Dubey and other BJP MPs are arguing that Tharoor violated committee norms by speaking on record about committee proceedings which are meant to be secret.“Shashi Tharoor himself decides the agenda of the sitting of the committee and then breaks the news not with members of the committee but with the media and his Twitter handle.”Later today, Dubey and other BJP MPs went for the 4 pm meeting of the committee but returned without signing the attendance register and ensuring there was no quorum to hold the meeting.Also, officials of the Ministry of IT and Electronics that were summoned by the panel did not turn up due to various reasons.The BJP has cited “no confidence in Tharoor” demanding his removal.Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, member of the panel, said, “BJP MPs came to the IT committee and refused to sign the attendance register to deny a quorum, Further, all the witnesses called from Ministry of IT and Electronics and Home Ministry wrote in execuses and did not appear as called to testify. It is very clear that Pegasus is a no go area for this government.”@BJP4India members come to the IT Committee & refuse to sign the attendance register to deny a quorum. Further all the witnesses called from MiEIT & MHA wrote in excuses & didn’t appear as called to testify. It’s very clear that #Pegasus is a no go area for this government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-fallout-it-panel-meet-put-off-after-bjp-mps-boycott-preventing-quorum-289550
29-07-2021||New Delhi||There are few relationships globally that are more vital than one between US, India: Blinken||In reflection of growing bilateral ties between India and the US, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday held wide-ranging talks covering the situation in Afghanistan, Indo-Pacific engagements, Covid-19 response mechanism and ways to strengthen regional security.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets Jaishankar, civil society leaders At a joint media briefing, Blinken said there are few relationships in the world that are more vital than the one between the US and India. At the same time, he said as the world’s leading democracies, “we take seriously our responsibilities” towards freedom, equality and opportunity to all of “our people”.China bristles at mention of democracy during Blinken visit to India He said actions by India and the US shape the 21st century and beyond, and that is why strengthening partnership with India is one of the top foreign policy priorities of the US. Referring to Afghanistan, Blinken said both India and the US are committed to the proposition that there is no military solution to the conflict in that country, asserting that there has to be a peaceful resolution that requires the Taliban and the Afghan government to come to the negotiating table. “We both agreed strongly that any future government in Afghanistan has to be inclusive and fully representative of the Afghan people... Ultimately it has to be an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process,” he said. Blinken said India “has and will” continue to make a vital contribution to Afghanistan’s stability and development. On his part, Jaishankar said that the talks took place at an important juncture when key global and regional challenges needed to be effectively addressed. “Our bilateral partnership enhanced to a level that it enables us to deal collaboratively with larger issues,” he said. Jaishankar said the issue of the coronavirus pandemic was naturally a particular priority. “We discussed travel challenges resulting from Covid,” he said.“We looked at Afghanistan, Indo-Pacific and the Gulf region,” he added.On Afghanistan, Jaishankar said that the world wishes to see an independent, sovereign, democratic and stable Afghanistan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-are-few-relationships-globally-that-are-more-vital-than-one-between-us-india-blinken-289538
29-07-2021||New Delhi||‘I am not a political astrologer’: Mamata Banerjee on being Opposition’s face||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday remained ambivalent on being the face of the Opposition to take on the BJP, saying it will depend on the situation.“I want to help all the Opposition parties to bell the cat. I don’t want to be a leader, but a simple cadre,” she said on the leadership issue.“I am not a political astrologer. It depends on the situation, structure. I have no problem if someone else leads. When the matter is discussed we can decide. I cannot impose,” Banerjee told a select group of reporters here when asked if she would be the face of the Opposition.On the Pegasus row, she said the situation was more serious than Emergency and accused the Centre of being unresponsive.“Everywhere they are sending ED, IT for raids. Here there is no response. In a democracy, the government has to respond.“The situation is very serious, it’s more serious than the emergency,” the Trinamool Congress chief said.On Tuesday, Banerjee had said the unity of opposition parties will take shape on its own.“I am a simple worker and want to continue as a worker,” Banerjee, who is in the national capital for the first time after her party’s resounding victory in the assembly polls, said on Wednesday.“I want to see sachcha din, bahut din acha di dekh liya,” Banerjee added, in a jibe at the BJP’s poll slogan.

29-07-2021||Guwahati/Silchar||Assam-Mizoram border tense; bandh in Assam hits truck service to Mizoram||Mizoram is suffering a blockade of sorts as fear of possible violence at the border and protestors enforcing a bandh in Assam's Barak Valley have ensured trucks to the neighbouring state of Mizoram have halted way ahead of the inter-state border. Armed police forces of both states remain near the tense border, though officials on Wednesday confirmed they have been pulled back by at least 100 metres, in a bid to restore normalcy.Normal life in the three districts of Assam's Barak Valley too has been affected on Wednesday due to a 12-hour bandh called to protest the killing of seven people, including six policemen, in Monday's inter-state border between Assam and Mizoram police forces.Seven people have been killed and 50 others, including a district police chief, injured in a bloody clash along the Mizoram-Assam inter-state border on Monday.All business establishments remained closed and few vehicles plied on the roads of Assam's border districts of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj. Emergency services were, however, exempted from the purview of the Barak Valley bandh that began at 5 am.Train services also have remained unaffected so far, a spokesperson of the Northeast Frontier (NF) Railway said.The bandh, called by Barak Democratic Front (BDF) and supported by political outfits including opposition AIUDF and social organisations, was "total" though there was no report of any violence from any district, another official said.BDF Chief Convenor Pradip Dutta Ray said people had spontaneously extended their support to the bandh."We were compelled to call this bandh as our police personnel have died and there must be a permanent solution to the dispute…we do not want any more bloodshed," he said.Several social organisations in Hailakandi district blocked roads leading to Mizoram and launched an indefinite "economic blockade" to prevent the movement of goods-carrying trucks to the neighbouring state.The chief secretaries and director generals of police of Assam and Mizoram will hold talks over the issue in New Delhi during the day under the aegis of the Union Home Ministry.A seven-member Congress delegation, led by newly appointed state unit chief Bhupen Bora, was scheduled to visit the disputed boundary to review the prevailing situation.Hailakandi Superintendent of Police Ramandeep Kaur has been posted as the new Cachar police chief following serious injuries to incumbent Vaibhav Chandrakant Nimbalkar in the bloody inter-state border clash.Kaur will be replaced by Chirang police chief Gaurav Upadhaya, a notification issued by the Assam government said.Upadhaya will be replaced by Pranjit Bora, currently serving as the Guwahati Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic).Nimbalkar was airlifted to Mumbai for better treatment, while three others were shifted to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday.The death toll in the clash increased to seven on the previous day as critically injured Shyamprasad Dusat of the 6th Assam Police Battalion succumbed to his abdominal bullet injury at Silchar Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday night.Tension along the inter-state border in Cachar and Hailakandi districts has been escalating since October last year, with frequent incidents of burning of houses and encroachment of land.On October 22, 2020, high-level talks were held under the aegis of the Union Home Ministry where it was decided to maintain the status quo and resolve the dispute through discussions.However, tension flared up again in February and since then people had fled their houses near Gallacherra border outpost after two huts were burnt down.After a lull of a few months, a grenade was hurled on an Assam government team visiting the border by unknown attackers from Mizoram on July 10, while two back-to-back explosions were heard from across the border in the wee hours of July 11. Armed police from both sides were as a consequence posted at the inter-state border.A high-level meeting between officials of both the states, including the chief secretaries and DGPs, was also held in New Delhi earlier this month, to sort out the dispute.Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Shillong last week to hold a meeting of chief ministers of North Eastern states to try to sort out border disputes that they have.However, despite these moves firing between opposing police forces broke out on Monday.
