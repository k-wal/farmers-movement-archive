The same is evident from the Forensic Science Laboratory report. The said evidence gives credence to the prosecutrix’s case that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant,” the HC said.“It hardly matters...having regard to the evidence that there was no penile-vaginal intercourse. Fingering of the vagina also constitutes an offense under the law,” the high court said.

16-07-2021||New Delhi||No serious connectivity initiative can ever be a one-way street: Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday projected Iran’s Chabahar Port as a key regional transit hub including to Afghanistan and stressed that building connectivity is an act of trust and it must conform to international laws, sovereignty and territorial integrity.In an address at a conference on regional connectivity in Tashkent, he said connectivity projects must be based on economic viability and financial responsibility and they should not create “debt burdens”, in an oblique reference to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Referring to Afghanistan, Jaishankar said that for reliable connectivity within and through the country, the world must have confidence in its governance, noting that development and prosperity go hand-in-hand with peace and security.He said “politics, vested interests and instability” can be “formidable impediments” to regional cooperation and prosperity, asserting that no serious connectivity initiative can ever be a one-way street.The comments are seen as a veiled dig at Pakistan which has denied India transit access to Afghanistan.“The real issues are of mindsets, not of disputes. Blocking connectivity in practice while professing support in principle benefits no one. A one-sided view of trade rights and obligations can never work. No serious connectivity can ever be a one-way street,” he said.The conference on ‘Central and South Asia: Connectivity’ was hosted by Uzbekistan to significantly boost connectivity between the two regions. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and leaders from around 35 other countries attended the conference.In his remarks, Jaishankar listed practical steps taken by India since 2016 to operationalise the Chabahar port and described as a “welcome development” the formation of the India-Uzbekistan-Iran-Afghanistan Quadrilateral group on the joint use of the port.“This (the port) provides a secure, viable and unhindered access to the sea for Central Asian countries. Its efficacy is now clearly proven. We have proposed to include the Chabahar port in the framework of INSTC (International North-South Transport Corridor),” he said.Jaishankar said there was a need to address not just physical infrastructure but all its accompanying facets while expanding connectivity between Central and South Asia.“Tourism and societal contacts can create a fostering enabling environment. But, at the end of the day, building connectivity is an act of trust and must, at the minimum, conform to international law. Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity are the most basic principles of international relations,” he said.                         Jaishankar said that connectivity efforts must be based on economic viability and financial responsibility.“They should promote economic activity and not create debt burdens. Ecological and environmental standards, as also skill and technology transfers, are musts. Connectivity must be consultative, transparent and participatory,” he said.There has been growing global criticism of the BRI as Chinese financing has resulted in rising debt in several countries where infrastructure projects under the mega initiative are being implemented.India has critical of the BRI on the ground that it cannot accept a project that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity.Jaishankar said that for reliable connectivity within and through Afghanistan, the world must have confidence in its governance, noting that development and prosperity go hand in hand with peace and security.“Our connectivity deliberations expect predictability, efficiency and observance of norms of our time as its foundation,” he said.Jaishankar said economic growth is universally driven by “3Cs: connectivity, commerce and contacts”, adding all three need to come together to ensure regional cooperation and prosperity.“The challenge we face is that politics, vested interests and instability can be formidable impediments to its realization. There are lessons too from our experiences that need to be understood,” he said.“The real issues are of mindsets, not of disputes. Blocking connectivity in practice while professing support in principle benefits no one. A one-sided view of trade rights and obligations can never work. No serious connectivity can ever be a one-way street,” Jaishankar added.The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is a 7,200-km-long multi-mode transport project for moving freight among India, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia and Europe.“We are gathered here today in pursuit of a more prosperous and inter-connected Eurasia. To realise that, India stands ready to cooperate, plan, invest and build,” Jaishankar said.The conference extensively deliberate on practical ways to enhance connectivity with a larger aim of deepening trade, investment and people-to-people ties in the region.“Connectivity acquires a particular salience in the context of post-Covid economic recovery. It is itself an economic multiplier,” Jaishankar said.“But there is also a widespread realization of the need now for more resilient and reliable supply chains. This is not just a matter of production; it is equally a challenge of efficient logistics,” he said.“All of us need more and multiple options. And this applies to the domain of connectivity most of all,” he added.Jaishankar held talks with the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell Fontelles on the sidelines of the conference.“Nice to meet EU HRVP @JosepBorrellF. Agreed to consult closely on Afghanistan. Discussed challenges faced by EU and India. Noted the progress in our cooperation after the May 8 Summit,” he tweeted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-serious-connectivity-initiative-can-ever-be-a-one-way-street-jaishankar-284185
16-07-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC judge says he will not hold court till connectivity problems resolved||Taking a serious view of connectivity issues during hearings in the virtual mode, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya of the Calcutta High Court on Friday said unless such technical glitches are resolved completely, he will not be part of such hearings.Justice Bhattacharyya directed the central project coordinator to show-cause in writing by 3 pm on Friday as to why criminal contempt proceedings should not be drawn up against the High Court Administration over disruptions in virtual court hearings.Asserting that he was stopping short of issuing a Rule of Contempt to give a last chance to the High Court Administration to rectify the faults in connectivity, Justice Bhattacharyya directed that the matter be listed on Saturday for passing further orders.“I categorically refuse to be a part of such circus because I have taken oath to deliver justice to the litigants, who are outside the courtrooms and beyond the reaches of the air-conditioned rooms accommodating the judges and toiling in the sun and the dust outside,” Justice Bhattacharyya observed.Due to connectivity issues during the hearing of a matter, Justice Bhattacharyya observed that despite tall talks about achievements of virtual hearing facilities and restricting hearing of litigations entirely to virtual hearings, it is unfortunate that the court is unable to provide the minimum virtual services to ensure that justice is rendered appropriately.The judge said he felt ashamed that the esteemed Chartered High Court, which has an illustrious history, was being relegated to such insignificance that “we cannot render justice to the litigants at large due to mere connectivity issues”.“Sitting in court and playing dumb charades during virtual hearings with the advocates, due to major disruptions in virtual services, has become a joke by now and does not tantamount to adjudication of matters but is a mere circus show before the public.“I personally feel guilty, as a part of this court, since disruption and interference in functioning of courts, in whatever form, might amount to criminal contempt. I am a party to such act as a part of the showcase of judges who are adorning this court, including the Chief Justice,” Justice Bhattacharyya said in the order.Mentioning he will not sit in court till such time that the technical glitches are resolved in full, the Judge directed the Central Project Coordinator to ensure that the show-cause in writing is sent to his chamber during the day elaborating the issues disrupting connectivity in court.He directed that a copy of the response be communicated to the Acting Chief Justice (Acting), through his secretary as well as to the Registrar General of the high court.

16-07-2021||New Delhi||Prisoners released during Covid-19 second wave will not surrender until further orders: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered that prisoners, who were released by the high powered committees (HPCs) of states during the second wave of Covid-19 following its May 7 directions, will not be asked to surrender until further orders.The top court also directed the state governments and their HPCs to file within five days the norms or the guidelines being adopted by them in implementing the order on release of prisoners for decongesting jails during the second wave of the contagion.A three-judge special Bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana gave examples of Haryana and Tripura HPCs saying they have been considering aspects such as old age and co-morbidities of prisoners, besides other grounds, for releasing them.The top court also asked the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) to file a report after getting details from states’ HPCs about the norms followed by them in implementing the May 7 order.“So far as the prisoners, who have been released by the high-powered committees following the order, should not be asked to surrender back to jail till further orders,” the Bench said.At the outset, senior advocate Dushyant Dave, who is assisting the Bench as amicus curiae, said that he has been getting information from some lawyers that prisoners, who have been released pursuant to May 7 order during the second wave, are being asked to surrender back.Dave said the states be restrained from asking the released prisoners to surrender back for some time in view of the threat of third wave of the pandemic.“We have not reached that stage where people, who have been released, should be sent back,” the Bench said, adding that it wanted to know as to how it’s May 7 order has been implemented by states.The guidelines, being adopted by HPCs of states, should be uniform across the nation, it observed.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the HPCs should place the guidelines before the Bench.The Bench, which has now fixed the case for hearing on August 3, said that the litigants having “individual grievances” may give their applications to the amicus curiae for necessary action.On March 16, 2020, the top court had taken suo motu cognisance of overcrowding of prisons across the country and said it is difficult for jail inmates to maintain social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus.It, on March 23, 2020, had ordered all states and UTs to constitute high-powered committee (HPC) to consider releasing on parole or interim bail prisoners and the under trials for offences entailing up to 7-year jail term to decongest prisons in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.It had also directed states that the HPC shall consist of (i) Chairman of the State Legal Services Committee, (ii) the Principal Secretary (Home/Prison) by whatever designation is known as, (ii) Director General of Prison(s), to determine which class of prisoners can be released on parole or an interim bail for such period as may be thought appropriate.Later, the Bench headed by the CJI took note of “unprecedented surge” in Covid-19 cases again and on May 7 this year ordered the immediate release of prisoners who were granted bail or parole last year.It observed that the decongestion of prisons housing around four lakh inmates across the country is a matter concerning “health and right to life” of prisoners and police personnel.All those who were allowed to go out on bail in March last year by the high-powered committees of states and Union Territories be granted the same relief without any reconsideration to avoid delay, the top court had said.It had said the decongestion of prisons housing around four lakh inmates across the country is a matter concerning “health and right to life of” prisoners and police personnel.“Further we direct that, those inmates who were granted parole, pursuant to our earlier orders, should be again granted parole for a period of 90 days in order to tide over the pandemic,” it had said.

Nine bodies have been recovered,” said Sarang, who is also the district”s guardian minister. Asked how many people were still feared trapped under the rubble, he said it was difficult to ascertain.“I will leave the spot only after I am fully convinced that no one is trapped in the well,” he said.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced in the morning that families of the deceased will be given a financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh each, while the injured will be provided Rs 50,000 each and free medical treatment.According to local people, the well is around 50 feet deep and had about 20 feet of water.A teenage boy fell into the well on Thursday night.

16-07-2021||New Delhi||Amid speculations of his exit, BS Yeddiyurappa meets PM Modi||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday again sparked off speculations of his exit.Though the beleaguered CM, who has been at the receiving end of scathing attacks by disgruntled BJP leaders, denied any talk of change in leadership. Following his meeting with the PM, the 78-year-old was quoted as saying: “I don't know anything about leadership change. During my discussion with PM Modi, I requested him to permit to carry out development works in the state”.Notably, his arrival in Delhi along with his son BY Vijayendra on Friday triggered off a Tirath Singh Rawat (former Uttarakhand CM) type of exit for the Karnataka CM. However, pointing towards the photo of the meeting (where both leaders can be seen smiling), BJP leaders say any comparison between Yeddiyurappa and Tirath Singh was like a one between oranges and apples.Meanwhile, Yeddiyurappa said he is returning to Bengaluru on Friday. While in Delhi, he is expected to meet senior BJP leaders, including Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah. However, notes of discord in the Karnataka BJP continue getting louder with several leaders openly challenging his authority, facing little action from the party’s top brass.BJP's state in-charge, Arun Singh, in his last visit to the state, had told the warring MLAs to refrain from commenting on the party's affairs in open, warning action against any violation of party discipline.Sources say much of the anger against the CM stems from alleged interference in the administration by his son, BY Vijayendra. They add that the BJP leadership understands that continued restiveness may damage its prospects in the 2023 elections but to remove Yeddiyurappa is not so easy even though he is well past the unofficial 75-year age policy for ministers.Credited with the first-ever saffron government in the south, the BJP stalwart belongs to the Lingayat community which accounts for 17 percent of the state population. He also enjoys strong links with RSS and any attempt to antagonise him may jeopardise the party. In 2012, he split the state unit and formed the Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP). Though KJP won only six seats in the 2013 elections, Yeddiyurappa managed to get a vote share of 9.8 percent and restrict BJP to 40 seats in the 224-member Assembly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-speculations-of-his-exit-bs-yeddiyurappa-meets-pm-modi-284180
16-07-2021||United Nations||India condemns killing of photojournalist Danish Siddiqui in Afghanistan: FS Shringla at UNSC||India strongly condemns the killing of Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Danish Siddiqui in Afghanistan, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said at the UN Security Council on Friday as he expressed serious concern over the violence against humanitarian workers in situations of armed conflict.Speaking at the Security Council briefing on ‘Protection of Civilians in armed conflict: Preserving humanitarian space’, Shringla said the “Dharma-based norms” for armed conflict in ancient India had rules protecting civilians during conflict and in a “Dharma-yuddha”, civilians were not attacked but protected.He said in a “Dharma-yuddha” or “righteous war”, civilians were not attacked, but had to be protected.“The Dharma-based norms for armed conflict in ancient India were founded on the principle of humanity and humanitarian norms and had many rules protecting civilians during conflict. High importance was attached to distinguishing combatants and non-combatants during armed conflicts,” he said.“We condemn the killing of Indian photojournalist Danish Siddiqui while he was on a reporting assignment in Kandahar in Afghanistan yesterday. I extend our sincerest condolences to his bereaved family,” Shringla said.Siddiqui, 38, was on assignment in Afghanistan when he died. The award-winning journalist was killed while covering clashes between Afghan troops and the Taliban in Spin Boldak district of Kandahar city.He was injured on Thursday night while accompanying Afghan soldiers who were attacked and succumbed to his injuries on Friday.Siddiqui won the Pulitzer Prize in 2018 as part of the Reuters team for their coverage of the Rohingya crisis. He had extensively covered the Afghanistan conflict, the Hong Kong protests and other major events in Asia, Middle East, and Europe.Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani said he was “deeply saddened with the shocking reports” that Siddiqui was killed while covering the Taliban atrocities in Kandahar.“While I extend my heartfelt condolences to Siddiqui’s family and also to our media family, I reiterate my government’s unwavering commitment to freedom of speech and protection of free media and journalists,” Ghani said.Shringla said the humanitarian law principles found their existence in India long before modern humanitarian jurisprudence evolved.India has followed the path of ‘Dharma’ or ‘righteous conduct’ and provided refuge to persecuted people over centuries.“While international humanitarian law, as we see it today, has its genesis in the recent past, civilizations and cultures throughout history have developed rules of warfare for the protection of non-combatants and civilian populations,” he said, adding that the world today is engulfed in a range of humanitarian crises.“Most of these are caused by armed conflicts that severely impact the lives of millions of innocent civilians. The Covid-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this situation,” he said.Shringla voiced serious concern over the violence against humanitarian workers in situations of armed conflict.Extending condolences to the families of the 99 humanitarian workers who were reported to be killed over the last year, he said India strongly condemns attacks against humanitarian personnel and asserted that ensuring accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian law remains “one of the key challenges before us”.“States must accord high priority to addressing this issue. We should assist national authorities in developing capabilities and capacities to strengthen their national legal frameworks and related structures to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators,” he said.Shringla noted that the Member States must take all measures to implement Security Council resolutions 2175 (2014) and 2286 (2016) to ensure the protection of humanitarian personnel and actors.Resolution 2175 (2014) strongly condemns all forms of violence and intimidation, including “murder, rape and sexual assault, armed robbery, abduction, hostage-taking, kidnapping, harassment and illegal arrest and detention to which those participating in humanitarian operations are increasingly exposed, as well as attacks on humanitarian convoys and acts of destruction and looting of their assets”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-condemns-killing-of-photojournalist-danish-siddiqui-in-afghanistan-fs-shringla-at-unsc-284179

16-07-2021||Hyderabad||Telangana Congress chief arrested while protesting fuel hike||The Telangana Police on Friday cracked its whip to stop protesting Congress leaders including the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) President Revanth Reddy from protesting in front of the Telangana State Raj Bhawan. The Congress leaders who were protesting the hike in prices of diesel and petrol were detained and taken to Amberpet police station. They were following the direction of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) for organising a protest against the rising fuel prices. They named the protest “Chalo Raj Bhavan” and took out a rally from local Indira Park in the city.While the permission to protest was denied, the local police, however, allowed a gathering of 200 people at Indira Park following the Covid-19 restriction. The police even suggested submitting representations to the governor online.Revanth Reddy in his address to the Congress leaders and workers said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Telangana chief minister KCR were not with the common man. “Out of Rs 150 charged on petrol, taxes worth Rs 60 were going to the state or the central government”.Seeing adamant posturing by the Congress leaders, the Congress arrested Reddy and others as tension mounted in the area due to the defiance by the Congress leaders to give up the protest. They insisted on marching to the Raj Bhawan to submit a memorandum against the fuel price hike.Just as Reddy and others removed the police barricades and tried to force their way towards Tank Bund to reach the Ambedkar statue, police stopped them. This led to pushing and jostling between the two sides. The police then arrested the Congress leaders. Meanwhile, Sharmila, the founder of YSR Telangana Party and daughter of former  Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy launched a counter-attack on the Congress leaders accusing them of getting the name of the former chief minister into an  FIR after his death and forcing multiple cases of corruption on her brother and current Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.She said: "I reiterate, the reason for me to establish a party in Telangana is solely for the welfare of the people who have seen injustice at the hands of the current government. Unemployment has risen to an all-time high so have farmers' suicides in the state”. She said she would bring justice to the people on the vision of her late father.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-congress-chief-arrested-while-protesting-fuel-hike-284166

16-07-2021||New Delhi||Sparks fly between Imran Khan, Ashraf Ghani at Tashkent meet||The connectivity conference in Tashkent attended by almost all foreign ministers from Central and South Asia saw sparks fly between Pakistan and Afghanistan before both sides cooled the tensions with a meeting between their leaders Imran Khan and Ashraf Ghani.Khan and Jaishankar also crossed swords, though indirectly.In an indirect reference to the Pakistan Army’s obdurate stance on trade and connectivity with India, Jaishankar said the real issue is of mindsets not of disputes.Khan in his speech cited Kashmir issue as a major hindrance in connectivity projects.With the Pak PM on stage, Afghan President Ghani criticised Pakistan indirectly for not stopping terrorists from crossing over into Afghanistan and for failing to convince Taliban to move for meaningful talks.Imran, in turn, pointed out that the Taliban was not ready for a deal when there were 1.5 lakh NATO troops in Afghanistan.“Why would they compromise now? Why would they listen to us when they are feeling victory?” he posed while stating that over 70,000 Pakistanis have also been victims of terrorism.Although the Tashkent meet was primarily meant for foreign ministers, top leaders of both Pakistan and Afghanistan had landed there since the gathering was expected to carry on the discussions they had held over the previous two days in Dushanbe.The immediate casualty of the clash between Khan and Ghani was the proposed weekend peace conference in Pakistan that was to be attended by elements close to the Kabul regime.The Taliban had recused itself as it had held discussions several times with the Pakistanis.Better sense prevailed after the ministers had delivered their speeches. Khan and Ghani held a meeting at which the DG Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed was also present.Speaking at the meeting, Jaishankar wanted the Chabahar port to be included in the North-South Corridor which was the main topic of discussions. He also said for reliable connectivity within and through Afghanistan, world must have confidence in its governance.Describing connectivity efforts as an act of trust, he felt they must conform to international law, respect nations’ sovereignty and be based on economic viability.The inclusion of Chabahar port in the INSTC (International North–South Transport Corridor) framework would ensure a secure and unhindered access to sea for Central Asian countries, he said while welcoming the India-Iran-Afghanistan-Uzbekistan Working Group on joint use of Chabahar port.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sparks-fly-between-imran-khan-ashraf-ghani-at-tashkent-meet-284151
16-07-2021||New Delhi||Why video conference facility not for foreign inmates: HC asks prison authority||The Delhi High Court on Friday sought the presence of an officer from the prison authority before it in connection with issues faced by inmates and questioned as to why foreign national inmates were not allowed video conference facility to speak to their families.“Why video conferencing for families abroad is not done? You were permitting phone calls. You have to upgrade,” said Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a petition for prison reforms by two JNU students and Delhi riots accused, Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita.Advocate Gautam Narayan, appearing for Director General, Prisons, said that further assistance on this aspect and reasons behind the policy could be best explained by the officer concerned.“It cannot be a bald statement. Let a competent officer be asked to remain present,” he said.Taking note of the submission, the court said on the next date September 10, an officer conversant with the facts of the case be present on behalf of the respondent.                            Advocate Adit S Pujari, appearing for Narwal and Kalita, submitted that while several grievances raised in the matter have been addressed by the authorities, certain issues still needed to be looked into.“They have done a lot of things. What remain,” the court questioned as it noted that both of them have been released on bail.Foreign inmates are still not allowed video conferencing, physical mulaqaat (meeting) and permanent solution to dietary issues etc, Pujari said.The court granted him time to file his short response on the surviving issues.Narwal and Kalita were arrested last year in May in connection with the communal riots in north east Delhi.On June 15, the high court granted bail to them in the Delhi riots case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The petition was moved by them during their judicial custody to allow them and other inmates to have a choice of physical or virtual mulaqaats or meetings to communicate with family and friends as is provided under the Prison Rules of 2018.Delhi Police appeal against the bail order is presently pending before the Supreme Court.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24, 2020 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 700 injured.

Pregnant women and lactating women should receive it. Patients with cancer and diabetes are even more needy in this requirement and here is real life data to show vaccine effectiveness to prevent deaths is huge," Paul said."But we should also remember that not just vaccines, but we also need to mask up to prevent infection," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-vaccine-doses-given-to-police-personnel-successful-in-preventing-95-pc-covid-deaths-icmr-study-284146
16-07-2021||New Delhi||Rahul Gandhi moves into chatty, interactive Twitter zone, asks what people are reading||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday signalled a shift in his social media outreach, going from mostly commentative to conversational with this simple poser: “I'm wondering what you guys are reading these days?”Gandhi's communication on Twitter and maybe other social media platforms is set for a makeover and will get more interactive in the days to come, party insiders said. And the casual, informal question on Twitter is perhaps the first step towards that.Sources said the former Congress president, who has 19.3 million followers on Twitter, may in the next few days share on Twitter the books he is reading.Gandhi—who usually posts trenchant comments about the government, makes observations on news developments of the day, tagging articles of interest, or condoles the death of a known person—now wants his social media engagement to be more interactive, so his connect with people increases, the sources added.I’m wondering what you guys are reading these days.  Pratishtha Singh, a former Mahila Congress functionary, is playing a key role in reshaping his outreach on Twitter.The unfollowing of some Twitter handles, including of journalists and some of his staff, was also part of his social media revamp, the insiders said.On his birthday on June 19, Gandhi for the first time responded on Twitter to random people who wished him. He also replied to political leaders who had extended wishes to him on the social media platform.In less than an hour, Friday's open-ended question on what his followers are reading saw more than 13,000 likes and 2,200 comments – many trolling him and some responding earnestly with their book list.In the coming few days, more interactive engagements are in store from Gandhi's handle, the sources said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-moves-into-chatty-interactive-twitter-zone-asks-what-people-are-reading-284144
16-07-2021||New Delhi||Google team helps Apple, Microsoft fix zero-day bugs in browsers||Google researchers have discovered four zero-day vulnerabilities in Chrome browser, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari that might have put users' data at risk.After the vulnerabilities were disclosed by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Apple, Microsoft and Google quickly patched those bugs.Zero-day vulnerabilities are unknown software flaws. Until they're identified and fixed, they can be exploited by attackers."The four exploits were used as a part of three different campaigns. As is our policy, after discovering these zero-days, we quickly reported to the vendor and patches were released to users to protect them from these attacks," Google said in a statement."We assess three of these exploits were developed by the same commercial surveillance company that sold these capabilities to two different government-backed actors," the company informed.In the first six months this year, there have been 33 zero-day exploits used in attacks that have been publicly disclosed this year Â— 11 more than the total number from 2020.There is not a one-to-one relationship between the number of zero-days being used in-the-wild and the number of zero-days being detected and disclosed as in-the-wild."The attackers behind zero-day exploits generally want their zero-days to stay hidden and unknown because that's how they're most useful," Google said.This year, Apple began annotating vulnerabilities in their security bulletins to include notes if there is reason to believe that a vulnerability may be exploited in-the-wild and Google added these annotations to their Android bulletins."When vendors don't include these annotations, the only way the public can learn of the in-the-wild exploitation is if the researcher or group who knows of the exploitation publishes the information themselves," the TAG team added.Google said that improvements in detection and a growing culture of disclosure likely contribute to the significant uptick in zero-days detected in 2021 compared to 2020, but reflect more positive trends."Increasing our detection of zero-day exploits is a good thing—it allows us to get those vulnerabilities fixed and protect users, and gives us a fuller picture of the exploitation that is actually happening, so we can make more informed decisions on how to prevent and fight it," the researchers noted. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/google-team-helps-apple-microsoft-fix-zero-day-bugs-in-browsers-284142

The profile had the Goa Chief Minister's photo and lotus symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). I was sure it was genuine," Asolkar added.It was only when the hacker asked him for money that Asolkar realised that something was amiss."People need to be careful with their social media accounts, especially when the Chief Minister's account itself has been hacked," Asolkar said.The Chief Minister also confirmed hacking of his old Facebook account."My old Facebook account has been hacked.

16-07-2021||New Delhi||SC allows five UPSC civil services candidates to appear for interviews as special case||The Supreme Court on Friday as a “special case” allowed five civil service candidates, who had cleared the UPSC main examination but were disqualified for not submitting the degree certificates by the cut-off date, to appear for the interviews.A Bench of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna directed that the candidates be allowed to take the interviews as a special case as it noted that their universities declared their results late due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The top court said that these five candidates will be in addition to the already published list for the candidates short-listed for the interviews. It noted that earlier the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) had allowed several candidates, who had cleared preliminary examinations, to appear for the main examinations despite the fact they had not produced the qualifying examination certificates along with their application form, on furnishing an undertaking.The Bench said it would be inequitable to deny these five candidates an opportunity of continuing with the UPSC examination as they were placed in a peculiar situation, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and their universities could not declare the result of examination on time. The top court said that it is passing the order while exercising its power under Article 142 of the Constitution and treating the matter as a special case.It said that order shall not be treated as precedent and is passed in peculiar facts and circumstances of the case.Advocate Tanya Shree, appearing for the petitioner, has told the top court that they were allowed to appear in preliminary examinations of UPSC on October 4, 2020 by furnishing an undertaking after their respective universities failed to declare results of final examination due to Covid-19.She said that they have cleared the preliminary examination as per the results declared on October 23, 2020. She further said as per rules, the candidates, who have cleared the preliminary examinations have to fill a detailed application form and submit a proof of qualifying examination for appearing in main examinations.The cut-off date for submitting the proof was November 23, 2020 but after their results were not declared by their respective universities, they were allowed to appear in main examination in January after furnishing an undertaking, the petitioners said, adding that their university results were declared later and they were declared as pass.The petitioners further pointed out that UPSC had later cancelled their candidature for not submitting the proof of qualifying examination within the cut-off date resulting in withholding of the main examination results. The UPSC has claimed that as per rules which are sacrosanct for the commission, the candidates had to submit the proof of qualifying examination at the time of submitting the detailed examination form, which many students complied with while many students failed to comply with.The candidates in their plea have said that cancellation of their candidature is arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory amongst the candidates for the UPSC.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-five-upsc-civil-services-candidates-to-appear-for-interviews-as-special-case-284137

16-07-2021||---||Cannot say if Siby Mathews, others would be arrested in conspiracy case: CBI to court||Thiruvananthapuram, July 16The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday told a court here that it cannot presently say if the former Kerala Police and Intelligence Bureau (IB) officers named in the case registered by the agency in connection with the illegal arrest of former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan and two Maldives nationals in a 1994 spying case will be arrested or not. The lawyer representing the agency told the court that he would need to take instructions on that aspect.The submission was made before Principal District and Sessions Judge P Krishnakumar during the hearing of former Kerala DGP Siby Mathews’ anticipatory bail plea in the case registered by CBI against him and 17 other police officers for various offences.The agency also told the court that it was yet to collect evidence against the accused, including Mathews, as it was a 27-year-old case and therefore, their custodial interrogation might be required.It had made such a submission even before the Kerala High Court while opposing the anticipatory bail pleas of former Kerala Police officers S Vijayan and Thampi S Durga Dutt.CBI also placed before the court the case diary of its investigation in the present case and the report of a committee headed by Justice (retd) DK Jain which was constituted by the Supreme Court to look into the matter.It said the case diary of the investigation carried out in the 1994 espionage case shall be placed before the court on the next date, a lawyer close to the case said.The court on July 14 had called for both case diaries and the committee report.The agency will continue with its arguments on July 26, the next date of hearing in the matter and will also inform the court whether it intends to arrest Mathews and the other accused in the case.Prior to CBI’s arguments, advocate Prasad Gandhi—representing the two Maldives nationals—told the court that proper procedure was not followed by Mathews and his Special Investigation Team (SIT) with regard to initiation of the case and arrest of the two women and the scientist.Gandhi contended before the court that action under the Official Secrets Act can only be taken by the Union Government and not the state government or the police here.He also told the court that the arrests were made by the SIT without any credible evidence and it was the CBI that was supposed to investigate the case.Gandhi also claimed in court that “it can only be a wild imagination to believe that a spy would travel with his/her original passport, show actual residential address and sell their belongings to pay hotel bills”.On the next date, advocate V Ajakumar, representing Mathews, would be rebutting the arguments of CBI, Narayanan and the two Maldives women.On the last date of hearing, former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan had told the court that he had informed the then Prime Minister that the US was also involved in the conspiracy to implicate him in the 1994 espionage case, but was asked not to publicise it so as not to ruin the country’s relations with that government.CBI has lodged the case for various offences, including criminal conspiracy and kidnapping and fabrication of evidence, under the IPC in connection with the arrest of Narayanan and the two Maldives nationals—Mariyam Rasheeda and Fouziyya Hasan.The women, in their plea opposing Mathews anticipatory bail application, have sought Rs 2 crore as damages from each of the 18 officers named in CBI’s case.Mathews has refuted the allegations against him and has claimed that Narayanan and the two women were arrested due to the pressure of IB officers.Mathews has also claimed cases under the Foreigners Act and the Official Secrets Act were registered against Rasheeda based on the information received from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) that she had “undesirable connections with some ISRO scientists and her activities were prejudicial to interest and security of India.”The Supreme Court had on April 15 ordered that the report of a high-level committee on the role of erring police officials in the espionage case relating to Narayanan be given to the CBI and directed the agency to conduct further investigation on the issue.The three-member committee, headed by former apex court judge Justice (retd) D K Jain, was appointed by the top court in 2018 after acquitting Narayanan in the case.The Supreme Court had also directed the Kerala government to pay Rs 50 lakh as compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo “immense humiliation”.The espionage case pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India’s space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.The CBI, in its probe at that time, had held that top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan’s illegal arrest.The case also had political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then Chief Minister, the late K. Karunakaran, over the issue that eventually led to his resignation.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cannot-say-if-siby-mathews-others-would-be-arrested-in-conspiracy-case-cbi-to-court-284129
16-07-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Allegations against Teltumbde prima facie true, says court||A special court here has said that there was sufficient material to show that the allegations against activist Anand Teltumbde, arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, were prima facie true. The court has also said it does not find the accusations against Teltumbde to be "inherently improbable" or "wholly unbelievable", and prima facie he was involved in furthering activities of a banned organisation. Special judge DE Kothalikar, presiding over matters probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), made the observations while rejecting Teltumbde's bail application on July 12, although the detailed order was made available on Friday. "Upon perusal of the documents, including the exchange of e-mails and the statements of the witnesses relied upon by the prosecution, and after cross-checking the truthfulness of the allegations made against the applicane, this court does not find that the accusations are inherently improbable or wholly unbelievable,” the court said. "On the contrary, I have no hesitation to conclude that there is sufficient material to enable the court reach to prima facie conclusion that the accusations made against the applicant (Teltumbde) are prima facie true," the judge noted. The court further said there is no hitch to record prima facie satisfaction that there is material against the applicant to show his complicity in the crime.  It also noted that evidence and documents submitted by the prosecution prima facie indicate that the applicant was prima facie involved in furthering activities of the banned organisation. The NIA had earlier claimed that Teltumbde was an active member of CPI (Maoist) and propagated its activities. "I hold that there is prima facie ample material on record which would reveal active role and participation of the applicant," the court said. Among other grounds, Teltumbde's lawyer had urged the court to consider the aspect that the probe in the crime has already been completed and the applicant is a well-qualified person. The court, however, cited a Supreme Court order and noted that the fact that that the chargesheet has been submitted against the applicant cannot be used in favour of the applicant, rather it would go against him. "As stated earlier, the courts considering the bail application are required to maintain a fine balance between the societal interest vis-a-vis personal liberty of the accused, by adhering to the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence. "In this background, the contention of the applicant that his educational qualification and social background, needs to be considered while deciding bail application, is liable to be discarded,” the judge observed. Teltumbde, arrested by the NIA in April last year, had in January 2021 filed a bail application stating that the theory of the prosecution that he was "waging a war or attempting to wage a war or abetting others to wage a war or incite the public is humbug."  Teltumbde is presently lodged in the Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elgar-parishad-case-allegations-against-teltumbde-prima-facie-true-says-court-284125

It will then meet with ships from the Indian Navy to conduct routine maritime exercises," the high commission said in a statement.It said the deployment represents the UK's commitment to deepening diplomatic, economic and security ties with India and in the Indo-Pacific region."It demonstrates both the UK's support for the freedom of passage through vital trading routes and for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific," it added.UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said that described the deployment of the CSG as a "major moment" for the UK's defence."The group is sailing the Indian Ocean and will shortly conduct exercises with the Indian Navy, building on our already strong partnership with an important ally and friend," he said."The deployment illustrates the UK's enduring commitment to global defence and security, strengthening our existing alliances and forging new partnerships with like-minded countries as we face up to the challenges of the 21st century," Wallace was quoted as saying in the statement.British High Commissioner to India, Alex Ellis, said the deployment of the carrier strike group is a powerful demonstration of the UK's commitment to the security of India and the Indo-Pacific."Its arrival follows the UK's first International Liaison Officer joining the Indian Navy's Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region in Gurugram," he said."Today marks another step towards delivering the ambition set out jointly by our prime ministers in the 2030 Roadmap, bringing our countries, economies and people closer together," Ellis said.Last month, the UK posted a liaison officer at the Indian Navy's Information Fusion Centre (IFC) that has emerged as a key hub in tracking movements of ships and other developments in the Indian Ocean region.The UK joined a select group of countries such as the US, Australia, Japan and France to depute officials at the Gurgaon-based facility.The Indian Navy established the IFC-IOR in 2018 to effectively keep track of the shipping traffic as well as other critical developments in the region under a collaborative framework with like-minded countries. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uks-carrier-strike-group-enters-indian-ocean-to-conduct-wargame-with-indian-navy-284113

16-07-2021||New Delhi||YouTube vlogger Karl Rock blacklisted for violation of visa condition, Centre tells Delhi High Court||The Centre on Friday told the Delhi High Court that YouTube vlogger Karl Rock had been blacklisted for violation of visa condition and was conducting business on spouse visa. “He has been blacklisted for visa violation. Let me file a status report. He was conducting business on spouse visa,” counsel for the Centre, advocate Anurag Ahluwalia told a bench of Justice Rekha Palli.The court was hearing a petition by Manisha Malik, the wife of the vlogger, challenging the Centre's alleged "arbitrary and unreasonable" decision to deny visa to her husband to enter India.The court said that while grant of visa was the prerogative of the Centre, it had to be reasonable and be communicated to the party. “You may be justified but they have to know. It is the prerogative of the government but they have to be justifiable,” the court said while issuing notice to the Centre on the petition and granted three weeks' time to it to file its response.If there is any confidential information, it is open to the Centre to furnish the same in a sealed cover, the court added.The counsel for Malik, advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, informed the court that his client received no word from the government on the denial of visa and while exiting India in October last year, the visa was simply stamped “cancelled without prejudice”."I asked for an extension and instead they gave me an exit permit," Ayyubi stated.He added that during his stay in India, the vlogger even donated plasma twice after recovering from Covid.The matter would be heard next on September 23.In her petition, Malik has submitted that her husband, Karl Edward Rice, visited most of India to capture its beauty and contribute to the promotion of tourism here.The plea said since their marriage in 2019, the couple had been living in Delhi and Rice had not been able to return to India from New Zealand since October 10 last year."The petitioner's husband, Karl Edward Rice, has a dual nationality of New Zealand and the Netherlands and has been visiting India since 2013 strictly abiding by the laws of the country and the conditions of visa."During the entire period since 2013, while the petitioner's husband has been granted Indian visa on various occasions, there hasn't been even a single allegation against the petitioner's husband," the plea said.Subsequent to their marriage, Rice was granted an X-2 Visa (meant for spouse/children of an Indian citizen) which had a validity period of May 2019 to May 2024 and one of the conditions in the visa for him was to exit India every 180 days or to intimate the Foreigner Regional Registration Office concerned."Complying with the aforesaid condition of exiting the nation, while Rice left India on October 10, 2020, he has not been able to return to India because any application for issuance of an Indian visa is being rejected by the respondents."While the petitioner has been running from pillar to post and no reasons are communicated to either Karl Edward Rice or to the petitioner herself as to on what basis her husband's request for issuance of visa have been rejected," the petition said, adding that Rice was only verbally informed that he had been blacklisted and therefore he is not permitted to enter India.The plea sought direction to authorities to call for records pertaining to cancellation of visa and unilateral blacklisting of Rice and also sought to review or quash the decision blacklisting him and allow him entry to India.As an alternative, the plea sought to direct the authorities to grant a meaningful hearing to the couple on the sudden blacklisting of Rice.

16-07-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Pandemic forces Kerala street musician to put his kidney and liver on sale||Before the pandemic outbreak emptied the normally busy streets and turned the city centres into ghost towns, hunger pangs had never disturbed Ronald so terribly.Rain or shine, he used to travel to crowded beaches and bus-stands here in his four-wheel scooter and sing old melodies in his profound voice, which would win him enough for his daily bread.City dwellers, for the last several years, had been enjoying the nostalgic songs which he sang sitting under the make-shift roof of his vehicle, to which a sound mixer and a tiny amplifier are fixed.But, when the Covid gripped the world and confined people within their houses, everything went upside down in this differently-abled street singer's life, which even forced him now to put his liver and kidney for sale to find a steady income for food and shelter.A notice board, which he placed in his tiny vehicle saying that his "kidney and liver for sale", was more than enough to understand the depth of the penury the man was suffering.Two other placards, reading "I am hungry...please give some donations" and "The singer in me has resigned and is waiting for his death", would also stare at passersby from his modified scooter.Ronald said he was a street singer before the pandemic and now his condition is not better than a wayside beggar who did not mind eating leftover food from garbage heaps."There is no crowd in the street nowadays...The once busy roads are almost deserted now. If there are no listeners, how can a street singer like me survive," he asked.The 59-year old singer said the utter penury had forced him to put the 'kidney for sale' board on his scooter."There is no other way than selling my organs to live without begging. I hope someone who is in urgent need of organ transplantation will approach me and give me some good amount after accepting my kidney and liver," Ronald told PTI.He said as he did not know any medical agent involved in organ donation, he used to roam around the premises of the government medical college here displaying these placards on his vehicle to get some "buyers" for his organs.His hardships have suddenly come under the media glare after some people shared pictures of him travelling on the vehicle, with display boards, on the social media platforms.Once a watch and radio repairer, he said the gnawing hunger recently persuaded him to eat the food waste from the wayside garbage heap.With teary eyes, he said his only dream was to get food every day and buy a small piece of land, where he could erect a tent and stay without the nightmare of paying a monthly rent.A native of the capital city, the singer was living in a rented house near the domestic airport here till the pandemic outbreak."As there is no way to remit monthly rent, my scooter is my home...my everything now," he said.For 18 years, he had been singing on the streets besides doing other menial jobs to run his family, which comprised his late wife, two sons and a daughter.Unfortunately, none of them are with him now.Ronald said he had even managed to construct a tiny house using the money which he earned singing on the street but had to sell it off when his children demanded a share when they got married.The daughter is away after marrying a Tamil Nadu native while one son is in jail in connection with a criminal case and the other is bedridden, suffering from a chronic disease."It is a great solace that I am getting a monthly disability pension of Rs 1,500 from the government. That's the only steady income. I used to sell the rice which I get as ration in a thattukada (wayside shop) for Rs 300," the singer said.To save money for petrol and mobile recharge, he would reduce his expenses for food."After the pandemic outbreak, I used to buy only one food parcel daily using donations from generous people and would keep it for the whole day," he added.A worn-out mobile phone, bought with the money gifted by a well-wisher, and the rusty scooter are the only assets of this once-popular street musician now.Knowing his plight from the social media, Transport Minister Antony Raju, who is also the MLA of the constituency and Thrikkakkara legislator PT Thomas, reached out to him and offered all support to Ronald who is now banking on the hope that the government would extend a helping hand to him.

During the 2005 Mumbai flooding, areas around Mithi river were the most affected and Army had to be called in to rescue and shift locals. Hundreds of people had died in the floods that year.The official said that after the rains took a break following the evacuation of people, Mithi river's water level went down to two metres from 3.7 metres. After that, most of the evacuated people returned to their places.Heavy rain pounded Mumbai, especially its suburbs, since early morning, the BMC officials said, adding that Mumbai island city recorded 55.3 mm rain, while 135 mm and 140.5 mm rain in Eastern and Western suburbs, respectively between 4 am to 9 am.A civic official said that the H-East administrative ward of the BMC, which includes areas like Bandra east and Khar east, recorded the highest rainfall of 186.9 mm, followed by 175.5 mm rain in M-west ward that includes Shivaji Nagar, Govandi and Mankhurd areas during those five hours.Due to the downpour, several low-lying areas in the eastern and western suburbs witnessed water-logging, which led to traffic snarls on the arterial roads.As a result of water-logging, mainly between Sion and Vidya Vihar section on the Central Railway's main line, and Chunabhatti-Tikal Nagar section on the Harbour line, the suburban train services were badly affected.A Central Railway spokesperson said the suburban services on both these lines were hit due to water-logging, and it led to bunching of trains.“Due to this, suburban services ran behind schedule and the operations of some long distance trains were also hit,” he said.Meanwhile, the IMD has predicted moderate rain in the city and suburbs with possibility of heavy rainfall at isolated places, the civic official said , adding that the city will witness hightide of 4.08 metres on Friday at 4.26 metres.Tulsi lake, one of the seven reservoirs that supply drinking water to the metropolis, overflowed due to heavy rains, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/heavy-rains-pound-mumbai-250-people-shifted-as-mithi-river-swells-local-train-services-hit-284087

Your government has been getting rid of stale laws,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana said on pleas filed by The Editors Guild of India and a former Major General. Both the petitions have challenged the constitutional validity of Section 124A (sedition) of the IPC. The SC’s remarks were widely hailed by the Opposition with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra hailing the observations. Moitra and Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav questioned the charges of sedition against farmers by the Haryana Police. “Ironic that the Haryana Police charged over 100 farmers with sedition after alleged attack on BJP leader’s vehicle while the SC questions why we have this outdated law?” said Moitra.Yadav, pointing to the SC’s question whether sedition was still needed, said, “Yes, that’s the question, case in point. Yesterday, a sedition case was registered against farmers in Sirsa for breaking the windshield of a minister’s vehicle. That is what the law is being used for.” Earlier, observing that their main concern was misuse of the law, the Bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, said, “Mr Attorney (General), we want to ask some questions. This is the colonial-era law and the same was used by the British to suppress the freedom movement.”Attorney General KK Venugopal defended the section and said it be allowed to remain on the statute and the court could lay down guidelines to curb its misuse.The offence under Section 124A is non-bailable. It penalises speech or expression attempting to bring into hatred or contempt or attempts to excite disaffection towards the government with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The Bench said the sedition law had been put to enormous misuse and observed, “It can be compared to a carpenter, asked to cut a wood, cut the entire forest.”The CJI said if a “particular party did not want to hear a voice, they would use this law to implicate others”. The Bench also noted that it was not blaming any state or government, but “unfortunately, the executing agency misuses these laws and there is no accountability”. It also referred to a very low percentage of convictions in sedition cases while hearing the matter in a virtual mode. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/colonial-era-sedition-law-being-misused-is-it-still-needed-asks-sc-283887

PTIOfficials confirmed that pre-fabricated structures were coming up in areas facing Sikkim, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. All were on their side and similar to the ones on the Indian side of the LAC, said an official.Such structures were hurriedly added by both sides following the stand-off. The Indian troops deployed in glaciated areas in the Himalayas had stayed put, while the PLA had to “rotate” their forward deployment in eastern Ladakh, which sees extreme winters with temperature plummeting to -40 degree Celsius. The two armies are locked in military posturing since April last year. Senior military commanders of both armies are scheduled to meet for the 12th round of talks soon, the agenda for which has been exchanged.

Kamal Nath meets Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 15Former CM of Madhya Pradesh Kamal Nath today met party president Sonia Gandhi and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for over an hour, indicating that the grand old party might be looking for a working chief. Sonia, who took over the party reins from her son Rahul Gandhi after the 2019 Lok Sabha poll debacle, continues to be interim president but is largely inaccessible due to health reasons.Rahul has been taking most decisions but remains averse to an active role as party president. Sources say nine-time MP Kamal Nath, 74, is a fit candidate to fill the void as Congress working president until organisational elections for a full-time chief are held.Closer to the state elections next year, including in UP and Punjab, the Congress appears keen on an arrangement where a working president could be installed to build the necessary organisational outreach while Sonia continues to monitor overall party affairs. Nath, it is learnt, is also open to filling the void left by Ahmed Patel. Since Patel’s demise, Sonia has not had a political adviser. “Services of Kamal Nath can prove handy at a time when the Congress is left with governments only in Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra,” observed an AICC functionary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-working-prez-kamal-nath-meets-sonia-gandhi-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-283900

This is the colonial era law and the same law was used by the British to suppress freedom movement. It was used by the British to silence Mahatma Gandhi, Gokhale and others.Sedition cases jump 160 per cent between 2016-19: Rights lawyer"Is it still necessary to keep this in statute even after 75 years of Independence?” asked the bench which also comprised Justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy.Observing that the provision on sedition had been put to “enormous misuse”, it also referred to alarming misuse of Section 66-A of the Information Technology Act even after the top court set it aside long back and observed: “It can be compared to a carpenter, asked to cut a wood, cut the entire forest.” “A factionist can invoke these types of (penal) provisions to implicate the other group of people,” the CJI said, adding that if a particular party or people did not want to hear a voice, they would use this law to implicate others.The bench wondered at the continuance of the sedition law in the statute book for the last 75 years and said: “We do not know why the government is not taking a decision. Your government has been getting rid of stale laws."        The bench said it was not blaming any state or government, but unfortunately, the executing agency misuses these laws and “there is no accountability”.In a hearing, conducted through video-conferencing, the bench said if a police officer in a remote village wanted to fix a person then he could easily do so by using such provisions.Moreover, said the bench, there was very low percentage of convictions in sedition cases and these are the issues which are needed to be decided.The CJI, on being told that another bench headed by Justice UU Lalit has been hearing a similar plea which has been fixed for further consideration on July 27, said he would take a call on posting of the matter and notify the date of hearing.Attorney General KK Venugopal, who was asked to assist the bench in dealing with the case, defended the provision and said it be allowed to remain in the statute book and the court might lay down guidelines to curb the misuse.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the Editors Guild of India, said a separate plea had been filed by the journalists' body challenging the validity of Section 124-A (sedition) of the IPC and that plea could also be tagged along with the present one.He said that besides challenging the validity, the Guild had also sought framing of guidelines to curb the misuse.The bench was hearing the fresh plea by former army officer, Major-General SG Vombatkere (retd), challenging the constitutional validity of Section 124-A (sedition) of the IPC on the grounds that it caused a "chilling effect" on speech and is an unreasonable restriction on free expression, a fundamental right.The bench, referring to the credentials of Vombatkere, said that he gave his entire life to the country and his motive in filing of the case could not be questioned.
