Only one weekly market per zone with 50 percent vendors will be allowed to open.The next level of alert coded with ‘Amber’ colour (L-2) will come into force if positivity rate rises above 1 percent or new cases number 3,500 or oxygenated bed occupancy reaching 700.‘Amber alert will invoke the same responses as ‘Yellow’ one except that malls and shops of nonessential goods and services will be allowed to open from 10 AM to 6 PM.The ‘Orange’ or L-3 alert will be the next stage which will kick in if the positivity rare crosses 2 percent or new cases number 9,000 or oxygenated bed occupancy becomes 1000.Construction activities will be allowed with onsite labourers while industrial activities will be restricted except those related with essential commodities and defence production.Malls and weekly markets will be closed. Only standalone nonessential shops will open from 10 am to 6 pm.The ‘Red’ alert (L-4) will be the highest level and will come in to force if the positivity rate crosses 5 percent or new cases rise to 16,000 or oxygenated bed occupancy reaches 3,000.Construction activities with onsite labourers and industrial manufacturing of essential commodities, national security and defence related productions will be allowed, while malls and weekly markets will be closed while standalone nonessential shops open, they said.The eight-member state level expert committee was formed by the Delhi government in May to devise a strategy to mitigate and manage the possible third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi.

07-07-2021||New Delhi||Bhupender Yadav: BJP’s ever-dependable organisation man, parliamentarian in Cabinet now||Bhupender Yadav has long been the go-to person for the BJP top brass for handling a variety of challenges and issues, ranging from assembly polls and organisation matters in important states to directing the party’s views in a number of parliamentary committees.His entry to the Modi government as a Cabinet minister is seen as his just reward after serving as a party office-bearer for the longest term among all current occupants.The 51-year-old second-term Rajya Sabha MP, enjoys the image of a sober and non-controversial politician who deftly handles the issues on hand without drawing any negative attention, a trait which has acquitted him well with various party presidents ranging from Nitin Gadkari to Amit Shah and JP Nadda.Yadav was considered a trusted general secretary of Shah, when he was the party president, and has been in charge of the BJP’s affairs in Bihar and Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah.He was also part of the party’s brain trust to strategise for important state assembly polls and was often dubbed as the “committee man”, as he once chaired around eight select committees and successfully persuaded all parties in building a consensus on many contentious Bills.From drafting resolutions at key party meetings to shaping its stand on legal challenges and presenting its views before the Election Commission, Yadav has always been the leader in the thick of things.These included the GST Bill, Mines and Minerals Bill and Enemy Property Bill. The BJP general secretary was also chairman of the Joint Committee on Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015.Hailing from Rajasthan and lawyer by profession, Yadav had been associated with the Akhil Bhartiya Adhivakta Parishad, a lawyers’ body affiliated to the RSS, and rose through the ranks.Prior to beginning his political career, he was an advocate in the Supreme Court and also served as government counsel for important commissions.

07-07-2021||Guwahati||Sonowal’s roller-coaster journey to a second time berth in Modi cabinet||Sarbananda Sonowal, who rose from the rough and tumble of student politics to assume the chief minister’s chair in Assam, is back for his second innings at the Centre.As a dynamic student leader who went on to join the state’s most prominent regional party AGP, before switching to the saffron camp, Sonowal was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s obvious choice for the job of Assam’s chief minister when he scripted BJP’s historic first electoral victory in any northeastern state, five years ago.Read also | Cabinet expansion: Narayan Rane, Sonowal, Jyotiraditya take oath as ministersBefore being entrusted with running Assam, Sonowal who started out life as president of students’ body AASU, was inducted in Modi’s first cabinet as northeast’s sole representative as a minister of state with independent charge.However, earlier this year, when Assam polls were announced, the BJP decided not to project him as the chief ministerial face. An obvious sign that he would be eased out of the top job. With Himanta Biswa Sarma getting that job, many political pundits had predicted that he would be accommodated in the Union cabinet in the next reshuffle.Sonowal, a law graduate, is considered to be a rarity - an honest politician who also worked to unite different communities with his oft-repeated lines ‘Barak-Brahmaputra-plains-hills’.The greatest challenge to his rule came during widespread protests in the state against enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act which saw his former comrades from the All Assam Students Union (AASU) turning against him.He was accused of failing to lobby the BJP leadership against the bill which AASU saw as compromising Assamese interests.His former colleagues termed this the “ultimate betrayal” by a man who was given the title of ‘Jatiya Nayak’ (leader of the community) after the scrapping of the controversial Illegal Migrants’ Determination by Tribunal (IMDT) Act by the Supreme Court in 2005 which Sonowal had challenged as AASU president.Sonowal’s foray into politics began with his joining the AASU where he served as president from 1992 to 1999.From AASU he predictably went on to join the Asom Gana Parishad in 2001, founded by his seniors in the students’ organisation, and was elected the party’s MLA from Upper Assam’s Moran constituency in 2001.In 2004 he went on to successfully contest the Lok Sabha polls wresting the Dibrugarh parliamentary seat for the first time from the Congress by defeating former Union Minister Paban Singh Ghatowar.Sonowal left the AGP in January 2011 following differences with the party leadership and went on to join the BJP in February 2011.He went on to become the BJP state unit president in 2012 and was credited with raising the party’s tally to seven from an earlier four in the 2014 Parliamentary polls.He, himself, wrested the Lakhimpur constituency from former Union Minister Ranee Narah of the Congress and was made the Union Minister of State for Sports and Youth Development.Sonowal, who belongs to the Sonowal-Kachari tribe, retained for the second consecutive term Majuli, the world’s largest inhabited river island and the seat of Vaishnavite culture.Born on October 31, 1962 in Mulukgaon in Dibrugarh district as the youngest of Jibeswar Sonowal and Dineswari Sonowal’s eight offsprings, Sonowal is a bachelor and a devout follower of Assam’s renowned Vaishnav saints Sankardeva and Madhavdeva.

07-07-2021||Bhopal||Jyotiraditya Scindia rewarded for delivering Madhya Pradesh to BJP||More than a year after playing a key role in the installation of a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia was rewarded with a berth in the Union Cabinet, a familiar terrain for the Rajya Sabha member who had served as a junior minister in the Congress-led UPA government.Scindia (50) resigned from the Congress and joined the BJP in March 2020 and his move triggered a chain of events which finally culminated in the collapse of the Kamal Nath government just 15 months after its formation, paving the way for the saffron party to assume power which it lost towards the end of 2018.On joining the BJP, he was made a Rajya Sabha member, while Shivraj Singh Chouhan came back as the chief minister.The scion of the former royal family of Gwalior had started showing signs of restlessness after the Congress high command chose veteran Kamal Nath over him to take over as the chief minister in December 2018.Things came to a head when Scindia warned of “hitting the streets” against his own party-led government if promises made to people in the manifesto were not fulfilled. The then chief minister Kamal Nath’s retort that Scindia was free to carry out his threat to launch an agitation, finally proved his undoing.Born on January 1, 1971, and educated in Harvard and Stanford institutions, Scindia has traversed a long way after contesting his maiden election as a Congress candidate in 2002, a bypoll in the Guna Lok Sabha constituency, which was held because of the sudden death of his father, Madhavrao Scindia, in a plane crash.In 2007, he was inducted into the UPA government and remained a part of the Union Cabinet till 2014 by serving as a minister of state for communications, commerce and industry and power.In 2014, he was again elected from Guna, his traditional seat for a fourth time but lost from the constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls to BJP candidate KP Yadav, who was once close to him.Scindia was the face of the Congress campaign in his capacity as the chairman of the poll campaign committee during the 2018 assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh. However, when the party came to power in the state after a drought of 15 years, the coveted post of chief minister went to Nath.After that he also lost the Lok Sabha polls from Guna and since then, he was not feeling comfortable with the Congress leadership in the state, sources close to him said.“While in the Congress, Scindia once paid a courtesy visit to Shivraj Singh Chouhan (then he was not CM) and that was the first indication of Scindia hobnobbing with the BJP,” his close aide Pankaj Chaturvedi said.Then came the big act—22 Congress MLAs loyal to Scindia, including six ministers—resigned from their assembly’s membership and toppled the Congress government.The BJP rewarded his loyalists by inducting most of them into the Chouhan cabinet. A majority of them later won assembly bypolls necessitated by the mass resignations of Congress MLAs.In the run-up to the bypolls in Madhya Pradesh, when Scindia was asked about the ‘political coup’ and when he had taken the final call to topple the Congress government, he told PTI, “When Nath asked me to hit the road and that was the final call”.     Scindia was the second member from his clan to pull down a Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, decades after ‘Rajmata’ Vijaya Raje Scindia toppled the “anti-people” Congress government in the state, Chouhan earlier said.The entire Scindia family is now part of one party (BJP), Chouhan had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jyotiraditya-scindia-rewarded-for-delivering-madhya-pradesh-to-bjp-279593
07-07-2021||Patna||Pashupati Kumar Paras: The man who successfully led a coup d’état against his nephew||A politician with more than four decades of experience, Pashupati Kumar Paras, who was administered the oath of office as Union cabinet minister on Wednesday, has spent the larger part of his career under the shadow of his late brother Ram Vilas Paswan.However, having staged a successful revolt against the latter’s son Chirag Paswan, the Lok Sabha MP from Hajipur in Bihar now seems poised to come into his own.Paras, who previously headed Lok Janshakti Party’s Bihar unit and is currently the national president of its breakaway faction, began his innings in 1978 as a Janata Party MLA from Alauli in his native Khagaria district, a seat formerly represented by the late Ram Vilas Paswan.He represented the assembly segment several times, on tickets of the Janata Dal and later of the party floated by his brother. He became a member of the Nitish Kumar cabinet in the state in 2017 when the chief minister realigned with the NDA.The 2019 Lok Sabha polls saw him making his parliamentary debut from Hajipur, a constituency the late Ram Vilas Paswan had nurtured over the decades. The move was seen as indicative of the trust between the two brothers.Nonetheless, the elevation of his greenhorn nephew Chirag as LJP national president mortified Paras who did not immediately choose to vent his dissatisfaction but hit back and extracted his pound of flesh when the Jamui MP was down in the dumps.Chirag who was hoping to step into father Ram Vilas’s shoes as the sole leader of the Paswan community had led his party to a disastrous assembly performance and painted himself into a corner by burning bridges with Nitish Kumar.This obviously gave his uncle the chance that he had long been on the lookout for. Armed with the support of all other party MPs, Paras last month elbowed out Chirag as the LJP’s leader in the Lok Sabha and came down heavily on the young MP’s vainglory in attacking the BJP-backed chief minister in Bihar while claiming loyalty towards the saffron party.A cornered Chirag, who has challenged his uncle’s political coup before the Election Commission, seemed to have sensed the writing on the wall when at a press conference in Patna on Tuesday he declared he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him not to induct Paras on the LJP quota.Desperation was evident when Chirag said he would be moving the court if Paras found a berth in the Union council of ministers.The 68-year-old, meanwhile, seems to be having the last laugh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pashupati-kumar-paras-the-man-who-successfully-led-a-coup-d%C3%A9tat-against-his-nephew-279592
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Narayan Rane’s journey from Shiv Sena ‘shakha pramukh’ to Union minister||Having spent the better part of his political career in the Shiv Sena, Narayan Rane has come a long way, leaving two parties and forming his own outfit for a while, before joining hands with the BJP and becoming a Union minister.Rane (69) began his political career as a ‘shakha pramukh’ (local ward chief) in the Sena and rose up the ranks to become chief minister at the fag end of the Shiv Sena-BJP government’s term in 1999.Not known to mince words, the Maratha leader having pockets of influence in the coastal Konkan region, was picked by Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray as chief minister when he decided to remove the genial Manohar Joshi ahead of the 1999 assembly elections.Thackeray, however, expelled Rane from the Sena in July 2005 for “anti-party activities” after he alleged that tickets and posts were for sale in the Shiv Sena.Rane joined the Congress in August 2005 and quit it in September 2017. “I waited for 12 years. When I found that there was no scope for me in the Congress, I decided to quit from the primary membership of the party and membership of the legislative council,” he had said in his rant against the party over “injustice” done to him and his supporters.Rane then said he had joined the Congress because he was assured that he will be made chief minister in six months.After quitting the Congress, Rane launched the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha in October 2017. In 2018, he declared support for BJP and was elected to the Rajya Sabha on that party’s nomination. In October 2019, he merged his party with the BJP.Over the years, Rane’s political rivals have been linking him to several incidents of violence, claiming his involvement in the murder of Shiv Sena worker Shridhar Naik and some other crimes in his Sindhudurg region of Konkan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narayan-ranes-journey-from-shiv-sena-shakha-pramukh-to-union-minister-279585

07-07-2021||New Delhi||Chinese hackers target State Bank of India users via phishing, gift scams||In fresh trouble for the State Bank of India (SBI), hackers of Chinese origin are targeting bank users with phishing scams, asking them to update their KYC using a particular website link and offering gifts worth Rs 50 lakh from the bank via a WhatsApp message, cybersecurity researchers warned on Wednesday.The research wing of New Delhi-based think tank CyberPeace Foundation, along with Autobot Infosec Pvt Ltd, studied two such incidents on the name of SBI that were faced by some smartphone users."All the domain names associated with the campaign have the registrant country as China," the research team said.In the first case of the text message requesting KYC verification, the landing page that appears resemble with the official SBI online page.On clicking the "Continue to Log in" button, it redirects the user to a full-kyc.php page, asking confidential information like username, Password and a captcha in order to login to the online banking."Following this, it asks for an OTP sent to the user's mobile number. As soon as the OTP is entered, it redirects the user to another page that asks the users to enter some confidential information again like account holder name, mobile number, date of birth. After entering the data, it redirects the user to an OTP page," the researchers informed.The research team came to a conclusion that the campaign is pretended to be launched from State Bank of India but hosted on the third-party domain instead of the official website www.onlinesbi.com, which makes it more suspicious.The overall layout of the web page used in the campaign is kept similar to the official SBI netbanking site to lure the users.The SBI was yet to react to the report.In the second case of luring users to win attractive free gifts, the team found that the WhatsApp message also redirects the user to a link."On the landing page, a congratulations message appears with an attractive photo of State Bank of India and asks users to participate in a quick survey to get a free gift of Rs 50 lakh from the State bank of India," the researchers informed.At the bottom of the page, a section appears which seems to be a Facebook comment section where many users have commented about how the offer is beneficial.The Research teams investigated the URLs in a secured sandbox environment where WhatsApp application was not installed.The researchers recommend that people should avoid opening such messages sent via social platforms."The URL manipulation showed that the web server has directory listing enabled and found other links visible which proves that not only the SBI users, IDFC, PNB, IndusInd and Kotak bank users are also targeted by the same type of phishing scam," the team noted.In March this year, the same research team had pointed out that several users of the SBI were targeted in a phishing scam where hackers flooded them with suspicious text messages, requesting them to redeem their SBI credit points worth Rs 9,870. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-hackers-target-state-bank-of-india-users-via-phishing-gift-scams-279579
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC issues notices to Centre, Maharashtra over PIL claiming Truecaller breached data privacy norms||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Union and Maharashtra governments, among others, over a public interest litigation (PIL) claiming that the Truecaller mobile application “shared” user data breaching legal norms of the country.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni was hearing a PIL filed by one Shashank Posture.“The Truecaller app collects data of all users. It shares such data with some of its partners without the consent of users, and dumps the liability on the user,” the petitioner told the court.“This is a manipulative set up because the user has no choice. The app also registers users for a Unified Payments Interface service without their consent, or without due process,” Posture alleged.When the court asked who were these partners benefitting from Truecaller, Posture named “Google India, Bharati Airtel, ICICI Bank”, and claimed that several loan providing companies were also the beneficiaries of such data leaks by the app.Posture further said he had impleaded the Union government, the Maharashtra government, the state IT department, Truecaller international LLP, ICICI Bank, and the National Payment Corporation as respondent parties in the case.The government authorities approved Truecaller app “without proper checks and in contravention of the information security practices rules”, Posture alleged.The High Court said this was a fit case for issuing notices.“The case of the petitioner is that Truecaller through its mobile application has indulged in an absolute breach of data privacy of citizens. He submits that such breach is contrary to data protection laws,” the court said.“We have heard the petitioner for some time and we are of the opinion that a notice is required to be issued to respondents,” it said, directing the respondent parties to reply to the notice within three weeks. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-hc-issues-notices-to-centre-maharashtra-over-pil-claiming-truecaller-breached-data-privacy-norms-279576
07-07-2021||Mumbai||CBI should widen probe into FIR against Anil Deshmukh: Bombay HC||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday said it expects the CBI to widen its investigation into the FIR filed against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, and added that the head of the administration cannot claim innocence and was equally responsible.A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said if true meaning has to be given to the April 5 order of the high court, directing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to hold a preliminary inquiry against the allegations of corruption levelled against Deshmukh, then the role of every person has to be looked into.The court was hearing a petition filed by Deshmukh seeking quashing of the FIR registered by the CBI on April 24 against him on charges of corruption and misuse of official position. The FIR was filed after the agency carried out a preliminary inquiry pursuant to directions from the HC.In March this year, days after his removal from the post of Mumbai police commissioner, senior IPS officer Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked police officers, including (now dismissed) cop Sachin Vaze, to collect Rs 100 crore each month from bars and restaurants.“Whoever is the head of the administration cannot claim innocence by saying that he was only following orders from the executive. The head of the administration is also equally responsible. The minister might have told to reinstate Sachin Vaze, but can the person holding the key and the top post simply obey the orders without performing his duties,” the court said.“We expect the CBI to widen its probe. We hope that the CBI has now found out who the conspirators are,” Justice Shinde said.The bench said if Vaze, who was arrested in the ‘Antilia’ bomb scare case and killing of businessman Mansukh Hiran, was such a “dangerous man” then the committee that reinstated him into the police force should also be included in the list of accused.“We are not taking any names now. Who has inducted this inspector (Vaze) after 15 years?” the court questioned.Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, appearing for the CBI, told the court that the agency has so far ascertained who the conspirators are.“The CBI probe is comprehensive and no person will be excluded. The investigation is still at a preliminary stage, where the facts are hazy and hence at this stage one cannot form a prima facie opinion,” Lekhi argued.The bench pointed out to the order passed by the Supreme Court on April 8 refusing to hear a petition filed by Deshmukh against the HC order directing the CBI to carry out an inquiry against him, and said it referred to the home minister and commissioner of police working in confidence.“The CBI may have to make an inquiry and investigate about all this too,” the court said.Lekhi sought dismissal of the petition and said a CBI investigation into the case was warranted.“No action was taken by the Maharashtra government on the complaint letter written to the Chief Minister by the then (Mumbai) commissioner of police Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh,” he said.Deshmukh’s counsel Amit Desai argued that the CBI FIR lacked any evidence and did not disclose any offence.“The whole FIR goes on about how he (Deshmukh) tried to misuse his official position and take undue advantage. But there is no iota of evidence to support this allegation. No money was exchanged between Deshmukh or anyone,” he said.The court will continue hearing the matter on July 12.Deshmukh resigned from the state cabinet in April this year after the high court ordered a CBI probe against him into allegations of corruption and misconduct levelled by Param Bir Singh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-should-widen-probe-into-fir-against-anil-deshmukh-bombay-hc-279575
07-07-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Chirag Paswan objects to induction of uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras in Modi cabinet||Chirag Paswan has objected to the induction of his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras in the expanded cabinet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi—a development that comes as the Lok Janshakti Party continues to face rebellion and leadership crisis.Chirag Paswan’s series of tweets against Modi government’s decision to induct his uncle came a few minutes before the central government finally released a list confirming Paras’s induction. Paras will be inducted into the Modi cabinet, filling up the void that his brother, the late LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, had left when he died last year.Modi government’s endorsement of Paras’s faction of the party as the legitimate one has drawn objections from Paswan’s son Chirag Paswan, who most recently wrote to the prime minister objecting to his uncle’s induction.In the first of a series of tweets he wrote in Hindi, Chirag Paswan, who has been left floundering for legitimacy since last month’s upheaval in his father’s party, said the LJP had nothing to do with such an appointment or with Paras. He also said his faction had moved a petition in the high court for its intervention.“Shri Pashupati Kumar Paras ji has already been expelled from the Lok Janshakti Party for betraying the party and its top leadership and now the party strongly objects to his inclusion in the Union Cabinet”.“It is the Prime Minister’s prerogative to decide who he wants included in his team and who he doesn’t. But as far as LJP is concerned, Shri Paras ji is not a member of our party.  If he’s still made a minister on the strength of his own faction because of activities such as breaking up the party, the LJP has nothing to do with it.”“After some expelled MPs of the Lok Janshakti Party made Shri Pashupati Paras ji the leader of the parliamentary party, the Lok Janshakti Party had submitted a review petition to the Hon'ble Lok Sabha Speaker which is still under consideration.”“The Lok Janshakti Party has filed a petition in the Delhi High Court today against the decision of the Hon'ble Speaker of the Lok Sabha, in which the expelled MP Shri Pashupati Paras ji was considered the leader of the LJP as the leader of the House.”  पार्टी विरोधी और शीर्ष नेतृत्व को धोखा देने के कारण लोक जनशक्ति पार्टी से श्री पशुपति कुमार पारस जी को पहले ही पार्टी से निष्काषित किया जा चुका है और अब उन्हें केंद्रीय मंत्री मंडल में शामिल करने पर पार्टी कड़ा ऐतराज दर्ज कराती है।||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chirag-paswan-objects-to-induction-of-uncle-pashupati-kumar-paras-in-modi-cabinet-279574

The district is home to just over 10,000 people but produces 85 per cent of the country's strawberries – close to 20,000 tonnes of the fruit are harvested every year.According to Ecozen, these marginalised farmers faced disaster earlier this year when dramatic lockdown restrictions closed markets and limited consumer spending. Local tourism and demand for ice cream – both of which create opportunities for strawberry farmers – were also badly hit."Across Mahabaleshwar, farmers faced a loss of around USD 2.7 million (around Rs 20 crore) as they were unable to preserve and sell their produce in the domestic market, or export it," it said in a statement.But the arrival of three portable solar-powered cold rooms created by Ecozen has allowed even small-scale farmers in the district to meet demand in the huge cities of Mumbai and Pune – as well as the further afield markets of Bangalore, Kochi and Chennai, it said.Farmers are able to rent small amounts of space in the cold rooms – the perfect solution for those with few savings to invest in large-scale storage, it added.Further, the Pune-based Ecozen is now working with 100 farmers in the region. It has also launched an Eco-Connect strawberry collection centre in the village of Bhillar, extending the cold chain that puts money in the pockets of strawberry farmers.Digital technology helps Ecozen and their customers ensure strawberries are kept in the best possible condition, it said.Ecozen CEO and co-founder Devendra Gupta said, "We are delighted to support strawberry farmers at such a critical time. Across India and beyond, lack of a cold chain is a big barrier to rural development. As climate change pushes temperatures higher, the problem will only get worse. Our technology brings security and new opportunities to producers and growers of all kinds."Ecozen intends to increase its work with Mahabaleshwar's strawberry farmers ahead of the next harvesting season in November.Ecozen, a partner in climate solutions charity Ashden's Fair Cooling Fund programme, is working with low carbon innovators around the world to scale up the impact of fair cooling solutions that benefit small scale farmers. Last November, the company received a grant of USD 100,000. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ecozens-solar-cold-rooms-help-struggling-strawberry-farmers-in-mahabaleshwar-279573

07-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC refuses to stop further circulation of film purportedly based on Sushant Singh Rajput's life||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday refused to pass any direction to restrain further circulation of film 'Nyay: The Justice' which is purportedly based on the life of late Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput and has been released on a website.“We will have it on 14th (July). I am not inclined at this stage,” said a bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh while hearing the application of Rajput's father Krishna Kishore Singh, in the appeal against a single judge order refusing to stay the release of the film.Justice Shakdher said the movie had already been released and since the bench was available only for today, he was not inclined to hear it or issue notice.“Matter is listed in usual course on July 14. Let the application be listed on same date. I don't want to second guess what the judge is going to do. I'm not inclined to issue notice at this stage. In an appeal, you know what the rigour is,” the court said.Senior Advocate Jayant Mehta, appearing for Singh, argued he was not seeking that the film be un-released, but that it should not be re-published or further circulated on any other platform now.Mehta told the court that while the movie had been released on 'lapalap' website, the duration of the movie was different from what was indicated earlier.“Let it not go to any other platform from now and July 14... Let there not be another lapalap..,” Mehta said.In the application, Singh said that the release of the film on 'lapalap' was “nothing but a sham” as it was “incomplete, completely smudged, blur and hazy throughout”.Since the movie is incomplete, it has not been released, the application said.Mehta submitted that as per a media interview, even the actor of the movie was not aware as to when the movie would be released.He also informed the court that the website 'lapalap' was owned by an entity in which one of the filmmakers, Sarla A Saraogi, was a director.Senior advocate Chander Lall, appearing for the film director, opposed the passing of any direction to restrain further publication and said that Singh was free to “come back with a defamation suit if the film defames”.Lall stated that the film carries a disclaimer that it is not based on anyone living or dead.“Who is the plaintiff to control my film?”, Lall questioned as he argued that Singh should not be allowed to “repeatedly make requests” against the release of the film.Last month, a vacation bench of the high court had issued notice on Singh's appeal against single judge order refusing to stay the release of several such movies, including 'Nyay: The Justice'.The single judge had earlier said it found merit in the submissions of producers and directors that if information of events which have occurred is already in the public domain, one cannot plead any violation of right to privacy on a movie inspired from such events.Some of the upcoming or proposed movie projects based on his son's life are—'Nyay: The Justice', 'Suicide or Murder: A star was lost', 'Shashank' and an unnamed crowd-funded film.The court had directed the filmmakers to render complete accounts of the revenue earned from the films, if any case of damages is made out in future, and listed the suit for completion of pleading before the joint registrar.The suit claimed that in case a "movie, web-series, book or any other content of similar nature is allowed to be published or broadcasted, it would affect the right of the victim and deceased for a free and fair trial as it may cause prejudice to them". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-refuses-to-stop-further-circulation-of-film-purportedly-based-on-sushant-singh-rajputs-life-279567

The state has shown almost a 12-per cent increase in the number of cases reported in the last four weeks. Twelve districts are showing an increase in the number of new cases over the past four weeks," Bhushan said.Changlang, East Siang, Lohit, Papum Pare, Tawang and Upper Subansiri districts reported more than 100 new cases each in the week ending July 4.

Imphal East and Imphal West had 17 and 28 deaths respectively in the week (June 28-July 4).

All districts have reported more than 200 daily cases in the week ending July 4, he added.Kollam and Wayanad districts have shown an increase in the number of weekly deaths in the said period (June 7-July 4)."Thrissur and Malappuram have reported more than 70 deaths in a week (June 28-July 4). Thiruvananthapuram has shown a declining trend in deaths, however, reported 111 (in the week ending July 4)," Bhushan said.Kannur, Kasaragod, Kollam, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad and Thrissur had over 100 new cases in the previous week with a weekly positivity rate of more than 10 per cent, the ministry said.It said Meghalaya is still reporting a weekly positivity rate of 14.05 per cent (June 28-July 4) and eight of its 11 districts are reporting a positivity rate of over 10 per cent."The districts of East Garo Hills, East Khasi Hills, North Garo Hills, Ri Bhoi, West Garo Hills, West Jaintia Hills and West Khasi Hills reported more than 100 new cases in the week ending July 4, with East Khasi Hills reporting 1,176 cases," the ministry said.Ri Bhoi showed a staggering 141-per cent rise in the number of fresh cases over the last four weeks and four districts -- East Garo Hills (28 per cent), South Garo Hills (20 per cent), Ri Bhoi (33 per cent) and West Garo Hills (11 per cent) -- had a positivity rate of over 10 per cent in the week ending July 4.

07-07-2021||New Delhi||ED attaches 3 Gurugram plots in money laundering case against Unitech Group||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday said it has attached a clutch of land parcels in Haryana worth over Rs 106 crore in connection with its money laundering probe against realty firm Unitech Group and its promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra.  The federal investigative agency said in a statement that a provisional order for attachment of the three immovable properties located in Gurugram near here has been issued under criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The total worth of these land properties is Rs 106.08 crore."These parcels had been purchased by two dummy entities of the Chandras, namely Erode Projects Pvt Limited and Kore communities Pvt Limited, from the companies of Unitech Group," it said.The agency said its probe found that the land parcels were "purchased by the two companies from the proceeds of crime generated out of scheduled offence." "Both these companies are controlled by the promoters of Unitech Group and proceeds of crime have been transferred to these companies after substantial layering in Singapore and the Cayman Islands," the ED alleged.The ED early this year filed a criminal case under various sections of the PMLA against the Unitech Group and its promoters over allegations that the Chandras illegally diverted over Rs 2,000 crore to Cyprus and the Cayman Islands.The case was booked after the ED studied some FIRs filed by the Delhi Police Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on the complaint by a number of homebuyers against the Unitech Group, including an instance where the company failed to complete a housing project on time in Gurugram. "Total proceeds of crime in this case is Rs 5,063.05 crore as determined till now," the agency said.The ED also carried out raids in this case on March 4 at 35 locations of the Shivalik Group, Trikar Group, Unitech Group and Carnoustie Group in Mumbai and the national capital region (NCR) after the registration of the case."After analysis of the seized records followed by the disclosures of various persons, the above diversion of proceeds of crime has been unearthed," it alleged.The total attachment in this case now stands at Rs 537 crore as two similar orders were earlier issued that froze assets worth about Rs 431 crore. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-3-gurugram-plots-in-money-laundering-case-against-unitech-group-279564
07-07-2021||Mumbai||TRP rigging case: 3 Republic TV employees get anticipatory bail||A sessions court here on Wednesday granted anticipatory bail to three Republic TV employees in connection with the alleged Television Rating Points (TRP) rigging scam.The three employees - Shivendu Mulherkar, Ranjit Walter and Sivasubramaniyam Sundaram - had filed their pleas before the court in November-December last year, their lawyer Vikram Kamath said.The court heard the pleas on Monday, he said.On Wednesday, Additional Sessions Judge A D Deo allowed the anticipatory bail applications of the three employees, their lawyer said.They had submitted before the court there was no ground against them (for arrest) and they were not named in the FIR registered in the case.Subsequently, a charge sheet was filed, and they were named as accused. So, whatever material was there, it was before the court. Hence, their custodial interrogation was not required, Kamath had argued.In a supplementary charge sheet filed in the case in June this year, the Mumbai police had named the three as accused, along with senior journalist and Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami.The alleged fake TRP scam came to light in October last year when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group (HRG), alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers.The HRG had been tasked with installing barometers for recording channel viewership data at sample households.Police had arrested about dozens of people, including top officials of the BARC and Republic TV. Most of them are currently out on bail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trp-rigging-case-3-republic-tv-employees-get-anticipatory-bail-279563
07-07-2021||Kolkata||PM Modi should hold ‘petrol ki baat’ instead of ‘Mann ki baat’: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “making a mess of the country’s economy” and urged him to hold ‘petrol and vaccine ki baat’ instead of ‘Mann ki baat’.Referring to the proposed Union Cabinet reshuffle, the chief minister, during a press meet here, said the removal of Babul Supriyo from the council of ministers shows that “they (BJP government) have also lost it even before the arrival of their end” in 2024.Noting that none of the letters she wrote to the PM evoked any response, Banerjee said despite appeals for Jagdeep Dhankhar’s removal as governor, nothing was done about it.“The entire economy is in doldrums. Fuel prices are increasing every day and the Union government is sitting idle. Our prime minister is only busy with his Mann ki Baat. He should instead hold petrol ki baat, diesel ki baat and vaccine ki baat,” she insisted.Asked about the possibility of BJP MP John Barla’s induction in the Union ministry, weeks after he demanded a separate Union territory for North Bengal, Banerjee said it will reflect the “divisive mindset” of the saffron party.“I won’t comment on ministry reshuffle. Will reshuffle end the woes of the people?” she added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-should-hold-petrol-ki-baat-instead-of-mann-ki-baat-mamata-279561
07-07-2021||Singapore||Indian national jailed for injuring compatriot in forklift accident in Singapore||A 34-year-old Indian national has been jailed for two weeks in Singapore for causing an accident which left his compatriot badly injured and had his legs amputated.Periyasamy Vivek pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a charge of causing grievous hurt via a negligent act endangering human life, The Straits Times reported.Court documents stated that the incident occurred at a worksite in Tuas South Boulevard on March 23 last year, when he was working as a supervisor for Sembcorp Marine, a shipyard.On that day, he was tasked to use a forklift to move concrete blocks, each weighing 5,000 kilogrammes.The accused knew that he had to keep a safe distance from others, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Shin Hui, adding that if his line of sight in front was impeded, he had to operate the forklift in reverse.At about 3.30 pm, Periyasamy loaded a concrete block and several wooden wedges onto the forklift.He reversed the vehicle, but realised that he would hit some paint cans if he continued doing so. He decided to go forward despite having his vision obstructed by the load.At that time, victim Sevugaperumal Balamurugan, who was working at the site, was heading to a toilet. The 36-year-old Indian national was employed by Entraco Engineering, a subcontractor of Sembcorp Marine.He noted that the oncoming forklift was moving at a slow speed and continued on his way.But the vehicle picked up speed and the concrete block hit his left hip, causing him to fall backwards onto the ground.Periyasamy stepped on the brakes but the forklift was unable to stop immediately due to its weight and the cargo it was carrying and ran over both the victim’s legs.Sevugaperumal was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where he was found to have multiple fractures to his lower limbs.He was transferred to the National University Hospital, where his legs were amputated above the knees. He was hospitalised for 11 days. He was later fitted with prosthetics at another hospital.For causing grievous hurt via a negligent act endangering human life, Periyasamy could have been jailed up to two years, or fined up to Singapore dollars 5,000, or both.

07-07-2021||---||SC asks Centre, states to file compliance report on its 2019 verdict to fill vacancies at CIC, SICs||ZCZCPRI GEN LGL NAT.NEWDELHI LGD6New Delhi, July 7The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Centre and states to file status reports in four weeks on compliance with its 2019 verdict for time-bound filling up of posts of Information Commissioners at CIC and state panels under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.In an important verdict on transparency law, the apex court had come out with a slew of directions on February 15 and ordered that the selection process to fill vacancies at the Central Information Commission (CIC) and State Information Commissions (SICs) should begin two months before they arise and the search committee should select people of eminence from various fields and not be limited to bureaucrats.A bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari noted that the Centre's last status report on compliance was filed over a year ago and asked Additional Solicitor General Madhvi Divan to file a fresh one on the status of vacancies, the steps taken to fill them and observance of other directions.“Respondents, Union of India and states, are directed to file the latest status and compliance reports within four weeks from today. List after four weeks... Petitioner (RTI activist Anjali Bhadwaj) is also permitted to file an additional affidavit in the meantime,” the bench said in its order.The top court also permitted lawyer Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the activist, to file additional affidavit in the case after he sought a direction that the Centre be asked to file the dissent note of Leader of Opposition Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury who was part of the appointment panel which includes the Prime Minister and the Home Minister.He said Chowdhury, during the meeting of the selection committee, had raised the issue of not being provided with the selection criteria for the CIC and ICs.Bhushan also said that the Centre should be directed to put on record the criteria for shortlisting of candidates for appointment as CIC and ICs and information such as the existing vacancies and the names of persons who had applied for the posts.The top court was hearing the plea of the RTI activist seeking implementation of the 2019 verdict on appointments to the CIC and SICs under the Act.Bhardwaj has also sought a direction to government authorities on the implementation of the top court's order asking them to appoint information commissioners.At the outset, Bhushan said an application has been filed for filling up vacancies in CIC and SICs.“Directions were given in 2020 that these posts need to be filled up well in time. Another important direction was issued. The court had deprecated the practice of selecting only bureaucrats or having a selection committee made up only of bureaucrats,” he said.He said there have been vacancies in SICs in states like Maharashtra, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal and there was a need to implement the directions of this court in entirety.He alleged that around 75,000 and 36,000 cases under RTI are pending adjudication in Maharashtra SIC and the CIC respectively and the efforts have been made to render the RTI legislation ineffective.Seeking selection criteria on record, Bhushan alleged that a “bogus journalist” has been appointed in the CIC and moreover, only bureaucrats are being considered for such appointments.The ASG opposed the submissions and the term “bogus journalist” used by Bhushan and asked him to file an affidavit to this effect for soliciting a response from the Centre.“They cannot make accusations or call the members bogus journalists. The maximum strength is up to 10 members. That doesn't mean that there are vacancies. Right now we have 7 members,” the law officer said.The apex court, in 2019, had said the selection of information officers for the CIC and SICs should include people of eminence from various fields and not be limited to bureaucrats, a "bias" which is "writ large" in the current selection process.It had said Parliament intended persons of eminence in public life be taken as CIC as well ICs but a "strange phenomenon is happening", that those persons who have been selected belong to only one category which is public service.It had also said that to bring transparency in selection of ICs, states should adopt the Centre's process in which it uploads on the website the names of the Search Committee, the names of the candidates who have been shortlisted as well as the criteria followed for selection.The top court had then directed the Centre and eight states—West Bengal, Orissa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka—to fill up the vacancies without any delay within a period of one to six months. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-states-to-file-compliance-report-on-its-2019-verdict-to-fill-vacancies-at-cic-sics-279554

He was 98."The demise of Mohammad Yusuf Khan (Dilip Kumar), who earned money in the film world by keeping a Hindu name, is an irreparable loss to the Indian film industry. Deepest condolences to the bereaved family. God give peace to the departed soul. Heartfelt tribute!" Yadav posted in Hindi from his Twitter handle.Kumar was born Yousuf Khan in Peshawar on December 11, 1922. His new name and new identity was given to him by Devika Rani, who was head of Bombay Talkies at the time and was of the view that a screen name would help audiences relate to him.Yadav was trolled by many Twitter users, who slammed him for "unnecessarily" bringing in Kumar's religion while paying tributes to him.When contacted, a state BJP spokesperson said he was yet to read what Yadav had posted.Kumar, who embodied the best of India through his films and seven decades in public life, died after prolonged illness.The actor, known to generations of film-goers as "tragedy king" for his portrayal of the brooding, intense romantic in classics such as "Mughal-e-Azam" and "Devdas", is survived by his wife Saira Banu. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Urmila Matondkar has slammed Haryana BJP's social media and IT wing chief for taking a shot at Dilip Kumar who passed away this morning. He was 98.   Arun Yadav—whose Twitter bio reads "State IT & Social Media Head" for the BJP in Haryana—wrote: "The death of Mohammad Yusuf Khan (Dilip Kumar), who earned money by keeping a Hindu name in the film world, is an irreparable loss to the Indian film industry! Deepest condolences to the bereaved family!""God give peace to the departed soul," the tweet continued.Shame on you 👎  Actor-turned-politician Urmila Matondkar, a popular actress who entered politics with the Congress ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, hit back with a caustic three-word tweet."Shame on you," she wrote, with a 'thumbs down' emoji for added effect.Dilip Kumar died on Wednesday in Mumbai after a prolonged illness.A tweet posted from the actor's official handle by family friend Faisal Farooqui read: "With a heavy heart and profound grief, I announce the passing away of our beloved Dilip saab a few minutes ago.

07-07-2021||New Delhi||Two men part of international investment scam held by Delhi Police||Two men were arrested in connection with an international cheating racket that induced people to invest online in wine and spice trade and duped them of Rs 25 crore, police said on Wednesday.The men arrested have been identified as Nagaraju Karmanchi (31), a resident of Gurgaon in Haryana, and Kondala Subash (31), a resident of Secunderabad in Telangana, they said.Several Indian SIM cards being used in this racket were found active in China, police said.According to the police, a complaint was received wherein the complainant stated that he met a person, Soo Yeon Park, allegedly a South Korean national, on a dating app.He was promised huge returns on his investment, and initially more than 20 percent returns were given to him in three to four days on his investment of Rs 5,000, they said.The complainant said he was asked to visit and make an account on a website, a senior police officer said. The money he invested was deposited by accused persons in four separate accounts of different companies, including Golden Mark Technologies Private Limited, he said.“On July 1, raids were conducted and Subhash, who was one of the directors of Golden Mark Technologies Private Limited, was arrested from Secunderabad and Karmanchi, who was in touch with Chinese nationals and also operated the bank accounts, was arrested from Gurgaon,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) R P Meena said.Investigation revealed that Karmanchi created at least 10 different companies whose bank accounts were used by Chinese nationals. He was in touch with them and presently working as dummy director in an online short-term loan company whose real owners are Chinese nationals, the DCP said.Karmanchi used to work as per directions of Chinese nationals and operated a number of fake bank accounts, police said.Thirty mobile phones, seven laptops, fifty SIM cards, six debit cards, among others, were seized from Karmanchi and Subash's possession, they said.Chinese nationals contacted people through social media. They assured a victim that financial markets in India are not good and if they want good returns for their money, they need to invest in wine or spice trade, police said.The accused shared the uniform resource locator (URL) of their fake websites for investing money and asked victims to invest only a small amount. Initially, they would give good returns -- to the tune of 20 percent -- on these small amounts, the police said.The victims invested more money and saw their returns grew multifold. They were asked to enroll for a membership to get more returns. If they wanted to withdraw money, they were asked to wait for a specific time or to take a specified membership, police said.However, when the victims could not take out the money, they realised that they have been cheated, the police said, adding this way the victims were duped to the tune of Rs 25 crore.It was revealed that the Chinese nationals hired people across India to set up companies so that they would be able to open current bank accounts with high transaction capacity, the police officer said.If some bank accounts of the Chinese nationals were not functioning, they directed their men in India to purchase cryptocurrency. The money was also being routed out of India through shell companies, he said.The members of this investment cheating scam are being identified and raids are carried out all over India to bust the gang, police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-men-part-of-international-investment-scam-held-by-delhi-police-279551

They duped people to the tune of over Rs 1 crore in the district," Superintendent of Police (SP) S Anand said.He said on June 30, one Nabe Hasan gave a complaint at the Tilhar police station alleging that Bhupendra Singh had taken Rs 3.70 lakh from him for a job in the Indian Army.The complainant alleged that when there was no recruitment in the Army, he asked the accused for his money, which he had arranged by selling land, but the latter refused to oblige.An FIR was lodged on the basis of the complaint at the Tilhar police station on July 4 and the four accused were arrested, the SP said.The police have seized fake appointment letters, caste certificates, laptops and fake walkie-talkie sets from the possession of the accused.The SP said during interrogation, the accused told the police that one Abhishek of Bhind was the kingpin of the gang and had appointed them as his agents in Shahjhanpur.They used to take Rs 5-6 lakh from a candidate promising him a job in the Army and sent Rs 3 lakh from it to Abhishek, who used to arrange for the candidate's fake physical test, the SP said.A detailed probe in the matter is on and the police are trying to arrest Abhishek and five other members of the gang. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/four-held-for-duping-people-by-promising-jobs-in-army-in-ups-shahjahanpur-279542
07-07-2021||New Delhi||5G roll out: Delhi HC grants week to Juhi Chawla to deposit Rs 20 lakh in costs||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted a week to Bollywood actress Juhi Chawla and two others to deposit Rs 20 lakh in costs imposed on them for abusing the process of law by way of their lawsuit challenging 5G wireless network technology.“The court is shocked at the conduct of the plaintiffs,” Justice J R Midha said, as he observed that Chawla and others were “not even willing to gracefully deposit the costs”.The judge was hearing three applications moved by the actor for refund of court fees, waiver of costs and replacing the word “dismissed” in the judgement with “rejected”.The court's reaction came after Chawla's counsel, Senior Advocate Meet Malhotra's, after withdrawing the application for waiver of costs, said that costs would either be deposited in a week or ten days, or legal remedies against the same would be taken.“On one hand you move a frivolous application and on the other hand, you withdraw the application and plaintiffs are not even willing to gracefully deposit the costs,” the court said.The court stated that it, in fact, took a lenient view when it imposed costs of Rs 20 lakh on Chawla and others and did not initiate contempt proceedings.“I was shocked... This court took a lenient view and did not issue contempt when case was made out... I was totally inclined. You say court had no power to impose costs (but) court has the power to issue contempt,” the court said as it took strong exception to the application.Malhotra clarified that the stand was not that the costs would not be paid, and did not even pressing the application for its waiver.“It is unintended... Today also, this is my instruction that nobody said that they wouldn't. I saw what happened (in the judgement). I fully understand,” he said.The court recorded Malhotra's statement that he sought a weeks' time to deposit costs and that recourse may be taken to avail legal remedies.The application for refund of court fees was also withdrawn by Malhotra.Advocate Deepak Khosla, appearing for Chawla and others, informed that the court fee had already been paid.“I'm yet to see a person in my judicial career a person who is not willing to pay court fees,” the judge remarked as the application was dismissed as withdrawn.“Let bygones be bygones,” Malhotra urged the court.The court ordered that the third application seeking rejection of plaint would be placed before Justice Sanjeev Narula after the deposit of court fees.Malhotra argued that plaint, which “never went up to the level of suit”, could only be rejected or returned in terms of the Civil Procedure Code, and not dismissed.Further, hearing in the case will take place on July 12.In June, the high court had dismissed the lawsuit by Chawla and other others against the setting up of 5G wireless networks in the country and slapped a cost of Rs 20 lakh.The court had described the plea as "defective", "abuse of process of law" and filed for "gaining publicity".Justice Midha said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was "not maintainable" and was "stuffed with unnecessary scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments" which are liable to be struck down.The court said the suit filed by actress-environmentalist and others was to gain publicity which was clear as Chawla circulated the video conferencing link of the hearing on her social media account which resulted in the repeated disruptions thrice by unknown miscreants who continued disruptions despite repeated warnings.The suit sought a direction to the authorities to certify to the public at large that how 5G technology is safe to humans, animals and every type of living organism, flora and fauna.It said that if the telecom industry's plans for 5G came to fruition, no person, animal, bird, insect and plant on earth will be able to avoid exposure, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to levels of RF radiation that are 10x to 100x times greater than what exists today. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5g-roll-out-delhi-hc-grants-week-to-juhi-chawla-to-deposit-rs-20-lakh-in-costs-279537

07-07-2021||New Delhi||'Misleading', says Centre on study claiming 6 patients suffered liver damage due to Giloy use||The Ayush Ministry on Wednesday termed as "misleading" and "disastrous" to the traditional medicine system of India a study relating Giloy to liver damage, noting that the herb has been used in Ayurveda since long.Refuting a media report based on the study published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, a peer reviewed journal of the Indian National Association for the study of the liver, the ministry said it did not take into account other studies that talk about the efficacy of the herb.The study mentions that use of herb TinosporaCordifolia (TC), commonly known as Giloy or Guduchi, resulted in liver failure in six patients in Mumbai.In a statement, the ministry said it feels that the authors of the study failed in placing all needful details of the cases in a systematic format."Apart from this, relating Giloy or TC to liver damage would be misleading and disastrous to the Traditional Medicine system of India as herb Guduchi or Giloy has been used in Ayurveda since long. The efficacy of TC in managing various disorders is well established," it said."After analysing the study, it was also noticed that the authors of the study have not analysed the contents of the herb that was consumed by the patients. It becomes the responsibility of the authors to ascertain that the herb consumed by the patients is TC and not any other herb," the statement said.To build upon the soundness, the authors would have taken the opinion of a botanist or would have consulted an Ayurveda expert, it stated.In fact, there are many studies that point out that identifying the herb not correctly could lead to wrong results.A similar looking herb TinosporoCrispa might have a negative effect on the liver. So, before labelling a herb, such as Giloy, with such toxic nature the authors should have tried to correctly identify the plants following the standard guidelines, which they did not, the ministry said in the statement."Other than this, the study has many flaws in it. It is unclear that what dose the patients had taken or whether they took this herb with other medicines. The study has not taken into account the past or present medical records of the patients."Publications based on incomplete information will open the door for misinformation and defame the age-old practices of Ayurveda," the statement said.It would not be out of context to state here that scientific evidence on medical applications of TC or Giloy as protective to liver, nerves etc. are available. It was found out that 'Guduchi and safety, as key words, alone has some 169 studies available in the public domain.Similarly, a quick search on T. Cordifolia and efficacy, as keywords, will show 871 results. There are other hundreds of studies on Giloy and its safe use, the ministry said.Giloy is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines in Ayurveda. It has proper pharmacopoeia standards in place of established safety of hepato-protective properties. No adverse event is noted in any clinical practice by pharmaco vigilance or in any clinical study."The newspaper article based its entire story on the much limited and misleading study without taking into account the voluminous peer reviewed, robust studies that speak for the efficacy of T.Cordifolia and without consulting any reputed Ayurveda expert or the Ministry of Ayush," the statement said.

He was 98."Saddened to learn of Dilip Kumar's passing. I can never forget his generosity in giving his time to help raise funds for SKMTH when (the) project launched. This is the most difficult time - to raise (the) first 10% of the funds & his appearance in Pak & London helped raise huge amounts," Khan tweeted."Apart from this, for my generation Dilip Kumar was the greatest and most versatile actor," he said.Apart from this, for my generation Dilip Kumar was the greatest and most versatile actor.Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centres are state-of-the-art cancer centres located in Lahore and Peshawar.SKMCH&RC, Lahore was the first project of the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust, which was the brainchild of the cricketer-turned-politician Khan.The inspiration to build the hospital came after his mother, Shaukat Khanum, succumbed to cancer in 1985.Kumar was born on December 11, 1922 at his family home in the Qissa Khawani Bazaar area of Peshawar.The Pakistan government has already declared his native house as a national heritage and completed all formalities to convert it into a museum in his name.Kumar, known to generations of film-goers as 'tragedy king' for his portrayal of the brooding, intense romantic in classics such as 'Mughal-e-Azam' and 'Devdas', had been admitted to the Hinduja Hospital, a non-COVID-19 facility in Khar, since last Tuesday.Kumar, born Yousuf Khan and often known as the Nehruvian hero, did his first film 'Jwar Bhata' in 1944 and his last 'Qila' in 1998, 54 years later. The five-decade career included 'Mughal-e-Azam', 'Devdas', 'Naya Daur', and 'Ram Aur Shyam', and later, as he graduated to character roles, 'Shakti' and 'Karma'. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-recalls-dilip-kumars-generosity-pays-tribute-to-the-legendary-indian-actor-279513

07-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi's NO2 pollution increased by 125 pc in one year: Study||Delhi recorded an increase of 125 per cent in NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) pollution between April 2020 and April 2021, according to a Greenpeace India study which analysed NO2 concentrations in India's eight most-populous state capitals.NO2 pollution has increased in all the eight capitals studied – Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur and Lucknow – but Delhi has seen the “most dramatic increase” during the period, the report said.NO2 is a dangerous air pollutant that is released when fuel is burned, as in most motor vehicles, power generation, and industrial processes.Exposure to NO2 can severely impact people's health at all ages, affecting the respiratory and circulatory systems and the brain, leading to an increase in hospital admissions and mortality."Satellite observations reveal NO2 pollution increased to 125 per cent of April 2020 levels. The analysis suggests the increase would have been even greater (146 percent) had weather conditions been similar to 2020," read the report, titled “Behind the Smokescreen: Satellite Data Reveal Air Pollution Increase in India's Eight Most Populous State Capitals”.Although relatively better than the capital, other Indian cities too recorded an equally worrying increase in NO2 levels.NO2 pollution increased by 52 per cent in Mumbai, 90 per cent in Bengaluru, 69 per cent in Hyderabad, 94 per cent in Chennai, 11 per cent in Kolkata, 47 per cent in Jaipur and 32 per cent in Lucknow in April 2021 compared to the same month last year, the study showed.As the pandemic continues to have a severe impact on India during 2021, there is growing evidence that polluted cities suffer disproportionately more coronavirus cases.The health impact of fossil fuel-related air pollution is severe and has been reflected time and again in several reports. Yet there has been little change in our reliance on fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas. Increased economic activity is still largely coupled with toxic air pollution in most cities, Greenpeace India said.“The air quality levels in these cities are alarming. The cities and the people are already paying a huge price for our reliance on burning fossil fuels, this business as usual cannot continue. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic," said Avinash Chanchal, senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace India."The disruption caused by the pandemic is a case to transition to cleaner, equitable and sustainable decentralised energy sources such as rooftop solar and clean and sustainable mobility must be central to recovery efforts across cities. The recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution," he added."Motor vehicles and industries based on fossil fuel consumption are the major drivers of NO2 pollution in Indian cities. The governments, local administration and city planners must initiate the transition from privately owned vehicles to an efficient, clean and safe public transport system that is run on clean energy that of course, must provide Covid-19-related safety measures," Chanchal said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-no2-pollution-increased-by-125-pc-in-one-year-study-279504

Sources, however, say preference will be given to “administrative experience, qualifications and performance of MPs as grassroots leaders”. “Women, Dalits, and members of the OBC community are likely to be given preference in the new council." “There will be younger, educated faces. MPs from Dalit and OBC communities and women will be given more representation,” sources say.

07-07-2021||In a conversation with The Tribune’s Ravi S Singh||Vested interests launched misinformation campaign, tried to mislead farmers: Anurag Thakur||Q: The country has seen turbulence since CAA, what with long spells of agitation, followed by farmers’ agitation. In a country driven by groups and lobbies with vested interests, how big is the impact of the periodic agitations in the country?A: Vested interest groups launched a misinformation campaign and attempted to mislead farmers. People with malicious intentions will never succeed in disrupting the peace and harmony of India.The Narendra Modi government has worked for the betterment of the agricultural sector as a whole and towards the goal of doubling the farmer’s income. Since the inception of the PM-KISAN scheme, we have disbursed a total of Rs 1,35,000 crores directly into their bank accounts. This amount is higher than any loan waiver amounts that few state governments announce during their election campaigns.We have announced record procurement of Rabi and Kharif crops during the current year. Over 432.48 LMT of Wheat has been procured which is an all-time high figure and 45.06 lakh farmers have already benefitted from the ongoing Rabi Marketing Season procurement operations with MSP value of INR 85,413 crores.It is worth noting that this money has been directly transferred into the bank accounts of the farmers without any leakages or cuts and it is the first time this has happened in Punjab which is a historic achievement in itself.We are also procuring record paddy with purchase of over 805.21 LMT of paddy till now with about 119.42 lakh farmers benefitting from the Kharif Marketing Season procurement operations of INR 1,52,022.37 crores.We have also increased the existing fertiliser subsidy from INR 27,000 crores to INR 42,275 crores in FY 2021-22.Let me add, we have been democratic with the consultation process, prior to bringing the bringing the bills in the House and also by inviting them during the recent agitations. The historic farm laws will benefit every single farmer of this nation and there are few stakeholder groups who are protesting these laws because of their sinister interests.Q: PM’s thrust is on Rural Development with a large number of social welfare intervention schemes like Swachh Bharat-Gramin, Jal Jeevan Mission, Jan Dhan, etc. How will this overall help the economy? Can you name some States which have shown signs of progress in their economy?A: The schemes we have announced have a major thrust on rural development and our goal is the upliftment of people out of poverty. All of our socio-economic schemes are formulated with this vision and target in mind.Whether it is Ujjwala Yojana, PM Jan Dhan Yojana, Swachh Bharat Mission, PM Awas Yojana or the Jal Jeevan Mission, we are always striving to create better livelihood for our citizens and to bridge the gap between the classes. We have expanded job opportunities for the youth. Our cleanliness drive has created more toilets that were missing since the last 70 years. From food security to housing, from job creation to healthcare, from financial inclusion to insurance - we have adopted a holistic approach towards social welfare. Every initiative has a multiplier effect, on the individuals welfare and society as a whole. Further, it has ensured transparency, deliverability and accountability within the system.Q: Government has rationalised the 44 labour laws into four Codes. Will this promote industrial peace as majority of the Central Trade Unions, especially Left-leaning ones says the four Codes were rushed and passed in Parliament?A: The historic consolidation of the 44 labour laws under 4 categories was seen as a much needed and a long-pending reform. These laws were discussed thoroughly in the committee meetings and then in both houses of Parliament.They will lead to Ease of Doing Business as the archaic labour regulations were not fit for an India Inc of the 21st Century. This will help us attract investments and we can promote India as a one- stop destination for investment, manufacturing and exports.Q: Atmanirbahar Bharat is a mantra given by the PM. Can you please quantify and also make qualitative assessment of the implementation of PM’s call?A: AtmaNirbhar Bharat is not just a vision but a strategic goal with a clearly defined roadmap. The reforms announced last year are in that direction, each on of them will have a multiplier effect on various sectors. Our motto of Vocal for Local aims to project Indian enterprises, entrepreneurs at the global level through their products and services.We have begun reaping the benefits of AtmaNirbhar Bharat, even during COVID, India transformed from an importer of PPEs and masks to amongst the worlds largest exporters.Further, we announced the creation of an Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to the tune of INR 1 lakh crore which will fund farm-gate infrastructure and aggregation points. We approved the PLI scheme in 10 key sectors with a total proposed outlay of INR 1.97 lakh crore over the next 5 years. Some of the sectors in which the PLI scheme has been started are Textiles, Electronics Manufacturing, Specialty Steel, Food Processing etc. We rolled out the Faceless Assessment Scheme which will eliminate the human interface between the taxpayer and the income-tax departmentQ: The Opposition says the Government has failed to manage the Covid pandemic, especially the third wave. Is the government exchequer full enough to soak in the possible third wave of the pandemic which is predicted by experts?A: The Opposition has first questioned India’s vaccines, then spread vaccine hesitancy, indulged in rampant wastage and later miserably failed to vaccinate the population in their respective states. Modi government has taken all measures to ensure vaccine accessibility and provided the vaccines to everyone free of cost. The growing momentum of the vaccination program will further bring normalcy and economic revival.Along with RBI’s support, we have ensured that liquidity is not a concern for our businesses, especially MSMEs. Last week, we revised the guidelines for MSMEs with inclusion of retail and wholesale trade as MSMEs which will benefit 2.5 crore retail and wholesale traders.Q: In your assessment, name one model of governance of Modi- dispensation which is markedly different from non-BJP government.A: Our Government’s hallmark is transparency and accountability. Unlike the previous UPA regime, there has been no corruption in this government, projects are delivered on time and there is zero leakage. With the massive digitalisation that is underway, we have ensured various documentations are uploaded online, processed in a time bound manner and approved. The bidding process is also online now with e-tendering. Further, we have taken several steps such as geo-tagging of MGNREGA projects and linking of Jan Dhan accounts with the Aadhaar number which brings transparency to governance.Q: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to make India a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025. Now, is the target realistic in the backdrop of a dip in the economy due to Covid lockdowns and turbulence?A: We remain committed towards making India a US$ 5 trillion economy despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic. After the first wave hit, we bounced back remarkably and from October to April, we were showing improvement in all sectors. Even as the second wave recedes in terms of case load, we are again seeing green shoots and growth in various metrics. This is a sign of a resilient India and a testament to India’s entrepreneurial spirit and zeal.Q: Is there any silver lining visible with regard to efforts to revive the economy?A: Our macroeconomic indicators remain fundamentally strong and are capable of withholding any exogenous shocks. We are carrying out the universal vaccination program at a remarkable pace which will aid the economic recovery. We recorded 8 consecutive months of INR 1 lakh plus collection in the GST figures, we saw an increase of 66 per cent in the direct tax collection year on year. The demand of power, automobiles, steel all show an uptick and I am confident of India’s recovery to be quick and buoyant.Q: There are upcoming crucial elections, including UP and Punjab.What are BJP’s prospects, and why?A: Our prospects look extremely promising in the upcoming elections. Especially the way in which the Hon’ble CM of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adityanath ji has handled the pandemic situation in the second wave.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vested-interests-launched-misinformation-campaign-tried-to-mislead-farmers-anurag-thakur-279499

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said that state officials should speak to their counterparts in Bihar, as there is a significant movement of devotees between our two states, and ensure that there are no violations of Covid protocols. The home department has been asked to formulate a detailed guideline for regulating the yatra this year," said a government spokesperson.He said that even as Uttarakhand was closed for Kanwar yatra, Shiva devotees in Uttar Pradesh had several holy sites they could visit to bring back Ganga Jal.Taking cue from the previous year, the government is likely to put in restrictions on the number of devotees allowed in temples at the same time.An official said that it is likely that not more than five persons will be allowed inside temples at a time. Social distancing and wearing of masks will also be compulsory.The Kanwar yatra takes place during the Hindu month of Shrawan spread over July and August.

The pop star has been under the comprehensive conservatorship of her father following her breakdown more than a decade ago.The spiritual guru — Kailas Natarajan — had moved the Supreme Court challenging a Kerala High Court order rejecting his habeas corpus petition seeking the release of his 21-year-old woman he called his spiritual partner.Noting that the petitioner’s credentials were suspect, the Bench said: The girl is in fragile state of mind. She is 21 and does not know what she is doing. The man (spiritual guru) is married and has two children.”The facts of the case and the petitioner’s antecedents did not inspire confidence, it added.

Swamy10 parties seek actionThe MEA, however, said all actions were strictly in accordance with the law and Father Swamy was arrested and detained by the NIA after following due process.The most trenchant criticism came from the UNHRC whose President Michelle Bachelet had suffered torture in prison while her elderly father had died in custody due to an ailment.“We are deeply saddened and disturbed that he died as the Bombay High Court was considering an appeal against the rejection of his bail application,” said her office in a lengthy statement.UN’s Special Rapporteurs, she noted, had repeatedly raised the cases of Father Stan and 15 other rights defenders and urged their release from pre-trial detention.The Jesuit priest’s incarceration also came under attack from rights bodies associated with the US and the EU. Nadine Maenza, chief of US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), noted that Father Stan was a rights activist imprisoned on “false terrorism charges”, but denied bail as his health deteriorated.UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders Mary Lawlor described the news about his death as “devastating”. Noting that he died nine months after his arrest, Lawlor said jailing rights defenders was “inexcusable”.EU’s Special Representative for Human Rights Eamon Gilmore said he was “very saddened.”The MEA said, “The authorities in India act against violations of law, and not against legitimate exercise of rights. India’s democratic and constitutional polity is complemented by independent judiciary, range of human rights bodies.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-eu-rights-bodies-call-father-stan-swamys-death-devastating-no-rule-violated-says-india-279350

Of the total 265 members present in the Assembly, 196 MLAs voted in favour of the resolution while 69 voted against it.‘Didi trying for backdoor entry’Some TMC ministers, including the Chief Minister, have lost in the Assembly elections. They are trying for back-door entry through the Vidhan Parishad. - Suvendu Adhikari, BJP LeaderThe formation of a Legislative Council was one of the poll promises that featured in the TMC manifesto. Soon after the Assembly elections, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had approved the proposal.Mamata was not present in the House during the voting.BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari opposed the resolution saying it would not be good for the exchequer and that it was a move to accommodate TMC leaders in the council.“Vidhan Parishad is not there in 23 states. This is not good for smart governance. Some TMC ministers, including the CM, have lost in the Assembly elections. They are trying for backdoor entry through the Vidhan Parishad,” Adhikari said.“The BJP has a majority in Parliament. Our stand is to oppose this resolution,” Adhikari added. In order to set up the council, a Bill has to be passed in Parliament.Meanwhile, Banerjee said, “The Centre has failed to meet the vaccine requirements of the state, forcing her dispensation to make purchases on its own and described Narendra Modi as “a shameless Prime Minister” who has his picture pasted everywhere — from hoardings to inoculation certificates.Banerjee, during her address in the Assembly, said, “Bengal has received two crore shots so far, which is very inadequate, given the state’s population, and administering free doses to all under such circumstances was a challenge for her government.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-house-passes-resolution-to-create-legislative-council-279368

Today, we are quite sensibly seeing the landscape for what it really is. Indo-Pacific reflects the reality of globalisation, the emergence of multipolarity and the benefits of rebalancing,” he observed.The minister flagged three issues that the pandemic has brought to the fore: the salience of health, the power of digital and the importance of building or rebuilding green.The Covid may have slowed the building of the global economy and the promotion of economic recovery, but it has not stopped it. “This is, therefore, an occasion to reflect, perhaps introspect on how to build green,” he observed.On agriculture, he said the government’s effort to empower farmers and enable freer trade has been matched by a stronger commitment to post-harvest infrastructure.“Across 13 key sectors, performance-linked initiatives promise to upscale manufacturing. Bold measures have just recently been taken to promote tourism. And not least, in making it much easier to do business,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-be-engine-of-growth-for-global-economy-jaishankar-279373

The provisional patent for the prototype was filed in May.Disha further said: “During simulation and prototyping, a few observations had been made for the project, which slightly deviate from the proposed solution.”“The solution becomes a network of nodes, where one node comprises a high quality microphone, controller, and an ultrasonic buzzer. Another node comprises a digital screen with a controller. There could be multiple nodes to transmit data,” she said.Disha also mentioned that the device could be mounted on a lonely street pole and one of its nodes might be installed at a nearby police station or beatbox.“In this case, one node should have a GSM and GPRS module to transmit location of the victim to the police station. Simultaneously, the ultrasonic buzzer will play after identifying the scream,” she said.“The device can also be put to use in a school or college campus. Multiple nodes can be installed on the corridors of campus. There is no need for the GSM and GPRS modules in this case, as the device can send location by using the campus WiFi. One node may be installed at the college/school authority check posts.”The live testing of the device could not be conducted due to the Covid pandemic. “Live testing will be conducted in near future, and probably the trial of the device will be launched in school or university campuses. Modifications will be done on the basis of the feedback,” said Disha.How the system worksIt analyses the scream patterns and sends signals to nearby police stations within a minimum time (from six seconds to nine seconds). For making a distress call, a person does not have to use any application, just a scream will activate the system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-at-panjab-university-make-scream-detecting-device-to-prevent-crime-against-women-279171

All such actions are strictly in accordance with the law,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.His comments came in response to media queries on the demise of Stan Swamy.In view of Father Stan Swamy’s ailing health, the Bombay High Court had allowed his medical treatment at a private hospital where he was receiving all possible medical attention since May 28, Bagchi said.The MEA spokesperson said Swamy’s health and medical treatment was being closely monitored by the courts and he passed away on July 5 following medical complications.“India’s democratic and constitutional polity is complemented by an independent judiciary, a range of national and state level human rights commissions that monitor violations, a free media and a vibrant and vocal civil society,” Bagchi said.“India remains committed to promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens,” he added.Earlier, the UN body on human rights said it was “deeply saddened and disturbed” by the death of 84-year-old activist in pre-trial detention.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and the UN’s independent experts have repeatedly raised the cases of Swamy and 15 other human rights defenders with the government of India over the past three years and urged their release from detention, it said.“We are deeply saddened and disturbed by the death of 84-year-old Father Stan Swamy, a human rights defender and Jesuit priest, in Mumbai yesterday, following his arrest in October 2020 under India’s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,” Liz Throssell, the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said.“Father Stan had been held in pre-trial detention without bail since his arrest, charged with terrorism-related offences in relation to demonstrations that date back to 2018,” she said in a statement.

More representation is likely to be given to women, Dalits and OBCs. Allies JD-U, Apna Dal and breakaway faction of LJP are also expected to be accommodated.  BJP leaders Sarbananda Sonowal, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Narayan Rane, all of whom are being seen as probable for induction as ministers in the Modi government, arrived in the national capital on Tuesday amid indications that the Union Council of Ministers is likely to be expanded on Wednesday.Read also: Ahead of Union Cabinet reshuffle, Bandaru Dattatreya appointed Haryana governor, Rajendran Arlekar that of HimachalModi government creates new Ministry of Co-operation for realising vision of 'sahkar se samriddhi'In another pointer to the imminent Cabinet reshuffle, Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot was appointed as Karnataka governor, causing yet another ministerial vacancy.JD(U) leader R C P Singh and LJP's Pashupati Kumar Paras, both of whom are expected to represent the BJP's allies in the government, also reached here from Bihar.All of them remained tight-lipped to queries about their possibility of joining the government. Rane told reporters that he had not received any call about his joining the government.Leaders of the LJP faction headed by Paras said he had received a call from Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday but claimed that it was related to the birth anniversary of party founder Ram Vilas Paswan.Modi's review of the works of his ministers, early next year assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur and Punjab and the Covid pandemic that has been a factor in the internal evaluation of the party's governance and organisational works are likely to weigh heavy in the expected reshuffle.Representation of BJP MPs from West Bengal and the Northeast may go up.Against the massive review exercise within the central government and the party machinery, the prime minister may go for new faces with an eye on grooming younger leaders while also factoring in caste and regional balances.The reshuffles undertaken by Modi so far, all in his first term, have also seen some ministers being dropped or removed from key portfolios on account of their performance.The prime minister has also sprung surprises in the past by inducting those with apolitical background, like S Jaishankar and Hardeep Singh Puri, as ministers.A party source said it is likely to be a "big shakeup" and members of the party organisation may be brought in the government.Names of Bhupender Yadav, Anil Baluni, Sudhanshu Trivedi are doing the rounds while BJP MPs Sushil Modi, Ashwini Vaishnav and G V L Narasimha Rao are also being mentioned as probables.BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh met party president J P Nadda in the evening. Former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje also met Santhosh.With Gehlot set to quit as an MP after becoming governor, his departure will also leave the key post of the leader of the House in Rajya Sabha vacant.It will leave one more position vacant in the BJP's Parliamentary Board, the party's apex body, where he is the only Dalit leader.Incidentally, top RSS brass, including its chief Mohan Bhagwat and joint general secretaries Krishna Gopal and Manmohan Vaidya, was also in the city for the last few days.The BJP has often factored in the feedback from the RSS in its key decisions.

07-07-2021||New Delhi||SC cites Britney case, nixes guru’s plea for custody of woman||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a plea by a 42-year-old spiritual guru from Kerala seeking release of his 21-year-old live-in partner from her parents’ alleged illegal custody.A bench headed by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana cited the case of pop star Britney Spears, who has been fighting a legal battle in the US to free herself from the conservatorship of her father.Refusing to entertain the plea, the bench also comprising Justices A.S. Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy noted that the petitioner’s credentials were suspect. The Chief Justice said: “The girl is in fragile state of mind. She is 21 and does not know what she is doing. The man (petitioner) is married with two children.” Additionally, Justice Roy noted the facts are such and the antecedents of the petitioner are such, that it does not inspire confidence.Citing the Spears case, the bench observed that in the US unless an adult gives consent, he or she cannot be given any form of medical or psychiatric treatment. “Now, the entire family is on the road because of that, since a mentally unstable person cannot give consent,” the Chief Justice said.Spears has been under the comprehensive conservatorship of her father, Jamie Spears, following her breakdown around 12 years ago. Recently, billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk had spoken up in support of the pop icon.In the spiritual guru’s case, he had moved the top court challenging a Kerala High Court judgment that had dismissed his habeas corpus plea seeking the release of his 21-year-old partner.Senior Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, representing the petitioner, submitted that the woman is an adult who is being illegally detained by her parents. The bench responded by saying, “There is nothing illegal. She is with her parents.” Citing a plea on parents’ concern about such spiritual gurus, the bench asked Sankaranarayanan, “You also know about some of these gurujis.” With this observation, it refused to interfere in the matter.The bench noted that the petitioner was married with two children, and his mother had also said she did not trust her son. “He is also involved in a POCSO case,” the bench added. POCSO is an abbreviation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, which was enacted in 2012.The apex court asked Sankaranarayanan, “How can we give this girl to this man?” Sankaranarayanan argued that the High Court had adopted a “paternalistic approach” as it denied an adult woman the right to take independent decisions for herself. He clarified that his client did not seek that the woman be allowed to join him, but was only asking for her freedom from the “illegal detention” of her parents.The counsel added that it was a question of the liberty of the woman. The High Court, he said, had erred in making an assessment of the mental capacity of the woman after interacting with her, although under the provision of the Mental Healthcare Act, it was expected to refer the woman for a medical examination.The bench replied, “No parent will say that a 21-year-old has a mental health issue. In India people cover up mental health issues. This is a case where we are clear that the woman should not go with the petitioner.” It added it was not a case of illegal detention because the woman was with her parents.The top court disposed of the matter with a direction to the Registrar General of the Kerala High Court to ask the district judge concerned to interact with the woman and her parents after a month and send a report on her condition to it.

07-07-2021|| New Delhi||Images of people thronging hill stations 'frightening', says Centre||The government on Tuesday cautioned that people roaming in hill stations and markets without following Covid-19-appropriate behaviours can nullify the gains made in the management of the pandemic so far.Stressing that the pandemic was not yet over, an official described the images of large numbers of people thronging popular hill stations as "frightening".Water shortage in Shimla as tourist footfall increasesThe government said violations of Covid protocols will lead to a further increase in infections as it stressed on wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. The second wave of Covid-19 has come down in most states. However, some states are still in the midst of the second wave and the areas reporting a test positivity rate of over 10 per cent have to impose/reinstate restriction measures, it said.Tourists throng Solang, Manali, Rohtang tunnelIn a joint press conference on the pandemic situation and vaccination status, a senior official said as many as 73 districts across 17 states and union territories reported more than 10 per cent Covid positivity rate in the week from June 29 to July 5.A total of 91 districts in the country reported more than 100 daily new cases in the week ending July 4, he said.Eighty per cent Covid cases in India were reported from 90 districts across 14 states and union territories, indicating the need for focused attention in these areas, the official said.With 553 fresh fatalities, India recorded the lowest daily death toll in around 90 days while 34,703 new cases of coronavirus were reported, the lowest in 111 days, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday.With the fresh cases, the total tally of Covid-19 cases climbed to 3,06,19,932, while the death toll climbed to 4,03,281.The active cases further declined to 4,64,357, the lowest in 101 days, and comprise 1.52 per cent of the total infections. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/images-of-people-thronging-hill-stations-frightening-says-centre-279086
07-07-2021||New Delhi||Stan Swamy death: India to face heat from human rights bodies||The circumstances surrounding Father Stan Swamy’s death are set to generate more discomfort for India before international organisations focusing on human rights, especially after chiefs of at least three of them have made public comments in this regard.UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders Mary Lawlor described the news about the Jesuit priest’s death in custody as "devastating", noting that he died nine months after his arrest, Lawlor said jailing human rights defenders was "inexcusable".Ever since Modi 2.0 took office, the criticism against the government has mounted especially after the controversial CAA law and the lockdown in Kashmir. Barely a fortnight back, India had to refute concerns raised by three UN Special Rapporteurs about the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to privacy due to the new IT rules.The criticism from the UN Human Rights Council, which MEA in the past has dismissed as "uninformed", is bound to get trenchant especially because its chief Michelle Bachelet is a victim of state torture while her father died in prison.Nadine Maenza, chief of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) noted that Stan Swamy was an elderly priest and human rights activist imprisoned on "false terrorism charges". She said the USCIRF had spoken out against his arrest and when he was denied bail as his health deteriorated.The USCIRF has already downgraded India on the quality of its human rights and has petitioned the US State Government to sanction some officers who framed the CAA and enforced the lockdown in Kashmir.Of greater concern for India will be the observation from EU Special Representative for Human Rights Eamon Gilmore. "I am very saddened to hear that Father Stan Swamy has passed away. A defender of indigenous peoples’ rights, he was held in detention for the past nine months," he said while revealing that the EU had been raising his case repeatedly with authorities.India had barely got off the hook from the censure of its actions in Kashmir by the European Parliament and has been attempting to edge closer to major countries in the European Union.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stan-swamy-death-india-to-face-heat-from-human-rights-bodies-279072
07-07-2021||New Delhi||Twitter will be in trouble if it fails to comply with India rules: Delhi High Court||In a major setback for Twitter in India, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday pulled up the micro-blogging site for failing to appoint a resident grievance officer (RGO), saying, "How long will your process take place? This cannot be allowed", even as the court free pass to the central government to act against the social media firm.A bench of Justice Rekha Palli told Twitter's counsel, "Come up with a clear response, otherwise, you will be in trouble", and sought information on Twitter's compliance with other provisions of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Rules, 2021) by the next date of hearing.IT rules: Centre moves SC over pleas pending in various high courtsThe high court told central government counsel: "We are not stopping you from taking action, court has not granted any protection to Twitter. If they are in violation, you know what to do." The Centre submitted that Twitter India is in clear violation of IT Rules,2021.The Centre had informed the Delhi High Court that Twitter has failed to comply with the IT Rules, 2021 as of July 1, on four counts: Chief compliance officer not being appointed; The position of the resident grievance officer being vacant; The position of the nodal contact person (even on an interim basis) being vacant; and The physical contact address, which was shown to be there on May 29, was not available on Twitter's website.The central government counsel submitted before the court that Twitter was given a three-month window to comply with IT Rules, but they did not.The counsel added that they are most welcome to do business in India, but they have to comply.The bench said, "I am not giving them any protection. I have already made it clear that they have to comply." Senior Advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter India, submitted that an interim grievance officer was appointed, but he had withdrawn his candidature on June 21. The bench responded that after June 21, and till July 6, the least it could have done was appoint another person."How long does your process take? If Twitter thinks it can take as long it wants in our country, I will not allow that," said the bench.Poovayya sought time to seek instructions on the new appointment, which was allowed by the court, and it passed over the matter. Later, Poovayya submitted that he needs more time to obtain detailed instructions from San Francisco-based Twitter.The bench observed that these rules are binding but Twitter has not appointed anyone till now. The court posted the matter for further hearing on Thursday, and asked Twitter to inform by when it will appoint an RGO and other officials.On May 31, the Delhi High Court had issued a notice to the microblogging platform on a plea by advocate Amit Acharya.The plea had urged the high court to issue directions to the Centre to pass necessary instructions to Twitter India and Twitter Inc to appoint a resident grievance officer under Rule 4 of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 without any delay.The plea had contended that in a nutshell, every significant social media intermediary has the responsibility of appointing not only a resident grievance officer who will act as a single-point authority for receiving and disposing of complaints within a fixed time, but someone should also receive and acknowledge any order, notice and direction issued by the competent authorities.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-will-be-in-trouble-if-it-fails-to-comply-with-india-rules-delhi-high-court-279068
