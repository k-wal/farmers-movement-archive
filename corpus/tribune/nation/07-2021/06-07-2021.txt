He was awaiting bail from the Bombay High Court, but it didn't materialise.A well-known tribal rights activist, Stan Swamy was arrested by the NIA in connection with the probe into the events preceding and after the January 2018 Bhima-Koregaon caste riots.The activist-priest's death evoked a global outpouring of anger, shock and sympathy on social media targeting the central government, the judiciary and others for the perceived delay in granting him bail despite his advanced age and frail health, while many have sought the attention of the President, questioning how he could pose threats to the nation as was alleged.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stan-swamy-laid-to-rest-in-bandra-church-279141

We have about 65 districts, which have about 5-10 per cent positivity and 595 districts, where it is below 5 per cent,” he said.Bhargava further said district specific measures should continue to be guided by test positivity rate.

06-07-2021||New Delhi||India to be engine of growth: Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is confident that as India comes out of the second wave, it will be a more dynamic and friendlier business destination and contribute to being an engine of growth for the global economy.Addressing the inaugural session of the first Indo-Pacific Business Summit, the Minister saw international cooperation to be the key.Indo-Pacific, he said, represents a return of history. “A seamless and integrated space was disconnected decades ago by the strategy of the day. Today, we are quite sensibly seeing the landscape for what it really is. Indo-Pacific reflects the reality of globalisation, the emergence of multi-polarity and the benefits of rebalancing,” he observed.The Minister flagged three issues that the pandemic has brought to the fore: the salience of health, the power of the digital, and the importance of building or rebuilding greener.The Covid may have slowed the building of the global economy and the promotion of economic recovery, it has not stopped it. “This is, therefore, an occasion to reflect, perhaps introspect on how to build greener,” he observed.On agriculture, he said the Government’s effort to empower farmers and enable freer trade has been matched by a stronger commitment to post-harvest infrastructure. “And across 13 key sectors, performance-linked initiatives promise to upscale manufacturing. Bold measures have just recently been taken to promote tourism. And not least, in making it much easier to do business,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-be-engine-of-growth-jaishankar-279130

But, neither my uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras nor other MPs, who are no longer associated with the party founded by my father, should be inducted into the union cabinet from the LJP quota. “If my uncle is inducted in the union cabinet from the LJP quota or as an LJP member, we will go to court,” the 38- year-old Jamui MP told reporters. “I have no objection if he (Paras) is made minister as an Independent”, he said. Lok Janshakti Party has split with Paras enjoying support of all the MPs except for Chirag claming to be the real LJP, a partner in the NDA coalition. LJP had won six seats in the 2019 election as NDA member. Though left alone, Chirag whom Paswas senior had projected as his political heir apparent claims right over the party founded by his father in 2000. Chirag, who is locked in a tussle with the Paras-led faction, said they have already informed the Election Commission of India that his uncle and other ousted party MPs—Prince Raj (cousin), Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Keshar- are no longer LJP members.On Monday, both the factions celebrated Ram Vilas Paswan’s birth anniversary.While Chirag launched “Ashirwad Yatra” from his father’s political bastion Hajipur on the occasion, Paras paid respect to the departed leader at LJP’s state headquarters here.Accusing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of breaking his party, Chirag said, “During the Bihar elections, even before that, there was a constant attempt by Kumar to break our party. Kumar made similar attempts even when my father was hospitalised.“My father had told the party leaders, including my uncle (Pashupati Kumar Paras) about the same”.The actor-turned-politician asserted that he will continue to fight for the cause of the party founded by his father. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chirag-urges-pm-not-to-induct-paras-in-union-cabinet-as-ljp-member-says-will-go-to-court-otherwise-279108
06-07-2021||New Delhi||SC upholds conviction in murder case, quotes Sherlock Holmes||"You see, but you do not observe," the Supreme Court said quoting Sherlock Holmes as it dismissed an appeal against the conviction and life term awarded to a man in a murder case.The top court rejected the submission of amicus curiae that it was not possible for the four eye witnesses to see at night the face of the man who had committed the murder.A Bench of Justices R F Nariman, K M Joseph and B R Gavai said in its order passed on Monday, “We find no ground to interfere with the impugned order passed by the High Court. The Special Leave Petition is, accordingly, dismissed”.During the hearing, advocate Pijush Kanti Roy, who has been appointed amicus in the matter, said it was a dark night in an isolated place and there was no way the four eye witnesses in the case could have seen the face of the petitioner.Justice Nariman then said, “It's like Sherlock Holmes telling Dr Watson, 'You see, but you do not observe'”.Roy said that his only endeavour is that an innocent should not get punished for the crime he has not committed.The bench said that there is a finding given by the trial court and upheld by the High Court that they (eye witnesses) have seen the face in the light of the headlight of the motorcycle.It told Roy, “You are flogging a dead horse. You have done more than the duty of amicus curiae. There is a clear cut finding”.The top court was hearing an appeal filed by one Mukesh, currently lodged in Jaipur Jail, against the order of Rajasthan High Court passed on April 5, 2019 dismissing his petition against the conviction and life sentence awarded to him by the trial court in a murder of fellow villager Gopal Lal on July 18, 2012. In his appeal, Mukesh has contended that he was falsely implicated in the case and no case under section 302 of IPC, was made out against him. “The High Court while dismissing the appeal of the petitioner failed to appreciate that the incident took place in the dark night in an isolated place and there was no light near the place of occurrence, as such identification of the petitioner by the prosecution witness in such a dark night in an isolated place remained questionable, as such evidence of the prosecution witnesses are not trustworthy,” he has said in his appeal.He said the high court ought to have appreciated the fact that there was no previous enmity between Mukesh and Gopal Lal and he had no intention to kill his co-villager.Mukesh said that as per the prosecution the incident took place at the spur of the moment in course of their discussion and as such the case in hand at best could be a case under Section 304 Part-II and the order of conviction under Section 302 IPC has resulted in serious miscarriage of Justice.He submitted that there were three other persons at the site of crime but only he was made an accused and no charge sheet was filed against the other two persons.According to the prosecution, on July 19, 2012, one Babulal had submitted a complaint at the police station that his younger brother on July 18, 2012 was coming from Bhanpur to their village at around 10-11 pm, when villagers informed him that Gopal Lal was being beaten by three persons.Babulal said that when he, along with the villagers reached the place of the incident, he saw that the three persons had already killed his brother by a knife.

06-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government introduces three Bills to counter Centre's farm laws||The Shiv Sena-led MVA government in Maharashtra on Tuesday introduced three amendment Bills in the assembly related to agriculture, co-operation, food and civil supplies, in a move to counter the new farm laws enacted by the Centre that are facing stiff opposition from a section of cultivators.The Bills have provisions for higher than MSP rate for produce in farming agreement with traders, timely payment of dues, three-year jail term and Rs 5 lakh fine or both for harassment of farmers.They also have provisions to give power to the state government to regulate and prohibit production, supply, distribution and impose stock limits on essential commodities.Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said the central farm acts were  passed without discussion and several of their provisions encroach on rights of state governments."The state government has right to make laws and we want to suggest amendments to the central agriculture laws which we feel are anti-farmer," he said.The Bills that have been placed in public domain for two months for suggestions and objections are—Essential Commodities (Amendment), Farmers (Empowerment and Protection), Guarantee Price; Agriculture Related Agreements (Maharashtra Amendment) and Amendments to Central Government Farmer Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation).The draft Bills have been prepared by a cabinet sub-committee headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.Pawar said the draft Bills will be in the public domain for two months during which all stakeholders can hold discussions and debates on their provisions. The Bills will be taken up for discussion and passage during the winter session of the legislature in Nagpur (held in December), he said. Agriculture Minister Dada Bhuse said farming agreements (between traders and farmers) will be considered invalid if the price of agri produce being offered is not more than the MSP (minimum support price).If the farmer is not paid in seven days of sale of his produce, a criminal offence can be lodged against the trader and punishments include three year in jail and Rs 5 lakh penalty, Bhuse said. Co-operation minister Balasaheb Patil said under the central acts, there is no control over trader in case of a default in payment to farmer after sale of agriculture produce.To ensure farmers get remunerative price for their agriculture produce  within time and to protect their interests, the state government has decided to amend the Centre's Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act in its application to Maharashtra, Patil said.The draft bill proposes that no trader shall trade in any scheduled agri produce unless he has a valid licence from the competent authority, Patil said.In any dispute arising out of a transaction between a farmer and a trader, parties may seek a solution by filing an application to the competent authority and an appeal against the order of competent authority  to the appellate authority, he said.For harassment of farmers punishment is not less than three years imprisonment and fine of not less than Rs 5 lakh or both, he said.Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said in the Essential Commodities Act, 1955—which has been amended by the Centre—there is no provision for the state government to regulate or prohibit production, supply, distribution, imposing stock limits under extraordinary circumstances which may include famine, price rise or natural calamity.He said the state government proposes to amend the act in its application to Maharashtra  and assume power to regulate and prohibit production, supply, distribution and impose stock limits. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-government-introduces-three-bills-to-counter-centres-farm-laws-279096

He was seen greeting them with folded hands.  "My Ujjain tour is over and I am leaving for Delhi now. I will return next week," Scindia told reporters. Scindia, however, remained tight-lipped about speculations that he might be inducted in the Union cabinet during its expansion and said he had no information about the same. Scindia embarked on a three-day tour of the Malwa-Nimar region on Sunday and he was supposed to leave for Delhi on Wednesday morning as per the earlier schedule.  Earlier in the day, when reporters asked Scindia in Indore whether he will get a berth in the Union cabinet, he merely said that he was leaving to attend his next programme. Scindia paid tribute along with other BJP leaders at the statue of Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Syamaprasad Mookerjee on his 120th birth anniversary in Indore.Meanwhile, when asked about speculations about Scindia joining the Union council of ministers, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh said: "Many congratulations to him if he is being inducted as a minister in the Central government”. In March 2020, 22 MLAs of Congress led by Scindia resigned from the party and crossed over to the BJP,  leading to the collapse of the then Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh, which paved the way for the BJP to return to power again. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jyotiraditya-scindia-visits-ujjain-temple-cuts-short-his-tour-to-leave-for-delhi-amid-cabinet-expansion-buzz-279083

This cannot be allowed", even as the court gave a free pass to the central government to act against the social media firm.While companies such as Facebook and Google have submitted their first report in compliance with the new IT rules, Twitter, a microblogging site that the central government’s ministers, as well as leaders of several parties such as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, use widely to reach out to their base, continues to be in a prolonged standoff with the Centre.Twitter will be in trouble if it fails to comply with India rules: Delhi High CourtThe Centre had informed the Delhi High Court that Twitter has failed to comply with the IT Rules, 2021 as of July 1, on four counts: Chief compliance officer not being appointed; The position of the resident grievance officer being vacant; The position of the nodal contact person (even on an interim basis) being vacant; and The physical contact address, which was shown to be there on May 29, was not available on Twitter's website.In addition, Karnataka High Court is currently hearing a petition over a notice that Uttar Pradesh Police issued to Twitter India head Manish Maheshwari some tweets on the microblogging site a few days ago. The notice pertains to tweets posted after a video of an elderly Muslim man being assaulted in Loni, Ghaziabad, became viral on Twitter.Uttar Pradesh currently has a Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government under Chief Minister Adityanath. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-rules-centre-moves-sc-over-pleas-pending-in-various-high-courts-279080

In such a case, being a responsible government, we conceptualised this scheme," he said."We are launching a portal through which such people can apply for financial assistance. Our representatives will also visit such families and get applications filled up," he added.The chief minister said such representatives would not reject claims of families in case any document is missing and would only facilitate the process."I want to tell all such representatives not to conduct scrutiny of applications. If the families lack any document, we will help them obtain it. We have to make sure that we make this happen. Don't find faults with their documents...don't make them unhappy, encourage them," Kejriwal said."We have to ensure that we provide financial assistance to such families as soon as possible," he added.The Delhi government's Department of Social Welfare had notified the 'Mukhyamantri Covid Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojana' on June 22.The notification stated, "The government will also consider a single member of the affected family to be enrolled as a civil defence volunteer. Besides, the state affirms to look after the health and education needs of the dependent children as per existing policy." There is no income criterion to apply for financial assistance under the scheme.

You can do it from home. I also wanted to go to Puri but I couldn't in the last one and half years. This isn't the time," said a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana while refusing to permit Rath Yatras in Baripada, Sasang and other parts of the state.The Odisha Government has permitted Rath Yatra only at Puri even as it allowed rituals within temple premises of all other Jagannath temples across the state.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta suggested that Rath Yatras could be allowed by limiting the number of participants with certain restrictions."We hope God will allow us these rituals next year," the CJI said dismissing all the pleas in this regard.The Odisha Government maintained that it was impossible to ensure adherence to strict Covid protocol in thousands of Jagannath temples across the state where lakhs of devotees gather to take part in religion processions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-refuses-to-allow-rath-yatra-across-odisha-except-at-puri-279052
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut justifies suspension of 12 Maharashtra BJP MLAs||A day after 12 BJP MLAs were suspended from the Maharashtra Assembly for alleged misbehaviour, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said indiscipline could not be tolerated, even as the opposition party held protests in the Vidhan Bhavan complex here and other parts of the state over the action.Talking to reporters here on Tuesday, Raut said, "Never before the state legislature witnessed such indiscipline." The opening day of the state legislature's two-day monsoon session on Monday witnessed high drama as 12 BJP MLAs were suspended from the Assembly for one year after the state government accused them of "misbehaving" with presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the Speaker's chamber.Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis had termed the allegation as false and said Jadhav's account of the incident was "one-sided".On Tuesday, Raut said, "Indiscipline cannot be tolerated. Breaking the Speaker's mike and using abusive language against the presiding officer is not Maharashtra's culture." Meanwhile, the BJP held protests in different parts of the state, condemning the MVA government's action against the opposition party's MLAs.Several BJP legislators squatted on the stairs of the Vidhan Bhavan building in Mumbai and shouted slogans against the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA-comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) government.The 12 MLAs against whom the action was taken were not seen as they are not allowed to enter the legislature building during the suspension period.The 12 suspended members are Sanjay Kute, Ashish Shelar, Abhimanyu Pawar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Parag Alavani, Harish Pimpale, Yogesh Sagar, Jay Kumar Rawat, Narayan Kuche, Ram Satpute and Bunty Bhangdia.On Monday, these 12 MLAs met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, seeking his intervention, and complained against the MVA government for "trampling upon the democracy".

Abhijit (61) first became an MP from Jangipur on the Congress ticket in 2012 after his father Pranab Mukherjee, sitting MP, resigned from the Lok Sabha midway through his term to take up the post of President.In the General Election held two years later, Abhijit secured a modest victory. Abhijit lost to TMC’s Khalilur Rahaman and was relegated to the third position at Jangipur in the last LS poll held in 2019.Abhijit said having handed out a massive defeat to the BJP, CM Mamata Banerjee was in course to emerge as the face of the anti-BJP political forces. “The way she halted the recent communal wave by the BJP, I believe in the future, with the support of others, she will be able to do the same in the entire country,” he added.Abhijit said he was not a legislator, nor was an office-bearer of the Congress. He was only a primary member of the Congress and that membership lapsed in three years in the normal course unless renewed again.On his sister Sharmistha Mukherjee’s continued association with the Congress, Abhijit said she was free to chart her own political course.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pranab-mukherjees-son-abhijit-mukherjee-joins-trinamool-congress-278804

Few years ago, Hasina inaugurated a “special mango train” on the Chapainawabganj-Dhaka route via Rajshahi to transport mangoes at lower cost.Mangoes though have a mixed record in promoting bilateral ties. A similar gift from then Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif to PM Modi in 2015 did not help lower tensions, including firing.It may have even contributed to the plane crash in 1988, killing Pakistan military dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq as well as US Ambassador Arnold Raphel as it was speculated that a bomb was hidden in one of crates of mangoes gifted to them.But mangoes have also melted tensions between both countries as was the case when Gen Zia sent “Anwar Rataul” mangoes to then PM Indira Gandhi in 1980 and, just before the Agra summit, Gen Pervez Musharraf sent mangoes to then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bangladesh-pm-hasina-sends-2-600-kg-mangoes-for-modi-bengal-cm-278806

We will not condone this kind of behaviour of MLAs who, on the floor of the House, throw mic and destroy public property,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said, adding, they must face trial.“They were MLAs and they were representing people…What message are they giving to the public?” commented the Bench, which also included Justice MR Shah.The top court was hearing the Kerala Government’s petition seeking permission to withdraw criminal cases against CPM leaders, including state’s Education Minister V Sivankutty, for alleged vandalism on the floor of the state assembly in 2015, when the party was in the opposition.Noting that such incidents were on the rise, the court said, “We must ensure that some decorum is maintained. These are sentinels of democracy. Such types of incidents are increasing nowadays. In Parliament also, it’s happening and one has to be strict on this… it must be ensured that decorum is maintained in the House.”The Bench posted the matter for hearing on July 15, saying it needed to examine certain additional documents filed in the case.Citing legislative privileges, the Pinarayi Vijayan government has challenged the March 12 order of the Kerala High Court refusing to give its nod for withdrawal of cases.The Kerala Assembly had witnessed bedlam on March 13, 2015, as LDF members tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani, who was facing allegations in the bar bribery scam, from presenting the state budget. The CPM MLAs had allegedly vandalised the Speaker’s dais, uprooted his chair, pulled out the mike system and computers.Refusing to allow withdrawal of cases, the Kerala High Court had said elected representatives were expected to uphold the prestige of the House or face consequences.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unruly-behaviour-by-legislators-unacceptable-supreme-court-to-kerala-govt-278798

What’s going on is terrible,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice RF Nariman said.Advocate Sanjay Parikh, representing the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), said despite directions issued by the court in 2019 that all state governments should sensitise police personnel about the judgment, thousands of cases had been registered under the scrapped provision.“We have seen those figures. Don’t worry we will do something,” said the Bench, which issued a notice to the Centre, asking it to reply in two weeks.Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Bench that on a perusal of the Act, it could be seen that Section 66A featured in it. However, the footnote made it clear that the provision had been scrapped.“When a cop has to register a case, he sees the section without going through the footnote. We can put a bracket after the section to mention it has been scrapped,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shocking-supreme-court-on-firs-under-junked-section-of-it-act-278709

Unfortunately, he could not survive,” the HC said.The death of Swamy, one of the 16 persons arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the Elgar Parishad case, sparked outrage with activists, politicians and human rights leaders expressing shock. He was arrested by the National Investigation Agency on October 8, 2020, from Ranchi.In May, he had told the HC that that his health was deteriorating and he could no longer bathe, walk or write by himself.

Briefing on the end-of RMS (2021-22) procurement, FCI CMD Atish Chandra said the highest procurement of 132.10 LMT wheat was from Punjab. Last year, Madhya Pradesh topped the list. According to Chandra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and J&K recorded their “best-ever”.     An all-time high MSP of Rs 84, 369.19 crore was directly transferred into the accounts of 4916424 farmers across the country under the 'One Nation, One MSP, One DBT' scheme. A record 49.16 lakh farmers benefitted against 43.35 lakh, last year, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said. Story HighlightsAccording to the FCI CMD, Rs 26103.89 crore were paid to 885117 farmers in Punjab and Rs 16706.33 crore to 760636 farmers in Haryana, the two states leading the agitation against three central farm laws. It was the first time that farmers in the two states received remuneration for grain directly into their accounts.With 132.10 LMT wheat procured from the state, Punjab regained its leader’s position among states and UTs from where central and state agencies procure grains for welfare schemes. With 129. 42 LMT in 2020-21 RMS, Madhya Pradesh topped the list followed by Punjab (127.14 LMT). This year, 128.08 LMT wheat was procured from MPAmid the expected issues related to bumper procurement and storage management, Chandra said “preparations for extra storage were made in advance based on procurement targets. Some unscientific storage is due to huge volumes of procurement. Currently, only 17.91 LMT grain is under unscientific storage. It is a small amount compared to what we have under scientific storage. We are committed to liquidating by July-end by disbursing it to beneficiaries. The PMGKAY has been greatly helpful. During 2020-21, only 0.003 per cent of grain (1800 tonnes) were damaged,” he said.       Notably, most of the grain under unscientific storage is in Punjab and Haryana.Chandra said the FCI moved highest ever foodgrains, 594 LMT in 2020-21 in comparison to 389 LMT during 2019-20 under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna.The Centre is running the longest ever exercise of distributing free food grains to people during this pandemic time, Pandey said, adding that 278.25 LMT foodgrains have been allocated under PMGKY 3 & 4 for the benefit of the most vulnerable.Close to 1.5 crore monthly portability transactions are being recorded under ONORC, he said, adding that the Centre will very soon finalise a modal guideline based on suggestions received from States/UTs for preparing a list of common factors for inclusion or exclusion in ration cards for beneficiaries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/record-procurement-of-wheat-at-433-24-lmt-in-rms-2021-22-says-centre-278627
06-07-2021||---||Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina sends mangoes for Modi, Mamata||New Delhi, July 5Several trucks from Bangladesh crossed the border on Sunday, carrying 2,600 kg mangoes from Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as gifts for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.The latest edition of the subcontinent’s mango diplomacy, however, did not suffer the fate of a similar effort by Pakistan barely a month back which found no takers in several countries, including the US and China.The famous ‘Haribhanga’ mangoes that crossed the Benapole border on Sunday afternoon were waived off from the Bangladesh side by Customs Deputy Commissioner Anupam Chakma as a “souvenir of friendship between the two countries” and received on the Indian side by Bangladesh’s Kolkata Consulate official Samiul Quader.Bangladeshi media reports say Hasina plans to send similar gifts to CMs of all states sharing borders with Bangladesh.India and Bangladesh have sought to build up a mango relationship that goes beyond gifting between highly placed counterparts. A couple of years ago, Hasina inaugurated a ‘special mango train’ on Chapainawabganj-Dhaka route via Rajshahi in order to transport mangoes at lower cost.Mangoes though have a mixed record in promoting bilateral ties. A similar gift from then Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif to PM Modi in 2015 did not help lower tensions, including cross-border infiltration and firing.It may have even contributed to the plane crash in 1988, killing Pakistan military dictator Gen Zia ul Haq as well as the US Ambassador Arnold Raphel as it was speculated that a bomb was hidden in one of crates of mangoes gifted to them.But mangoes have also melted tensions between both countries as was the case when Gen Zia sent ‘Anwar Rataul’ mangoes to then PM Indira Gandhi in 1980 and, just before the Agra summit, Gen Pervez Musharraf sent mangoes to then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Pakistan also used the mango route to get closer to China when it sent mangoes to Mao Tse-Tung in the1960s.Their lusciousness so delighted the Chinese leader that he had subsequent consignments distributed all over the country as prized presents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-sends-mangoes-for-modi-mamata-278626

06-07-2021||New Delhi||SC takes strict view on unruly behaviour of lawmakers in parliament, assemblies||The Supreme Court said on Monday that it has to take a “strict” view of unruly behaviour of lawmakers in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies as such incidents are “increasing nowadays” and this sort of conduct cannot be condoned.The apex court, which was hearing pleas relating to a criminal case lodged in connection with ruckus inside Kerala Assembly in 2015 during the previous Congress-led UDF rule, said it must be ensured that decorum is maintained in the House.“Prima facie, we have to take a very strict view on this kind of behaviour. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable,” a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and M R Shah said while referring to the incident in Kerala Assembly.“We must ensure that some decorum is maintained. These are sentinels of democracy,” the bench said, adding, “Such incidents are increasing nowadays. In the parliament also, it is happening and one has to be strict on this”.One of the pleas was filed by the Kerala government which has challenged the March 12 order of the high court dismissing its petition seeking withdrawal of a criminal case registered in connection with the ruckus inside the state Assembly in 2015.The state assembly had witnessed unprecedented scenes on March 13, 2015 as LDF members, then in opposition, tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani, who was facing allegations in the bar bribery scam, from presenting the state budget.Besides flinging the speaker’s chair from the podium, electronic equipment like computers, keyboards and mikes on the desk of the presiding officer were also allegedly damaged by the LDF members.The case, which also involves V Sivankutty who is a minister in the state, was registered against a group of then LDF MLAs and others.During the hearing conducted on Monday through video-conferencing, the apex court referred to the incident in the Kerala Assembly and observed that the MLAs had obstructed presentation of finance budget and such behaviour cannot be accepted.“We will not condone this kind of behaviour of MLAs who, on the floor of the house, throw mikes and destroys public property,” said the bench, which posted the matter for hearing on July 15.“They were MLAs and they were representing people,” the bench said, adding, “What message are they giving to the public”.One has to take strict view on such conduct otherwise there would be no deterrence to this kind of behaviour, it said, adding that those involved in such behaviour should face trial under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.“This kind of behaviour cannot be condoned,” it said, adding, “What is the larger public interest in shielding an MLA who was obstructing presentation of finance budget in the House.”      When one of the counsel said the MLAs were protesting against the then finance minister against whom there were corruption allegations, the bench said irrespective of that, “presentation of finance budget is of utmost importance”.On the issue of application under section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which deals with withdrawal from prosecution, the bench observed that it is the prerogative of the public prosecutor.In its plea filed in the apex court, the Kerala government has claimed that high court had failed to appreciate that the alleged incident had occurred while the Assembly was in session and no crime could have been registered “without previous sanction” of the speaker.“The FIR registered by the secretary Legislative Assembly without the consent of the speaker is wrong and therefore, the application filed under section 321 CrPC is liable to be allowed,” said the plea filed by the state.            The plea has sought a stay on the March 12 order of the high court and also on further proceedings in the case, which is pending before a trial court.It has said because the act of accused persons being in relation to their function to protest as members of the legislative assembly, the MLAs, who are accused in the FIR, were entitled to get protection under the Constitution.It said that Article 105(3), 194(3) of the Constitution of India confers certain privileges and immunities to the members of Parliament and state legislature and therefore, it was not proper for the secretary of the Legislative Assembly to file cases against MLAs with regard to an incident which happened on the floor of House during the protest made by opposition members, that too, without the consent of the speaker.“The allegation in the present case has admittedly happened during the budget session of the Legislature as a part of the protest by opposition members of Legislative Assembly against the budget presentation by the then finance minister due to the then prevailing political reasons,” it said.The state government had moved the high court against an order of the trial court which had dismissed an application filed by the public prosecutor seeking permission to withdraw from prosecution against the accused in the case.In its plea filed in the top court, the state has said there was no evidence to show that the application submitted by the public prosecutor was “not in good faith”.The case was registered for the alleged offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 447 (criminal trespass), and under the provision of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-takes-strict-view-on-unruly-behaviour-of-lawmakers-in-parliament-assemblies-278604
06-07-2021||Mumbai||12 BJP MLAs suspended from Maharashtra Assembly for 1 year||Twelve BJP MLAs were suspended on Monday from the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for one year after the state government accused them of “misbehaving” with presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the Speaker’s chamber.Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis termed the allegation as false and said Jadhav’s account of the incident was “one-sided”.However, Jadhav sought a probe into the allegation that some Shiv Sena members and he himself made uncharitable remarks, and said he was ready to face any punishment if it was proven true.The motion to suspend the MLAs was moved by state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab and passed by a voice vote.The 12 suspended members are- Sanjay Kute, Ashish Shelar, Abhimanyu Pawar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Parag Alavani, Harish Pimpale, Yogesh Sagar, Jay Kumar Rawat, Narayan Kuche, Ram Satpute and Bunty Bhangdia.Parab said during the period of suspension, the 12 legislators will not be allowed to enter the Legislature premises in Mumbai and Nagpur.Objecting to the decision, BJP members, led by Fadnavis, said the opposition would boycott the House proceedings.“This is a false allegation and an attempt to reduce the numbers of opposition benches, because we exposed the government’s falsehood on the OBC quota in local bodies,” Fadnavis said.He said the BJP members had not abused the presiding officer. “It was Shiv Sena MLAs who used abusive words. I brought our MLAs out of the Speaker’s chamber,” Fadnavis said.Ashish Shelar apologised and the matter ended, the former CM said, claiming that what Jadhav said was a “one-sided” account.Earlier, NCP leader and minister Nawab Malik accused the BJP members of misbehaving with Bhaskar Jadhav and the state Assembly was adjourned four times over the issue.The House was initially adjourned for 10 minutes after Jadhav  put to vote the resolution urging the Centre to provide 2011 census data to enable the State Backward Class Commission to prepare an empirical data of the OBC population, in a bid to restore political reservations for its members in local bodies.Some BJP members, including Girish Mahajan and Sanjay Kute, climbed the Speaker’s podium and argued with the Chair.Later, after the House reassembled,  minister Nawab Malik and Shiv Sena member Sunil Prabhu demanded that action be taken against the opposition members for their behaviour with Jadhav.“What happened  in your chamber is not right,” Malik said addressing Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal.The Deputy Speaker then adjourned the House for 15 minutes.Later, presiding officer Dilip Bankar adjourned the House for another 15 minutes and again for 30 minutes.Talking to reporters outside the House, Malik alleged that the BJP members had “gheraoed” Jadhav in the Speaker’s  chamber and used abusive words.He claimed that Fadnavis also broke his own mike.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray  then called Jadhav  in his chamber to seek information on what had happened.When the House reassembled after the fourth adjournment, Jadhav was in the Speaker’s Chair and gave a detailed account of what had happened.He said Maharashtra’s tradition was never to take outside the differences expressed on the floor of the House.“Today is a black day for me. Abusive words were directed at me. Some people are saying I made uncharitable remarks. Let there be a probe into it after checking the CCTV footage.  If I have used any inappropriate language, I am ready to face any punishment,” Jadhav said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/12-bjp-mlas-suspended-from-maharashtra-assembly-for-1-year-278599
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Sena-BJP ties like Aamir Khan-Kiran Rao relationship: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday evoked the post-divorce relationship between actor Aaamir Khan and Kiran Rao to stress that the political paths of his party and BJP are separate but friendship remains between the former alliance partners.“Look at Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao. (Their) paths have separated but (they) are friends. Same here. (Our) paths are separate but friendship remains. There will be friendship in politics. But this doesn't mean that we are going to form government (in Maharashtra),” Raut said.“There are differences, but as I have been saying for a long time, we (Sena and BJP) are not India-Pakistan. There are meetings and talks. But now our paths have diverged. In politics, our paths have separated,” he said.Raut's analogy was in response to BJP leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis saying their parties are "not enemies".After announcing recently that he and Rao had divorced after a 15-year marriage, Khan had said, “Our relationship has changed but we are still together.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sena-bjp-ties-like-aamir-khan-kiran-rao-relationship-sanjay-raut-278582
06-07-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi offers Co-WIN model to rest of the world||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday offered India’s Co-WIN platform to the world for adaptation to local use.Speaking at the global Co-WIN conclave being attended by health and technology experts from abroad, Modi said having been used in India, “you can be sure the software has been tested in the real world for speed and scale”.Pointing out that vaccination is the best hope for the humanity to emerge successfully from the pandemic, PM Modi pointed out that right from the beginning, India had decided to adopt a completely digital approach while planning its vaccination strategy as it thought such an approach was necessary if the post pandemic world has to return to normalcy.In addition, such proof must be safe, secure and trustworthy. People must have a record of when, where and by whom they have been vaccinated. Given how precious each dose of vaccine is, the government was also concerned that each dose should be tracked and wastage minimised. This was not possible without an end-to-end digital approach.The Indian civilisation considers the world as one family and the pandemic made people realise the fundamental truth of this philosophy.Co-WIN was prepared in an open-source format so that it could be available in any and all countries.“Today’s conclave is the first time this platform is being introduced to all,” said the prime minister.It is through this that India has administered 350 million doses of vaccine and a few days ago, it vaccinated 9 million in one day.“They need not carry fragile pieces of paper. It is all available in digital format. This software can be customised in any country as per local requirements,” he said.The prime minister said despite all its constraints, India had tried to share as much as possible with the world as well as remained eager to learn from global practices.“Technology is integral to the fight against Covid. Luckily software is one area in which there are no resource constraints. That is why we made Covid tracing as open-source as soon as it was technically feasible. With nearly 200 million users Arogya Setu is also a readily available package for developers,” offered the PM.The government has claimed that about 50 countries, including Canada, Mexico, Nigeria, Panama and Uganda, have shown interest in knowing about Co-WIN.The virtual meet is seeing participation from health and technology experts representing countries across the world. The conclave aims to share India’s experience with regards to universal vaccination to fight Covid through Co-WIN.India developed Co-WIN as the central information technology (IT) system for strategising, implementing, monitoring and evaluating Covid vaccination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-offers-co-win-model-to-rest-of-the-world-278580
06-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi High Court agrees to hear on July 9 plea on calculation of Class 10 CBSE marks||The Delhi High Court on Monday agreed to hear on July 9 a petition concerning the calculation of marks of Class 10 students of CBSE-affiliated schools here.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh advanced the date of hearing in the petition from August 28 after the NGO, 'Justice for All', moved an application for early hearing.Advocate Khagesh Jha, appearing for the NGO, said the petition was not adversarial but raised a serious issue of using “historical background as the biggest factor in marking scheme” for class 10 CBSE students.“My marks will depend on how my seniors have performed,” he told the court.The NGO, in its application, stated that once the process of uploading of students' marks and preparation of results was over, the petition would become infructuous.The court also agreed to hear on July 9 a petition by NISA Education, a registered society comprising entities running private schools, concerning the constitution of a Results Committee for the assessment of Class 10 CBSE students.It was the society's concern that since the members of the Result Committee and other faculty and staff of the school would be required to be physically present for the deliberations, there would be a real danger to the health on account of the Covid pandemic.The society's counsel Ravi Prakash Gupta argued that if the petition was not heard before the declaration of results, it would become infructuous. Counsel for the CBSE, Rupesh Kumar, told the court that nothing survived in the society's petition as the majority of schools had already uploaded the marks of their students.“His case is in view of lockdown, results committee can't be constituted. There are 21,000 schools. 62 are remaining to upload marks. Petition is infructuous,” he said.The high court had on June 2 sought response of the Centre, Delhi government and CBSE on the NGO's petition claiming that the policy of the board for calculating marks of class 10 students based on the internal assessment by schools was unconstitutional and required to be modified.

06-07-2021||New Delhi||189 officials, contractors booked as CBI registers second FIR on Gomti River Front project in UP||The CBI has booked 189 officials and contractors in its second FIR related to irregularities in the Rs 1,437-crore Gomti river front development project in Lucknow, which was undertaken during the tenure of the previous Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh, officials said on Monday.Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav was the chief minister then.After registering the fresh FIR on Friday, following a preliminary inquiry, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday carried out searches at 42 locations spread across 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh, Alwar in Rajasthan and Kolkata in West Bengal, they said.The operation, which started early in the morning, is going on and it may be expanded during the course of the day, the officials said.This is the second FIR related to the project by the CBI. An earlier FIR has already covered work orders worth over Rs 1,031 crore.In the present FIR, in which 16 officials, including chief engineers, and 173 contractors are accused, the CBI has alleged that 30 notices inviting tenders have come under the scanner.Of these, only five were published in newspapers while the remaining 25 forged letters were sent to the Department of Information and Publication to show compliance, it alleged.The agency has listed several similar irregularities, including award of tender on the basis of forged documents and forgery in publication of notices inviting tender, according to the present FIR.The preliminary inquiry also showed that 27 work orders each over Rs 1 lakh, including one for import of an international standard musical fountain, worth over 55.95 lakh euros (Rs 49.3 crore at the present exchange rate), from the Aquatique Show in Strasbourg, France, were issued without any tender, it alleged.This was in violation of government orders which stipulate that no order of above Rs 1 lakh can be awarded without a tender, the CBI said.The quotation notice for the fountain was issued by Akhil Raman, the then superintendent engineer, and it was genuinely published, it said."However, prior to issuance of quotation notice a normal tendering process notice was shown by Raman. This notice was not published and forged receipt letter, release order and copies of newspaper clippings were placed in the records," an official said.The estimate was approved on the basis of quotations in 2016. Roop Singh Yadav, the then superintendent engineer, directly wrote to the French company for signing the contract. He recommended for issuance of supply order for the company, the CBI alleged.SN Sharma, the then chief engineer, sought prior permission to import the material on August 27, 2016, and issued supply order after four days without obtaining prior permission, it alleged.The CBI has alleged that Sharma, Raman and Yadav abused their official position and issued the supply order on quotation basis instead of tender basis giving undue benefit to Aquatique Show.In Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr district, CBI sleuths raided the residence of contractor Rakesh Bhati in connection with the case, officials said.Bhati is also a member of the Congress unit in Uttar Pradesh.UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the CBI searches indicated the misdeeds of the previous Akhilesh Yadav government."We had requested the CBI earlier to speed up its probe in such scams. The CBI is a central agency and working in its style. In the Gomti river front scam, the searches are on at places of 16 engineers and 173 contractors," the minister said when asked about it by reporters in Lucknow.
