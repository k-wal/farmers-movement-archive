Microbrewery shall also be allowed to supply to other bars and restaurants that have licence to serve liquor,” the policy document stated.Senior officials of the excise department said the move will allow people to go to such microbreweries and take away freshly brewed beer.“This exercise is already in place in nearby towns such as Gurugram but in Delhi take away services were not allowed. This excise policy will promote microbreweries in the national capital,” the official said.He added that the new policy will, however, command a number of quality checks to ensure the safety of the product being served.The policy document also stated that draught beer shall also be allowed to be served at permitted events, banquet halls that have temporary licences such as P-10, P-10E etc.“Wherever draught beer is being served as a takeaway, clear signage and information will be needed to put up about its short shelf life and the bottles will have to mention the expiry date clearly,” the excise policy said.The policy clearly states that establishments found selling draught beer “after its expiry date will immediately have his license revoked”.The excise policy also recommended serving of liquor in open spaces such as terrace, balcony at licenced hotels and restaurants.“Licensees of HCR (hotel, clubs and restaurants) shall be allowed to serve any Indian Liquor and Foreign Liquor in any area within the licensed premises, including open spaces viz. terrace/balcony/lower area of licensed premises with the condition that the liquor serving area shall be screened off from the public view,” the policy said.“The bars in Hotels, Restaurants and Clubs are allowed to operate till 3 am except those licensees which have been given license to operate round the clock service of liquor,” it added.

05-07-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi holds meeting with Shah, Santhosh amid buzz of Cabinet expansion||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held marathon meetings with Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh in what is being seen as the final touches being given to the details of a likely expansion of the Union Cabinet.Sources said Shah and Santhosh confabulated with Modi at his residence for several hours on Sunday amid a “strong possibility” that the Cabinet reshuffle may happen very soon.Some sources said the swearing-in may happen as early as Wednesday. However, there was no official word on it.If the prime minister goes ahead with the exercise, he will be expanding his Council of Ministers for the first time since assuming the charge in May 2019 for his second innings.BJP leaders Sarbananda Sonowal, the former Assam chief minister who made way for Himanta Biswa Sarma in the state, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sushil Modi are seen as strong ministerial probables amid indications that some allies of the saffron party may also get berths.The states which will go to the assembly polls early next year, including the all-important Uttar Pradesh, may figure high.West Bengal may also see its representation in the Union Council of Ministers go up, the sources said.It is believed that the BJP’s allies like JD(U) and Apna Dal can also get representation.Presently, Republican Party leader Ramdas Athawale, a junior minister, is the only ally in the government after parties like the Shiv Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal severed ties with the BJP.Lok Janshakti Party founder Ram Vilas Paswan, a Cabinet minister, had died last year and all eyes are on whether his brother Pashupati Kumar Paras will be part of the expansion.Paras is engaged in a bitter battle with Paswan’s son Chirag Paswan for the control of the party and has been recognised as the LJP leader in Lok Sabha after five of its six MPs lent their support to him.The current strength of the Council of Ministers is 53, besides Modi, and its maximum number can be 81.For the last few weeks, Modi has been meeting Union ministers in groups with BJP president J P Nadda also being present in the exercise to review their works and gather feedback.The BJP brass has also held organisational meetings in different states.

In democracy, crime is fought through law and not encounter. These happen only when there are no other means,” he later told reporters.At least 12 suspected militants and criminals have been shot dead in the state since May as they reportedly tried to escape from custody, while several others, including rape accused and cattle smugglers, were injured.The opposition, reacting to the incidents, alleged that Assam Police have turned “trigger happy” under the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led regime.The state police, however, refuted the charge, claiming that it was the criminals who forced its personnel to resort to firing.

05-07-2021||New Delhi||SC condemns grant of long protection while rejection of pre-arrest bail pleas by Allahabad HC||The Supreme Court Monday expressed dissatisfaction over granting of protection from arrest to accused persons for a long period of time while dismissing their anticipatory bail applications by the Allahabad High Court.“We condemn these kinds of orders. We see the Allahabad High Court passing orders granting protection for 90 days,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana said.The observation of top court came during the hearing of appeals by two women, accused in a dowry death case, challenging the Allahabad High Court’s January 12 order by which their plea for grant of anticipatory bail was declined.However, the high court had restrained the Uttar Pradesh police from taking any coercive action against them for 90 days and had made clear that investigators may take any coercive action after the expiry of protection period.The apex court bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, issued notice to the state government on the appeal of Leelavati Devi alias Leelawati and Radha Devi in the dowry death case lodged in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh and extended their protection against coercive action by four weeks.“Issue notice returnable in four weeks. Dasti service, in addition, is permitted. Liberty is also granted to serve the Standing counsel for the State of Uttar Pradesh. In the meantime, interim protection is granted to the petitioners for a period of four weeks from today,” it said.It asked the women to cooperate in the investigation and listed the plea after four weeks.“The applicants are not entitled to be granted anticipatory bail. The offences alleged are prima facie made out from the allegations in the FIR. However, in view of the entirety of facts and circumstances of the case, it is directed, on the request of counsel for the applicants, that in case the applicants appear and surrender before the court below within 90 days from today and apply for bail, their prayer for bail shall be considered and decided as per the settled law...,” the single judge bench of the high court had said.“Till then no coercive action shall be taken against the applicants,” the high court had also said.The observations of the apex court assumes significance as the CJI-led bench, on May 28, had held in a judgement that the courts must come out with reasoned order for granting protection from arrest to a person while rejecting the application for anticipatory bail.Writing the judgement for the bench, the CJI had said when such orders are passed, courts must balance the concerns of investigating agency, complainant and the society at large as grant or rejection of an application seeking bail for a person apprehending arrest has a direct bearing on the fundamental right to life and liberty of an individual.The verdict had come on two separate pleas challenging the orders passed by the Allahabad High Court which had dismissed the anticipatory bail pleas of accused in two cases but granted them protection from coercive action for 90 days to surrender before the trial court to seek regular bail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-condemns-grant-of-long-protection-while-rejection-of-pre-arrest-bail-pleas-by-allahabad-hc-278635

The observations made by the study can help farmers in the region to plan their agricultural practices accordingly.The findings on irrigation-monsoon feedbacks and the agri-cartographic products will directly benefit the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture by the central government, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today.The study to investigate the impact of agricultural water use on the Indian Summer Monsoon using a climate model was undertaken by Subimal Ghosh, Professor of Civil Engineering and Convener at Interdisciplinary Programme in Climate Studies at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, and his research group, with support from the Department of Science and Technology.The group identified for the first time that risks for rice and wheat have increased in the recent decade, with wheat at a two-fold higher magnitude than rice. The study followed the Assessment Report - 5 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s definition to quantify the risk.Increasing crop risk is predominantly driven by the decreasing number of farmers and the wheat risk is also attributed to increasing minimum temperatures during the crop growing season. This study provided compelling evidence indicating that the hydro-climatic hazards related to precipitation extremes and drought are alarmingly increasing the crop risk as compared to temperature extremes.Another finding obtained from this study was that extreme rainfall in recent decades in Central India has been increasing and this is also caused by an increase in irrigation and consequent increase in evapo-transpiration, which is the sum of evaporation from the land surface and transpiration from plants.South Asia is one of the most heavily irrigated regions of the world, largely using groundwater, and its major summer crop is paddy which is cultivated in water flooded fields. Hence it was pertinent to study how such practices can influence the monsoons which form the fulcrum of this agro-based economy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/irrigation-practices-affect-monsoon-finds-study-278634
05-07-2021||New Delhi||Delta variant 8 times less sensitive to vaccine antibodies: Study||The Delta variant of coronavirus is eight times less sensitive to antibodies generated by vaccines as compared to the original strain that came from China’s Wuhan, according to a new study.The study, which was conducted on more than 100 healthcare workers (HCWs) at three centres in India including Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) here, found that the B.1.617.2 Delta variant not only dominates vaccine-breakthrough infections with higher respiratory viral loads compared to non-Delta infections (Ct value of 16.5 versus 19) but also generates greater transmission among the fully vaccinated HCWs.The collaborative study, “Sars-Cov-2 B.1.617.2 Delta Variant Emergence and Vaccine Breakthrough: Collaborative Study”, from India with scientists from Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease is yet to be peer-reviewed.It revealed that in vitro, the Delta variant is approximately eight-fold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies compared to Wuhan-1.“Across all scenarios considered, our results suggest the Delta variant is both more transmissible and better able to evade prior immunity elicited by the previous infection compared to previously circulating lineages,” the findings of the study read.Dr Chand Wattal, chairperson of the Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, SGRH, said, “From this study, it appears that we have miles to go before we sleep in case of Covid-19 pandemics. These mutations are bound to happen if we lower our guard and allow ourselves to fall prey to this virus, giving it an opportunity to multiply.”“This is a straight eye-opener to the fully vaccinated people that you cannot lower guard in the name of vaccination. The virus is on the prowl, still looking for its prey. This mutant has come back with enhanced spike proteins for attachment to the lung epithelial cells which have provided it with a much higher capacity to infect many more people than the Wuhan strain,” he said.These combined epidemiological and in vitro data indicate that the dominance of the Delta variant in India has been most likely driven by a combination of evasion of neutralising antibodies in previously infected individuals and increased virus infectivity resulting in the second wave, the study said.Severe disease in fully vaccinated HCWs was rare. However, breakthrough transmission clusters in hospitals associated with the Delta variant are concerning and indicate that infection control measures need to continue in the post-vaccination era, it said.Based on recent data and the dominance of new infections by this variant, the B.1.167.2 Delta variant appears more transmissible than B.1.1.7 in the UK, it added.“In the absence of published data on the transmissibility of the Delta variant, we predict that this variant will have a transmission advantage relative to Wuhan-1 with D614G in individuals with pre-existing immunity from vaccine/natural infection as well as in settings where there is low vaccine coverage and low prior exposure,” the study stated.Lower protection against B.1.351, the variant with the least sensitivity to neutralising antibodies, has been demonstrated for at least three vaccines. However, progression to severe disease and death was low in all studies, it said.Therefore, at population scale, extensive vaccination will likely protect against moderate to severe disease and will reduce hospitalisation due to the Delta variant, it said.

He dedicated his life working for tribal rights. I had strongly opposed his arrest & incarceration. The Union government should be answerable for absolute apathy and non provision of timely medical services, leading to his death," Soren said in a tweet.Stan Swamy had worked for about three decades among tribals in Jharkhand.Ranchi Catholic Archdiocese expressing grief over Swamy's death said the "caged parrot" now sings in Heaven."We are deeply grieved to learn of the death of Father Stan Swamy, a champion of tribal rights, a fighter for justice and a symbol of courage. The fact that this sick man suffering with Parkinson disease was arrested at the age of 84, refused bail for over 7 months, not even allowed a sipper and finally contracted Covid in jail itself is a sad reflection on those who got the innocent man arrested and the courts that refused to give him bail," said the Archdiocese. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-should-be-held-accountable-for-apathy-towards-stan-swamy-soren-278625
05-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai the only city where encroacher is given free housing: HC||Referring to rampant illegal constructions across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the Bombay High Court on Monday said that the situation has gone “out of hand” and the Maharashtra government must not have policies that “permitted people to die”.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni was referring to the Maharashtra government’s slum rehabilitation policies that granted statutory protection against demolition and eviction to slum tenements that have been constructed prior to January 1, 2000, and are not higher than 14 feet.The bench noted the June 9 collapse of a residential building in suburban Malwani was an outcome of “pure greed” and suggested the state authorities should draw inspiration from the “Singapore model” of housing for the poor.“It is only in Mumbai that one encroaches on government land and in return is given free housing. I asked the Chief Justice (who was earlier at the Calcutta HC) if such policy existed in West Bengal and the answer was a flat no,” Justice Kulkarni said.The bench was presiding over a bunch of public interest litigations that it had initiated suo motu (on its own) following incidents of building collapse in Bhiwandi in Thane district last year.The HC had started hearing the pleas again last month following a building collapse in Mumbai’s suburb of Malwani, in which 12 people, including eight children, had died.The HC had ordered a judicial inquiry into the Malwani incident and the preliminary report had said the residential building that collapsed was initially just a ground-plus-one structure.Additional floors had been added to it illegally and the original allottee of the structure was not known, according to the report.On Monday, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, who appeared for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), told the HC that most tenements in notified slum areas across the city had added additional floors illegally.“The slums are a problem but also essential for the working for the city. So even if the state allows ground plus one floor in notified slum areas, it needs to put a stop to further floors to prevent instances of collapses,” Chinoy said.The bench, however, said the working population of the city needn’t live in slum tenements. It said the state could draw inspiration from the “Singapore model” of housing for the poor.“The situation has gone out of control. But we can’t have policies that permit people to die. We have to value human life,” the HC said. “Just because people say they have nowhere else to live, they can’t be allowed to risk their lives and stay in illegal structures,” it said.As per the existing slum rehabilitation provisions for the MMR, those living in slums built until January 1, 2000, are legally protected and can’t be removed without a free rehabilitation tenement.“In the present case (Malwani), there is no document to show who is the original allottee. There is no mechanism to check. It is pure greed,” HC said.“The original allottee is an encroacher of government land, who received the ground floor for free. He then built more floors vertically and let them out on rent to meet his greed,” it said.The HC will continue the hearing on Tuesday.

05-07-2021||Lucknow||BJP giving political colour to religious conversion issue: Mayawati||BSP supremo Mayawati on Monday accused the BJP of giving political colour to the issue of religious conversion in an attempt to hide its failures ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in five states.“It seems that now they (BJP) want to give political colour to (religious conversions) to cover their weaknesses ahead of the assembly elections to be held in some states of the country. If this is really a conspiracy, it is highly condemnable,” Mayawati said.Alleging that the BJP has a political interest in cases of religious conversion, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said, looking at the entire Muslim community with suspicion is wrong.“It is completely illegal to convert someone by intimidating, threatening or luring them and strict action should be taken against the culprits after proper investigation of such cases,” Mayawati said.The BSP chief further said “as per a well thought out strategy and conspiracy”, it is being portrayed as a “Hindu-Muslim issue”.“Looking at the entire Muslim community with suspicion is not correct… This is the belief of Muslim community and other people also. This is creating a sense of insecurity among Muslims. The BSP condemns it in the strongest terms,” she said.“It is being claimed that a conspiracy to harm the country under the guise of religious conversion was going on for a long time. If this is true then what were the intelligence agencies of the country doing till now. The action that is being taken now should have been taken long back,” she added.Mayawati, without naming anyone, claimed the properties confiscated or demolished by the Yogi Adityanath government as they were allegedly owned by mafia elements mostly belonged to Muslims.The state government has tightened the noose on BSP MLA from Mau Mukhtar Ansari and his associates. While proceedings are going on against them, many of their properties were attached and illegal constructions were demolished.

She is the most credible secular leader in the country who can fight and defeat the communal BJP. I have left one Congress to join another. We are sure of resisting the saffron camp across India in the future,” Mukherjee said.The newly inducted leader said that while he was in touch with Mamata Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee before the assembly elections, had he joined the TMC before the polls, it would have been construed that he switched allegiance for some post.“I don’t hanker for any post. I work as a grassroots worker and it is up to the party to decide how to use me. I did not have any post in the Congress,” Mukherjee added.TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said the party hopes that Abhijit Mukherjee’s political acumen and sagacity will help it to ensure a “BJP-free India” in the future.“We would like to use his services appropriately to fight the communal, undemocratic and fascist forces. He is the son of Pranab Mukherjee, who was our source of inspiration on many matters. He was a politician with deep roots in secular and progressive values,” Chatterjee added.

05-07-2021||---||No option save a JPC: Antony after French Rafale probe||New Delhi, July 5Upping the ante on alleged corruption in the Rafale deal, the Congress on Monday said the only way forward in the matter was a fair probe by a joint parliamentary committee.The party on Monday fielded former defence minister AK Antony to ask why Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “mum” even after 48 hours of the ordering of a corruption investigation into the Rafale deal by French Public Prosecution Services.“Simple question is why has the Government chosen to remain ‘mum’? Why have the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister not come forward to react on the shocking and sensational development of a corruption probe in the Rafale deal by the Public Prosecution Services of France? Can the Government escape accountability for corruption allegations by its intriguing silence? Is it not the responsibility of the Government to come forward and accept the truth,” Antony asked.He said the government’s clarification was even more important as 36 aircrafts were purchased under an ‘Inter-Governmental Agreement’ and one party to the agreement – the French Government—has proceeded to order an investigation through a judge.“The only way forward is to accept accountability and order a free and fair JPC probe into the entire set of facts, evidence and allegations of corruption in the Rafale deal,” said Antony adding that “prima facie corruption” in the Rafale deal was now apparent.The former minister alleged that the intriguing silence of the Government pointed towards mal intent to hush up corruption.“The refusal of the Government to probe and punish the guilty is even more astonishing, pointing towards a concerted effort to bury the scam,” Antony said.The Congress veteran said the PM went to Paris on April 10, 2015 and “unilaterally announced the purchase of 36 Rafale aircrafts without going through any tender process and in complete disregard of the Defence Procurement Procedure.“Every defence expert was shocked. It was even more surprising as there was an ongoing negotiation for purchase of 126 Rafale Aircrafts in pursuance of an international tender, which envisaged 108 aircrafts to be made in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and 18 aircrafts to be purchased in fly away condition. This international tender for 126 aircrafts envisaged Transfer of Technology to India. Till today, neither the PM nor the Government have explained the reason for reducing the number of aircrafts from 126 to 36 or for sacrificing the Transfer of Technology clause,” said Antony.He said the Government had also not explained the basis for enhancing the price of 36 aircrafts or for denying the offset contract to HAL.“No reason has also been given as to why when an ongoing tender was being finalized, how could the PM unilaterally enter into another agreement?  The subsequent series of events and documents have affirmed the stance of the Congress about wrongdoing and corruption in the Rafale deal,” the former minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-option-save-a-jpc-antony-after-french-rafale-probe-278601
05-07-2021||Patna||Frail-looking Lalu addresses RJD workers after long time, slams Modi-Nitish||A frail-looking RJD supremo Lalu Prasad on Monday addressed his first political meeting in a long time and castigated the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and Nitish Kumar administration in Bihar for their “many failures” and predicted that a bright future awaits his own party under his son Tejashwi Yadav.Appearing on national television to mark the silver jubilee of the party he founded in 1997 after breaking away from the Janata Dal, Prasad, who is suffering from many ailments and convalescing at his MP daughter Misa Bharti’s residence in New Delhi, recalled his struggles for OBC quota and the fight for the rights of the weaker sections.The snappy wisecracks were missing from the speech he delivered virtually for scores of RJD workers and leaders at the party’s state headquarters in Patna who were waiting for a glimpse of their leader for a long time since his incarceration after conviction in the fodder scam.“GST and demonetisation as also corona have created an economic crisis. Now, there is the threat of destroying the social fabric. After Ayodhya, some people are talking about Mathura,” Prasad, a strident critic of the BJP, said without naming the BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He attacked the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar over “rampant corruption”, alleged mismanagement of the Covid-19 crisis and “four murders” taking place in the state every day.“Lakhs and lakhs of people are being reduced to migrant labourers because of lack of employment,” he said.He lavished praise on his younger son Tejashwi Yadav, who is the leader of the opposition, for astutely helming the party during the assembly elections in 2020.“Frankly, I had never expected this from him. He safely anchored the RJD’s boat (naiya paar lagayi). RJD has a bright future,” he said.RJD is the single largest party in the 243-member Bihar assembly though the JD(U)-BJP alliance governs the state.Prasad also had a word of praise for his elder son Tej Pratap who, he said, made a “forceful speech” at the event.The RJD boss, known for breathing fire and brimstone while making political speeches, in his restrained address, credited his wife Rabri Devi, a former chief minister, and Tejashwi for being alive.“But for them, I would have perished in Ranchi (where he was incarcerated in the fodder scam cases). Doctors at AIIMS here also took great care of me,” Prasad, who slurred at times, said.He promised RJD workers and leaders that he will overcome whatever remained of the illness and visit Bihar soon.“I will come to Patna soon...not only Patna, I will mark my attendance in all districts of Bihar soon. Please don’t lose patience,” he told them. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/frail-looking-lalu-addresses-rjd-workers-after-long-time-slams-modi-nitish-278598
05-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt, Centre to respond to plea alleging inordinate delay in reopening spa centres||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought response of the Delhi government and the Centre on a plea alleging inordinate delay in issuing guidelines to reopen spa centres, which were closed in April due to the second wave of Covid-19, while salons, gymnasiums and yoga institutions have been allowed to be open.Justice Rekha Palli issued notices and sought replies of Delhi government, Ministries of Home Affairs and Health and Family Welfare on the petition filed by owners of two spa centres here.“It is expected that respondent no. 1 (Delhi government) on the next date of hearing will be ready with the explanation as to why in light of the (earlier) order of this court, spas are not permitted to be open,” the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on July 22.The judge also observed that it was not for the court to direct when to open spa centres, especially when there are experts to look into it.“We are not living in ivory towers, we are aware of the situation. Hotels have opened in some states, we know. But I can’t direct them today to open spa centres. I have to hear them also,” the judge said.When the counsel for the petitioners sought advancement of the date of hearing, the judge said “don’t worry nobody is in a hurry to go to spas”.To this, the counsel said it was a question of livelihood of poor people employed in these spas and they are facing a tough time.Advocate Davesh Vashishth, appearing for petitioners Pritam Raj and Manish Upreti, argued that even though the Delhi government has permitted gyms, ayurvedic centres and salons to open in Delhi in June, they have not passed similar orders regarding spa centres.The petitioners are being aggrieved by the “arbitrary, unlawful, unwarranted and in-ordinate delay in issuing the guidelines for reopening the spa centres, and petitioners are also challenging the guidelines dated June 26, 2021, issued by the respondent no. 1 (Delhi government) through Delhi Disaster Management Authority by virtue of which salons, gymnasiums and yoga institutions have been allowed without application of mind, and is highly discriminatory,” the plea said.Delhi government additional standing counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan said everyone has seen the Covid-19 situation in March, April and May and that more than four lakh people died and the issue has to be holistically examined by experts of the field.“Can they do spa by wearing PPE kits? Let them wait for some time and let the situation becomes conducive,” he said.Due to the second wave of Covid-19, lockdown was imposed and spa centres along with malls, bars, and gyms were closed on April 15 in Delhi.The plea sought quashing of June 26 order of DDMA qua spa centres and urged the court to direct for reopening spa centres in Delhi and permit their re-functioning in a time bound manner.The plea sought direction to the authorities to decide the matter relating to reopening and functioning of spas centres in Delhi within a week.“The guidelines issued by the Delhi government through DDMA have directed reopening of the yoga centres and gyms and specifically prohibited reopening of spas. It is pertinent to mention that these guidelines are without application of mind, and is highly discriminatory as similar services like masseur services through Urban Clap and Salons are operational as on date,” it said.It said that on January 14, the high court had passed an order directing reopening of spa centres which were closed during the first wave of the pandemic.It cited the high court’s order which had said that the slight difference in the nature of services and a slightly higher percentage of risk due to the proximity of the client and the service provider can be obviated by prescribing stricter measures and safeguards rather than continuing to keep such establishments closed.It also cannot be lost sight of that several salons also provide services akin to those provided in spas, the order said.“Thus, the difference between the services provided in salons and spas is very minimal. Both these services require service providers and service takers to remain in close proximity for a sufficient duration. Thus, while allowing the opening of salons, continuing the embargo on spas would be violative of the rights of these establishments and their employees,” the high court had said.The plea said the petitioners have no other means to earn for their livelihood and due to closure of their spas, their families and staff are facing acute financial crisis and are on the verge of starvation.It said the petitioners had given representation to the Delhi government for reopening of spa centres but nothing happened, after which they approached the court.It said the petitioners are directors of Ayur Thai Spa and Revive Spa in south Delhi respectively having valid licenses to run the spa centres in Delhi.

National highways witnessed a record award, construction and dispute resolution even during the challenging times of Covid 19 during his tenure. His tenure was among the best ever achieved in NHAI. His contribution for construction of oxygen plants across India will always be remembered.”Gadkari also thanked Sandhu for “constant support towards the development of national highways” in clear recent trend of the Government publicly hailing the services of bureaucrats during Covid times.Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally led the tributes for Guruprasad Mohapatra who as secretary to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade steered the availability of medical oxygen at the height of the second Covid 19 wave.Sandhu had taken over as Chairman, NHAI, in October 2019.He previously served as additional secretary, higher education, erstwhile Ministry of Human Resource Development. An MBBS from government medical college, Amritsar and masters in history from Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Sandhu also holds a law degree.“He has vast experience in the field of state roads, infrastructure development, PPP projects, finance, urban development, environment, health and family welfare, tourism, revenue administration, rural development, power, new and renewable energy, information technology, industries and science and technology.

05-07-2021||New Delhi||Wait on to see if Uttarakhand ‘Constitutional crisis’ formula can be applied to Mamata Banerjee||The BJP may have managed to contain its “Constitutional crisis” in Uttarakhand through the resignation of Tirath Singh from the post of the Chief Minister, it remains to be seen if the same argument/logic can be applied to Mamata Banerjee to corner her in West Bengal.      Speculations are rife as Mamata has been asking the Election Commission to announce dates for by-polls to vacant seats in West Bengal. She also took a swipe at the ECI, saying that perhaps the Constitutional body is waiting for the Prime Minister’s nod and “appealed” to Narendra Modi “to allow the by-polls to be held”.Amid the ongoing cat and mouse between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP in West Bengal, an alleged visit by BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari to the residence of the Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta has led to another political storm in the State with the ruling party writing to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking his removal (Mehta's)Notably, Mamata, like Tirath Singh, is not an elected member of the Legislative Assembly, or an MLA, which is mandatory to become CM or a minister in any state.As per rules, Tirath Singh who assumed office on March 10, had to be elected to the Legislative Assembly of Uttarakhand in six months which was before September 10. Similarly, Banerjee, who took oath on May 5, needs to be elected to the West Bengal Assembly before November 5.Article 164(4) of the Constitution says, “A Minister who for any period of six consecutive months is not a member of the Legislature of the State shall at the expiration of that period cease to be a Minister.”West Bengal, like Uttarakhand, does not have a Legislative Council, or an upper house.Now, the difference between Tirath Singh and Mamata is that the former had to quit since by-polls on two vacant seats there could not be held before September 10 because the Assembly polls are scheduled in less than a year.This cannot be used in West Bengal as Assembly polls there are almost five years away.However, interestingly, sources say a request could have “easily been made by either the Uttarakhand government or the CM on the grounds that by-polls are necessary for them to meet the Constitutional requirements”. But the buzz is that neither Tirath Singh nor the Uttarakhand government petitioned the ECI to hold by-elections to allow him to become a member of the Assembly before the due date.Notably, in a similar situation in 2020 when elections were put on the hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Maharashtra government has asked for relaxation in restrictions to allow the election of CM Uddhav Thackeray. Though later, he was nominated to the legislative council.West Bengal like Uttarakhand does not have a Legislative Council.  The legislative council there was abolished around 1969.Currently, only some states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka, have an upper house.The TMC government has approved its setting up as it was a promise made by the party in its election manifesto.However, it is not entirely in the hands of the state government as the permission of the Parliament is also required.Mamata has also moved the Calcutta high court challenging Suvendu Adhikari’s win in Nandigram.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wait-on-to-see-if-uttarakhand-constitutional-crisis-formula-can-be-applied-to-mamata-banerjee-278594

05-07-2021||Bilaspur||Widow loses right to previous husband’s property if her remarriage proven: Chhattisgarh HC||The Chhattisgarh High Court has observed that rights of a woman over the property of her deceased husband would cease if her remarriage is “strictly proven” as per the law.A bench of Justice Sanjay K Agrawal made the observation in a recent order, while dismissing an appeal related to a property suit filed against Kiya Bai by her deceased husband’s cousin brother Loknath, who claimed that she had remarried as per local rituals. “According to Section 6 of the Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act 1856, in case of remarriage, all the formalities for marriage are required to be proved,” the order said. “…..The effect of the valid remarriage is the widow losing her right in the property inherited from the previous husband. Therefore, where remarriage is set up as defence, it has to be strictly proved looking to devastating consequences to be befallen upon the widow in the shape of depriving her the right to property,” it said. As per the order, the dispute relates to the sharing of property of Kiya’s husband Ghasi, who died in 1942 at Chichor Umaraiya village in the state’s Raigarh district. The property in dispute originally belonged to Sugriv, who had four sons--Mohan, Abhiram, Goverdhan and Jeeverdhan--all dead now. Goverdhan had one son Loknath, the plaintiff in the case who is also now dead, and Ghasi was the son of Abhiram. Loknath had moved the court claiming that Kiya, after her husband’s death, remarried in 1954-55 through ‘Chudi’ form (a traditional custom in Chhattisgarh wherein a man marries a widow by offering her bangles). Therefore, she and her daughter would get no share in the property, being governed by clause 29 of the Raigarh State Wajib-ul-arz. Kiya, who also died during pendency of the suit, and her daughter in a joint statement had said the partition of the property took place when Ghasi was alive. The duo had said that after Ghasi’s death, they remained in possession of the suit property and Kiya’s name was included in the revenue records by tehsildar (revenue officer) in 1984 in accordance with the law. They had said Kiya never remarried and the civil suit should be dismissed. After hearing the matter, the HC in its order said there is no admissible evidence on record to hold that Kiya had remarried and lost her right to the property. “..as it has already been held that the effect of remarriage would be, widow loses her right in the property inherited from her husband and unless the fact of remarriage is strictly proved after observing the ceremonies required as per Section 6 of the Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act 1856, the fact of remarriage cannot be said to be established by which the right to property, which is a constitutional right, is lost that too by widow,” it said. Earlier, trial court had held that Kiya and her daughter were not entitled for any share in the property, which the first appellate court reversed, holding that during the lifetime of Ghasi and his father Abhiram, the suit property was partitioned and Kiya remained in its possession after Ghasi’s death. After the Hindu Succession Act-1956 came into force, Kiya became the full owner and as such, the plaintiff is not entitled for any decree, the appellate court had held.  Later, a second appeal was filed in the high court.

They had targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Congress and Left parties have made a fresh demand for a probe into the Rafale purchase deal by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in light of French government instituting a Judicial Commission to probe into allegations of corruption in the Rafale deal.The Congress and the CPI(M) have given broad hints to raise the issue in Parliament during the Monsoon Session.However, Mayawati took a jibe at the Congress with regard to corruption in arms purchase deals during its regime, making it clear in public perception that her stand on the Rafale was autonomous, and not influenced by it (Congress).“Probe into the allegations and counter allegations on commissions in purchase of arms for defence is not new, rather it is a new continuation of the same old chapter starting from the Congress regime,” Mayawati tweeted in Hindi.She added that the present government should come clean on the Rafale deal and put the controversy surrounding it to rest.“The news of the institution of judicial probe set up by the French government on allegations of corruption in the purchase of Rafale fighter jets by the Indian government has made national and international headlines due to which the issue has become topic of fresh discussions. It would be better if the Union government takes appropriate cognisance of it,” Mayawati added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/controversy-surrounding-rafale-jet-deal-gathers-storm-before-monsoon-session-of-parliament-278588

In response to a show-cause notice issued by the government, Fefar justified his absence as the workplace environment was not ideal for "doing penance" to "change the global conscience".Fefar, a Rajkot resident, was then granted premature retirement from government service because of his absence from office due to his claims. He claimed that it was because of his divine powers that the state was receiving good rains for the last two years.On July 1, demanding money from Water Resources Department of the government, Fefar wrote to the secretary claiming that the "demons sitting in the government" were harassing him by withholding his salary and gratuity. Because of the "harassment" he will now bring drought in Gujarat as he is the "tenth avatar of Lord Vishnu"."I am indeed the 'Kalki' Avatar of lord Vishnu and it is because of my 'Tapascharya' that the country is receiving good rains for two years, benefiting Hindustan with more than Rs 20 lakh crore. Despite that, the demons sitting in the government offices are harassing me. So I am going to bring drought in the entire world," Fefar claims in his letter."The Gujarat government owes me around Rs 16 lakh for the salary of one year. I have been doing work from home as everybody else during this Corona times," says Fefar's letter.Fefar claims that he had first realised that he was Kalki Avatar, when he was in the office in March 2010. Since then, he has acquired divine powers, he claimed to the media.Fefar has also claimed that it was he who brought the present crisis of the coronavirus and said that no one will be able to escape from it. There was only one cure to beat it, "Chanting Sitaram Mantra thousands of times".--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vishnu-avatar-guj-man-demands-rs-16l-salary-or-else-face-drought-278574

Hence, it was not given, he said.To this, Bhujbal asked, "If there are mistakes in the data, why wasn't the rectification and correction done? Why were you sitting over the data for six years. If the data is used for central schemes like Ujjwala gas, why isn't it being given for the OBC (quota issue)." The 2021 census has not begun due to COVID-19, then how can the state government begin an empirical inquiry for the OBC population? he asked.The minister said when Fadnavis was the chief minister, he wrote to the NITI Ayog on August 1, 2019, seeking the census data."Why are you playing with words like empirical inquiry or data? We are pursuing the demand for census data with the Centre. The Supreme Court has asked the State Backward Class Commission to conduct an empirical inquiry, which can be done only after the census data is provided," he said.When presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav put the resolution for a vote, BJP members Girish Mahajan and Sanjay Kute climbed the Speaker's podium and argued with the Chair.The Chair subsequently adjourned the House for 10 minutes.Later, when the House reassembled, Sunil Prabhu (Shiv Sena) and Nawab Malik (NCP) alleged that BJP members "misbehaved" with the presiding officer and manhandled him in the Speaker's chamber."Action should be taken against them," they said.Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal then adjourned the House for another 15 minutes.Later, speaking to reporters outside the House, Fadnavis said BJP members had not misbehaved with the presiding officer."Since we exposed the falsehood of the government, some new twist is being given so that the House doesn't function. Bhujbal has not given factual information in the House. The central government hasn't used census data for its schemes," he said.The Supreme Court earlier this year quashed quota for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local bodies after observing that the total number of seats earmarked for various communities, including the SCs and STs, should not exceed 50 per cent of its total strength.Earlier in the day, Fadnavis said the SC had asked for an empirical inquiry (into the issue of OBCs population) through the State Backward Class Commission."The apex court has not asked for census data. The resolution is time pass, face-saver and misleading, and will not yield anything. But, we will support the resolution as we want to stand by the OBCs," the BJP leader said.

05-07-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Youth Congress leader complains to NCPCR against Kerala MLA Mukesh for his remarks against class 10 student||The national coordinator of the Indian Youth Congress on Monday shot off a complaint to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) against CPI(M) MLA M Mukesh for his remarks against a class 10 student during a telephone call.In his complaint letter, J S Akhil, has termed as "derogatory" how the actor spoke to the boy and also alleged that the Kollam MLA had "humiliated" and "threatened" the child."It is most unfortunate that a cine artist by profession and a person occupying the high chair of MLA who has high responsibility and commitment to the society at large fails to address the issue of a juvenile," he has said in his complaint.According to a recording of the telephonic conversation between Mukesh and the student, the MLA shouted at the boy from Palakkad for calling him up for help instead of the legislator of the boy's own district.Mukesh, thereafter, in a video claimed that the phone call was part of a"politically motivated plan" to "harass him and corner him" into a situation, which would spark an outburst from him.Mukesh told the media that ever since he has been re-elected from Kollam, he has been receiving calls at all hours of the day on frivolous issues like why is the train late, when electricity supply will be restored, etc, and charged that all these were part of a "major plan" to harass him.In the audio clip, which went viral, the student can be heard saying that he had called asking for some help and he got the number from a friend.However, an irate Mukesh does not ask what the student's grievance was and shouts at the boy, saying that he should have called the Palakkad MLA, who is not dead, for help before calling him.He is also heard telling the student that he should slap his friend in the face for giving the number of the actor instead of the Palakkad MLA.When the boy says he does not know who the Palakkad MLAs, Mukesh said that had the student been standing before him, he would have caned him as a class 10 boy should be aware of the legislator of his constituency.He told the teenager to find out who the Palakkad MLA and to speak to him or her and not to call him again without first contacting the legislator of that constituency.Explaining his conduct, Mukesh said in his video that the student had called him six times before the recorded conversation and each time he had told the boy that he was in a zoom meeting and would call him back.However, the boy kept calling and the meeting got cut off, he claimed and said if the boy was really innocent he would not have recorded the conversation.The actor further said that his remark regarding caning the boy was just an expression as his conduct towards children can be ascertained from the children's show he had hosted.He said there was no need to teach him how to behave with kids as he has children, always tries to encourage children to achieve their best and never misbehaves with them and the incident in question was a well-conceived plan to distress him.The actor had also said that he would be filing a complaint with the cyber Cell of the police and soon it would be revealed who all were behind the incident.This is not the first time Mukesh has been the centre of a controversy over his response to a telephone call.A few years back he had ranted at a caller who had called him at 11 PM.--PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/youth-congress-leader-complains-to-ncpcr-against-kerala-mla-mukesh-for-his-remarks-against-class-10-student-278567
05-07-2021||New Delhi||1 in 10 women in India 'ran out of food' during lockdown: Report||More than one in 10, or nearly 3.2 crore women in India "limited their food intake or ran out of food" during the Covid-induced lockdown last year, finds a report.The report, titled 'Impacts of Covid-19 on women in low-income households in India' conducted by social impact advisory group Dalberg, captures the experiences and perspectives of nearly 15,000 women and 2,300 men across the 10 states of Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal from March 24 to May 31, 2020, and the following months from June till October 2020.The pandemic exacerbated women's nutritional challenges, as an additional 3.2 crore reported being worried about food sufficiency in their households, the report showed.About 16 per cent of women, who used menstrual pads before the pandemic, had no or limited access to menstrual pads, primarily because they could no longer afford these items.In addition, more than one in three married women were unable to access contraceptives or 15 per cent of married women could not access contraceptives, primarily due to concerns about accessing a healthcare facility during the pandemic.While Kerala, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh did well on providing women with both pads and contraceptives, Bihar had the highest proportion of women (49 per cent) with no or low access, the report showed."The health repercussions on these women who, majority of in their reproductive age between aged 18-55, is going to be far more," Swetha Totapally, Partner, Dalberg Advisors, and the author of the report, told IANS."We should be thinking about the generational impacts - how is the issue affecting women and girls today, and how are those impacts from today going to affect them for the next 15-20 years? And how do we address that accordingly?" Meanwhile, the report showed that government schemes such as MGNREGA (1.2 crore), Jan Dhan (10 crore), and PDS (18 crore) supported women during the crisis.About 70 per cent of women in the study depended on PDS for food and nutrition during the crisis than on any other channel.Totapally told IANS that the need "address gender barriers in the value chain".The question should be how do we look at what's happening to women and how do we offer practical solutions within our existing entitlement infrastructure to support them, she noted."It is important to tweak our government machinery so that it better supports women and girls in crisis moments," Totapally said.The lockdown also financially affected women in India, who already constitute a minority in the paid workforce.During April-May, the pandemic resulted in job and income losses for an estimated 4.3 crore women (57 per cent out of the 7.6 crore who were previously employed).One out of four women (6.4 crore women) were yet to meaningfully recover their paid work as of September-October 2020.An estimated 87 lakh women who were working before the pandemic remained out of work as of October 2020.Moreover, women experienced a deeper loss and a slower recovery in paid work compared to men -- women made up just 24 per cent of those working before the pandemic and yet, they accounted for 28 per cent of all those who lost jobs, and 43 per cent of those yet to recover their paid work compared to 35 per cent men."The impact of the pandemic on women in India is both devastating and unsurprising. Our study offers hope. It is clear that government entitlements have proved indispensable in helping women navigate the crisis so far, our findings demonstrate how such help can be even more responsive to the needs of specific segments, and they show how support can be re-imagined for the longer term," Totapally said.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-in-10-women-in-india-ran-out-of-food-during-lockdown-report-278563

05-07-2021||New Delhi||Shocking that people still booked under scrapped section 66A of IT Act, says SC||The Supreme Court on Monday termed as “amazing” and “shocking” that people are still being booked under the Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which was scrapped by the apex court verdict in 2015.A bench of Justices R F Nariman, K M Joseph and B R Gavai issued notice to the Centre on an application filed by NGO, 'Peoples Union For Civil Liberties' (PUCL).“Don't you think this is amazing and shocking? Shreya Singhal judgement is of 2015. It's really shocking. What is going on is terrible,” the bench told senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for PUCL.Parikh said that despite express directions of the court in 2019 that all state governments should sensitise police personnel about the March 24, 2015 judgement, thousands of cases have been registered under the section.The bench said, “Yes, we have seen those figures. Don't worry we will do something”.Parikh said there has to be some kind of method to handle the matter as people are suffering.Justice Nariman told Parikh that he should read his dissent verdict in Sabarimala judgement and it is really shocking.  Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, said that on perusal of IT Act it can be seen that section 66A features in it and in the footnote one can see it written that the provision has been scrapped. “Now when a police officer has to register a case, he sees the section and registers the case without going through the footnote. Instead what can be done is that we can put a bracket just after section 66A and mention that it has been scrapped. We can in the footnote put the entire extract of the verdict,” Venugopal said. Justice Nariman said, “You please file counter in two weeks. We have issued a notice. List the matter after two weeks”. The top court was hearing a fresh application of PUCL saying, “That, shockingly, despite the order dated February 15, 2019, and steps taken towards compliance thereof, the Applicant discovered that Section 66A of the IT Act has continued to be in use not only within police stations but also in cases before trial courts across India”. The NGO said, “That in spite of the order passed by this Court on February 15, 2019, directing that copies of the judgment of this Court in Shreya Singhal should remain available with every High Court as well as all the District Courts and that the police departments in the entire country i.e. all States and UTs be sensitized about the said judgment, the facts mentioned above show that not only the investigations under Section 66A by the police are continuing but even in the trial courts”.

05-07-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court to hear Ramdev's plea on remarks on allopathy on July 12||The Supreme Court Monday said it would hear on July 12 the plea of yoga guru Ramdev seeking a stay on proceedings in connection with multiple FIRs lodged over his alleged remarks against the use of allopathic medicines during the COVID pandemic, saying it received original records of his statements late Sunday night only.The apex court was scheduled to examine the original records of the statements of Ramdev on the use of allopathic medicine following his plea to stay investigation and transfer the cases lodged against him in this connection to Delhi.“Yesterday night at 11 PM, we got bulky files having copies of statements and videos,” said a bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy.“We are posting the matter after a week,” the CJI said after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Ramdev, offered that the matter can be taken up on some other day.Earlier, the bench had sought original records pertaining to the alleged statements made by Ramdev on the issue.Multiple FIRs have been lodged against Ramdev in Patna and Raipur following complaints by the Indian Medical Association.Besides seeking quashing of criminal complaints, Ramdev has sought their clubbing and transfer to Delhi.As an interim relief, Ramdev has also urged for a stay on the investigation in connection with the criminal complaints.The criminal complaints have been lodged by Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Bihar and Chhattisgarh over his alleged remarks against the use of allopathic medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Patna and Raipur chapters of the IMA have lodged complaints against Ramdev,alleging that his remarks are likely to cause prejudice to the COVID control mechanism and may dissuade people from availing proper treatment against the pandemic.The yoga guru has been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act, 2005.Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the IPC have been invoked against him.Ramdev, whose alleged statements stirred a nationwide debate over the issue of Allopathy versus Ayurveda, however, had withdrawn his statements on May 23 after receiving a letter from Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who had called his remarks as "inappropriate".The Delhi Medical Association (DMA), meanwhile, has sought permission to become a party to the case, alleging that Ramdev insulted Allopathy and "instigated" people to disregard vaccines and treatment protocols.The DMA, having 15,000 Delhi doctors as members, has claimed that Ramdev's Patanjali earned over Rs 1,000 crore by selling Coronil kits which were not approved by medical bodies.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-to-hear-ramdevs-plea-on-remarks-on-allopathy-on-july-12-278551
05-07-2021||New Delhi||Enforcement Directorate arrests Shakti Bhog CMD in money laundering case||The ED on Monday said it had arrested Kewal Krishan Kumar, chairman and managing director (CMD) of Delhi-based Shakti Bhog Foods Limited, in a money laundering case linked to an alleged multi-crore bank loan fraud.Kumar was arrested on Sunday here and later produced before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court that sent him to ED custody till July 9, the federal investigative agency said in a statement.The agency, prior to the arrest, also raided at least nine premises in Delhi and Haryana. "During the searches, various incriminating documents and digital evidences have been recovered," it said.The ED case filed under criminal sections of the PMLA is based on a CBI FIR that was filed earlier this year against Shakti Bhog Foods Limited for an alleged fraud of Rs 3,269 crore on a consortium of 10 banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI).The CBI complaint came after the SBI registered a complaint against the company.According to the SBI, the directors allegedly falsified accounts and forged documents to siphon off public funds.The 24-year-old company, which is into manufacturing and selling wheat, flour, rice, biscuits, cookies, etc, had grown organically as it ventured into food-related diversification over a decade with a turnover growth of Rs 1,411 crore in 2008 to Rs 6,000 crore in 2014, the bank had said.The ED said the "allegations against the accused include diversion of funds from loan accounts by round-tripping through related entities and siphoning of funds was being done by way of suspicious sale/purchase from various entities".The bank report to the CBI said the turnover growth of the company came to an abrupt halt in 2015 with the account turning into a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) and it was ultimately declared a fraud in 2019.The account turned an NPA on account of inventory losses owing to a steep fall in paddy prices, under-utilisation of capital expenditure in the rice and paddy segments and a delay in the tie-up funds to tide over losses, an investigation report by the bank on staff accountability had noted in 2017.A forensic audit done by the bankers pointed out that the company, in its account books of financial year 2015-16, showed that its inventory worth over Rs 3,000 crore got damaged due to pests and was sold at substantially low prices.This was contradictory to the stock and receivable audit report, which showed that the company had a stock of over Rs 3,500 crore in September 2015, its warehouses were fully stocked and none of the inventory was obsolete or slow moving, the bank had alleged in its complaint.

05-07-2021||New Delhi||Remove BJP leaders who 'harassed' Muslims from posts if true to your words: Digvijaya to Bhagwat||A day after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat asserted that the DNA of all Indians is the same, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Monday said if Bhagwat is true to his words, he must give directions that all those BJP leaders who "harassed" innocent Muslims be removed from their posts.Singh, however, added that Bhagwat will not do so, alleging that there is a difference between his words and actions.  In his address at an event 'Hindustan First Hindustani Best' organised by the Muslim Rashtriya Manch in Ghaziabad on Sunday, Bhagwat also took on those indulging in lynching. "Cow is a holy animal, but those involved in lynching are against Hindutva," he had said. Bhagwat had also said that though at times, some "false cases" of lynching have been registered against some people.संघ प्रमुख मोहन भागवत बोले- हिंदू और मुस्लिम अलग नहीं, सभी भारतीयों का डीएनए एक है https://t.co/bkfecvXRWEमोहन भागवत जी यह विचार क्या आप अपने शिष्यों, प्रचारकों, विश्व हिंदू परिषद/ बजरंग दल कार्यकर्ताओं को भी देंगे? क्या यह शिक्षा आप मोदीशाह जी व भाजपा मुख्यमंत्री को भी देंगे?AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi hit back at Bhagwat over his remarks, saying those criminals who carried out lynching may not know the difference between a cow and a buffalo but the names of Junaid, Akhlaq, Pehlu, Rakbar, Alimuddin were enough for them to kill. This hatred is the product of Hindutva and these criminals have the patronage of a  government backing Hindutva, the president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) alleged."Cowardice, violence and murder are an integral part of Godse's Hindutva thinking. The lynching of Muslims is also the result of this thinking," he said in a series of tweets in Hindi.Tagging a report on the RSS chief's remarks that the DNA of all Indians is the same and those asking Muslims to leave the country cannot call themselves Hindus, Singh said, "Mohan Bhagwat ji, will you pass on these views to your disciples, preachers, Vishwa Hindu Parishad/Bajrang Dal workers also? Will you pass on these teachings to Modi-Shah ji and BJP chief minister also?" "Mohan Bhagwat ji, if you make it obligatory for your disciples to follow this thought, I will become your admirer," the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said.Alleging that the RSS had instilled "hatred" between Hindus and Muslims, Singh said it was now not easy to remove the "seeds of hatred" sown against Muslims from "Saraswati Shishu Mandir to the intellectual training provided by the Sangh."  "If you are honest with the views you expressed, then issue directions to remove all those leaders in the BJP, who have harassed innocent Muslims, from their posts immediately. Start with (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi and (UP Chief Minister) Yogi Adityanath," the Congress leader said.Referring to Bhagwat's remarks giving primacy to being Indian, Singh asked Bhagwat to explain this to his disciples first as they "advised me to go to Pakistan many times".

An Afghan-origin man, Eid Gul, carried out multiple reconnaissances in the targeted area and later he and his wife imbedded 20 kg of explosives in the vehicle.

Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee president, is also the incumbent leader of the party in the Lok Sabha. The Congress normally practises the policy of one person, one post but there are many leaders who continue to hold two positions.The talk of Chowdhury’s replacement has been rife since the Congress drew a blank in the recent West Bengal election, where he was instrumental in striking an alliance with the Left against the wishes of the TMC. He has drawn flak within the Congress for pressing an alliance with the Indian Secular Front in Bengal. Chowdhury has been an open critic of Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.In the last session too, the Congress had nominated Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu as the acting leader of Lok Sabha in the absence of Chowdhury, who was campaigning in Bengal. On reports of Chowdhury’s replacement, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera today said changes in any organisation were an ongoing affair.Roy denies claims on Cong-TMC tangoSaugata Roy, TMC spokesperson and Lok Sabha member, has denied reports on the TMC and Congress contemplating joining hands to put up a united fight against the BJP.

Of 49 samples analysed, none was found positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus infection,” the institute said in its interim report to the Ministry of Jal Shakti.The report also states the pH levels of the Ganga ranged between 7.02 and 8.49 and were found within the prescribed limits at all the sites. “Dissolved oxygen in the river was within range so was biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand,” the interim report added.The discarded bodies had raised an alarm across the country when the second wave was at its peak.Minister of State for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria said the findings came as a relief for every Indian who revered the holy river Ganga.On the disposal of bodies along the banks, Kataria said the practice was integral to the faith of many communities and the government had included the construction of crematoriums and ghats as a component under the “Namami Gange” project. Over 45 crematoriums and 149 ghats had already been constructed, he said.“During May, the National Mission for Clean Ganga swung into action to sound local authorities and help with safe disposal of bodies to ensure dignity to the deceased. The states responded by improving enforcement alongside the river and helping families with finances to perform the last rites,” Kataria said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-covid-traces-in-ganga-after-bodies-found-floating-csir-lab-278289

He also said that though, at times, some false cases of lynching had been registered against people.“If a Hindu says that no Muslim should live here then the person is not a Hindu. A cow is a holy animal but people who are lynching others are going against Hindutva. Law should take its own course against them without any partiality,” he said at the launch of a book written by Dr Khawaja Iftikhar Ahmed.Bhagwat said people could not be differentiated on the basis of how they worshipped. The concept of Hindu-Muslim unity was misleading because there was nothing to unite as they were “not different”, he added.There can never be dominance of either Hindus or Muslims as “there can only be dominance of Indians”, he said. Underlining that development was not possible without unity in the country, he said the basis of unity should be nationalism and the glory of ancestors.Bhagwat said the only solution to the Hindu-Muslim conflict was dialogue, not discord. “Hindu-Muslim unity is misleading as they are not different, but one. The DNA of all Indians is the same, irrespective of religion,” he said. “It has been proven that we are descendants of the same ancestors, going back 40,000 years. People of India have the same DNA,” he said.Addressing the event at Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls early next year, Bhagwat said he was there neither for any image makeover nor for vote bank politics.“The Sangh is not in politics and is doing its work to strengthen the nation and for the welfare of all,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhagwat-those-behind-lynching-against-hindutva-278277

Dhami was administered the oath of office along with 11 ministers by Governor Baby Rani Maurya, two days after Garhwal MP Tirath Singh Rawat resigned from the post to avoid a “constitutional crisis” in the hill state.Editorial: Tirath yatra endsThe ministers include Satpal Maharaj, Harak Singh Rawat, Banshidhar Bhagat, Yashpal Arya, Bishan Singh Chuphal, Subodh Uniyal, Arvind Pandey, Ganesh Joshi, Dhan Singh Rawat, Rekha Arya and Yatishwaranand.Dhami has assumed charge barely a few months ahead of the Assembly elections due early next year and amid visible signs of reservation among senior leaders over his appointment. Sources said Maharaj, Uniyal, Harak Singh, Chuphal, Arya and senior leader Madan Kaushik were among those who expressed reservations regarding Dhami with the party high command. Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to the senior ministers unhappy with the party’s decision to go with the 45-year-old Khatima legislator, they added.Dhami, who paid courtesy calls on his predecessors Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat, also met Maharaj. He is understood to have persuaded the senior leader, whose name was among those doing the rounds until Saturday as probables for the CM’s post.Maharaj was the first to leave the legislature party meeting on Saturday, even before Dhami’s election as its leader was formally announced by Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar. However, reports of resentment or reservation were dismissed by senior leaders.This apart, the young CM has inherited a pile of issues from his predecessors and has very less time to set things right. The challenges before him include a Covid-battered economy, suspended Char Dham yatra, fake Covid testing scam during Kumbh in Haridwar and ongoing agitation by priests of Gangotri and Yamunotri against the Devasthanam Board.Grappling with all these issues and the political challenges of a resurgent Congress amid the growing clout of AAP, Dhami has another issue to address. Over the past few weeks, Uttarakhand has been trending on social media over demands to revive land laws restricting the transfer of land to persons from outside the state to “protect the eco-sensitive state and its cultural identity”. The demand has been revived amid Covid, which has triggered reverse-migration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/12-member-dhami-cabinet-takes-oath-278276

Guilty conscience, saving friends…. all of these,” Rahul tweeted as the BJP reiterated that the Congress leader was acting at the behest of competing defence firms. With the French prosecutors reopening the matter and launching a probe into the alleged corruption and favouritism in the 36-jet fighter deal between India and France, the Congress plans to step up the offensive once again. On the eve of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections too, the Congress had made the Rafale deal the principal poll plank of the party.The Congress is likely to raise the issue in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament. Earlier today, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said national security was merely a slogan for the BJP.“After more than 24 hours of the decision by France to investigate corruption, influence peddling, money laundering, favouritism, there is one question every responsible Indian is asking: ‘why is the government still silent?’” Khera said.The Congress said it was an insult to the people that the government and its ministers continued to be mum on the Rafale “scandal”.“This government makes a song and dances about national security but does everything under the sun to undermine it,” he added.The BJP, meanwhile, reiterated that the Congress was raking up the Rafale issue to “weaken the country”.Sambit Patra, spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party, has alleged that Rahul is acting at the behest of Rafale maker Dassault Aviation’s rival companies.The BJP also said that the French probe development was the outcome of a complaint by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) and should not be seen as a matter linked to corruption.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-govt-unwilling-to-order-jpc-probe-into-rafale-deal-asks-congress-278275

I appreciate the diligence & speed of Punjab Police’s Counter Terrorism Dept (CTD) in unearthing the evidence and commend the excellent coordination of all our civil & military intelligence agencies,” said Imran Khan in a social media post.The Pakistan PM directly blamed New Delhi for the blast that killed three and injured over 20. “The planning and financing of this heinous terror attack has links to Indian sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan. The global community must mobilise international institutions against this rogue behavior,” he stated.Shortly thereafter, Pakistan’s NSA Moeed Yusuf, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry and Punjab IG Inam Ghani addressed the media. “Other than the call records, we have the data on bank account in India used by handlers to transfer money for the bomb blast,” said Yusuf while alleging that a third country was used to transfer money to the orchestrators of the blast.Ghani said the CTD investigated the matter within 16 hours and arrested a “Peter Paul David” who arranged a vehicle for the blast with a tampered engine plate. ‘Eid Gul’, an Afghan-origin man, carried out multiple reconnaissances in the targeted area and later he and his wife imbedded 20 kg of explosives in the vehicle.The same police officer had said a weeks ago that 10 Pakistani citizens — men and women — who were involved and who executed the blast had been arrested.Pakistan’s allegations comes two days after the MEA lodged a strong protest with Pakistan Foreign Ministry and asked it to investigate the incident of a drone hovering over the Indian High Commission premises in Islamabad on June 26. The incident came a day before explosives-laden drones were used to carry out an attack on the Jammu Air Force station on June 27, which preliminary investigations suggest had the imprint of Hafiz Saeed’s Lashkar-e-Toiba.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ties-with-pak-set-to-dip-as-imran-alleges-raw-hand-in-lahore-blast-278192
