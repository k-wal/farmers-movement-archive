31-07-2021||Dimapur/Guwahati||Assam, Nagaland sign agreement to de-escalate tense situation at two locations||The Chief Secretaries of Assam and Nagaland on Saturday signed an agreement to de-escalate tense situation prevailing at two locations in the Dessoi valley forest/Tsurangkong valley by simultaneously withdrawing security forces within the next 24-hours.The agreement was signed following a meeting at Dimapur between Assam Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua and his Nagaland counterpart J Alam in the presence of Nagaland Deputy Chief Minister Y Patton and Assam Education Minister Ranoj Pegu.Both sides agreed that in order to maintain peace and tranquillity in the areas around Ao Senden village and Vikuto village as they are known in Nagaland and called as Jankhona Nala/Nagajankha and Compartment No. 12 respectively in Assam, urgent and effective steps are required for defusing the standoff between the security forces of Nagaland and Assam. “In this regard, it is decided that the security personnel of both states shall simultaneously move back from their present locations to their respective base camps. The simultaneous withdrawal of the security personnel shall begin immediately and shall be completed in the next 24 hours as far as possible,” according to the agreement.Nagaland and Assam shall monitor the area by surveillance using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and satellite imagery with a view to maintaining the status quo.The meeting also decided that the Superintendents of Police of the districts of Mokokchung (Nagaland) and Jorhat (Assam) shall ensure orderly withdrawal of their respective forces and shall be responsible for it.Patton told media persons after the meeting that the chief ministers of both the states had discussions on the border issue with Union Home Minister Amit Shah on July 24 and 25 in Shillong and it was agreed in principle to withdraw the forces and accordingly the agreement was signed Saturday.Discussions were held only for the particular area but the issues related to other areas along the interstate border will also be taken up subsequently, he said.On travellers from Nagaland facing problems while crossing into the neighbouring state, Patton said Assam government has agreed not to stop or check commuters from Nagaland.Assam education minister lauded the statesmanship of the union home minister and the chief ministers of both the states in taking steps to resolve the border issue and hoped that the cordial relationship between the two states will be maintained.“We are having a long pending border issue with different states but despite the disputes, we have been maintaining peace and tranquillity at the border. We are mostly depending on the government to finalise the boundary and I thank people of both sides as well as the government officials for maintaining peace,” he said.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that in a major breakthrough towards de-escalating tensions at Assam-Nagaland border, the two chief secretaries have arrived at an understanding to immediately withdraw states’ forces from border locations to their respective base camps.“This is a historic step in our relations. My gratitude to Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu_Rio for working with Assam in restoring peace at the border”, Sarma tweeted.Assam is committed to ensuring peace along all its borders and strives for social and economic prosperity of Northeast region, he added. Assam’s longest border dispute is with Nagaland, which began since the creation of the state in 1963.The Nagaland State Act of 1962 had defined its borders according to the 1925 notification when Naga Hills and Tuensang Area (NHTA) were integrated into a new administrative unit and made an autonomous area.Nagaland, however, did not accept the boundary delineation and demanded that the new state should comprise the Naga Hills and all Naga-dominated area in North Cachar and Nagaon districts, which were part of Naga territory, created by the British according to the 1866 notification.Since Nagaland did not accept its notified borders, tensions between Assam and Nagaland soon flared up resulting in the first border clashes in 1965 and this was followed by major clashes between the two states along the border in 1968, 1979, 1985, 2007 and 2014.The Assam government had filed a case in the Supreme Court for identification of boundary and resolving border disputes which is still pending.

31-07-2021||New Delhi||Oppn parties demand President’s intervention for formation of JPC on farmer deaths||Some opposition parties, led by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), met President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday to seek his intervention in asking the government to set up a JPC on farmer deaths and allow a discussion in Parliament on the farmers’ issue and the Pegasus snooping controversy.Leaders of SAD, NCP and JKNC met the president and handed over a letter signed by the representatives of various parties for his intervention.The Congress, however, was not a signatory to it.The letter by various parties, including SAD, Shiv Sena, NCP, BSP, JKNC, RLP, CPI and CPI(M), seeks the president’s intervention to ensure the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to ascertain the details of farmer deaths during their agitation against three agriculture laws of the Centre and allow a discussion on their issues in Parliament.After meeting the president, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said the entire Opposition is demanding from the government for the last two weeks to allow them to speak in Parliament on issues concerning people.Among those who met Kovind included Mohammed Faizal (NCP), Hasnain Masoodi (JKNC), Ritesh Pandey (BSP) and Balwinder Singh Bhundar (SAD).Badal said she herself had approached the Congress and the TMC and wanted these parties to accompany them during the meeting with the president, “but unfortunately, it is before you that no one has reached here. We had sought time from the president”.All opposition parties are giving adjournment motions in Parliament on the farmers’ issue and the Pegasus snooping row, she said, alleging that it is the government’s duty to enable Parliament to function, but it is stonewalling the Opposition.“We have come here to tell the president that democracy and democratic traditions are under threat and the voice of parliamentarians is being crushed inside Parliament too. This is a big loss to democracy.“We have appealed to the president, who is the custodian and conscience keeper of the country, to put pressure on the government and admit the people’s issues raised by the opposition parties and allow Parliament to function,” the former Union minister told reporters.She said they may belong to small political parties, but represent people from across the country, from Jammu and Kashmir to Lakshadweep.“We have urged the president to put pressure on the government to let Parliament function smoothly so that people’s issues are addressed,” the Akali leader said.She said farmers are sitting on the roads for the last one year and at Delhi’s borders for eight months, and 500 of them have lost their lives.But when the agriculture minister says no farmer has died during the agitation against the three farm laws, it adds to their anger, Badal said.“The government says this is an issue concerning only one state, but MPs have come here from different states, from every nook and corner of the country,” she added.“The snooping issue is also an issue of national security. Why is the government not agreeing for a discussion on these issues and running away?“We have also appealed to the president to form a Joint Select Committee comprising MPs from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to work out a solution for the protesting farmers. How many more farmers does the government want dead? Five hundred farmers have already died during the agitation,” Badal said.The opposition leaders have demanded that tributes be paid in Parliament to the farmers who have died during the agitation.“We hope that the president would surely tell the government to allow Parliament to function and let public money not be wasted. At least, listen to the families of those farmers who have died,” Badal said.Masoodi said, “We have also urged the president to restore statehood to Jammu and Kashmir.”  Badal said they had urged the Lok Sabha speaker on Friday to form a JPC to find out how many farmers have died during the agitation.“We have now urged the president to form the JPC. We want that the government should not run away from Parliament as it has a responsibility,” she added.Asked about the government accusing the Opposition of stalling Parliament, she said the government just wants to buy time.Every party wants a discussion but the government does not, she alleged.“Simply allow a discussion on both these issues and the House will start functioning and everything will settle down,” the SAD leader said.On the absence of the Congress and the TMC from their meeting with Kovind, she said till the time the Opposition is not united, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will continue to benefit.

31-07-2021||Berlin||China, India miss UN deadline to update emissions targets||China and India have missed a United Nations deadline to submit fresh targets for cutting their greenhouse gas emissions, officials said Saturday.The world’s two most populous countries are among dozens that ignored the deadline of July 30 set by the UN climate change agency to provide an update on their plans for curbing the release of planet-warming gases.China is the country with the world’s highest emissions, while India is third. The United States, which submitted its new target in April, is the second-biggest global emitter.UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa welcomed that 110 signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had met the cut-off date, which was extended from the end of 2020 due to the pandemic.But she said it was “far from satisfactory” that only 58% had submitted their new targets in time.Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria and 82 other nations also failed to update their nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, for the UN to include in a report it is preparing for an international climate change conference in November.Espinosa noted that a previous report found countries were doing too little to meet the goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times. The more ambitious target of capping warming at 1.5C (2.7F) is far out of reach.“Recent extreme heat waves, droughts and floods across the globe are a dire warning that much more needs to be done, and much more quickly, to change our current pathway,” said Espinosa. “This can only be achieved through more ambitious NDCs.” AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-india-miss-un-deadline-to-update-emissions-targets-291007
31-07-2021||Bhopal||Economy’s woes began with Nehru’s 1947 speech: MP minister on inflation||A BJP minister in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday said the  problem of inflation does not arise “in a day or two”, and the economy began to go downhill with the “mistakes” of Jawaharlal Nehru’s speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, 1947.Minister for Medical Education Vishvas Sarang was reacting to a planned protest by the Congress over rising prices and other issues.Talking to reporters in Bhopal, Sarang said that “if the credit for increasing inflation by crippling the economy after the country’s independence goes to anyone, it is the Nehru family”.“Inflation does not rise in a day or two. The foundation of the economy is not laid in a day or two.  The country’s economy has deteriorated due to the mistakes of the speech that (the first prime minister) Jawaharlal Nehru delivered from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, 1947,” the BJP leader said.The Narendra Modi government, on the other hand, has strengthened the economy in the past seven years, he said.The BJP government has launched schemes for the welfare of the poor and their participation in the economy, Sarang said, adding that during the Congress regime the economy was the preserve of a few industrialists.The inflation is down and people’s incomes have increased during the BJP rule, the minister claimed.Congress workers should rather protest in front of “10 Janpath”  (party president Sonia Gandhi’s residence), he quipped.Congress leaders in the state ridiculed Sarang’s comments.MP Congress spokesperson K K Mishra said, “Vishwas Sarang, an eligible minister of Shivraj’s (Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan) circus, is blaming the country’s inflation on Nehru’s speech in 1947, when he was not even born. As a departmental (health) minister, can you state if Nehru was also responsible for the thousands of deaths due to lack of beds, oxygen and Remdesivir during the coronavirus pandemic?”   Narendra Saluja, another Congress spokesperson, said the BJP ministry in MP was full of weird people.“A minister starts climbing up an electricity poll to repair it, another talks about how many children a couple should have, yet another says that money should be charged for a selfie. Now, a minister is holding a speech delivered 75 years ago responsible for inflation. Why did the BJP then promise relief from inflation in its poll campaign?” he asked.

31-07-2021||Lucknow||In UP, women teachers’ association raises chorus for ‘period leave’||An organisation of women teachers in Uttar Pradesh has started a campaign seeking three-day “period leave” for the educators.Underlining the need for such a campaign, Uttar Pradesh Mahila Shikshak Sangh president Sulochana Maurya on Saturday said three days period leave is necessary for women teachers, especially in view of the bad condition of toilets in government schools of the state.“We formed this association on February 8 to work for the cause of women teachers who constitute almost 60 per cent of the total strength of teachers in primary schools. The association already has its units in 50 of the 75 districts of the state,” she told PTI.There are some women specific problems which can be raised effectively only by women and the association is working on them, Maurya said, adding that though there is representation of women in various associations, it is practically ornamental and men continue to dominate the proceedings.More importantly, women teachers do not feel free to share the problems specific to them and sometimes the issues which are important for us are not that serious for our male counterparts, the official, who is posted in a Barabanki school, said.She said the association has already met ministers and other people’s representatives, and handed over memoranda to press for their demand.“A five-member delegation of the association met Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi regarding the issue. He assured that he would discuss the issue with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. We have also met Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and Labour Minister Swami Prasad Maurya,” Maurya said.Meanwhile, the campaign is currently trending on Twitter by the name ‘period leave#’.“This kind of leave is being provided to women in Bihar. Former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad had announced special period leave for two days, but we want three-day leave as we feel this is the need of women,” she asserted.Apart from the campaign on Twitter, the Uttar Pradesh Mahila Shikshak Sangh officials have started handing over memoranda addressed to the CM to various public representatives in various districts of the state.“We will also meet Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and later the chief minister over our demand,” Maurya added.

Infertility is often attributed to advanced-age parenthood. However, the husband and wife were at the brink of giving up as they opted for assisted reproductive technologies (ART), like intrauterine insemination (IUI) to become parents, but failed due to low ovarian reserve (the number and quality of eggs in the ovary), doctors at the IVF clinic said.The birth took place on July 12 at a unit of Seeds of Innocence, a fertility clinic chain based in south Delhi.Dr Gauri Agarwal, director and co-founder, Seeds of Innocence, says the woman had already gone through four cycles of IUI by the time she came to the clinic. Upon investigating the reasons, it was found that anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were low, which indicated low ovarian reserve, such women need IVF, she said."Since the semen sample yielded normal results, we opted for IVF after due counselling to know more about any family history of infertility or addiction, etc. After complete ovarian stimulation, we retrieved four ovum that yielded three embryos, which were transferred – the Indian Medical Council of Research allows transferring of up to three embryos if the quality is not satisfactory," the doctor said."When we did a trans-vaginal scan for viability on six weeks, we found three sacs and four heartbeats. Six weeks later, it was confirmed that all three embryos have thrived, and one of those have further divided to become twins," she said .The would-be parents were offered the option of in-house foetal reduction and explained in detail about risks of carrying quadruplet pregnancy, but "they persisted," the hospital said."On sixteenth week, we put a cervical stitch to prevent cervix from opening and she was kept on close antenatal watch. After 33 weeks, she delivered four healthy babies – three boys and one girl – all weighing more than 1.5 kg," Agarwal said.The process was challenging on many accounts – maternal risks included gestational diabetes mellitus,  pregnancy-induced hypertension, miscarriage, anaemia, breathing difficulties, placenta abruption in which placenta separates prematurely and leads to bleeding, hydramnios (excessive amniotic fluid build-up), and post-partum haemorrhage, doctors said.For the foetuses, the risks included pre-term delivery, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), multiple birth defects, twin-to-twin transfusion, and cord entanglement, Agarwal added.

31-07-2021||New Delhi||Change negative perception of police among people, PM tells IPS probationers||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday told Indian Police Service probationers that the spirit of 'Nation First, Always First' should be reflected in every action of theirs and they should also work towards changing the negative perception of the force among people.He urged the IPS probationers to keep national interest in mind and have a national perspective while taking decisions when they are in the field."You have to always remember that you are the flag-bearers of 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat' too," Modi said."Therefore, the spirit of Nation First, Always First, should be reflected in your every action," the prime minister said addressing the IPS probationers at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy via video-conferencing.Modi said the negative perception of the police among the people is a big challenge in itself.This perception changed a bit during the beginning of the coronavirus period when people saw police personnel helping out, but the situation had again gone back to the old perception, he said."Our police personnel even sacrifice their lives for the security of the country, maintaining law and order and for fighting terrorism. They are unable to go home for days, they are unable to go home even during festivals but when it comes to the police's image, people's perception is different," he said.It is the responsibility of the new generation coming into the police force that this image changes and this negative perception of the police goes away, Modi said.The prime minister said that in the last 75 years, India had tried to build a better police service and police training infrastructure had also improved a lot in recent years."The way the youth of the country came forward between 1930 and 1947, the whole young generation got united for one goal; today, the same sentiment is expected of you," Modi told the IPS probationers."At that time the people of the country fought for 'Swaraj', today you have to move forward for 'surajya' (good governance). You are starting your career at a time when India is going through a phase of transformation in every field," he said."The coming 25 years of your career are also going to be the most important 25 years of India's development. That's why your preparation, your mental state, should be in line with this big goal," he said.Modi also interacted with the probationers during the event. Union Home Minister Amit Shah also participated in the function.The Hyderabad-based academy is the premier police training institution in the country. It trains officers of the Indian Police Service at induction level and conducts various in-service courses for the serving IPS officers.

By encouraging people to eat more beef, the perception that BJP will impose a ban on cow slaughter will be dispelled," he told reporters on Friday.Shullai, who is the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Minister, also assured that he would speak to Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to ensure that cattle transportation to Meghalaya was not affected by the new cow legislation in the neighbouring state.On the vexed boundary dispute between Meghalaya and Assam, the three-term legislator said it was high time the state utilise its police force to protect the border and its people."If the people of Assam keep on harassing our people in the border area, time has come not only to talk and drink tea... We have to react, we have to act on the spot itself," he said.He, however, clarified that he was not pro-violence."We should have the spirit to protect our people, we have to utilise our force -- the police should go to the front to talk with the Assam Police."Lauding the Mizoram Police for "standing up to protect" its land and people, the BJP minister criticised the Meghalaya Police who are always "seen at the backfoot" when it comes to protecting border residents."We have seen from time to time -- the police are behind and the civilians are at the fore-front. The higher-ups should give orders that police should be in the front to protect the people," he said."If enemies come to your house, attack you and your wife and children, you also have to attack in self defense. The same thing should be done at our borders... If your enemy comes to your house to steal or rob your house, you have to protect yourself, whether it is legal or illegal, you have to protect," Shullai asserted.He said the issue of border dispute has been pending for a long and needs to be resolved at the earliest."Many political parties have given commitments in their manifestos that if they come to power they will resolve the issue -- but it's more than 50 years, no party could resolve it. So, we have to do a post-mortem of the problem here," he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eat-more-beef-than-chicken-mutton-fish-bjp-minister-290963

It mentioned that he had withdrawn Rs 40,000 from her UPI account and wasted the money on ‘Free Fire' game,” he said. The minor took the extreme step when his mother, a nurse working with the state health department, had gone to the district hospital and his father was also not at home, police officials said.After getting an alert on her phone about the financial transaction from her account, the boy's mother had called and scolded him for it. The boy then locked himself inside a room. After some time, his elder sister found that he was not opening the door and informed her parents about it, they said. Later, when the door of the room was broken open, the boy was found hanging from the ceiling fan using a scarf, police said. A similar incident had occurred in January this year at  Dhana town of Sagar district in Madhya Pradesh, in which a 12-year-old boy had hanged himself to death after his father took away his mobile phone due to his addiction to 'Free Fire' game.

Of the 400 samples, 243 had tested positive for Covid. In case of health workers, antibodies were found in 62 of the 99 samples (62.6 per cent).“Due to virus mutation, the possibility of achieving herd immunity is not very high,” said Amitabh Awasthy, Secretary, Health and Family Welfare. He said although antibodies were found in 62 per cent people, the likelihood of attaining herd immunity was not very strong due to the prevalence of various mutants.Chief Secretary Anil Khachi said preparations were on to ensure that in the case of a third wave, the state was well equipped to tackle the situation. “Within a month, we will have 28 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants to meet oxygen requirement. This will help cover most of the 100-bedded health institutions at places like Rampur, Theog, Nurpur and Paonta Sahib,” he said.An official said, “The influx of a large number of persons from Nepal to work as labourers in apple orchards makes us vulnerable as the Covid situation is quite grim.” Shimla and Kullu also have a huge tourist influx, which aggravates concerns. Sudden spike in Mandi district hints the dormant virus is getting activated again.2.27L pregnant women given first jab: GovtOver 2.27 lakh pregnant women have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine under the ongoing national inoculation drive, the Health Ministry said on Friday.

Sibal said it was urgent due to its ramifications on national security and civil liberties. Opposition leaders, journalists, members of judiciary were being snooped on and the matter was hitting headlines not just in India, but internationally as well, he added.As the senior lawyers complained that the court’s Registry was not listing it for urgent hearing, the Chief Justice of India said, “We will hear it next week.”Ram and others had moved the top court on Tuesday seeking a judge-led independent investigation into alleged snooping by using Israeli spyware Pegasus.Terming the allegations as an attempt by government agencies to muzzle free speech dissent in India, the petitioners sought a direction to the Centre to disclose if the government or any of its agencies obtained licence for Pegasus spyware and used it, either directly or indirectly, to conduct surveillance in any manner.“The targeted surveillance using military-grade spyware is an unacceptable violation of the right to privacy which has been held to be a fundamental right under Articles 14 (equality before the law), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) by the Supreme Court,” the plea submitted.Israel probes NSOIsrael has launched a probe into the allegations of wrongdoing against NSO Group.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-plea-on-pegasus-next-week-290666
