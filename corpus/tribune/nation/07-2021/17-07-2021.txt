He was covering the situation in Kandahar.While holding a candle light meeting at the Press Club of India, Working News Cameraman Association (WNCA) president S N Sinha said that Siddiqui scaled the heights of his profession while documenting wars, riots and human suffering.“He worked with passion and dedication about the stories he covered and always focused on the people caught up in difficult circumstances,” Sinha said in a statement.The WNCA expressed concern over the “growing trend of attack on media persons while doing their professional duties”.“...Media fraternity is always working as frontline warriors and working under increasing threat and it’s a matter of deep concern to the working journalists and democratic world,” it said in a statement.Jamia Millia alumnus Md Meharban along with mass communication student Srijan Chawla organised a candle light vigil, attended by over 500 people, outside the university’s gate number 17.Meharban remembered Siddiqui who was his college senior and mentor in the profession.Siddiqui’s work as a photojournalist with Reuters news agency since 2011 involved reporting on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Rohingya refugee crisis, the protest in Hong Kong and earthquakes in Nepal.Based in Mumbai, he had received the Pulitzer Prize as part of the photography staff of the news agency.He graduated with a degree in Economics from Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi. He had a degree in Mass Communication from the AJK MCRC in Jamia in 2007.Starting his career as a television news correspondent, he switched to photojournalism and joined Reuters as an intern in 2010.

At times, live streaming of proceedings may become a double-edged sword. However, judges might feel the pressure of public scrutiny, which may ultimately result in a stressful environment that may not be conducive to justice dispensation.“A judge must remember, even if justice commands standing up against the popular perception, he must do so out of his commitment to the oath he took under the Constitution. A judge cannot be swayed by popular opinion,” he said in the programme conducted virtually.Listing out some of the disadvantages of live streaming, Justice Ramana said that with increased public gaze, a judge might become a subject of multiple debates, which should never deter him from his duty to protect the right of one against the might of many.“Always remember, as a repository of peoples’ faith, a judge cannot afford to lose objectivity,” he added.He also flagged issues like the privacy of the citizens and security of litigants and specially key witnesses as areas of concern.“Another aspect that must be taken into consideration is the privacy of the parties involved and ensure the safety and security of the victims and witnesses.“Therefore, it is imperative to carefully calibrate the Rules governing such live-streaming by keeping in view the competing interests,” he said.He also had a word of caution for lawyers and advised them against going after publicity.“Similarly, with the increasing access, lawyers should not go after publicity, rather they must ensure to put in all possible efforts to protect the best interests of clients. They must always uphold and maintain the dignity of the profession,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-terms-live-streaming-as-double-edged-sword-284666
17-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police officials to meet farmers’ delegation on Sunday ahead of planned Parliament protest||Officials of the Delhi Police will meet a delegation of farmers on Sunday ahead of their planned protest in front of Parliament during its Monsoon Session to demand scrapping of the contentious farm laws and a legal guarantee on MSP.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions, has planned that around 200 farmers will hold protests outside Parliament every day during the Monsoon Session.The leaders have not commented on whether they have permission to hold demonstrations outside Parliament but have maintained that the protests will be “peaceful”.A tractor parade in Delhi on January 26, that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws, had dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.A senior police officer said the meeting will take place with a delegation of farmers on Sunday before their proposed protest. During the meeting, police officials may suggest alternative venues in Delhi for the protest, but nothing concrete has been planned yet.The SKM had earlier said at a press conference that two days before the Monsoon Session begins, a “chetavani patra” (warning letter) will be issued to all opposition MPs to protest the farm laws inside the House.Thousands of farmers from across the country have been agitating at the Delhi borders against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.

17-07-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati slams Amarinder over letter to PM Modi regarding farmers’ protest||BSP president Mayawati on Saturday targeted Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh over his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the ongoing farmers’ agitation.“The letter written by the Congress CM of Punjab to the PM, expressing various apprehensions about the farmers’ agitation is a conspiracy to defame the movement of the farmers, who are sacrificing their lives to get the new agricultural laws repealed, and pursue electoral politics under its guise. This is most unfair,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.Taking the Centre’s cooperation on challenges faced by the government of a border state is not unreasonable, but pursuing selfish electoral politics under its garb and defaming the farmers’ movement are something the public understands well, Mayawati added.“The Congress is not going to reap any benefit by doing this,” she said.Singh had on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately resume talks with agitating farmers, sending him a letter that cited “cross-border threat” by ISI-backed groups ahead of the state assembly polls.In the letter, the chief minister cited “heightened cross-border threat and increased drone and other terrorist activities by ISI-backed groups, including plans by Khalistani outfits to target certain farmer leaders”.He warned that powers across the border “may try to play upon the charged emotions of our proud, sincere, and hardworking farmers” of Punjab.

17-07-2021||New Delhi||All gaps in Indian borders will be plugged by this year end, says Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday asserted that unfenced gaps along India’s over 7,500-km-long land border will be sealed by the end of this year, thus covering areas that lead to infiltration and smuggling of arms and narcotics.He also asserted that India’s security policy was either “influenced or was overlapping” with the foreign policy and it was only after Narendra Modi became prime minister that the country got an independent security strategy.Shah was delivering the annual ‘Rustamji memorial lecture’ instituted by the Border Security Force (BSF) in memory of its first director general (DG) KF Rustamji.An officer of the 1938 batch of the British-era Imperial Police, Rustamji headed the BSF for nine years. He died in 2003.Shah also gave away gallantry medals to the serving personnel and to the family members of those who were killed in the line of duty from the country’s largest frontier force.“I assure that there will be no gap in our fencing from 2022,” he said.Shah said about three per cent of the unfenced area leaves a “big gap” and makes the border vulnerable for infiltration of terrorists and other border crimes like smuggling of arms, ammunition and narcotics among others.The Modi government has been plugging these gaps after resolving administrative obstacles and even by talking to neighbouring countries, he said.“I believe that (ensuring) border security is (ensuring) national security,” Shah said adding they are developing a “new model” of the border fence that cannot be cut or broken.He also spoke about the security policy of the Modi government.“I used to think if there is a security policy of this country or not? Till Narendra Modi became the prime minister we did not have any independent security policy,” Shah said.“It was either influenced by foreign policy or it was overlapping with the foreign policy,” he said.After Modi became prime minister, the country got an independent security policy.“Our idea is to have peaceful relations with all but if someone disturbs our borders, if someone challenges our sovereignty, the priority of our security policy is that such an attempt will be replied in the same language,” Shah said.He said this security policy was a “big achievement” as the country wanted such a good plan.“I believe without this (security policy) neither the country can progress nor democracy can prosper,” the home minister said.    “Modiji (PM) has done this big job. I do not want to give examples as it is well known,” he said adding the policy was made operational on the ground by his government.Shah said India was working to soon develop an indigenous counter-drone technology, which is being carried out by technical organisations like the DRDO and some other agencies.His comments came in the backdrop of the first-ever drone attack on the IAF station in Jammu last month where two unmanned aerial vehicles dropped bombs injuring two airmen and damaging a portion of a building inside.He added that the security establishment of the country is preparing a long-drawn project to thwart artificial intelligence and robotic technology enabled attacks from across the borders.Shah gave out figures to showcase how the Modi government worked to enhance and fortify border security.He said while only 3,600 km of border roads were made between 2008-14, the period between 2014-20 (Modi being the PM) it has seen a jump of 3.5 times with 4,764 km of these roads being constructed.The budget for this job was enhanced from Rs 23,000 crore to 44,000 crore, a total of 14,450 metres of bridges were made during 2014-20 as compared to 7,270 metres made during 2008-14, he said.While one border tunnel for transportation was made earlier, six tunnels have been made by the Modi government in the last one year while 19 such structures are in the pipeline, Shah said.Similarly, a total of 170 km of border roads were resurfaced during 2008-14 and it was enhanced to 380 km after the Modi government came to power.The cutting and formatting of roads along the China border has now been enhanced to 470 km per year as compared to the earlier 230 km per year.Shah said the government has sanctioned 32 more border roads measuring about 683 km for the Sino-India frontier.“The prime minister believes that till border infrastructure is upgraded and strengthened the security forces will not be able to do their job properly.”              “The PM has said that if border infrastructure is not proper the local population will continue to migrate from these areas and this will make our borders unsafe,” he said.The home minister stressed that forces like the BSF should take steps to ensure that border population is provided all basic amenities and that they do not migrate to other area because of these issues.The officers of these forces should execute “out of routine” thinking and plan so that we are two steps ahead of the adversary, he said.He asked them to maintain “regular touch” with their troops, resolve their problems and also take feedback from them.BSF DG Rakesh Asthana said during the event that the force has made 61 drone sightings and unearthed 4 tunnels along the western front in the last one year.The about 2.65 lakh personnel strong BSF guards over 6,300 km of Indian fronts with Pakistan and Bangladesh on the east.Ministers of state for home Nityanand Rai, Ajay Kumar Mishra, home secretary Ajay Bhalla, Intelligence Bureau director Arvind Kumar and RAW chief Samant Goel attended the event.

17-07-2021||New Delhi||BJP raising population issue for political motive, to target particular community: Shashi Tharoor||Amid a push for a population control policy by some Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Saturday alleged the BJP’s motive of raising the issue is political and aimed at targeting a “particular community”.The former Union minister said the population debate is “utterly misplaced” and half a century out-of-date as a large majority of Indian states have achieved replacement levels of fertility.In an interview with PTI, Tharoor said the bigger challenge for India in the next 20 years will be to prepare for an ageing population, not a growing population.He alleged the ruling party is raising this issue out of “thinly-concealed motivation” to target a “particular community”.“It is no accident that the three states where the government is talking about reducing population are UP (Uttar Pradesh), Assam and Lakshadweep, where everyone knows who their intended audience is,” the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.“The Hindutva elements in our polity have not really studied the demographic issues. Their motive is purely political and communal,” he said when asked about the push for population control in UP and Assam.Tharoor’s remarks come days after Uttar Pradesh’s draft population control Bill was made public and the Assam government proposed formulation of a policy in this regard. Both states are ruled by the BJP.The UP draft Bill has provisions to debar people who have more than two children from the benefits of government schemes and proposes perks to those who follow the two-child policy.Also, some BJP MPs are set to introduce private members’ Bills on population control and uniform civil code in the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament, according to information from the secretariats of both Houses.The Monsoon Session begins on July 19 and would conclude on August 13.Asked about the upcoming Parliament session and the key issues the Congress and the Opposition would raise, Tharoor said the government has been “so colossally inept’ that there are multiple issues “we need to raise in the public interest”.“The ineptitude of the government in its disastrous mismanagement of Covid, especially the blunder-laden vaccine policy; the continued failure to resolve the farmers’ agitation; the cratering economy, with GDP growth at its lowest in three decades,” he said listing the issues the Opposition needs to focus in Parliament.He also referred to the “price rise caused by extortionate fuel taxes; the worst unemployment ever recorded”, the French investigation into corruption in the Rafale deal” the situation on the Sino-Indian border and the crisis in Afghanistan.“And who knows what else may arise by Monday morning, given the government’s many unsavoury sins of omission and commission?” Tharoor said.On disruptions rather than debate becoming the norm in Parliament, the 65-year-old Congress leader said it was well known that he has been opposed to disruptions in principle and prefers to debate the issues.“But if you look at those disruptions in recent years that have been called by the Opposition, they have always been caused by the ruling party’s refusal to discuss a specific issue of burning national importance, which leaves the Opposition no choice but to draw attention to the issues the government wishes to avoid through disruption,” he said.If debates were allowed, disruptions would be unnecessary, he asserted.Tharoor urged the government to have the courage to debate any issue the Opposition wishes to raise.“That’s what Parliament is for. The government prefers to treat it as a notice-board where they can just announce their laws and policies,” he said.“If the ruling party treats Parliament with respect, which means agreeing to discuss the issues the Opposition raises and not just using their brute majority to push through the government’s agenda, I am sure the Opposition will reciprocate in kind,” he argued.Asked whether the Afghanistan situation would also be a key issue to be raised in Parliament, Tharoor said, “Yes, that’s why I mentioned it along with China as the two external affairs issues that require discussion.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-raising-population-issue-for-political-motive-to-target-particular-community-shashi-tharoor-284651

17-07-2021||New Delhi||PIL in SC seeks ‘comprehensive’, ‘stringent’ law to replace colonial era IPC||A PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre to set a judicial panel or a body of experts to draft a “comprehensive” and “stringent” penal code for ensuring rule of law and equality and after examining existing statutes, including Indian Penal Code of 1860, relating to crime and corruption.The plea, filed by lawyer and BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay, alternatively urged the top court that it being “custodian of the Constitution and protector of fundamental rights” may direct the Law Commission India to examine “domestic and internal laws relating to corruption and crime and draft a stringent comprehensive Indian Penal Code within six months”.“Direct the Centre to constitute a judicial commission or an expert committee to examine all domestic-internal laws relating to corruption-crime and draft a comprehensive stringent ‘one nation one penal code’ in order to secure rule of law, equality before law and equal protection of laws,” the PIL, filed through advocate Ashwani Dubey, said.It further sought a direction to the Centre to ascertain the feasibility of implementing a stringent and comprehensive Indian Penal Code (One Nation One Penal Code) instead of existing outdated laws relating to corruption and crime.The petition, which may come up for hearing next week, said that the injury to the public due to the 161 years old colonial IPC was extremely large.It said, “rule of law and right to life, liberty and dignity can’t be secured without implementing a stringent and comprehensive ‘One Nation One Penal Code’ having specific chapters on bribery, money laundering, black money, profiteering, adulteration, hoarding, black marketing, drug smuggling, gold smuggling and human trafficking.”“If this IPC had been even a little effective, then many Britishers would have been punished, not the freedom fighters. In fact, the main reason behind creating the IPC 1860 and Police Act 1861 was to prevent another revolt like that of 1857,” it said.It added that laws related to witch-hunting, honour killing, mob lynching, Goonda Act, etc. are not included in the IPC though these are pan-India offences and the sentence is different for the same offence in various states.“Therefore, to standardise the punishment and make them uniform, a new IPC is essential. India needs a comprehensive Penal Code that provides equal protection to all the citizens against all the offences and secures right to life, liberty, dignity and rule of law,” it said.

17-07-2021||Guwahati||Displaced Mising people to get new home in Assam after 70 years||Around 12,000 Mising community people, displaced due to change in course of the Brahmaputra river 70 years ago, are likely to find a new home outside a national park in Assam's Tinsukia district where they are now living, an official statement said.The state government will soon issue a notification for rehabilitation of the missing people of Laika and Dodhia forest villages of Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, it said.The matter was taken up at a high-level meeting where issues related to Forest Rights Act, 2006 were discussed."During the meeting, the issue regarding rehabilitation of the people residing at Laika and Dodhia in Dibru-Saikhowa National Park in Tinsukia district was discussed at a length. The forest department will soon issue a notification in this regard (rehabilitation)," the statement said on Friday.Welfare of Plain Tribes and Backward Classes Minister Ranuj Pegu, Environment and Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya and MLA Bhuban Pegu along with officers of various departments were present at the meeting.The government emphasised on preparing a roadmap for implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, on a mission mode with the WPT and BC being the nodal department and Environment and Forest as associate one.The plight of a group of Mising people, the second-largest ethnic community of Assam, dates back to 1950 when a change in course of the Brahmaputra river took place after an earthquake, rendering 75 families of Murkongselek along Arunachal Pradesh border homeless.The story repeated in 1957 with 90 households in Aukland area of Rahmaria revenue circle in Dibrugarh district becoming homeless due to river erosion, and they were forced to move out and took shelter in the then Dibru Reserve Forest.These displaced agrarian people prefer to live by the riverside. They moved to the southern bank of Brahmaputra and came to the forest area surrounded by six rivers Lohit, Dibang and Disang on the north, and Anantanala, Dangori and Dibru on the south.The problem of these people started in 1999 when the forest was declared as Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, and it made any human habitation inside the protected area illegal.Since then, five governments of different political parties such as the AGP, the Congress and the BJP have ruled the state but no concrete step was initiated to rehabilitate the ethnic community people.The Laika-Dadhia Rehabilitation Demand Committee's chief convenor Minturaaj Morang had earlier told PTI that forced by natural calamities, the villagers tried to move out and settle in other places several times, but had to return on the government promise of proper rehabilitation.An attempt was made in 2020 when the Tinsukia district administration identified 320 hectares of land at Ouguri in Lakhipathar area for settlement of the Mising people, but it was later withdrawn after the local Moran community opposed the rehabilitation, Morang said.AGP MLA Ponakan Baruah wrote to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on May 24, highlighting the plight of these people and pointed out that at least four attempts have been made to relocate the villagers, but none has been successful.Baruah said the previous BJP government had earmarked Rs 10 crore for the rehabilitation of the forest villagers, but they could not be relocated due to the non-availability of land.Last year, former Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, on the basis of a committee report, had directed to rehabilitate Dodhia villagers in Lakhimpur and Laika residents in Tinsukia districts. The rehabilitation proposal was sent to the government on January 8 for immediate in-principal approval.With no rehabilitation programme in sight, the villagers have resorted to protest for years now. More than 2,000 people have been camping at Tinsukia city and holding demonstrations on rotation since December 21 last year to push for their demand. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/displaced-mising-people-to-get-new-home-in-assam-after-70-years-284629

He had come to India on a student visa in 2007 and stayed back. He was earlier arrested in October 2011 for forging fake certificates,” Surat Police Commissioner Ajay Tomar said.The accused had allegedly promised the complainant Rs 2 crore as advance for his kidney and asked him to deposit some money over several transactions to start the process, the police said.According to the cyber cell, the accused was also involved in creating fake websites for forex trading, bitcoin investment, etc. to commit investment fraud and created fake websites that offered jobs abroad.The accused created a fake email ID in the name of a Reserve Bank of India official and used on a mobile number to lure his victims into transferring money to various bank accounts, it was stated.The police have frozen over Rs 7.50 lakh in eight bank accounts that were used in the transfer of money from the victim, and found that the accounts were used for transactions of over Rs 1.13 crore, a cyber crime official said.The accused has been arrested under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery) among other sections of the IPC and Information Technology Act, it was stated.“Similar cases have been registered in Bengaluru, and we are trying to find out about other such complaints.

17-07-2021||New Delhi||Joint pain, backache common among many post-Covid cases: Delhi Hospital||A leading private hospital in Delhi on Saturday claimed that joint pain and backache were the most common problems reported among post-Covid patients at its orthopaedic department.Even after recovering from the coronavirus infection, a large number of people are struggling with post-Covid complications, ranging from weakness to hair fall and skin complications.According to Dr Vishal Nigam, orthopedic and spine surgeon at the Moolchand Hospital, "Back pain and joint pain after Covid have been the most common presentation in orthopaedic clinics. Almost 15 per cent of patients present with joint pains or arthralgia, and 45 per cent of patients present with muscle pains or myalgia".Joint pain can be temporary or can last longer, he said.One of the wrong steps that patients take is to try to get back to normal routine quickly despite weakness. This leads to injury rather than recovery. Exercises and routines should be progressed gradually, respecting the fact that the body is weak and needs time to regenerate, doctors said."Post-covid fatigue leads to tiredness and prevents resumption of normal activities," Nigam said.Aging causes joint and spinal disorders, which are medically called as degeneration of joints and discs. Till one is active and fit, this degeneration may not cause symptoms. But if muscle weakness due to a disease causes loss of fitness, then this degeneration causes joint pains. These temporary joint pains improve as fitness and activity returns to normal gradually, he added."More serious and longer-lasting joint pains could be reactive arthritis. Similar to inflammatory response that damages lungs, cytokines also damage joint capsule. It is commonly seen in other viral diseases like chikungunya and is also occasionally seen in coronavirus infection," the doctor said.Pains in this condition are associated with joint swelling, and are more severe and long-lasting. Such pains increase after a period of inactivity, like getting up from bed in the morning, he added.The number of cumulative cases of COVID-19 on Friday stood at 14,35,419 in Delhi. Over 14 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/joint-pain-backache-common-among-many-post-covid-cases-delhi-hospital-284618

17-07-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka meets two SP women workers ‘attacked’ during panchayat polls||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday met two women workers of the Samajwadi Party with whom BJP activists had allegedly misbehaved during the recent block panchayat chief elections, and demanded repolling at places where violence took place.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had earlier alleged that BJP workers misbehaved with his party candidate Ritu Singh and her proposer Anita Yadav in Lakhimpur Kheri, pulling their “sarees”.In a terse message to the ruling party, Priyanka in a Hindi tweet said, “The goons of the BJP involved in ‘cheerharan’ of the democracy should hear that women will become pradhans, block pramukhs, MLAs, MPs and prime minister, and defeat the government, which gives patronage to those committing atrocities against women.”  “For justice of all victims of the panchayat poll violence—all my sisters and citizens—I will write a letter to the State Election Commission,” she further said. After meeting the SP workers, Gandhi told reporters at Semra village in Lakhimpur Kheri’s Pathgava block that it was their constitutional right to file nomination papers and contest elections “but this right of theirs was snatched”.“They were beaten up while they had gone to file nominations and disrobed. You can imagine what was going on in their mind. Along with Anita, his 19-year-old son was also there,” Priyanka said, alleging that nobody tried to stop it.“A CO who tried to intervene, was suspended, and no action was taken on those who were standing there. The administration remained silent,” she alleged.Priyanka told reporters that she came to meet them as they are women and her “sisters”.“I want to tell (them) that each and every woman of India stands with them. I told them not to feel afraid, and have confidence,” she said.“One day, you will file the nomination papers and emerge victorious in the polls. You must fight and all of us will fight for you,” Gandhi said.The Congress general secretary said, “This is a fight for democracy. Women were given reservation in our democracy so that their rights can be upheld. And the situation has become such wherein a woman went to file her nomination papers and she was beaten up.”      “This is no democracy. I demand that this election be cancelled and also at all those places where these types of incidents have occurred and re-polling be held,” she said.Putting the ball in the state government’s court to fix things, she said all those responsible for such an act should be held accountable.“Whenever, even a minor incident of this nature happens, the polls are cancelled, and re-polls are held. Can anyone win the elections by bringing 10 goons and indulging in violence. Is this our democracy today? We need to ask this. You (media) should raise questions,” she said, stressing that a video of the incident shows everything.“Do you want that the democracy be shattered in this way in the state and in the country? And the prime minister is praising and has congratulated for the (panchayat) polls. In every district, some incident has taken place --- be it poll violence, bomb explosion or atrocities against women,” she said.UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu was also present during Priyanka’s meeting with Ritu and Anita.The Congress leader is on a two-day visit to Lucknow ahead of the crucial Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls next year.

Under the new policy, the ministry will procure 75 per cent of the vaccines being produced by the drug manufacturers in the country.While the Centre has asked both the vaccine manufacturing firms to scale up their production, the manufacturers had indicated that getting Rs 150 for each dose while making investments to ramp up the production was not viable for them, sources said.The Union government had earlier allowed states and private hospitals to procure 50 per cent of the vaccines following demands for decentralisation of the process.However, after several states complained of problems including of funding, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the revision of the vaccine guidelines on June 8.Domestic vaccine manufacturers are given the option to provide 25 per cent of their monthly production of vaccines to private hospitals.According to the revised guidelines which came into effect from June 21, vaccine doses provided free of cost by the Centre will be allocated to states/UTs based on criteria such as population, disease burden and the progress of vaccination, and all above the age of 18 will be eligible for the free jabs.Any wastage of vaccine will affect the allocation negatively.The states and UTs would aggregate the demand of private hospitals keeping in view equitable distribution between large and small private hospitals and regional balance."Based on this aggregated demand, the Centre will facilitate the supply of these vaccines to the private hospitals and their payment through the National Health Authority's electronic platform. This would enable the smaller and remoter private hospitals to obtain a timely supply of vaccines, and further equitable access and regional balance," the ministry had said.The price of vaccine doses for private hospitals would be declared by each vaccine manufacturer, and any subsequent changes would be notified in advance, it said.More than 41.69 crore vaccine doses had been provided to states and UTs so far, through all sources, the health ministry said on Saturday.

In 2019, 1.4 million children in India did not receive the first dose of the DTP-1 vaccine and this number rose to 3 million in 2020, the UN said.“India is experiencing a particularly large drop, with DTP-3 coverage falling from 91 per cent to 85 per cent,” the agencies said.They added that disruptions in immunisation services were widespread in 2020, with the WHO Southeast Asian and Eastern Mediterranean Regions most affected.

17-07-2021||United Nations/Geneva||Stan Swamy's death will 'remain a stain' on India's human rights record: UN expert||A UN human rights expert has said that she is devastated to hear about the demise of Jesuit priest Stan Swamy in custody, saying there is “no reason” for a human rights defender to be denied his rights and that his death will forever “remain a stain” on India's human rights record.Swamy, 84, who was arrested last year under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, died at a Mumbai hospital on July 5.In a statement issued on Thursday, UN Special Rapporteur Mary Lawlor said Father Swamy's case should remind all states that human rights defenders and all those detained without sufficient legal basis should be released.Lawlor said the death in custody of Catholic priest Swamy, “a renowned human rights and social justice advocate for over four decades, will forever remain a stain on India's human rights record”.   "There is no excuse, ever, for a human rights defender to be smeared as a terrorist, and no reason they should ever die the way Father Swamy died, accused and detained, and denied his rights,” she said.India has rejected international criticism over the handling of Swamy's case.The Ministry of External Affairs has said the authorities concerned act against violations of law and do not restrain the legitimate exercise of rights.It said India remains committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all its citizens and that the country's democratic polity is complemented by an independent judiciary and a range of national and state-level human rights commissions."Swamy was arrested and detained by the National Investigation Agency following due process under the law. Because of the specific nature of charges against him, his bail applications were rejected by the courts. Authorities in India act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights. All such actions are strictly in accordance with the law,” the MEA said in a statement in New Delhi soon after Swamy's death.It said Swamy was receiving all possible medical attention at a private hospital where he was admitted since May 28. His health and medical treatment were being closely monitored by the courts. He passed away on July 5 following medical complications.Lawlor said Swamy was jailed last October “on fabricated terrorism charges” and had been subjected to harassment and repeated interrogations.“I was devastated to hear that Father Stan, a Jesuit priest who had dedicated much of his life to defending the rights of indigenous people and the Adivasi minority, died in custody on July 5, despite many requests for his release as his health deteriorated in prison,” she said.She added that in early November 2020, UN experts joined her in raising his case with the Indian authorities, reminding them of their international human rights obligations. “I now ask again why he wasn't released, and why he had to die in custody.” she said.Lawlor added that Swamy had been working for decades to protect the rights of Adivasi minority indigenous people and the Dalit minority, in particular violations involving forced displacement and illegal land acquisitions.“We know that defenders working on environmental, land or indigenous people's rights are among the most vulnerable to being targeted,” said Lawlor.Lawlor's call has been endorsed by Special Rapporteur on minority issues Fernand de Varennes, Special Rapporteur on the right to physical and mental health Tlaleng Mofokeng.

He was embedded with Afghan special forces at the time of his death.“We are deeply saddened to hear that Reuters photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering fighting in Afghanistan,” Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson at the US Department of State, told reporters.“Siddiqui was celebrated for his work often in the world's most urgent and challenging news stories and for creating striking images that conveyed a wealth of emotion and the human face behind the headlines. His brilliant reporting on the Rohingya refugee crisis earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 2018,” she said.“Siddiqui's death is a tremendous loss, not only for Reuters and for his media colleagues but also for the rest of the world. Far too many journalists have been killed in Afghanistan. We continue to call for an end to the violence. A just and durable peace settlement is the only way forward in Afghanistan,” Porter said.Senator Jim Risch, Ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed his condolences over the killing of the Indian journalist.“The tragic death” of Reuters journalist Danish Siddiqui in Afghanistan while covering the Taliban “reminds us of the risk journalists take to share the news. No reporter should be killed while doing their job,” he said.“The death today of Reuters photojournalist Danish Siddiqui is a tragic notice that even as the US and its partners withdraw forces, journalists will continue to work in Afghanistan, documenting whatever comes next at great risk to their lives,” said Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia program coordinator, in Washington, DC.“Combatants need to take responsibility for safeguarding journalists, as dozens of journalists have been killed in this conflict, with little or no accountability,” he said.

Regarding the PM’s very public praise for Adityanath, they argued that the “PM is bound to praise his CM on a public platform”.Meanwhile, Nadda, in his address, said four years ago, the state was “afflicted by appeasement politics”, where a particular caste used to get benefits and the other faced harassment. Once a “BIMARU”, UP is now known for ease of doing business, he said, adding that a curfew was a common thing in the past but there had not been a single riot under the BJP government. “There was nothing in the name of development.

This clearly suggests that the vaccination does provide reduction in hospital admission and mortality,” the ICMR’s researchers said in a study.It involved genome sequencing study of 511 breakthrough (post vaccination) infections from 17 states/UTs and was led by ICMR’s National Institute of Virology.The study reinstates the dominance of the Delta variant and shows that 86 per cent (443) of the vaccinated subjects were found infected by the Delta variant.Across South, West, East and North-West regions of India, the predominant breakthrough infections were mainly from Delta and then Kappa variant. The North and central regions of India reported such infections mainly due to Alpha, Delta and Kappa variants. In the study, 67 cases (9.8 per cent) required hospitalisation and death was observed in only three cases (0.4 per cent).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delta-behind-86-post-jab-covid-infections-284329

Following his meeting with the PM, the 78-year-old was quoted as saying: “I don’t know anything about leadership change. During my discussion with PM Modi, I requested him to permit to carry out development works in the state”.Notably, his arrival in Delhi along with his son BY Vijayendra today triggered a speculation about his exit like that of Tirath Singh Rawat, former Uttarakhand CM. However, pointing towards a photograph of the meeting (where both leaders can be seen smiling), BJP leaders played down the chances of any such move.Meanwhile, Yediyurappa said he was returning to Bengaluru tomorrow. While in Delhi, he is expected to meet senior BJP leaders, including Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah.BJP’s state in-charge Arun Singh, during his last visit to the state, had told the warring MLAs to refrain from commenting on the party’s affairs in the open, warning action against any violation of party discipline. Sources say much of the anger against the CM stems from alleged interference in the administration by his son BY Vijayendra.They add that the BJP leadership understands that continued restiveness may damage its prospects in the 2023 poll but to remove Yediyurappa is not so easy even though he is well past the unofficial 75-year age policy for ministers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/speculation-as-bs-yediyurappa-son-meet-pm-to-call-on-amit-shah-rajnath-singh-too-284343

In an indirect reference to the Pakistan army’s obdurate stance on trade and connectivity with India, Jaishankar said the real issue was of mindsets, not of disputes. Imran in his speech cited the Kashmir issue as a major hindrance to connectivity projects.Jaishankar takes a dig at Pak over tradeWith the Pakistan PM on stage, Afghan President Ghani criticised Pakistan indirectly for not stopping terrorists from crossing over into Afghanistan and for failing to convince the Taliban to move for meaningful talks.Wants Chabahar part of int’l corridorImran, in turn, pointed out that the Taliban were not ready for a deal when there were 1.5 lakh NATO troops in Afghanistan. “Why would they compromise now? Why would they listen to us when they are feeling victorious?’’ he posed while stating that over 70,000 Pakistanis have also been victims of terrorism.Although the Tashkent meet was primarily meant for foreign ministers, top leaders of both Pakistan and Afghanistan had landed there since the gathering was expected to carry on the discussions they had held over the previous two days in Dushanbe.The immediate casualty of the clash between Imran and Ghani was the proposed weekend peace conference in Pakistan that was to be attended by elements close to the Kabul regime. The Taliban had recused itself as it had held discussions several times with the Pakistanis.Better sense prevailed after the ministers had delivered their speeches. Imran and Ghani held a meeting at which Inter-Services Intelligence Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed was also present.Speaking at the meeting, Jaishankar wanted the Chabahar Port to be included in the North-South Corridor, which was the main topic of discussions. He also said for reliable connectivity within and through Afghanistan, world must have confidence in its governance.Describing connectivity efforts as an act of trust, he felt they must conform to international law, respect nations’ sovereignty and be based on economic viability.The inclusion of Chabahar Port in the INSTC (International North-South Transport Corridor) framework would ensure a secure and unhindered access to sea for Central Asian countries, he said while welcoming the India-Iran-Afghanistan-Uzbekistan Working Group on the joint use of Chabahar port.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imran-khan-afghan-president-ghani-spar-at-tashkent-meeting-284228

The health of the citizenry of India and their right to ‘life’ are paramount. All other sentiments, albeit religious, are subservient to this most basic fundamental right.”The SC direction came after the state government told the Bench it had decided to hold a “symbolic” Kanwar Yatra with appropriate Covid restrictions.Appearing for the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said state governments must not permit the yatra in view of the pandemic and arrangements be made for “Ganga jal” to be made available through tankers at specified places.The Bench told Mehta, “One thing is clear, we cannot allow the UP Government to hold Kanwar Yatra in view of Covid.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/life-paramount-rethink-kanwar-yatra-decision-supreme-court-to-up-284259

Inaugurating the renovated state-of-the-art Gandhinagar Railway Station virtually from Delhi, the PM said he would like to see train passengers enjoy facilities similar to those at airports. TNSThe WHO has said cases are again rising globally and daily infections are nearing 5.63 lakh as of today, climbing up towards the 9 lakh a day mark witnessed at the height of the second wave on April 29 this year.The PM described as “grave worry” the rising infections in Kerala and Maharashtra and said, “Initially experts believed that states where the second wave originated will see the normalisation first. However, increasing numbers in Kerala and Maharashtra are a cause of grave worry.”These six states have 80 per cent of all Covid cases reported in July and 84 per cent of all deaths.Warning the CMs that similar trends were seen in January-February before the second wave, the PM said “proactive measures are needed to prevent the possibility of the third wave”.Coining the strategy of 4 Ts —Test, Track, Treat and Teeka (vaccination), the PM said states must enforce micro-containment zones, use the emergency response package of over Rs 23,000 crore announced recently to ramp up medical infrastructure and ensure arrangements to protect the paediatric population.Out of 332 pressure swing absorption plants allocated to the states present in the meeting, 53 have been commissioned so far.“Completion of these plants should be expedited,” the PM said, adding that the rise in the number of cases in Europe, America, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and other countries must “alert India”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/must-prevent-3rd-wave-pm-to-6-states-with-high-covid-cases-284261
17-07-2021||Nonika Singh||Surekha Sikri: ‘Dadi’ whose grand smile never failed to connect||Veteran actress Surekha Sikri won hearts and a National Award with her feisty performance of a quirky robust ‘dadi’ (grandmother) in successful and critically acclaimed ‘Badhaai Ho’.Three-time National Award winner, she had a winning smile that never failed to connect. It’s hard to imagine we have seen the last of sprightly acts of the actor, who was last seen as a bedridden patient in director Zoya Akhtar’s short film in the Netflix anthology ‘Ghost Stories’.An NSD alumna who made her film debut with ‘Kissa Kursi Ka’ (1978), her filmography with films like ‘Sardari Begum’, ‘Zubeidaa’, ‘Hari Bhari’, ‘Sarfarosh’ and Rituparna Ghosh’s ‘Raincoat’ runs long. So does her innings on television, which includes Govind Nihalini’s critical success ‘Tamas’.If ‘Tamas’ fetched her first National Award, Shyam Benegal’s ‘Mammo’ (1994) led her to the same illustrious honour. Yet she was always self-depreciating. While critics gushed over her performances, she was rather circumspect about her talent and assessed herself critically.A brain stroke in 2018 and another in 2020 led to a prolonged illness and she had to drop out of films like ‘Sheer Qorma’, a fact she truly regretted. As she passed away into eternity, it’s not just her family, including her son Rahul Sikri, who mourned her demise. Her reel family of films and television serials paid rich tributes to this much-loved ‘dadi sa’ of ‘Balika Vadhu’.Gajraj Rao, who played her son in ‘Badhaai Ho’, remembers her as “youngest at heart on the sets”. Ailing for some time, her last wish, “I want to walk again” may not have been granted but in the annals of acting, she would always stand tall.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/surekha-sikri-dadi-whose-grand-smile-never-failed-to-connect-284262

Indian diplomats were in contact with Indian community leaders and had offered support and assistance to distressed families.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had on Thursday spoken with this South African counterpart Naledi Pandor, who assured him that the early restoration of normalcy and peace was her government’s overriding priority.The High Commissioner of South Africa in New Delhi has also updated the MEA on the situation in South Africa.Meanwhile, there were signs that the government was wresting back the situation with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa hitting ground zero in Ethekwini municipality in Durban, one of the worst-hit areas.Ramaphosa said his government was doing all it could to deal with the unrest, which has killed more than 100 people in the past week, and declared that he would not allow “anarchy and mayhem” to prevail.Meanwhile, a South African cabinet minister said on Friday that protests and looting in the country were now over and that the situation had “fully stabilised”.Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, acting minister for the office of President Cyril Ramaphosa, said the country’s two key highways, including the N3 that links Gauteng to Kwa-Zulu Natal, had been reopened and they were now fully operational.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/external-affairs-ministry-keeps-eye-on-south-african-situation-284264

17-07-2021||New Delhi||Farmers' protest: AAP govt rejects Delhi Police's panel of lawyers; ball now in L-G's court||The AAP government on Friday rejected the Delhi Police's proposal to set up a panel of public prosecutors to argue cases related to violence during a tractor rally by farmers on January 26, setting the stage for a fresh round of confrontation with the Centre and the L-G office.Sources, however, said Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal is likely to invoke special powers granted to him in the Constitution and approve a panel of lawyers chosen by the Delhi Police.At an online press conference, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the appointment of lawyers comes entirely under the purview of the Delhi government and the L-G can only use his veto power in the rarest of rare cases.He also alleged that the lieutenant governor has been using veto power even in routine matters, terming it as a "murder of democracy" and violation of the Supreme Court's orders.The Delhi Cabinet on Friday observed that letting police's lawyers appear in the case of farmers who have been protesting the three farm laws would seriously hamper legal parity and would not be fair to the accused peasants who bear a right to go through an unbiased trial, the government said in a statement.It also said the cabinet affirmed that prosecutors are meant to be independent and cannot be according to the choice of the police.The cabinet, while deliberating upon the proposal of the Delhi Police to appoint lawyers of their preference, was of the view that as held by various judgments of the Supreme Court, the role of the public prosecutor is not to act as a spokesperson of the police force but to discharge an independent statutory role, presenting to the court the correct picture, the government said.After his cabinet's decision, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said it is the duty of every citizen of India to support farmers and that the Delhi government has not done any favour to them."We have only done our duty towards the farmers of the nation. A farmer is not a criminal or a terrorist, but our 'annadata'," he tweeted.Sisodia also claimed that it is very unfortunate that the BJP-led Central government has been interfering in the functioning of the AAP dispensation through the L-G."The Supreme Court has defined the use of this veto power by the L-G on transferred subjects. Doorstep delivery of ration and court matters related to farmers' protests are not the rarest of rare cases."This power cannot be used left, right and centre every day. This is a murder of democracy and violation of the Supreme Court's orders," the deputy chief minister said during the press conference.The cabinet also observed that the demand of the Delhi Police to appoint lawyers of their choice in the case was baseless and unwarranted and that it could not allow the same to happen."The cabinet was satisfied with the performance of the government's present public prosecutors and noted that there were no complaints made against their functioning," it also said.In July last year, Lt Governor Baijal had overturned the AAP government's decision to reject the Delhi Police's panel of lawyers to argue the 2020 northeast Delhi riot cases in the high court and the Supreme Court.According to a Delhi government official, the cabinet's decision to reject the city police's proposal to argue the farmers' protest cases will be conveyed to the L-G."It was decided that the Delhi government's lawyers will be public prosecutors in court matters related to the farmers' agitation," the official said.However, sources said the L-G is likely to invoke his special power under the Constitution and refer the dispute to the President of India.On Thursday, the Delhi government had alleged that it was being pressured by the BJP-ruled Centre to replace its prosecutors appearing in cases related to the anti-farm laws stir, with those of the Delhi Police.The issue pertained to a request made by the Delhi Police for the appointment of special public prosecutors for cases related to violence, disrespect of the national flag and blatant disregard of the rule of law on Republic Day during the tractor rally taken out by the protesting farmers in the national capital."It has nothing to do with the farmers' protest as it is being deliberately made out with ulterior motives," a source claimed.On Thursday, the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), in a statement, had said Baijal "rejected" the panel of Delhi government lawyers appearing in cases against the farmers protesting against the Centre's three new farm laws at the city's borders."The Delhi Police investigating the cases, however, wants the appointment of its own panel of lawyers. Law Minister Satyendar Jain had rejected the Delhi Police proposal but now, the LG has put pressure on the Delhi government to call its cabinet meeting for a decision on the Delhi Police panel," the statement said.It also claimed that the LG, at a virtual meeting with Jain, had "admitted" that the public prosecutors of the Delhi government were doing a "good" job and fighting the cases efficiently.The Delhi Police had registered over 40 cases in connection with the Republic Day violence and vandalism in the national capital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-aap-govt-rejects-delhi-polices-panel-of-lawyers-ball-now-in-l-gs-court-284172
17-07-2021||New Delhi||Disastrous to administer Covid-19 vaccines without trials, especially on kids: HC||The Delhi High Court Friday said it would be a “disaster” if Covid-19 vaccines are administered, especially to children, without clinical trials and asked the Centre that it should take steps to quickly vaccinate kids below 18 once the trials are over as the whole nation is waiting for it.The court was informed by the Centre that clinical trials for the vaccines for children under 18 years of age are going on and on the verge of completion and that a policy will be formed by the government and children will be vaccinated when experts give permission.“Let the trials be done, otherwise it would be a disaster if vaccines are administered without trials that too in case of children,” a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh observed.“Once trials are over, you quickly apply to children. The whole country is waiting,” it added and listed the matter for further hearing on September 6.The high court was hearing a PIL filed on behalf of a minor which sought directions for the immediate vaccination of those in the 12-17 age group on the ground that there were fears a likely third wave of Covid-19 could affect them more.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, said pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila which is developing DNA vaccines has concluded its clinical trial for between the age group of 12 to 18 years of age and subject to the statutory permission, the same may be available in near future for children of the age group of 12 to 18 years of age.The Centre, in the affidavit filed through standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, said vaccination is the top most priority of the government and all efforts are being made to achieve an objective of 100 per cent vaccination in the shortest time possible keeping the available resources in mind and availability of vaccine doses into consideration.It said from May 1, onwards under the new liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid vaccination strategy, all citizens above the age of 18 years including parents of children who are residing in Delhi are already eligible for the vaccination.The Centre said on May 12, Drug Controller General of India has permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct clinical trials on the healthy volunteers between 2 to 18 years of age for its vaccine—Covaxin.Senior advocate Kailash Vasudev, representing the petitioner, said vaccines are being administered to children of the age group of 8 to 18 years in various countries and the court may ask the authorities to conclude the process in a time bound manner.To this, the bench said the government was saying that trials are going on and there cannot be a time-bound schedule for research.“They are only asking for breathing time. Everybody is working,” the bench said, adding that looking into the stand taken by the Centre that the trials are going on and are at the verge of completion, list the petition on September 6.Meanwhile, the court disposed of another petition seeking to vaccinate class 10th and 12th students since they had to appear for board exams.The court noted that trials for vaccines for children are already going on and that the CBSE has cancelled the exams and now there are no offline mode of examination for students of class 10th and 12th this year.“Looking into these two facts… we see no reason to entertain this petition at this stage. Liberty is given to the petitioner to move an appropriate authority for the grievances in future,” the bench said.When the petitioner’s counsel said the children will need to appear for competitive exams, the bench said they can approach the court at that time.The first PIL was filed seeking directions for immediate vaccination of 12-17 year-old children on the ground that there was an apprehension that a likely third wave of Covid-19 could affect them more.The petition has also sought priority in vaccination to parents of children up to 17 years of age as several kids were orphaned after their parents succumbed to Covid-19 during the second wave.There are two petitioners in the matter—the first is a minor represented through her mother and the second is a mother of a minor child.The petition has claimed that according to the data of number of persons infected between April 2021 to May 2021, the number of reported cases where children were infected “has risen tremendously” than last year.It has alleged that the vaccine policy of India has failed to factor in children or parents of children for vaccination and the Centre and Delhi government have also failed to prepare a national plan for taking of the minors during the present pandemic.“That globally, countries have fully recognised the importance of vaccinating children, alongside adults, to curb, mitigate the ill effects of the present pandemic and have accordingly and effectively taken measures.“Vaccines for children are being produced and administered in countries such as Canada, United States of America (USA), for children between the ages of 12-17 years,” it has said.

U.S. Rep. Marie Newman (D-IL) noted that acts of violence are not only targeting religious minorities, but social and political activists, lawyers, journalists, and students.The US Department of State report, released by Secretary Antony Blinken in 2020, had also noted “reports of religiously motivated killings, assaults, riots, discrimination, vandalism, and actions restricting the right of individuals to practice and speak about their religious beliefs”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-ngos-ask-biden-to-sanction-indian-officials-284150

17-07-2021||New Delhi||SC says ‘all sentiments’ subservient to right to life, asks UP to reconsider Kanwar Yatra decision||All sentiments, including religious, are subservient to the Right to Life, the Supreme Court said on Friday and asked the Uttar Pradesh government to inform by July 19 whether it would reconsider its decision to hold a “symbolic” Kanwar Yatra.The Uttarakhand government earlier this week cancelled the annual ritual that sees thousands of Shiva devotees called ‘kanwariyas' travel mostly on foot to collect water from the Ganges and bring it back to their villages. Uttar Pradesh is going ahead with a pared-down “symbolic” version.A bench of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai said the Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution is paramount and asked the Uttar Pradesh government whether it was willing to reconsider its decision to hold a yatra at all.“We are of the prima facie view that this is a matter which concerns every one of us and this is at the heart of Article 21 of the Constitution. The health of citizenry of India and Right to Life is paramount and all other sentiments, including religious, are subservient to this fundamental right,” the bench said.The apex court's direction came after the Uttar Pradesh government told the bench that it had decided after relevant discussions to hold a “symbolic” Kanwar Yatra with appropriate Covid restrictions.Appearing for the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said state governments must not permit the yatra in view of the pandemic and arrangements should be made for water from the Ganges to be available through tankers at specified places. Considering age-old customs and religious sentiments, state governments must develop a system so devotees can collect holy ‘Gangajal' and offer it at the nearest Shiva temple, he said.The bench told Mehta, “One thing is clear, we cannot allow the Uttar Pradesh government to hold Kanwar Yatra in view of Covid.”“Total ban on the yatra will be inappropriate,” senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, told the court.He said they had filed an affidavit stating a symbolic yatra would be held with the minimum presence of devotees and also keeping in mind religious sentiments.Appropriate restrictions would be taken, he said – ‘Gangajal' will be supplied through tankers, Covid tests done and social-distancing norms followed among other measures.The bench then told Vaidyanathan that he might take instructions and inform the court by July 19 (Monday) on whether to hold the yatra at all.Advocate Abhishek Atrey, appearing for the Uttarakhand government, said they had filed an affidavit and taken a decision to ban the yatra due to Covid and it had been notified.On July 14, the top court took suo motu cognisance of media reports on the Uttar Pradesh government's decision to allow the yatra amid the Covid pandemic and sought responses from the state as well as the Centre "given the disparate political voices" on the matter.
