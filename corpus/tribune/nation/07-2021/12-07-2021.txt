China topped the list at 4,106, followed by Russia (2,526), Hong Kong (692), the United States (685), Pakistan (283) and Kazakhstan (278) ahead of India.Saudi Arabia at 223, Turkey at 221 and Egypt at 206 complete the list of top 10 countries to have been issued the visa allowing applicants residency rights in the UK, with around half the total now under review.“Golden visas allow wealthy individuals to buy the right to live in the UK if they invest in UK-registered companies. Individuals that invest 2 million pounds get an immediate right to live in the UK for three years, followed by a two-year extension,” notes the report entitled ‘Red Carpet for Dirty Money'.“Those that invest 10 million pounds can be fast-tracked to get indefinite leave to remain within two years, or within three years if they invest 5 million pounds. From indefinite leave to remain visa holders are on a steady path, after one year, to much prized UK citizenship,” it adds.Diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in relation to the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam and now fighting against being extradited to India in the High Court in London, is believed to have been living in the UK on an Investor Visa applied for in 2015.At the time, the route was relatively easier for super-rich individuals to acquire residency rights in the UK, based on a minimum of 2-million-pound investment.It is dubbed the “blind faith” period but since then the UK Home Office tightened the norms for the category and announced a review around three years ago of these visas issued between 2015 and 2018.Spotlight on Corruption claims that all 6,312 golden visas issued during the “blind faith” period are under review by the Home Office for “potential national security risks”, which amounts to half of all such visas issued overall.“The UK's golden visa regime continues to pose a significant corruption, money laundering and national security risk to the UK,” said Susan Hawley, Executive Director of Spotlight on Corruption.“It is alarming and deeply unfair that the government is becoming draconian in other parts of its immigration policy but has yet to close major loopholes that allow dirty money to come to the UK. The government must commission an independent review of whether the regime provides any real benefit to the UK,” she said.The new report by the charity, which has a remit to fight corruption within the UK and wherever the UK has influence, has called on the government to urgently publish the findings of its review of the visas issued under the category in the 2008-2015 period.It includes detailed statistics on what action has been taken on specific cases, including referrals to law enforcement, revocation of visas, and denials of citizenship applications.Its report warns that the golden visa regime continues to pose a significant "national security, corruption, and money laundering risk" to the UK despite recent reforms."Glaring loopholes remain, including that applicants using 'gifted' funds to apply for a golden visa still face no due diligence, and that the Home Office remains over-reliant on financial institutions for due diligence on wealth invested,” it warns.The UK Home Office said the route has been reformed in the last few years to crackdown on black money and that it will report on its pre-reform findings in due course.“We reformed the Tier 1 visa route in 2015 and in 2019 to crack down on dirty money and we have not ruled out making further changes, if necessary,” the Home Office said in a statement.“These changes include requiring banks to do extra due diligence checks prior to opening accounts and requiring applicants to provide evidence of the source of their funds. As part of our work to prevent this route from corruption we are reviewing all Tier 1 investor visas granted before these reforms were made, and will report on our findings in due course,” the statement said.

12-07-2021||New Delhi||SC takes note of delay in counselling for NEET-MDS admissions, says Centre is dilly-dallying||The Supreme Court Monday took strong note of delay in holding the counselling for the NEET-MDS admissions for which exams were held on December 16, 2020, saying the Centre and others have been “dilly-dallying” for a year now.A bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah, which had issued notices to the Centre and others, including Medical Counselling Committee (MCC), on July 2 on the plea of nine BDS doctors, granted one week’s time to the government for filing an affidavit.“These are qualified BDS students. Why you have not held the counselling since last year? Can you imagine the loss to India? You are not allowing them the degree by not holding counselling.Read also“You have been dilly-dallying for a year. Tell us within a week as to when are you holding it,” the bench observed during the hearing conducted through video-conferencing.Senior advocate Vikas Singh and lawyer Tanvi Dubey, appearing for the BDS doctors, referred to the plight of the dentists who had cleared the NEET-MDS in the exams held last year and are still waiting for the admissions in PG course.Now the matter has been listed for hearing on July 19.The doctors, having Bachelor in Dental Surgery (BDS) degree, had appeared in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)-MDS conducted on December 16 last year by the National Board of Examination (NBE) for admission to the Master in Dental Surgery (MDS) course.Besides the Centre and MCC, the bench had earlier also issued the notices to the Dental Council of India and the National Board of Examination (NBE).The plea, filed through lawyer Tanvi Dubey, said that these doctors are challenging the “unjust and infinite delay” caused by the MCC in announcing the counselling schedule for NEET-MDS, 2021.The plea also sought a direction to the MCC to conduct a separate counselling for the NEET-MDS 2021.The results for admissions in PG courses for BDS candidates were also declared on the scheduled date, that is on December 31, 2020.“However, after the declaration of the result, i.e., on 31.12.2020 until today i.e. 23.06.2021, there is no update regarding the counselling. It is most respectfully submitted that umpteen efforts were made by the Petitioners to get in touch with the Respondents in order to get an idea about the schedule of the counselling. However, there has been no update about the date of the commencement of the counselling,” the plea said.It said the dentists, who are also registered with state Dental Council, have obtained provisional or permanent registration and have also undergone compulsory rotatory internship of a year in an approved or recognised dental college.“That around 30,000 BDS (dental) graduates appeared for the NEET-MDS conducted for admission to over 6,500 seats in the country and till date there has been no update for admissions in PG courses,” it said.

12-07-2021||Vijay Mohan||AFT directs Army to formulate separate promotion policy for ‘Minor Corps’||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 12 The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has directed the Army to formulate and promulgate a separate policy for the officer management of ‘Minor Corps’ keeping in view their peculiarities, unique requirements and contingencies.While upholding the seniority concept and policy of calculating vacancies being currently implemented by the Army for all arms and services, the AFT’s opined there was a need for complete clarity in understanding the concept of functional requirement, scheduling selection boards, designating reckonable period for calculating vacancies and method of calculating vacancies for Minor Corps.The AFT’s bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz, has directed that the new policy letter, duly approved by the competent authority be promulgated within six months and a completion report be filed in this regard.‘Minor Corps’ are those services where the strength of officers and other ranks is very low as compared to other arms and services like the Infantry, Artillery, Engineers, Ordnance, Army Service Corps and Army Medical Corps. The Judge Advocate General’s Department (JAG), Pioneers, Corps of Military Police, General Service, etc., are considered as Minor Corps.Three JAG officers, Col Leena Gurav, Col VS Gaur and Col Mukul Dev had moved the AFT, averring infirmities in the process of fixing vacancies as well as the proceedings of the selection board for promotion from Colonel to Brigadier. Consequently, the results of No.2 Selection Board were stayed by the AFT in January 2020. The stay has now been vacated. Normally, the selection board is held for all arms and services together, based on a schedule promulgated in advance. The policy on calculation of vacancies for selection boards is based on pro rata vacancy system taking into account the batch strength. Vacancies are calculated for a period of one year.During the course of arguments, it was brought out that the concept of Minor Corps is not defined and that the concept of “functional requirement” utilised in the context of Minor Corps was vague and lacked clarity. Sometimes, whilst the vacancies have been approved and promulgated, the conduct of the board is deferred for various reasons.Also, unlike the major arms and services, which have large cadre strength and a fresh batch each year, the Minor Corps have small cadre strength and often do not have a fresh batch every year. As a result, the method of assigning pro rata vacancy based on the “rolling block method‟ of three years cannot be implemented in their case.Thus, in the case of Minor Corps, vacancies only arise from retirement or chain promotions and are limited in number. This was even observed by the Supreme Court in its judgements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aft-directs-army-to-formulate-separate-promotion-policy-for-minor-corps-282093

Gurjot was admitted on bail in the same matter a day after his arrest in the ASI case.While granting relief, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gajender Singh Nagar said that they have been made accused in both cases on the basis of the same act and no specific role is attributed to them.The judge granted bail to them on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 50,000 with one local surety of like amount. He also imposed various other conditions on them.Boota and Gurjot have been directed to join the investigation as and when called, not threaten the witnesses or tamper with the evidence.Advocate Jaspreet S Rai, representing the two accused, said argued that even though they were present at the Red Fort, no overt act was committed by them.Meanwhile, Public Prosecutor Rajiv Kamboj asserted that if they are released on bail, they might run away from justice, destroy the evidence as they have done in the past by destroying their clothes and phones.For Gurjot, the police said he was seen in at least three photographs at the spot of hoisting of flag at the Red Fort with the riotous mob.This case was registered on the complaint of Gunjan Shrivastava of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). On January 26, protesting farmers had clashed with police and stormed into the fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes.Notably, actor-activist Deep Sidhu, who is accused of being the key conspirator of the violence, was also arrested in this case moments after being released from jail in another case related to the incident.

12-07-2021||New Delhi||From 54K on Apr 27, home isolation cases in Delhi plummet to 252||Amid marked improvement in the coronavirus situation in Delhi, the number of people under home quarantine here has fallen to a low of 252 from over 54,000 on April 27 when the second wave was wreaking havoc in the capital.According to official figures, the number of active cases too has come down from a record high of 99,752 on April 28 to 743 on July 11.The positivity rate on Sunday dipped to 0.07 per cent, and other metrics, such as the number of daily cases and deaths and the count of containment zones too have significantly come down in the past several weeks.Delhi had been reeling under a brutal second wave of the pandemic, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with the oxygen supply shortage issue during April-May at various hospitals, adding to the woes.As the cases mounted, the Delhi government imposed a lockdown, starting April 19.Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling up, with 28,395 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20; rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths, according to official data.On April 20, the city had recorded 40,124 people under home isolation while active cases tally was 85,575 and containment zones count being 17,151.The metric spiralled up in a week’s time, with 53,819 people under home isolation in Delhi on April 28, and 99,752 active cases and 25,985 daily cases.In the beginning of the month, the daily cases and home isolation cases had stood at 2,790 and 5,698 respectively on April 1, while there were 10,498 active cases and 2,183 containment zones.As the second wave spelt mayhem in the city in April, all metrics shot up, and on April 27, the city had a record 54,578 people under home isolation, as per the official data shared by the city health department.The positivity rate on April 27 had skyrocketed to 32.72 per cent when 24,149 cases and 381 deaths were reported in the national capital, with 98,264 active cases and 31,570 containment zones.However, several metrics have come down in the last few weeks, and on July 11, the positivity rate dipped to 0.07 per cent while 53 cases, the lowest since April 15, and three deaths were recorded.While daily cases and death counts are steadily falling and positivity rate shrinking, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has cautioned that the chances of the third wave of the pandemic was “quite real” and said that it was working on a war-footing to combat it.On May 15, he had said, “The virus is reducing in Delhi slowly and steadily, and I hope it diminishes completely and does not rise again. However, we are not going to become negligent in anyway”, while sounding a tone of caution.On May 28, the city saw 1,141 cases and 14,581 active cases while 7,111 people were under home isolation and containment zones count stood at 22,701.The daily cases count came down to 212 on June 16 when the home isolation count was 781, with 2,749 active cases and 6,169 containment zones, as per the official data.Following the decline in cases, the Delhi government started the unlock process from early June in a phased wise manner.Notwithstanding the improved coronavirus situation, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday passed a colour-coded response action plan under which curbs will be implemented in accordance with the severity of the Covid-19 situation here to deal with a possible third wave of the pandemic.Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal last Wednesday had inaugurated a genome-sequencing laboratory at the ILBS hospital here and said the people of Delhi will highly benefit from this facility.This is the second such laboratory in Delhi, and a much advanced one than inaugurated by Kejriwal on Tuesday at LNJP Hospital here.

12-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||VHP asks UP govt to remove one-child norm from its draft population control Bill||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 12RSS affiliate Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has taken strong exception to the one-child norm proposed by the draft population control bill of the Yogi Adityanath government. Asking the state law commission to “delete it”, the right-wing organisation also warned Uttar Pradesh that in its case the one-child policy may lead to “furthering of the imbalance between different communities because they are known to respond differently to incentives and disincentives related to family planning and contraception”.Pointing to an “alarming growing imbalance” in states like Assam and Kerala “where the overall growth of population has declined”, the VHP said: “In both those States, the TFR of Hindus has declined far below the replacement rate of 2.1, but that of Muslims is 3.16 in Assam and 2.33 in Kerala.“In these States, one of the communities has thus entered the contraction phase while the other is still expanding. UP should avoid getting into that situation. The policy needs to be tailored to redress the imbalance otherwise one-child policy may end up doing the opposite,” states the letter signed by VHP working president Alok Kumar, a senior advocate.Asserting that the one-child norm goes beyond the stated objectives of the UP Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill, 2021, of stabilising the population and promoting a two-child norm, the VHP said: “The preamble of the Bill states that this is a Bill (i) inter alia to stabilize the population and (ii) promotion of two child norm and the VHP agrees with both objects. However, Section 5, 6 (2) and 7 of the Bill, which incentivise the public servants and others to have only one-child in the family go well beyond the said objects”.“We also notice that the Population Policy of Uttar Pradesh has an object to bring the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) to 1.7 within a certain time limit. We suggest that Sections 5, 6(2) and 7 of the Bill as also the object of bringing the TFR to 1.7 needs reconsideration,” the VHP further argued. Asserting that the population in a society stabilises when the average number of children born to a woman in her reproductive life (Total Fertility Rate) is marginally above two, the VHP said: “This happens when the TFR is 2.1. At this level of TFR, on average, there are two children born to replace the two parents and the additional one child provides for the possibility of some children dying before reaching the reproductive age and similar other wastage”. “Therefore, a two-child policy is considered desirable for achieving population stability. A policy aiming at an average of less than two children per woman leads to a contraction of the population over time. Such contraction has several negative social and economic consequences”. Citing the example of China, the VHP said in a contracting population, the ratio between the working-age and dependent population gets disrupted. “There is a rise in the number of persons that each working-age person has to take care of. In an extreme case, the one-child policy would lead to a situation where there is only one working-age adult to look after two parents and four grandparents. In China, which adopted the one-child policy in 1980, it was called the 1-2-4 phenomenon. “To get over it, China had to relax its one-child policy for parents who were themselves single children of their parents. It is said that in China, the one-child policy was never applied to more than half of the prospective parents. Within about three decades, it had to be completely withdrawn. Stating that single children are known to be “socially less accommodative, the VHP also said that “this is partly because they do not learn to share with siblings, and partly because they are over-indulged and pampered by their parents. This has been referred to as the “Little Emperor” syndrome”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vhp-asks-up-govt-to-remove-one-child-norm-from-its-draft-population-control-bill-282079
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Farm sector needs post-harvest revolution, govt impetus on scientific ecosystem: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said there is a need for a "post-harvest revolution" in the farm sector, which has been witnessing an increase in production.Modi said the hardworking farmers had made record production of commodities despite the unprecedented challenges of the Covid pandemic."With the ever-increasing agricultural production, there is a need of post-harvest revolution and value addition," Modi said in a message to commemorate the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development's foundation day, which was read out at an event hosted by the state-run lender."We are striving relentlessly to intensify our speed and scale to achieve this. We have been taking comprehensive steps to get a complete solution, from irrigation to sowing, harvesting and earnings that are technology enabled," he added.Last year, the Union government passed three new farm laws but its implementation has been postponed amid farmers' protest. However, in January this year, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse. Modi had also promised to double farmers' incomes by 2022.The Prime Minister said the government's focus is to encourage youth and promote start-ups associated with the agricultural sector."We are giving the impetus to create a scientific ecosystem, speed up development according to the wishes and expectations of the villages and transform the agricultural sector of the economy through holistic approach," he added.The PM said a self-reliant rural economy is necessary for 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' or self-reliant India, and added that the government had taken concrete measures over the last seven years for the same.The government is committed to empowering close to 12 crore small farmers and help them become the driving force of the rural economy, he added.

12-07-2021||New Delhi||5G rollout: Delhi HC defers hearing on Juhi Chawla's plea till July 29, judge recuses||The Delhi high court on Monday deferred a hearing on the plea by Bollywood actress Juhi Chawla in connection with the dismissal of her lawsuit against 5G wireless network technology.Justice Sanjeev Narula recused from hearing Chawla's plea and directed that it be listed before another bench on July 29.“Subject to the order of the Chief Justice, list before another bench on July 29,” the judge said.Last week, Justice J R Midha had directed that Chawla's application, which seeks that her lawsuit against 5G rollout is declared “rejected” instead of “dismissed”, be placed before Justice Narula after the deposit of previously imposed Rs 20 lakh costs.Chawla's counsel argued that the plaint, which “never went up to the level of suit”, could only be rejected or returned in terms of the Civil Procedure Code, and not dismissed.The court had also granted a week's time for deposit of costs after Chawla decided to not press the application for its waiver. Application for refund of court fees was also withdrawn by Chawla.In June, the court had described the lawsuit by Chawla and two others against 5g rollout as "defective", "abuse of process of law" and filed for "gaining publicity" and dismissed it with costs.Justice Midha said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was "not maintainable" and was "stuffed with unnecessary Scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments" which are liable to be struck down.The court said the suit filed by actress-environmentalist and others was to gain publicity which was clear as Chawla circulated the video conferencing link of the hearing on her social media account which resulted in the repeated disruptions thrice by unknown miscreants who continued disruptions despite repeated warnings.

12-07-2021||New Delhi||Centre asks Odisha govt to expedite work under Jal Jeevan Mission||The Centre has asked the BJD-ruled state of Odisha to expedite work to provide piped drinking water to all the villages under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM).In a letter to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has pitched for the start of work to provide tap water in all the villages of the state.Sources said the Centre’s nudge to the Odisha government is on the heels of its approval of the state’s Annual Action Plan (AAP) for 2021-22 for JJM.While green-lighting the plan, the Centre approved an increased annual allocation of funds to the state to more than Rs 3,323 crore for the year 2021-22.The Central grant to the state in 2020-21 was about Rs 812 crore, making this year’s allocation marks about a four-fold increase.With an unspent balance of Rs 11 crore and matching state’s share of Rs. 3,253 crore, in all Rs 6,596 crore is available for water supply work in the state in 2021-22.The JJM’s goal is to provide every rural household in the country with piped drinking water by 2024. The Jal Shakti Ministry is the nodal authority with regard to its implementation.Goa, Telangana, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Puducherry have achieved 100% household with an assured tap water supply and have become ‘Har Ghar Jal’.At the start of the JJM in 2019, out of a total of about 19 crore rural households in the country, only about 3 Crore (17%) had tap water connections.During the last 22 months, despite Covid-19, it has been implemented with speed and 4.5 crore households have been provided with tap water connections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-asks-odisha-govt-to-expedite-work-under-jal-jeevan-mission-282039

Extensive campaigns would be run in communities, groups, and geographical areas where fertility rates were higher.""It (draft bill) is an electoral propaganda. They (BJP) look at everything from a political angle. They just want to win elections and do not take any decision in the interest of the people. Since the UP assembly election is coming, they are concerned about it. By the grace of Allah, we will not let them win," Barq said here on Sunday evening."It would be better to stop marriages. No one should be allowed to get married for the next 20 years and no children will be born," he added. "Those who will challenge the law of Allah will get finished," the MP from Sambhal said further.Barq said while China was encouraging its citizens to have more children, India was doing the opposite which might backfire in case of a war."A lot of births are taking place in China and you (India) are stopping people from having children. A time will come when we will be very few. If there is a war, then from where will you bring people to fight," Barq said.He also alleged that the recently held block panchayat chief polls were rigged by the ruling BJP.According to the draft of the population control bill put up on the state law commission website, people having more than two children in the state will be debarred from contesting local bodies polls, applying for government jobs or receiving any kind of subsidy.The draft bill, for which suggestions have been invited from the public till July 19, also prohibits promotions in government jobs for such people, while offering incentives to those limiting their children to two.The draft says it is necessary to control and stabilise the population of the state for the promotion of sustainable development with more equitable distribution.If enacted, the provisions of the proposed legislation titled The Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill, 2021 will come into force after one year from the date of publication in the Gazette, according to the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission (UPSLC) website. Assam, which is another BJP-ruled state, too has announced that it will gradually implement a two-child policy for availing benefits under specific schemes funded by the state.

12-07-2021||Kottayam (Kerala)||Supreme head of Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church of India passes away||Baselios Marthoma Paulose II, the supreme head of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church of India, who had stood for the cause of the poor and destitute and was instrumental in initiating several path-breaking changes in the church, passed away in the early hours of Monday, a spokesman said here.He was 74.His end came at 2.35 am at a private hospital in Parumala in Pathanamthitta district while undergoing treatment for post-Covid complications, the church spokesman said.The senior priest, who had been suffering from lung cancer since December 2019, had recovered from the Covid infection in February this year.Enthroned as the eighth Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan in November 2010, Baselios Marthoma Paulose II was the 91st primate on the Apostolic Throne of St Thomas, church sources added.Cutting across religion and politics, several people, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Pianrayi Vijayan, condoled the demise of the senior priest."Saddened by the passing away of His Holiness Moran Mar Baselios Marthoma Paulos II, the Supreme Head of Indian Orthodox Church. He leaves behind a rich legacy of service and compassion. In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the members of the Orthodox Church. RIP," the Prime Minister tweeted.Born on August 30, 1946 at Mangad, a nondescript hamlet in Thrissur district of central Kerala, Baselios Marthoma Paulose II was known as K I Paul in his earlier life before taking the holy orders.After completing his post graduation and theological studies, the church Parliament (Malankara Syrian Christian Association) elected him as Bishop at the young age of 36.He was consecrated as Episcopa (bishop) with the new name Paulose Mar Milithios in 1985 and subsequently elevated as the first Metropolitan of the newly formed Kunnamkulam diocese.He was unanimously elected as the Catholicos Designate and the successor to the Malankara Metropolitan in 2006.Following the abdication of his predecessor, Baselios Marthoma Didymus I, Paulose Mar Milithios Metropolitan was enthroned as the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan with the new name Baselios Marthoma Paulose II on November 1, 2010, church sources added.Lovingly called as 'Bava Thirumeni' by his admirers and followers, Baselios Marthoma Paulose II had been a known philanthropist and a strong advocate of secular ideologies throughout his years of priesthood.Besides strongly protecting the interests of his church men, he had also shown keen interest in effective and meaningful inter-church relations.Bava Thirumeni also did not mind criticising governments and political parties whenever he felt that justice was denied to the Church.A modest personality and a great humanitarian, Baselios Marthoma Paulose II had always tried to extend support to the poor and destitute and initiated several programmes under the aegis of the Church to help them.His historic interventions in ensuring women equal participation in the administration of the Church and granting them voting rights in parishes had garnered widespread praise.His campaigns against drug menace also won attention.One of the greatest challenges faced by Baselios Marthoma Paulose II during his stint as Catholicos was the long-standing dispute with the Jacobite faction.During his stint as the Church head, the Supreme Court had pronounced the historic verdict clearing the dispute between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions.As part of boosting inter-church relations, he had meetings with all the present heads of the Oriental Orthodox Churches during his short span of time as Catholicos.The fraternal relations with the sister Churches too had been given prime importance and the meeting with the present Pope of the Catholic Church had enhanced the bilateral relations between the two Churches, church sources added.The senior priest also authored a few devotional and contemplative books in Malayalam.Condoling his demise, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan called Baselios Marthoma Paulose II a "humble man" who lived among common people.Stating that the senior priest had always been there in the forefront to help the struggling people, he said the Catholicos played a major role in bringing women to the leadership roles in the Church."He stood for bringing peace in the Church and society. He always stood for the interest of the Church," he said, adding that Baselios Marthoma Paulose II had lived a life equal to that of a saint and his death was a huge loss to society.Besides ministers and MLAs, several leaders, including senior Congress leader and former defence minister AK Antony and BJP state chief K Surendran, were among those who condoled the death.According to church sources here, the funeral rites would be held on Tuesday adhering to Covid protocols.

They found that everybody inflicted with severe Covid had developed antibodies, but the proportion was 80 per cent for those with moderate disease and 30 per cent for those with mild and asymptomatic disease. With the passage of time, antibody levels declined further.The storage of bio-samples happened over the entire period of the epidemic with the THSTI collaborating for the project with Faridabad ESI Hospital, Gurugram Civil Hospital, Palwal District Hospital and Delhi’s Maulana Azad Hospital.All bio-samples were taken after informed consent of patients and approval from ethics committees.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan on Sunday hailed the THSTI’s effort at creating the massive bio-repository of samples from Covid patients. She said, “Bio-repositories, combined with metadata, can help answer many questions about Covid-19.”The THSTI bio-repository was created under a Biotechnology Department initiative last year to understand the epidemiology of the disease, how immune responses develop in different patients and how the samples can be used to augment diagnostic.The samples, kept at minus 80°C under advanced refrigeration, can be stored for up to 10 years and made available to academics and the industry for Covid-19 research.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-5k-samples-in-store-one-of-worlds-largest-covid-bio-banks-set-up-at-faridabad-281771

Shimla district is considered a Congress stronghold. Virbhadra Singh and Ram Lal Thakur, who hailed from the district, occupied the CM’s post for nearly 25 years. Both are no more.Former minister Vidya Stokes has retired. She did not contest the 2017 Assembly poll. Another Congress leader, JBL Khachi, who was from Kumarsain, passed away in 2002. With Virbhadra Singh gone, the Congress may find it hard to retain its bastion.Shimla district has eight Assembly segments of which four — Rampur, Rohru, Shimla (Rural) and Kasumpti — went with the Congress in 2017. The BJP won the Shimla (Urban), Chopal and Jubbal-Kotkhai seats and the CPM bagged the Theog seat.With the death of senior BJP leader Bragta, the Jubbal-Kotkhai seat has fallen vacant, byelection for which is likely to be held soon.

It creates obstacles in development. UP will control population with education, awareness and better health facilities. -  Yogi Adityanath, UP  CM“Population control measures will not be confined to any class or section in UP. Population growth is directly related to poverty and illiteracy. It creates obstacles to development. UP will control population with education, awareness and better health facilities,” said the Chief Minister, releasing the new policy on the occasion of World Population Day.Adityanath said the effort of population stabilisation was linked to wider awareness in society.“Widespread awareness is the only tool for family planning. It will be difficult to achieve the goal of population stabilisation unless we run an awareness campaign keeping in mind all sections of society. All such sections must be identified and a mass awareness programme should be launched,” the CM said at an event at his official residence, allaying fears that the two-child policy unveiled yesterday would target Muslims. On the provision to bar violators of the two-child policy from applying for government jobs and contesting local body elections, Adityanath said the implementation of the proposed legislation would focus more on incentivising rather than punishing dis-incentivising persons.“Population explosion can create obstacles to the path of development. Nations and states that have taken steps in this regard have seen positive results, but more needs to be done,” said the CM of the most populous state which has a population of more than 24 crore.Under the population policy 2021-2030, a target has been set to bring the gross fertility rate to 2.1 by 2026 and to 1.9 by 2030. As per the National Family Health Survey 4 (concluded in 2015), UP’s total fertility rate was 3 in rural areas and 2.7 in urban areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/population-measures-wont-be-class-specific-says-up-cm-yogi-281776

The plane avoided Pakistani air space while bringing back the personnel.External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “The safety and security of our personnel is paramount. They have been brought back for the time being due to intense fighting near Kandahar. This is a temporary measure. The consulate continues to operate through our local staff members.” Arrangements are being made to ensure continued delivery of visa and consular services through the Embassy in Kabul.The only consulate left functional is in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. There too the security situation is deteriorating and reports state that some countries have already shut their consulates in Mazar.India once had four fully functional consulates in Afghanistan. The numbers and their location had become a bone of contention with Pakistan. With the temporary closure of Kandahar consulate and the earlier shuttering of Jalalabad consulate, India has shut both consulates near the Pakistan border. Herat consulate, near the Iranian border, was shut along with Jalalabad consulate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-evacuates-diplomats-security-staff-from-kandahar-as-taliban-gain-ground-281767

He highlighted the emergence of the subcontinent’s first towns Mohenjodaro and Harappa and specified that the Indus Valley Civilisation was considered to be the most populous of the ancient world.He outlined the prevalence of high urban infant mortality rate peaking up to 380 per 1,000 during the Muslim rule. He traced the impact of several epidemics and numerous famines on Indian population and suggested that black deaths did not affect India in a big way as many would presume.He said the mortality declined during 1947-52 and improved subsequently in the 1950s and 1960s. Interestingly, at least as gauged by the rise in life expectancy, the Indian population grew probably faster in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, than it was in subsequent decades, he added.“There is no simple relationship between the rate of economic growth and the rate of improvement in life expectation,” he said. He ended his talk with giving his population projections for India for the year 2051 at 1,579 million.Earlier in the day, several faculty members of the CRRID took part in awareness drive and distributed free masks among disadvantaged sections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/increase-in-life-expectancy-led-to-rise-in-indian-population-expert-281769

BJP president later joined the 11 lady members of the Union Cabinet, a gesture that was appreciated by Sitharaman.While Sitharaman and Smriti Irani are Cabinet Ministers, the other nine are Ministers of State.Besides Sitharaman and Irani, the tea party also included Meenakshi Lekhi, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, Anupriya Patel, Renuka Singh, Annapurna Devi, Pratima Bhoumik, Bharati Pawar, Shobha Karandlaje and Darshana Jardosh.Though many of them are well known names, there are those who have made a mark in state politics such as Jardosh, the new Minister of State for Railways & Textiles. She reduced the last two polls in Surat to a no-contest by picking up 75 % of the votes. Annapurna Devi, the new MoS for Education, was a four term RJD MLA who crossed over to the BJP after losing the 2014 assembly polls. Pratima Bhoumik, the first Tripura resident and second woman from North East to be a Union Minister, stayed with the BJP through thick and thin since 1991 and finally won the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by a handsome margin.Bharati Pravin Pawar, another MoS, is the daughter-in-law of a eight-term NCP MLA from Maharashtra. She had lost the 2014 Lok Sabha polls on a NCP ticket and then joined the BJP to successfully win the 2019 polls.Anupriya Patel was the only non-BJP woman MoS to join the party. Chief of the Apna Dal that was launched by her father, Patel won her first election in 2012 in alliance with the pro-Muslim Peace Party but enetered into an alliance with the BJP which has fetched her the Lok Sabha seat in 2014 and 2019.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sitharaman-hosts-tea-party-union-cabinets-women-members-281670

He said the formation of a low-pressure area will also boost its advancement.“We are expecting light rainfall on Sunday and a good spell on Monday,” he said.Read alsoThe IMD said, “Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, the Gujarat region, Madhya Maharashtra, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Telangana, coastal and south interior Karnataka, Kerala and Mahe and Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal.”It has also issued alerts for several north Indian states and a red warning for coastal Maharashtra.The bulletin also indicated that heavy rainfall is expected at isolated places over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad, west Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan, west Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim, Odisha, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Saurashtra and Kutch, Marathwada, Rayalaseema, north interior Karnataka and Lakshadweep.It said thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds (with a speed of 30-40 km per hour) are very likely at isolated places over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Telangana.Lightning at isolated places is also expected over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Vidarbha, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, central Maharashtra, Marathwada, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Rayalaseema and Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal by Monday morning, the IMD added.

12-07-2021||New Delhi||Fresh worries as R-factor rises, decline in active Covid cases slows||Giving rise to fresh worries about the Covid-19 pandemic rearing its head again, the R-factor, which indicates the speed at which the infection is spreading in the country, has risen recently leading to a sluggish pace in the decline of active cases while Kerala and northeast states have emerged as regions of concern.This is despite the nationwide tally of new cases remaining low, revealed an analysis by researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai.The R-factor has increased slightly to 0.88 in June-end after being at its lowest-ever value of 0.78 from mid-May till late last month, it showed.Read alsoThis comes amid the unlocking process by many states trying to restore a semblance of normalcy as the deadly second wave, which infected lakhs and killed thousands during its peak in April-May, shows signs of ebbing.Sitabhra Sinha, who led the team of researchers, said the ‘R’ for India is still below one, so the number of active cases is decreasing at a much slower rate. The same trend of slowing down in the rate of decline in active cases is also seen in many states.“Kerala showed a brief spike in cases and its R continues to hover close to 1. The northeast region is of great concern. Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and possibly Tripura are showing a rise in the number of cases,” Sinha pointed out.When the second wave of the Covid-19 infection was at its peak, the overall R-value in the country was estimated to be 1.37 between March 9 to April 21. It declined to 1.18 between April 24 to May 1 and then to 1.10 between April 29 to May 7, according to the analysis.Between May 9 and 11, the R-value was estimated to be around 0.98. It then to 0.82 from May 14 to May 30. The R-value was 0.78 from May 15 to June 26 and 0.88 from June 20 to July 7.In Kerala, the R-value is estimated to be around 1.10. As for the northeastern states, the R for Manipur is 1.07, Meghalaya 0.92, Tripura 1.15, Mizoram 0.86, Arunachal Pradesh 1.14, Sikkim 0.88, Assam 0.86.Rising Covid-19 cases in Kerala, coupled with the recent outbreak of the Zika virus, is a matter of concern for the health authorities as the southern state battles to bring down daily new infections.The state had reported 14,087 fresh Covid cases on Saturday and 109 fatalities taking the caseload to 30,39,029 and the death toll to 14,380. Active cases in the state have touched 1,13,115.While on June 1 this year, Kerala reported 19,760 positive cases, there was a slight decline for a week with 9,313 new cases being recorded on June 7. However, two days later it again shot up to 16,204. For over a month, the state has been reporting cases between 11,000 to 13,000 daily.Kerala Health Minister Veena George had recently said the numbers have spiked due to certain unlock measures and that they were expected to go down.“India’s R has increased a bit to 0.88 from June-end after being at the lowest ever value of 0.78 (since the pandemic began in March last year) from mid-May till late last month,” Sinha said.This means, every 100 infected people on average pass on the infection to 88 other individuals. If R is lesser than 1, it means the number of newly infected people is lower than the number of infected people in the preceding period which means the disease incidence is going down, the lead researcher said.“The smaller the value of R is, the faster the disease is on decline. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round—technically, this is what we call the epidemic phase. The bigger the number is than 1, the faster the rate of spreading of the disease in the population,” Sinha added.Earlier this month, Manindra Agarwal, a scientist of a government panel tasked with modelling of Covid-19 cases, said the third wave of coronavirus could hit the peak between October-November if Covid appropriate behaviour is not followed, but may see half the daily cases recorded during the second surge.Agarwal also said the third wave could spread faster if any new virulent variant emerges.

Minhaz Ahmed, a resident of Lucknow’s Dubagga area, and Maseeruddin, a resident of Lucknow’s Madiaon area, have been arrested. Explosive material has been recovered from them,” he said.Ahmed and Maseeruddin, on the instructions of Umar Halmandi, the head of the Uttar Pradesh module of the Al-Qaeda, along with their associates were planning to “unleash terror activities before August 15 in different cities of the state, especially its capital Lucknow”, the additional director general of police (ADGP) said.“They were planning explosions at important places, memorials and crowded places, and also to use human bombs. For this, they were collecting weapons and explosives,” Kumar said.He also said that members of this module are not only from Lucknow, but also from Kanpur in the state.Raids are being conducted at different places to apprehend associates of militants Ahmed and Maseeruddin, the ADGP said.“During interrogation, the accused persons said that their accomplices ran away from their house. The ATS team along with the local police has undertaken intensive checking,” Kumar said and added that a case has been registered in this connection at the ATS station.They will be produced before a court, and then taken into police custody.The official said that an improvised explosive device (IED) was found at Ahmed’s house along with a huge amount of explosives and a pistol. Explosives were also seized from Maseeruddin’s residence, he said.The IED is being defused by the bomb squad, the ADGP said.He said that in 1988, at the time of Soviet-Afghan war, Osama Bin Laden and some of his associates had formed the Al-Qaeda, a militant Sunni Islamic multi-national terror organisation.The module of the Indian sub-continent was announced by then head of the terror group Ayman al-Zawahiri on September 3, 2014. Maulana Asim Umar, who headed the Al-Qaeda in the sub-continent was killed on September 23, 2019 in an US-Afghan operation, Kumar said.He had links with Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh, Kumar said.Umar Halmandi had started the work of recruiting men for the Al-Qaeda in India, and radicalise them, he said.“For this, he had identified some aggressive persons in Lucknow, appointed them, and built the Al-Qaeda module. This module was made to unleash terror activities under the Ansar Ghazwatul Hind. Prominent members of the module are Minhaz Ahmed, Maseeruddin and Shakeel,” he said.

If we can do it in Delhi, then why can't we do it in Uttarakhand, which not only produces electricity but also gives it to other states," Kejriwal said at a press conference here."There will be no power cuts. Free electricity doesn't mean long outages. When we took over in Delhi 7-8 hours long power outages were common. We set that right," said the AAP leader who recently promised free electricity to every household in Punjab that consumes up to 300 units of power if his party forms government in the state next year.Kejriwal had last year announced 100 per cent subsidy to those who consume up to 200 units of electricity in Delhi. Consumers of 201-400 units received approximately 50 per cent subsidy.In Uttarakhand, he said, every household will be provided 300 units of free electricity if the AAP forms the government.The freebies announced on Sunday are being seen as his attempt to woo voters and steal the ruling BJP's thunder by going one step ahead of it.Uttrakhand Power Minister Harak Singh Rawat had also recently announced that the state government will give free electricity to people of the state up to 100 units The AAP which has not been able to win a single seat in the state in the past elections has plans to emerge as an alternative to both Congress and BJP in the next assembly polls.The AAP leader remembered how he and his ministers went door-to-door to get transformers and wires replaced.He claimed that AAP workers touring different areas of Uttarakhand have found that exaggerated bills have been issued on a large scale to people "deliberately to dupe them"."So we have decided to waive the old bills and start afresh if elected to power. We will also give free electricity to farmers for agricultural purposes," Kejriwal said.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kejriwal-promises-300-units-of-free-power-to-every-family-waiver-of-old-bills-in-uttarakhand-281624

All the three personnel have to be residents in India.Read alsoAs per the information updated on Twitter's website, Vinay Prakash is the Resident Grievance Officer (RGO). Users can contact him using an email ID listed on the page. "Twitter can be contacted in India at the following address: 4th Floor, The Estate, 121 Dickenson Road, Bangalore 560 042," the page further said.Prakash's name appears along with Jeremy Kessel, who is the Global Legal Policy Director, and is based in the US.The company has also published its compliance report for the period of May 26, 2021, to June 25, 2021. This was another key requirement under the IT rules that came into effect on May 26. Twitter had previously appointed Dharmendra Chatur as its interim resident grievance officer for India as required by the IT rules. However, Chatur stepped down last month.Twitter has been at loggerheads with the Indian government over the new social media rules. The government has confronted Twitter over deliberate defiance and failure to comply with the country's new IT rules, despite repeated reminders. Twitter -- which has an estimated 1.75 crore users in India -- lost its legal shield as an intermediary in India, becoming liable for users posting any unlawful content.On July 8, Twitter had informed the Delhi High Court that it has appointed an interim chief compliance officer, who is a resident of India, and that it will make an endeavour to fill the regular position within eight weeks as per the new IT Rules.It had also said it was in the process of making an appointment to an Indian resident as its interim RGO and it expected to do so on or before July 11 and details would be updated on its 'Help Page' as soon as possible.

12-07-2021||New Delhi||India evacuates diplomats, security personnel from Kandahar as Taliban captures new areas||India has pulled out around 50 diplomats and security personnel from its consulate in Kandahar in Afghanistan in view of the deteriorating security situation and the Taliban gaining control of new areas around the southern Afghan city, people familiar with the development said on Sunday.A special aircraft of the Indian Air Force was sent on Saturday to bring back the Indian diplomats, officials and other staff members, including a group of Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel, they said.External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India-based personnel have been brought back for the time being in view of intense fighting near Kandahar city.Describing the pull out of the India-based personnel as a temporary measure, he said the consulate continues to operate through the local staff members.He said India is closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan."The safety and security of our personnel is paramount. The consulate general of India in Kandahar has not been closed. However, due to the intense fighting near Kandahar city, India-based personnel have been brought back for the time being," Bagchi said.He was replying to a media query on the issue."I want to emphasise that this is a purely temporary measure until the situation stabilises. The consulate continues to operate through our local staff members," Bagchi said.He said arrangements are being made to ensure continued delivery of visa and consular services through the Indian embassy in Kabul."An important partner of Afghanistan, India remains committed to a peaceful, sovereign and democratic Afghanistan," the spokesperson said.India's move to temporarily bring back its Indian staff came in view of Taliban fighters rapidly seizing control of a number of key areas in the region as well as in western Afghanistan, triggering huge security concerns.On Tuesday, the Indian embassy in Kabul said there was no plan to close the embassy and the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif.Two days back, the Ministry of External said India was carefully monitoring the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and its implications on the safety and security of Indian nationals."Our response will be calibrated accordingly," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Bagchi had said at a media briefing on Thursday.Afghanistan witnessed a series of terror attacks in the last few weeks as the US looked to complete the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan by August-end, ending a nearly two-decade of its military presence in the war-ravaged country.There were reports that at least two foreign missions in Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of northern Balkh province, have closed their operation in view of the escalating violence in the region.Amid growing concerns in India over the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, Afghan Ambassador Farid Mamundzay on Tuesday briefed Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on the situation in Afghanistan.The Indian embassy last week asked all Indians visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan to exercise the utmost caution with regard to their security and avoid all types of non-essential travel in view of rising incidents of violence in various parts of the country.In an advisory, the embassy said the security situation in Afghanistan remains "dangerous" and that terror groups have carried out a series of complex attacks including targeting civilians, adding Indian nationals additionally face a "serious threat" of kidnapping.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested nearly USD three billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.In March, Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar visited India, during which Jaishankar conveyed to him India's long-term commitment towards a peaceful, sovereign and stable Afghanistan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-evacuates-diplomats-security-personnel-from-kandahar-as-taliban-captures-new-areas-281561
