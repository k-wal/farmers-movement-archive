They have been asked to give their comments within 15 days of the receipt of letters,” a source said.The Tenth Schedule, popularly called the anti-defection law, was inserted in the Constitution in 1985.It lays down the process by which legislators may be disqualified on the grounds of defection by the presiding officer of a legislature based on a petition by any other member of the House.A legislator is deemed to have defected if he either voluntarily gives up the membership of his party or disobeys the directives of the party leadership on a vote. This implies that a legislator defying (abstaining or voting against) the party whip on any issue can lose his membership of the House.The law applies to both Parliament and state assemblies. The decision of the presiding officer can be challenged in court. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-secretariat-issues-notice-to-3-mps-under-anti-defection-law-283710
15-07-2021||New Delhi||Sedition cases jump 160 per cent between 2016-19: Rights lawyer||Sedition cases spiked by 160 per cent between 2016 to 2019 and conviction rate in such matters stood at just 3.3 per cent in 2019, according to an analysis of official data by a rights lawyer. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, referred to and quoted by rights lawyer Vrinda Grover, assumes significance in view of the observations of an apex court bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana that there have been  “enormous misuse” of the colonial era penal law on sedition and very low rate of conviction in such cases.Grover, using the NCRB data, told PTI that there has been a consistent rise in the number of sedition cases being filed, and between 2016 to 2019, there has been a 160 per cent increase in the number of cases filed for sedition.On the issue of cases culminating in convictions, she again referred to data and said in 2019, 30 cases of sedition were decided, with 29 acquittals and one conviction and the “rate of conviction is abysmal, being 3.3 per cent”.Concurring with Grover, senior advocate Geeta Luthra said that the conviction rate is low in such cases because the basic principle and ingredient for invoking the law is not there in most cases.“The prosecution may not even produce evidence or file charge sheet because their intention is only to put someone behind the bars. It is not that the government wants to necessarily punish somebody. It is for sending a message across and making dissent disappear,” she added.Mrinal Bharti, lawyer and senior partner in MZM Legal firm, who represents media houses and journalists facing sedition cases, said the cases are foisted by the government of the day to quell the dissent.“The reason for poor conviction rate is obvious as there was hardly any material to establish the offence and moreover, police do not investigate such cases properly,” he added.  Grover also attributed the spike in sedition cases to the rising authoritarianism in governance and claimed that the State Executive is increasingly resorting to it to silence any criticism, questions, or dissent raised by citizens through the exercise of freedom of speech.She further said that out of 30 cases of sedition decided in 2019, there was conviction in only one case, adding that the “rate of conviction is abysmal, being 3.3 percent.” Calling it as a “vestige of colonial rule”, she said that the State is foisting sedition cases to silence citizens, intimidate the public, and throttle democracy.“Sedition cases foisted based on trumped-up charges which fall upon judicial scrutiny; often after people have suffered long incarceration as undertrials,” she added.Luthra, however, said that even though the law is being misused rampantly, more and more people are becoming conscious that it should be abolished.“I cannot tell if it is being misused or invoked more, but I definitely think that people are becoming more conscious,” Luthra said about the law the existence of which was questioned by the apex court for the last 75 years.The top court asked the Centre why it was not repealing the provision used by the British to “silence” people like Mahatma Gandhi to suppress the freedom movement.  The non-bailable provision makes any speech or expression that brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India a criminal offence punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. — PTI  RKSRKS07152143NNNN||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sedition-cases-jump-160-per-cent-between-2016-19-rights-lawyer-283709

Forcible acts like imposing a law on them cannot help," he said.When asked whether he would meet RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, he avoided an answer and said that he only came to Patna to resume Aashirwad rally."Decision regarding making a political alliance generally takes place before Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha elections. We will do the same in future," he said.Reacting on the LJP-Paras group's fresh appointment of leaders, Chirag said that such a development would not affect him much."The appointment of officials would not affect us.

15-07-2021||New Delhi||Farmers from 22 states will participate in protests planned outside Parliament: SKM||Farmers from 22 states will participate in the protests planned outside Parliament from July 22 to demand scrapping of the contentious farm laws and for a legal guarantee on MSP, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) said on Thursday.The umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions has planned that around 200 farmers will hold protests outside parliament every day during the monsoon session. The leaders have not commented on whether they have permission to hold demonstrations outside parliament but have maintained that the protests will be “peaceful”.“The Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s call for Parliament March from July 22 till August 13 has received an overwhelming and enthusiastic response from across the country,” it said in a statement.Besides Punjab and Haryana, a large number of farmers from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra, Telangana, Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan will participate in the protest, SKM said.Special marches by women on July 26 and August 9 will also see huge participation from across India, including the northeastern states, it said.“The parliamentarians shall see farmers from all over India march in a disciplined manner to parliament to place their demands and have their voices heard,” SKM said.Extending their support to the farmers’ movement, Punjabi artistes, including Gul Panag, Amitoj Mann and Babbu Mann, performed on Thursday for the protesters camping at the Singhu border, the statement said.They also appealed to the Indian citizens to extend their solidarity with the farmers’ movement.“It is noteworthy that all sections of the country are coming out in support of the farmers and it is unfortunate that the Union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unable to do justice to the farmers and stand with them,” the statement said.Thousands of farmers from across the country have been agitating at the Delhi borders against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws at major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.

15-07-2021|| New Delhi||Customs to speed up clearance of imported vaccines||The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on Thursday put in place a three-step Customs Response Plan (CRP) for instant clearance of imported vaccines.The CRP is based on the understanding that any delay in customs clearance would only damage the vaccine, in view of its special requirement of storage at very low temperatures. Also, CBIC is acutely conscious of the importance of the vaccines reaching the users without any loss of time, stated an official press release.The plan builds upon CBIC's experience in the early days of the pandemic, as demand for medical supplies had surged.The CBIC said it had paid special attention to the findings of the WHO that the arrival and the subsequent customs clearance of vaccines and their transport to the primary vaccine store are the most critical stages. Experience shows that this is often the time when mistakes are made, and delays occur.The CRP by the customs department aims to eliminate that.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/customs-to-speed-up-clearance-of-imported-vaccines-283701
15-07-2021||Pilibhit (UP)||Like Bengal, efforts will be made in UP to create atmosphere against BJP: Tikait||Making his intentions clear against the Yogi Adityanath government, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said like in West Bengal, efforts will be made in Uttar Pradesh to create an atmosphere against the BJP in next year’s Assembly polls.Speaking to reporters here, Tikait, who has been leading a farmers’ agitation on Delhi’s borders for the last seven months against three new farm laws of the Centre, said, “The BKU will neither contest the next Uttar Pradesh election nor will it lend support to any political party. The farmers, who are angry over the (Narendra) Modi government’s decision, will however work to create an atmosphere against the government and the BJP.”Farmers will not vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if they do not benefit from the government’s policies, the BKU spokesperson said, adding that like in West Bengal, in Uttar Pradesh too, they would work towards keeping the saffron party away from power.Tikait, who was here to attend a private programme at the house of former Samajwadi Party (SP) district president Lakhwinder Singh Lakha in Mudalia Gausu village of Amaria tehsil, said the BKU succeeded in creating an atmosphere against the BJP in West Bengal.As a result, the saffron party suffered a crushing defeat in the West Bengal polls, he said, adding that similarly, in Uttar Pradesh too, the members of the union will work to create an atmosphere against the present government.Tikait said the future strategy of the farmers’ movement would be chalked out at the historic “Kisan Mahapanchayat” of the Kisan Morcha in Muzaffarnagar on September 5.Adamant on the demand for a complete repeal of the three farm laws of the Centre, he said the Union government, while refusing to withdraw the legislations, has sent proposals to the farmers’ organisations several times for a discussion on the flaws in those.Referring to the closed talks with the government for almost six months, Tikait said the Centre has an opportunity right now to find a solution to the problems of farmers.

15-07-2021||New Delhi||Ex-minister Arun Shourie moves SC against sedition law||Former Union minister Arun Shourie on Thursday moved the Supreme Court asking for the sedition law to be declared unconstitutional as it has come to be “heavily abused” and cases are being filed against citizens for “exercising their freedom of speech and expression”.Why aren’t you repealing British-era sedition law used against Gandhi, SC asks CentreSignificantly, the petition was filed on the day when a bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana expressed concern over “enormous misuse” of the law and asked the Centre why it was not repealing the provision used by the British to “silence” people like Mahatma Gandhi to suppress freedom movement.The bench agreed to examine the pleas filed by Editors Guild of India and a former major general, challenging the constitutionality of the law, and said its main concern was the “misuse of law”.The Section 124-A (sedition) under the IPC is non-bailable provision and it makes any speech or expression that “brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India” a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment up to three years to a life term and fine.Shourie’s petition claimed that “the definition of sedition (Section 124-A of IPC) was vague and incapable of accurate appreciation by the common citizen and the law enforcement agencies/ police”.The petition, filed by advocate Prashant Bhushan on behalf of Shourie and NGO Common Cause, claimed that sedition was a colonial law which was used expressly to suppress dissent by the British in India.“Sedition has come to be heavily abused with cases being filed against citizens for exercising their freedom of speech and expression on the basis of the literal definition that is available to law enforcement authorities on the statute books,” it said. The petition said that the interpretation accorded to Section 124-A of Indian Penal Code, by the Supreme Court in ‘Kedar Nath Singh vs State of Bihar’ matter in 1962 was “not understood or appreciated by the police which continues to register cases against citizens who are exercising their right to freedom of speech and expression”.“By the time the courts step in to apply the interpretation of Kedar Nath to the facts of the cases, the citizens have already been deprived of their liberty,” the petition said.It added that after India became a democracy, this law was challenged as being violative of fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India in Kedar Nath Singh v State of Bihar matter in 1962.Even though the provision was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1962, the position of law has hence changed and the matter requires reconsideration, it said.“In such circumstances, it is submitted that this court needs to revisit the judgment of Kedar Nath Singh v State of Bihar, and strike down Section 124 A of Indian Penal Code, as being violative of Articles 14 (equality before the law), 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution of India,” the petition said.It sought a direction “declaring Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code as unconstitutional”.“Alternatively, direct that strict action as per law be taken against concerned public servants and complainant/ informants in cases where the accused is discharged in a case of sedition and lay down guidelines for the same,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-minister-arun-shourie-moves-sc-against-sedition-law-283692

The history lovers are a disappointed lot after a portion of the historic Mahbub Mansion belonging to Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI, the sixth Nizam, collapsed due to the rain on Wednesday night.The building, which is 119 years old, is a reminiscence of the Nizam’s era in the Deccan. The building is in ruins and has been facing encroachments. The state authorities have barricaded the building.The flooding and poor drainage have inundated many areas and sent fear among the residents of low-lying areas of the city’s southern side. Last year floods caused havoc in the city, leaving many people homeless.On Wednesday night, panic gripped residents in some areas, and they started shifting from their houses in colonies surrounding the Osmannagar tank near Pahadishareef after water started entering their homes.Similar reports of panic were also received from residents of Al Jubail colony in Chandrayangutta, which remained waterlogged for four days last year. Due to heavy rains, everyone who could move out or move to the upper floors did so while remaining awake to keep an eye on the developing situation. Fatima Begum, a resident of Al Jubail colony, said.Residents of Moula ka Chilla, Yakutpura, Chacha Garage, Amannagar, Lalithbagh and Uppuguda have also witnessed anxious moments for the past few days of rains. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) monitors the situation and clears the water-logging wherever possible using pumps.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rain-damages-nizams-119-year-old-mansion-283687

The NHRC should have respected the court. Instead of leaking the findings to the media, it should have first submitted the same to the court.Read also“What would you call it other than political vendetta of the BJP? It is yet to digest defeat (in the assembly polls) and that is why the party is resorting to such tricks,” she told a press conference here.Asserting that the situation in West Bengal is a “manifestation of law of ruler instead of rule of law”, an NHRC committee probing alleged incidents of post-poll violence in the state, in a report placed before the Calcutta High Court, recommended a CBI probe into “grievous offences like murder and rape”.On her visit to Delhi next week, Banerjee said she would like to meet the Prime Minister and the President if she “gets an appointment”.“Every time after elections, I visit Delhi to meet old and new friends.

Discussed the current situation in and around Afghanistan. Reiterated our support for peace, stability and development of Afghanistan,” the external affairs minister tweeted.Jaishankar travelled to Tashkent after a two-day visit to Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe where he attended a crucial meeting of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).The foreign ministers of the SCO countries extensively deliberated on the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan triggered by the Taliban’s attempts to expand its influence in that country following the withdrawal of the US forces.The US has withdrawn majority of its forces from Afghanistan.Afghanistan witnessed a series of terror attacks in the last few weeks as the US aimed to complete the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan by August-end, ending a nearly two-decade of its military presence in the war-ravaged country.In his remarks at the SCO meeting on Wednesday, Jaishankar said that the future of Afghanistan cannot be its past and the World is against seizure of power by violence and force.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar were among those who participated at the meeting.In Tashkent, Jaishankar also held talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart A K Abdul Momen.“Happy to meet with Bangladesh FM Dr AK Abdul Momen on the sidelines of the Tashkent Connectivity Conference.

15-07-2021||Bengaluru||There may be illegitimate parents but no illegitimate children: Karnataka HC||The Karnataka High Court has held that there may be illegitimate parents but no illegitimate children, because a child has no role to play in his or her birth.A division bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Hanchate Sanjeevkumar made the observation recently while setting aside a single judge order, quashing a petition by K Santosha seeking a job in the state-run Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) on compassionate grounds, following the death of his fatherAfter the death of his father, a lineman grade-2, in 2014, Santosha had applied for appointment on compassionate grounds.However, the petitioner was born out of second marriage when the first marriage was in subsistence, which was against the policy of the BESCOM.Hence, his application was rejected by the company.The petitioner then approached the High Court and his plea was rejected by a single judge.While setting aside the single judge order, the division bench noted, “We add that no child is born in this world without a father and a mother. A child has no role to play in his or her birth. Hence, the law should recognise the fact that there may be illegitimate parents, but no illegitimate children.”     It is for the Parliament to bring about uniformity in law vis-a-vis legitimacy of children and to determine in what way protection could be extended to children born outside a valid marriage, the bench pointed out.“For the limited purpose of this case, we find that children born out of void and voidable marriages under other personal laws, where there is no provision for conferment of legitimacy, must also have equal protection of the law by treating them on a par with children born of out of void and voidable marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act or the Special Marriage Act, 1954 insofar as the appointment on compassionate basis is concerned,” the bench observed.It then directed the company to consider the petitioner’s job application in accordance with the law and the observation made by it.The court also quashed a clause in the electricity department’s circular with respect to the appointment of children born out of second marriage, issued on September 23, 2011.According to the clause, the second wife or her children are not eligible for compassionate ground appointment, if the marriage has taken place during the subsistence of the first marriage. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-may-be-illegitimate-parents-but-no-illegitimate-children-karnataka-hc-283671

More than 50 per cent of respondents feel work-from-home post-pandemic has not affected their professional development.However, about 75 per cent of the respondents did not receive any promotion or appraisal amid the pandemic."Maximum number of engineers want to switch jobs but they clearly need upskilling through a structured programme that delivers what it promises - a development job! The current workforce of engineers is not suitable for present day tech-based jobs, a reason for more engineers looking for a job after completing graduation," said Narayan Mahadevan, Founder of BridgeLabz, in a statement."At BridgeLabz, we are trying to find the gaps with such surveys and understand the aspirations of both the engineers and the companies.

15-07-2021||Guwahati||Full freedom to Assam police to act against criminals: Himanta on encounters||Unfazed by criticism of his government over recent encounter killings, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday said the state police has "full operational liberty" to fight against the criminals within the ambit of law.Replying to a Zero Hour discussion on the rising number of encounters initiated by the Leader of the Opposition Debabrata Saikia in the Assembly, Sarma appealed to all the MLAs to send a message that the House is against any form of crime."As a leader of the House, I thank and congratulate the Assam police for its work as whole and especially in my tenure."I want to tell the DGP that do not torture innocent people. You have full operational liberty as long as you fight against the criminals as per the law," he added.Sarma informed the house that in the last two months, 15 alleged criminals have died and 23 others were injured in police encounters when they snatched service weapons, tried to attack and attempted to escape."As the chief minister of the state and with full sense of responsibility, I want to say that we have zero tolerance towards cow smuggling, drug trade, human trafficking, crime against women and children, and all crimes will be dealt with heavily and firmly irrespective of religion and caste," he added.The criminals must understand that there is a government, which is confident, resolute and has the will power to retaliate against them if it is attacked or try to flee but within the ambit of the law, said Sarma, who also holds the Home portfolio.Giving examples of the situations leading to encounters, he said that among the killed were six suspected Dimasa National Liberation Army (DNLA) terrorists and two alleged militants of United People's Revolutionary Front (UPRF) who were heavily armed and opened fire at police, which went to arrest the insurgents."There is one RPF personnel, who was the kingpin of a drug network. When police arrested him, he knew that it was the end of his world. So, he snatched the service revolver of one policeman and then police had to fire at him."In the minor rape case of Morigaon, the accused killed the 9-year old girl and then he raped her from both sides -- vagina and anal. These are not humans. He knew that he will be convicted with extreme punishment and so he tried to flee.Police had to fire at him," Sarma said.A total of 504 persons have been arrested in the last two months for their alleged involvement in cattle smuggling and only four of them were injured in police firing as they tried to escape, he added."It is the police which again take the criminals to hospital, treat them and then produce them in the court. Our main attempt is to get the criminals convicted and punished," Sarma said.He said that the critics are citing laws and human rights, but the same law and the Constitution give power to a police person to defend himself and act against the criminals.Claiming that such police encounters have been going on for decades, the chief minister said, "Sympathy is important, but misplaced sympathy is very very dangerous. If a message goes from here that the police did wrong, then they will sleep again."The Assembly needs to send a strong signal against all forms of crime. Law will rule here and police will act as per the law. If police do anything wrong to an innocent, then we will condemn and it will be probed. But, as long as they fight against criminals lawfully, the assembly will stand by the Assam police."Earlier, Saikia pointed out media reports and said no inquiry as per the law has been ordered in the encounters that resulted in deaths of the alleged criminals."We welcome the steps taken to stop the crimes, but if law is not followed, then it is the breakdown of the Constitution. Police must register FIR and follow the necessary criminal proceedings... The CM's statement at the police conference was anti-Constitution," he added.At the first ever face-to-face meeting with the Officers In-Charge (OCs) of all police stations of Assam on July 5, Sarma had said that shooting at criminals "should be the pattern" if they attempt to escape from custody or try to snatch arms from the police to fire at them.On Wednesday, the chief minister told the assembly that the Assam police will retaliate against criminals trying to snatch service weapons of its personnel and attacking them or fleeing from their custody, thereby defending the series of encounters in the last two months.Taking suo moto cognisance, the Assam Human Rights Commission (AHRC) had on July 7 asked the state government to institute an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the death and injury of the accused in police encounters over the past two months.Earlier, a New Delhi-based lawyer from Assam, Arif Jwadder, had filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) against the Assam police for a series of encounters that have taken place since Sarma took over on May 10. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/full-freedom-to-assam-police-to-act-against-criminals-himanta-on-encounters-283666

However, the ship sank off the country’s coast on June 17.Apart from the 325 metric tonnes of fuel in its tanks, the ship was loaded with 25 tonnes of hazardous nitric acid. Environmentalists have dubbed it as one the worst ecological disasters in Sri Lanka’s history.The Indian Navy vessel is currently surveying the sea route safety around the Colombo port after the damage caused by the gutted container carrier.“TTX-2021 exemplifies the deep trilateral engagement between India-Maldives-Sri Lanka which has strengthened immensely in maritime domain over the past years. Interaction between the three neighbouring countries in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has also grown significantly in recent years, in consonance with India’s policy of ‘Neighbourhood First’ and vision of ‘Security and Growth for all in the Region (SAGAR),” the release said.The exercise came as a follow up to India, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives agreeing to focus on ways of enhancing maritime security cooperation in the IOR at the fourth National Security Adviser (NSA)-level trilateral meeting held in Colombo in November last year with the participation of India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and the top defence brass from Sri Lanka and the Maldives. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-sri-lanka-and-maldives-conduct-trilateral-table-top-exercise-on-maritime-security-283664

15-07-2021||New Delhi||Job applications of many Gen Z aspirants rejected or cancelled during second Covid wave in India: Report||The pandemic has adversely affected careers and education plans of India’s youth and job applications of a significant number of Gen Z aspirants, those below 24 years, were rejected or cancelled during the second Covid wave, says a LinkedIn survey.On World Youth Skills Day 2021 on Thursday, LinkedIn launched the ‘Career Aspirations Gen Z India’ survey that captures the sentiment and outlook of Gen Z professionals in India towards jobs, internships, skilling, and networking opportunities.LinkedIn commissioned research firm GfK to conduct the survey, which was done in June. It focuses on insights of 1,000 Gen Z students and professionals in the age group of 18 to 24 years.As per the survey, 72 per cent students and 65 per cent Gen Z Indians were professionally impacted during the second wave of Covid.The study shows that nearly 70 per cent of Gen Z job applicants did not get a positive response after waiting for long periods while a similar proportion said their applications were either cancelled or delayed indefinitely.Gen Z Indians cited ‘fewer opportunities’, followed by ‘slower recruitment’ and ‘higher competition’ as the top three reasons affecting their job search today. Other barriers in pursuing job opportunities include lack of guidance for skilling and increased familial responsibilities due to Covid.Around 72 per cent of the students stated that internship opportunities had also greatly reduced during the pandemic’s second wave. Among those who are currently employed, 32 per cent of Gen Z Indians experienced a pay cut while 25 per cent lost a job opening because the company cancelled the job role due to the pandemic.The second wave of Covid has disrupted the education plans of nearly 75 per cent students and Gen Z Indians. In fact, 40 per cent of those with higher academic aspirations have postponed or cancelled their plans due to safety concerns, financial constraints, and travel restrictions.“Such is the disruption that every fifth (20 per cent) Gen Z Indian is now pivoting to a different learning program than originally planned,” the report said.“As one of the youngest nations in the world, India’s future of work will be driven by Gen Z professionals, whose new-age skills can revitalise our economic recovery. But 70 per cent of Gen Z Indians had their job applications rejected due to hiring challenges during the pandemic,” said Ashutosh Gupta, India Country Manager, LinkedIn.Employers must treat this as a distress call to urgently re-imagine how they hire and develop talent to prevent young professionals from being left behind, Gupta added.As upskilling and collaboration have become workforce essentials in today’s challenging professional landscape, every second Gen Z professional (51 per cent) wants employers and leaders to make skill-based hires today.“Skills are the currency for workforce transformation and the only viable solution to tackle the evolving workforce dilemma,” Gupta said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/job-applications-of-many-gen-z-aspirants-rejected-or-cancelled-during-second-covid-wave-in-india-report-283655

In India, for example, vaccination drives in remote areas are helping to reach missed children," the statement said.Yasumasa Kimura, Officer-in-Charge and Deputy Representative programmes, UNICEF India said, “While the health systems are strained by the Covid -19 response, we must be cautious in our fight against the pandemic so as not to interfere with decades of gains against other preventable diseases. We cannot afford to lose out on routine immunisation and letting vaccine-preventable diseases endanger children's health.”“UNICEF is partnering with the Government of India to support continuity of essential health and immunisation services through planning, implementation, and monitoring of various strategies to identify and vaccinate missed children. We also support generating awareness and confidence among communities to vaccinate their children and strengthening the cold chain for routine immunisation,” he said.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-has-highest-number-of-unvaccinated-under-vaccinated-kids-worldwide-at-3-5-million-unicef-283650

15-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government gives nod to ACB for open inquiry into corruption charges against Param Bir Singh||The Maharashtra government has given its permission to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to conduct an open inquiry into the allegations of corruption against former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh made by another police officer, an official of the agency said on Thursday.The ACB had sought permission to initiate open inquiry against Singh into the charges levelled by police inspector Anup Dange and the government gave its nod on Wednesday, he said. Dange was suspended last year and reinstated into the police service earlier this year.The ACB official said that the probe is based on the complaint by Dange, who alleged that he was approached by a man claiming to be Param Bir Singh's relative and demanded a bribe of Rs 2 crore to reinstate him into the force.Dange was earlier attached to Gamdevi police station and is now attached to Mumbai police's south control room. He had written a letter to Maharashtra Additional Chief Secretary (Home) in February this year, in which he had levelled allegations against Singh.  Dange alleged that Singh had tried to shield some people having underworld links from the law when he was the DG of the ACB.  In his letter to the state government, Dange had said that in November 2019, when he went to shut down a pub in south Mumbai, the owner claimed to know Singh well. Dange, however, went on to file a complaint after a scuffle broke out outside the pub while the police were taking action against the pub.Dange alleged that after Singh became Mumbai police commissioner, he suspended him. He claimed that a person claiming to be Singh's relative approached him and demanded a bribe of Rs 2 crore to reinstate him.“The ACB, which was conducting two discreet inquiries against Singh based on the complaints by Dange and another inspector, had sought permission from the home department to proceed with an open inquiry (on Dange's complaint),” he said. Singh had been transferred from the post of Mumbai police chief in March this year over the handling of the Mukesh Ambani security scare case. A few days after that, Singh had written a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that Anil Deshmukh, who was the home minister at that time, had asked police officer Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh stepped down as a minister in April after the Bombay High Court ordered a CBI inquiry into the allegations made against him by Singh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-government-gives-nod-to-acb-for-open-inquiry-into-corruption-charges-against-param-bir-singh-283641

15-07-2021||New Delhi||Sharjeel Imam seeks bail in sedition case, denies encouraging violence during anti-CAA protests||JNU student Sharjeel Imam, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and sedition law, has moved a bail plea before a court here in a case related to making allegedly inflammatory speeches during the protests against CAA and NRC at two universities.Imam was arrested for his alleged speech at Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on December 16 where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India. He is in judicial custody since January 28, 2020.In the bail plea, which came up before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat for hearing on Thursday, Imam claimed that he never participated in or encouraged any violence during the course of any protest or demonstration and is a peace-loving citizen.During the hearing, advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, representing Imam, read parts of his speeches to the court and said that they do not fall within the meaning of sedition law.“Where is the call of violence? How does Sedition come into play? The context is to block the roads. How is this seditious? He called for a greater federal structure. That was the intent,” advocate Mir said.Alluding to the speeches, the counsel further said, “Imam spoke about cutting off some cities. When the call rail roko is not seditious, why is the call of bringing the country to a standstill seditious?”He submitted that the perusal of the contents of the speeches show that there was neither any 'incitement to violence' nor have any 'incidents of violence' taken place which could be attributed to the Imam's speeches.ASJ Rawat heard the arguments put forth by Imam's counsel and posted the matter to August 2 for further hearing.Imam is accused of offences relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the UAPA.Last year, Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019.“In the garb of CAA, he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block highways leading to major cities and resort to 'chakka jaam'. Also, in the name of opposing CAA, he openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the charge sheet had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sharjeel-imam-seeks-bail-in-sedition-case-denies-encouraging-violence-during-anti-caa-protests-283638

However, we are not going to become negligent in anyway", while sounding a tone of caution.The Delhi government had earlier announced reopening of restaurants with 50 per cent capacity and one weekly market per municipal zone from June 14.With close gathering of shoppers in markets and restaurants resuming business amid phased unlock in the national capital, doctors have cautioned that Delhi could face a "worse than second wave situation" of Covid-19 if people do not adhere to safety norms or lower their guards.A total of 69,212 tests, including 45,615 RT-PCR tests and 23,597 rapid antigen tests, were conducted a day ago, according to the health bulletin on Thursday.The number of cumulative cases on Thursday stood at 14,35,353.

Our team then conducted a raid and arrested him from Pokhran after due verification. Some secret documents were recovered from his possession and a case was registered against him under the Official Secrets Act," Special Commissioner of Police (Crime) Praveer Ranjan said at a press conference.“Rahman's location was traced through electronic surveillance. On questioning, he could not give any satisfactory reply as to why he was in possession of these documents or their source, and kept on giving evasive replies,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Monika Bhardwaj said.Sharing further details, police said Rahman was in the trade of supplying fruits and vegetable to different vendors, including the Pokhran Army base camp.“Rahman knows some of his handlers with different names, and we are trying to find out if these handlers are in India. We also found that social messaging platform WhatsApp was one of the modes through which he used to send the classified documents to his handlers,” a senior police officer said.During the course of investigation, it was found that Army man Paramjit was the link man in the crime. He was earlier posted at Pokhran where he came in contact with Rahman who asked him to share the secret documents, police said.Paramjit is currently posted as a clerk at Agra Cantt, they said.According to police, Rahman's relatives are based in Pakistan's Sindh province, and he visited that country in 2019. He came in contact with a few handlers in the spy racket there.Rahman was asked to share the secret documents with them and the money for doing the job was sent through hawala network, police said.Multiple bank accounts used in the crime have also been found, he said, adding the matter is being thoroughly investigated.Police added that they have got inputs about some people based in Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh being involved in such anti-national activities.Some Army officials are allegedly providing them highly confidential information and documents for monetary benefits, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-man-vegetable-supplier-held-for-providing-classified-documents-to-pakistans-isi-283631

We are not considering this option. We will be acting through the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) to fortify the borders, if required. It will be important for all of us to maintain coordination. India has been training army personnel. So too is Russia. All options are possible,” said Russian Deputy Head of Mission Roman Babushkin at a media conference.Important to maintain coordinationWe have got some real experience in Afghanistan but let us be clear, the situation doesn’t require foreign military involvement. It will be important for all of us to maintain coordination. —Roman Babushkin, Russian dy head of missionThe CSTO is a six-nation grouping comprising Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Belorussia and Kyrgyzstan. The Russian assessment is that the new Taliban is fragmented. There are some hardliners who want to fight on, but others favour a political solution. “We have heard commitments, but have to see their implementation,” he said.India is a big player, which has always been supportive of the government in Kabul by providing economic and social assistance, and training Afghans in Indian universities and defence institutes. “It shows India has a huge interest and this is quite a crucial moment for everyone to remain in very close touch to support the original consensus on Afghanistan and effort by Afghans to share power according to agreements reached before,” observed Babushkin.Russia supported Indian contacts with the Taliban because it is a reality in Afghanistan and following US blessings, it is a party in the intra-Afghan talks.“It would be useful to deal with everyone in the region so that national interest is better ensured,” he observed.In his opening remarks, Russian Ambassador Nikolai Kudashev noted that both countries were poised for intensive consultations and interactions in the coming months.India will assume the presidency of both BRICS and SCO in September which will be occasions for meetings between PM Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.“Overall, Jaishankar’s discussions with Lavrov (last week) were comprehensive and forward-looking,” said Kudashev.The Ambassador said it was a matter of pride that Sputnik vaccine was a part of the Indian vaccination campaign. The launch of the one-shot Sputnik Lite is also expected soon. “We are committed to continue discussion on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates,” he said, while welcoming the Indian desire to increase its involvement in the Arctic Council which is currently chaired by Russia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-rules-out-military-tie-up-with-india-on-afghanistan-issue-283372

It was expected the Chinese side would work with us towards this objective. However, the situation in remaining areas is still unresolved,” said the MEA’s readout on the talks.Attempting to pick up the threads afresh, the two ministers noted the agreement in the last meeting of the WMCC on June 25 to hold another round of the meeting of senior military commanders.“They agreed this should be convened at the earliest. They also agreed that in this meeting, the two sides should discuss all the remaining issues and seek a mutually acceptable solution. There was also an understanding that both sides will continue to ensure stability on the ground and neither side will take any unilateral action that could increase tension,” said the readout.The two Ministers had made similar commitments as at Dushanbe during their last meeting in Moscow on September 10, 2020.Jaishankar referred to this aspect and emphasised the need to follow through on the agreement reached then and complete the disengagement, resolving the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh at the earliest.The minister recalled that both sides had agreed that a prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side. It was visibly impacting the relationship in a negative manner.SCO: Sever ties with terror groups, China tells TalibanChina asked Afghanistan to make a ‘clean break’ from all terrorist forces, including Qaida-backed Uighur Muslim militant group.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-agree-to-resolve-lac-issues-283125

The directive came days after the Supreme Court expressed shock that the law was being invoked even six years after it was struck down by the apex court.In its advisory, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has asked the authorities in states and UTs to direct all police stations not to register cases under the repealed provision and sensitise the law enforcement agencies for compliance of the order issued by the Supreme Court.“The MHA has also requested that if any case has been booked in states and UTs under Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000, such cases should immediately be withdrawn,” the government said in an official release.In view of the Supreme Court judgment, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, through a letter in January 2019, and the MHA, via two letters in January and April 2019, had asked the states and UTs to sensitise the police department and local police authorities for strict compliance of the Court directive, it said.“It has been brought to our notice through an application in the Supreme Court that FIRs are still being lodged by some police authorities under the struck down provision...Supreme Court has taken a very serious view in the matter,” said the MHA advisory.The section penalises "grossly offensive, menacing, or to send communication which the sender "knows to be false to cause annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will". The provision was struck down by the Supreme court in March 2015.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-asks-states-uts-to-immediately-withdraw-firs-under-repealed-sec-66a-of-it-act-283119
15-07-2021||July 14||Twitter sees jump in government demands to remove content of journalists, news outlets||Twitter Inc saw a surge in demands over the course of last year from governments around the world to take down content posted by journalists and news outlets, data to be released by the social media platform for the first time will show.In its transparency report to be published on Wednesday and a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Twitter said verified accounts of 199 journalists and news outlets on its platform globally were subject to 361 legal demands from governments to remove content in the second half of 2020, an increase of 26 per cent from the first half of the year.It declined to elaborate on which countries submitted the demands, or how many of the legal demands pertaining to journalists or news outlets the platform complied with.The new details in Twitter's biannual report on its enforcement of policy rules and the information and removal requests it receives comes as Twitter and other social media companies including Facebook and Alphabet’s YouTube are facing scrutiny from governments around the world over the content allowed on their platforms.On Monday, Cuba began restricting access to Facebook and messaging apps like Telegram amid widespread anti-government protests. Last month, Nigeria banned Twitter's service from the country and ordered television and radio stations not to use the platform to gather information.Twitter said in the report India was now the single largest source of all information requests from governments during the second half of 2020, overtaking the United States, which was second in the volume of requests.The company said globally it received over 14,500 requests for information between July 1 and December 31, and it produced some or all of the information in response to 30 per cent of the requests.Such information requests can include governments or other entities asking for the identities of people tweeting under pseudonyms.Twitter also received more than 38,500 legal demands to take down various content, which was down 9 per cent from the first half of 2020, and said it complied with 29 per cent of the demands.Twitter has been embroiled in several conflicts with countries around the world, most notably India over the government's new rules aimed at regulating content on social media. Last week, the company said it had hired an interim chief compliance officer in India and would appoint other executives in order to comply with the rules.In the updated transparency report, Twitter added that the number of impressions, or views of a tweet, that violated Twitter's rules accounted for less than 0.1 per cent of impressions for all tweets globally in the second half of 2020, the first time the platform has released such data.Like other social media companies, Twitter has struggled to police hate speech, misinformation and other abuses on its service, with Chief Executive Jack Dorsey among the tech leaders who appeared in a hearing before Congress in March on misinformation.Major social media companies were most recently under fire this week over racist abuse on their platforms directed at Black players on the England soccer team.—  Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-sees-jump-in-government-demands-to-remove-content-of-journalists-news-outlets-283103
15-07-2021||New Delhi||India presents 3-point roadmap to bring peace to Afghanistan||Emphasising that the future of Afghanistan cannot be its past, India on Wednesday presented a three-point roadmap for the conflict-ridden country that entailed cessation of violence and terrorist attacks, settlement of the conflict through political dialogue and steps to ensure that neighbouring countries are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar put forth the roadmap at a meeting of the SCO foreign ministers’ contact group on Afghanistan in Dushanbe amid growing global concerns over the Taliban fighters gaining control over large parts of the country.Read alsoRussian Foreign Minister Serge Lavrov, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar were among those who participated at the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) contact group.“The world, region and the Afghan people all want the same end state: 1. An independent, neutral, unified, peaceful, democratic and prosperous nation,” Jaishankar tweeted.“2. Ceasing violence and terrorist attacks against civilians and state representatives, settle conflict through political dialogue, and respect interests of all ethnic groups, and 3. Ensure that neighbours are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism,” he said.Amid escalating violence in Afghanistan, India has been pressing for a comprehensive ceasefire.“Peace negotiations in earnest is the only answer. An acceptable compromise that reflects Doha process, Moscow format and Istanbul process is essential. The future of Afghanistan cannot be its past. A whole new generation has different expectations.  We should not let them down,” Jaishankar added.The Doha process, Moscow format and Istanbul process are separate frameworks for dialogue to resolve the conflict in Afghanistan.“The challenge is to act seriously and sincerely on these beliefs. Because there are forces at work with a very different agenda. The world is against seizure of power by violence and force. It will not legitimise such actions,” Jaishankar said.Afghanistan witnessed a series of terror attacks in the last few weeks as the US aimed to complete the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan by August-end, ending a nearly two-decade of its military presence in the war-ravaged country.Earlier this month, the Indian embassy asked all Indians visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan to exercise the utmost caution with regard to their security and avoid all types of non-essential travel in view of rising incidents of violence in various parts of the country.In an advisory, the embassy said the security situation in Afghanistan remains “dangerous” and that terror groups have carried out a series of complex attacks including targeting civilians, adding Indian nationals additionally face a “serious threat” of kidnapping.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested nearly USD three billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.

Ltd. (Mastercard) from on-boarding new domestic customers (debit, credit or prepaid) onto its card network from July 22, 2021,” the central bank said in a statement.The RBI, however, clarified that its supervisory action will not impact the services of the existing customers of Mastercard in the country.Announcing the ban on Mastercard, RBI said, “notwithstanding lapse of considerable time and adequate opportunities being given, the entity has been found to be non-compliant with the directions on Storage of Payment System Data”.Mastercard is a payment system operator authorised to operate a card network in the country under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSS Act).In terms of RBI’s circular on Storage of Payment System Data on April 6, 2018, all system providers were directed to ensure that within a period of six months the entire data relating to payment systems is stored only in India.They were also required to report compliance to RBI and submit a board-approved System Audit Report conducted by a CERT-In empanelled auditor within specified timelines.

Decoding ‘no mask-no distancing' public recklessness||New Delhi, July 14Why are thousands crowding into markets, public places and holiday destinations seemingly without thought for the devastating second wave India is barely out of?If you have asked yourself that question, you are not alone.That is the question baffling experts too. It's a combination of apathy and a certain fatalistic attitude, said senior epidemiologist Lalit Kant.Attempting to decode the ‘no mask-no social distancing' recklessness underlining societal behaviour, psychiatrist Nimish Desai added that the public is unable to see the risks and correlate the restrictions on them.India, Desai said, has seen “heavy trends of social irresponsibility”.Concerns have mounted after images on social and other media of snaking queues of cars waiting to enter hill stations, and of people so anxious to get their lives back on track that basic precautions have been given the go by as they throng vacation spots and leisure sites.“In all cultures what should have happened is what is called risk perception — how much does a society perceive the threat (to be) and how much does it modify its behaviour accordingly,” Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, told PTI.While the pandemic is primarily a health crisis, experts say the role of a society in controlling or fanning a contagion cannot be overlooked.“The public in their conscious or unconscious minds could not see and correlate the restrictions on them…,” Desai said, referring to the peak of the first wave during the festive season last year.Around the Diwali-Durga Puja season, people seemed to be over-compensating for the time they spent confined in their homes, he said.This unlock doesn't seem very different.The seeming return to normalcy as India's Covid numbers dip is comforting. But the scenes of people not adhering to basic Covid protocols are also alarmingly familiar – that's exactly what happened when the first wave was ebbing only to make way for a ferocious second one.“People's compliance to guidance for adopting Covid appropriate behaviour has influenced the course the pandemic would take - slowing or accelerating it,” Kant, former head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told PTI.According to the senior epidemiologist, the non-adoption of Covid appropriate behaviour (CAB) is part of the reason for the second wave. Social distancing already seems a thing of the past, and double masks are on their way out, as single ones resume their ‘chin position'.India's Covid death toll crossed the four lakh mark earlier this month. Of this, nearly 60 per cent was during the second wave, the Union Health Ministry has said.Trying to understand why it is difficult for people to do the basic of wearing masks properly, maintaining hand hygiene or just keeping distance, Kant said a fatalistic attitude discourages them from considering “non-pharmaceutical interventions”."To my mind, it is general apathy. It is not that they are against it, they understand that it is important, but they just don't care.“People have developed a fatalistic attitude where they believe that anything can happen. They think, 'there's no medicine, no beds in the hospitals, what are we alive for?' And when you get that kind of an attitude, you stop taking precautions,” he said.Societies higher in openness and extraversion (an indicator of how much of an extrovert a person is) showed that people did not stay confined to their homes even after restrictions were announced on their movement, he said.“Studies have shown that extraverts are especially prone to defying short term instructions or regulations, exhibiting perhaps more counter-compliant behaviour.” The increasing number of Indians violating Covid norms seems to bear his assertion out.According to Delhi government data, for instance, over 87,000 people were fined in a matter of three weeks last month."Sustained mass level behaviour change is difficult but also not impossible,” Desai explained.Often, governments and administrations attempting to modify people's behaviour at a mass level rely on Behaviour Change Communication (BCC). Effective BCC strategies comprise repetitive messages that are simple to understand and often illustrative, and the benefits of which should be evident.“In the last two decades, developed countries have somewhat understood that every individual's health status depends on their lifestyle and behaviour. This itself was lacking in our society. Now the realisation in the world community is and should be that our collective health status depends on our collective behaviour,” Desai said.The public's faith in the government is crucial for mass behavioural change, which, according to veteran economist Arun Kumar, appears to be lacking among Indians.“If people had more faith in the government, then they would follow its instructions. In India, unfortunately, the faith in political parties is very low,” he said.“Seeing that so many families had to take loans for medical expenses, people will hold on to their money. They will go out for essentials, but they won't splurge. So the crowd that you see in the market is because people want to go out (not spend money),” Kumar told PTI.Disseminating unclear information about the severity of the infection and the rate of vaccination has added to the confusion.“If everybody says that we have conquered the disease, then people will question the need to worry about masks or social distancing'. The government lacks clarity,” the former economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University asserted.The government's projection of India's vaccination numbers having overtaken the US last month created a “false sense” of reassurance, he said.Kant agreed.“If the government is able to do targeted messaging, that will be of help. That's what people have tried elsewhere and found that it could be of help,” Kant said.Concerned over the situation, the Union Home Ministry on Wednesday said blatant violations of Covid-19 norms have been observed in several parts of the country, including hill stations, and asked states and union territories to take action against officials responsible for enforcing SOPs.In a letter to all states and UTs, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla emphasised that the second wave of Covid is not yet over and there is no room for complacency.The consequent increase in the 'R'-factor (reproduction number) in some states is a matter of concern, Bhalla said.The 'R'-factor indicates the speed at which the infection is spreading in the country. An 'R'-factor below 1 indicates that each infected individual is on average passing on the disease to less than one person.With 38,792 new coronavirus cases, India's Covid tally is now 3,09,46,074 (3.09 crore/30.9 million), the Union Health Ministry said on Wednesday.Active cases have declined to 4,29,946 and the daily positivity rate recorded at 2.10 per cent—less than three per cent for 23 consecutive days. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/apathy-fatalism-or-bravado-decoding-no-mask-no-distancing-public-recklessness-283084
15-07-2021||New Delhi||Centre directs states to regulate crowded places to avoid third Covid wave||The central government on Wednesday asked all states and the Union Territories (UTs) to issue strict directions to district and other local authorities concerned to regulate the crowded places and take necessary measures for management of Covid-19.The direction comes in the wake of "blatant violations" of Covid norms in several parts of the country, especially in public transport and hill stations at a time when third wave of the deadly virus has already started in various countries and there is possibility that it will hit India if people fail in following appropriate safety measures specified by the government.In an advisory to Chief Secretaries of all states, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) made it clear that the officers concerned should be made personally responsible for any laxity in strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour.The advisory sent by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also advised that orders issued by the respective state governments or UT administrations, district authorities in this regard should be widely disseminated to the public and to the field functionaries for their proper implementation.Referring to MHA's June 29 order issued for the implementation of targeted and prompt action for Covid-19 management in line with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare advisory dated June 28, Bhalla mentioned there is need to ensure if the norms of Covid  appropriate behaviour are not maintained at any establishment, premises, markets, such places shall be liable for the re-imposition of restrictions.The advisory made it clear that such actions are necessary for containing the spread of Covid-19, and that "the defaulter shall also be liable for action under the relevant laws".The MHA advisory came after reports of massive crowds thronging the marketplaces violating norms of social distancing and consequently increased in 'R' factor (Reproduction number) in some of the states -- a matter of concern.The advisory warned that "any increase in 'R' factor above 1.0 is an indicator of spread of Covid"."Therefore, it is important that authorities concerned shall be made responsible for ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour in all crowded places, such as shops, malls, weekly markets, market complexes, restaurants and bars, mandis, bus stations, railway platforms or stations, public parks and gardens, gymnasiums, banquet halls, sports complexes, as well as areas identified as hotspots for transmission of Covid-19 virus." Emphasising that the second wave of Covid is not yet over, Bhalla writes, "We ought to remember that while the reach of vaccination is increasing considerably, there is no room for complacency and hence Covid appropriate behaviour must continue in line with our philosophy of "dawai bhi, kadai bhi (medicine as well as restrictions)." The Home Secretary stressed that the testing needs to be continued with the same vigour, as adequate testing is extremely essential in terms of checking the virus and early identification of cases."You would appreciate that we must guard ourselves against complacency and laxity, which creep in as positivity declines. Instead, during the periods of low positivity, efforts must be stepped up to prevent any probable future surge." The advisory also stressed on the need for continuous focus on the five-fold strategy for effective management of Covid-19 -- Test, Track, Treat, Vaccination and adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour.The Home Ministry issued the advisory a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi flags crowding issue while interacting with chief ministers of northeast states, saying "the crowds at hill stations and markets where people are not wearing masks or following Covid-19 protocols are a matter of concern".IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-directs-states-to-regulate-crowded-places-to-avoid-third-covid-wave-283057

Given the fact that this Yatra is to take off from July 25, it is necessary to fix a short time period for this case,” the bench said.
