He had replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat in March.Pushkar Singh Dhami was sworn in as the new chief minister of the state following his election on Saturday as the leader of the BJP legislature party.“In Uttar Pradesh, democracy has been ‘injured’ because of the Chief Minister (Yogi Adityanath), and in Uttarakhand, democracy has become a ‘victim of instability’. In this situation, it will be better that the BJP transfer the UP CM to Uttarakhand, so that the hill state gets free from the daily problem of change of leadership,” the SP leader said in a statement.He also alleged that both the states were grappling with law and order problem, women security, unemployment, poor health services, among others.“There is a decline in the law and order situation in both the states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. No investments are taking place in the states owing to political manipulation. Unemployment, inflation and corruption are also on the rise since the BJP came to power in the states,” the statement said.The SP chief added that women are finding it difficult to live with honour and injustice is being done to farmers in both states.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-should-transfer-up-chief-minister-adityanath-to-uttarakhand-akhilesh-278199

While the digital app has been criticised by some for it allows only the digital-literate, smartphone-equipped population to access this service, it has also been lauded for its reliability, and ease in registration and appointment for vaccination.Official sources said around 50 countries are expected to seek information about the use of the platform as a digital public good. The countries that have registered interest include Canada, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Nigeria, Uganda, Vietnam, Iraq, Dominican Republic, the UAE and others.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringa had said India is working on sharing the platform with partner countries during a recent UNSC open debate on cyber security.Shringla had described CoWIN as scalable, inclusive and open technological platform which can be customised and scaled up for health interventions across the globe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-address-global-meet-on-cowin-278196
04-07-2021||New Delhi||Maharashtra ex-Minister Anil Deshmukh moves SC for protection against arrest in money laundering case||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday moved the Supreme Court seeking protection from any coercive action in a money laundering case.The Enforcement Directorate had, on Saturday, issued fresh summons to the 71-year-old NCP leader seeking his appearance on July 5 in the case.The ED has, so far, issued three notices to Deshmukh, who has been asked to record his statement at the central agency's office in south Mumbai on Monday.Deshmukh has moved the top court seeking protection from any coercive action, Mumbai-based advocate Inderpal B Singh said in a video message released for the media.The former minister had skipped the two earlier summons citing his "vulnerability" to COVID-19 as the reason for non-compliance in his last communication to the agency.He instead offered the ED to record his statement through video conferencing.The fresh summons by ED was issued in connection with the criminal case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) related to an alleged Rs 100 crore bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to Deshmukh's resignation in April this year.The first summons followed raids conducted by the ED at his premises in Mumbai and Nagpur apart from that of his aides and some others last month.The agency subsequently arrested two of his aides in this case, personal secretary Sanjeev Palande (51) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde (45).They are in ED custody till July 6.The agency, sources said, apart from the present case wants to question Deshmukh about his and his family members' alleged links with certain shell companies that were being used to launder funds much before the present allegations of bribery in the Mumbai Police setup came to light.The ED case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations of at least Rs 100 crore bribery made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.In his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the police commissioner's post, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked suspended Mumbai Police assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Deshmukh had to resign from his post in April following the allegations and he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.In his last communication sent to the agency through his lawyers, Deshmukh said the agency had already recorded his statement during his "several hours" of interaction with the ED investigators when they raided his premises here on June 25.He wrote that he was a law-abiding citizen "who has led a life of dignity and honour." "I am sanguine to expose the falsity, hollowness and lack of substance in the allegations levelled against me," he had stated.He said he was suffering from "hypertension and cardiac problems" and hence it "may not be prudent or desirable to appear in person today." The ED had earlier claimed in the court that Waze recorded his statement before the agency stating he "collected" Rs 4.70 crore cash from Mumbai bar owners and "handed it over" to Deshmukh's personal assistant (Shinde).The cop, lodged in Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai, had also told the ED that he attended a meeting at the official residence of the home minister wherein he was given a list of bar and restaurant owners and asked "to collect Rs 3 lakh per month from each bar and restaurant" in Mumbai.As per the PMLA, a statement recorded under the stringent sections of this law is admissible before the court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-ex-minister-anil-deshmukh-moves-sc-for-protection-against-arrest-in-money-laundering-case-278195
04-07-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena and BJP not enemies; appropriate decision will be taken as per situation: Fadnavis||Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday said his party and former ally Shiv Sena are “not enemies” though there are differences of opinions on certain issues between them and added there are no “ifs and buts” in politics.Responding to a query on whether there is a possibility of the two former allies coming together again, Fadnavis said “appropriate decision” will be taken dependent on the situation.When asked about his recent meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and the possibility of the BJP and Shiv Sena coming together again, Fadnavis said, “There are no ifs and buts in politics. Decisions are taken as per prevailing situations”.He was addressing a press conference on the eve of the monsoon session of the Maharashtra legislature.“The BJP and the Shiv Sena are not enemies though there are differences of opinions. An appropriate decision will be taken as per situation,” the former chief minister said.Fadnavis said, “Our friend (read Shiv Sena) contested the 2019 Assembly elections with us. But after polls, they (Sena) joined hands with the very people (NCP and Congress) against whom we contested the polls”.Notably, the Sena and the BJP fell out after the elections over the issue of the chief minister’s post which the Uddhav Thackeray-led party had staked claim to.The Sena later joined hands with the NCP and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with Thackeray as the chief minister.In the same vein, Fadnavis said central investigating agencies are probing various cases in Maharashtra on orders of the high court and there is no political pressure on them.Fadnavis’ statement comes against the backdrop of Sena president and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhdav Thackeray meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi separately during his visit to Delhi last month when he had led a delegation of state ministers.Earlier in the day, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut tried to dismiss “rumours” about his meeting with BJP leader Ashish Shelar on Saturday.“The more such rumours spread, the stronger the MVA alliance will become. We may have political and ideological differences, but if we come face-to-face at public functions, we will cordially greet each other. I have had coffee with Shelar openly,” the Sena’s chief spokesperson had said.Meanwhile, Fadnavis expressed anguish over the suicide of an MPSC aspirant in Pune over the uncertainty of the final interview before he could get a government job.“Due to the apathetic attitude of the MPSC, no members were appointed and examinations and interviews are not being held,” he said and demanded an overhaul of the state public service commission.

04-07-2021||Chandigarh||Centre should not put conditions to resume talks with protesting farmers: Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday said the Centre should not put conditions if it wants to resume talks with the protesting farmers.His remarks come after Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar asserted that the three new central agriculture laws would bring revolutionary changes in the lives of farmers, and made it clear that the government was ready to hold talks with the protesters, except on the demand of the repeal of these laws.“We have said earlier as well that we are ready for talks whenever the government is ready. But why are they making it conditional by saying that they will not take back the farm laws?” Tikait told reporters in Rohtak.He alleged that the central dispensation was working under pressure of the corporates.“.. they (Centre) would have talked (to farmers), but they are being run by the corporates,” he alleged.The farmer leader earlier addressed a ‘Pink dharna’ by women activists in Rohtak in support of the farmers’ stir against the farm laws.In nearby Uchana in Jind district, a mahapanchayat of farmers was also held wherein nine resolutions were passed.Jind BKU leader Azad Palwa told reporters that the mahapanchayat resolved to boycott BJP-JJP supported candidates in the forthcoming panchayat polls in Haryana.He said if the government does not repeal the farm laws, the candidates of BJP and JJP will face boycott in the assembly and parliamentary polls as well.Addressing the ‘Pink-Mahila Kisan Dharna’, Tikait said, “Such a dharna by women activists is possible in Haryana, where women too have been at the forefront of this (farmers) agitation”.He said the ongoing stir has now become a “revolution of ideas”.He added that although the farmers have been protesting against the “black farm laws” for months now, it has not moved the government.“There is an undeclared emergency in the country and the people of this country should rise…” he said.Tikait alleged that if the farm laws are implemented, the farmers will ultimately be forced to do petty jobs as their land “will be snatched” by the big corporates.Meanwhile, Palwa said during the mahapanchayat, that it opposed the Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property During Disturbance to Public Order Bill, 2021.The Bill passed by the state assembly in March allows authorities to recover compensation from violent protesters damaging properties.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader claimed the Bill was aimed to be used by the government against the farmers agitation.The mahapanchayat demanded that the “black farm laws” be rolled back, a law to guarantee crop MSP be framed by the government, government job and Rs 50 lakh compensation be given to next of kin of those farmers who died during the ongoing agitation, all kinds of loans of farmers and farm labourers be waived.Resolutions related to women’s security, power issue and to ensure employment to the youth were also passed at the mahapanchayat.Later talking to reporters in Uchana, Palwa said two prominent leaders—Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala and Hisar BJP MP Brijendra Singh “are not standing in support of the farmers in their fight against the farm laws”.“Through this mahapanchayat, we want to give them the message that they were elected due to the support of farmers and labourers. By the power of the same vote, they can remove these leaders as well,” he said.Palwa further alleged that Chautala, great grandson of former deputy prime minister late Devi Lal who was considered a ‘messiah of farmers’, was not standing with the farmers and clinging to power.“It was Chaudhary Devi Lal who gave up power for farmers’ sake, whereas Dushyant does not care about the farmers as he does not want to give up power,” he said.

04-07-2021||New Delhi||Air India flyer seeks damages over data breach||An Air India flyer has sought damages from the airline after the recent leak of personal data of 4.5 million passengers, including hers and her husband’s.A legal notice was sent to Air India management on Sunday by Ritika Handoo in which she said that the airline informed her about the breach on June 1, her lawyer said.Terming the breach as a violation of her “right to be forgotten and informational autonomy”, she sought a compensation of Rs 30 lakh.Air India’s passenger service system provider SITA faced a sophisticated cyberattack in February this year leading to the leak of personal data of 4.5 million passengers—which included passengers of the national carrier—from across the world, the email sent by the carrier said.“The breach involved personal data registered between August 26, 2011 and February 20, 2021, with details that included name, date of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance and Air India frequent flyer data (but no passwords data were affected) as well as credit cards data.“However, in respect of this last type of data, CVV/CVC numbers are not held by our data processor,” the email said.Handoo, a Delhi-based journalist, in her notice to Air India accused it of “knowingly, intentionally and deliberately leaking the personal data and for breach of sensitive information”.              “Noticees (Air India) are the guilty of leaking the sensitive information and personal data of my client.“My client was shocked and alarmed to learn the recent security lapse of you the Noticees that has led to a massive personal data breach that includes sensitive personal information and personal data thereby, making my client’s personal data open to exploitation,” the notice sent through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey said.Referring to Chapter VII of the Company’s Customer Care Data Privacy Policy, the notice said that it clearly provides that all customers retain control over their data/information to the extent possible so as to change the personal information in your records except in exceptional circumstances where it’s a law and order issue.“Now that my client does not have any control over personal information as the same is stolen, it violates my client’s right to privacy and right to be forgotten as this loss of control over his personal data has led to a loss of my client’s informational autonomy, which is guaranteed as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttuswamy (Retd.) & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors,” the notice said.Data of 4.5 million passengers—which includes Air India’s passengers—across the world has been “affected” due to the cyberattack on SITA, the statement said. SITA is based out of Geneva in Switzerland.“Air India would like to inform its valued customers that its passenger service system provider has informed about a sophisticated cyber-attack it was subjected to in the last week of February 2021,” the airline had said.

04-07-2021||Kolkata||BJP stir to expose nexus between TMC leaders and vaccine scam mastermind: Dilip Ghosh||Stepping up its attack on the ruling TMC over the recent fake vaccination drive here, the BJP on Sunday said it would stick to its plan to take out a protest march to Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) headquarters, despite the police asking the party to call off the programme in view of the Covid-19 situation.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh alleged that the ruling camp was trying to “hush up” the connection between Debanjan Deb, the alleged mastermind of the dubious drive, and a section of TMC leaders and KMC bosses, and his party will organise the demonstration on Monday to expose this “nexus”.The fake vaccines may have endangered lives of many people, he reasoned.“The administration, at the behest of the ruling party, is trying to force the BJP to withdraw its agitation as it does not want the issue to get highlighted. We will organise our protest with limited number of people following all Covid-19 guidelines. We have already informed the Kolkata police about our plan. The police, however, are trying to stop us at the last minute,” Ghosh said.Deb, posing as the joint commissioner of the TMC-run civic body, had set up dubious vaccine camps in the city, which got busted after actor-turned-TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty, who had taken her jab at his Kasba centre, raised an alarm.Sources in the Kolkata police said all gatherings are prohibited under the Disaster Management Act.They also said that the police came to know about the BJP programme from social media, and accordingly informed the party about the restrictions.Last week, student, youth and women’s organisations of the CPI(M) had staged a protest outside the KMC office, seeking immediate action against all those involved in the dubious drive.The agitators were bundled into police vehicles and moved from the protest site, triggering allegations of high-handedness by the TMC administration.

04-07-2021||Lucknow||Opinion of Congress workers & organisation will be important for UP polls: Priyanka||Months ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday urged party workers to stand with the people of the country, and share their pain and grief.Addressing a two-day training programme of party workers of Lucknow and Mathura through video conferencing, the party’s in-charge of the state said, “Congress party workers should stand with the people of the country, and share their pain and grief. For this, the work of building the organisation is most important”. In a statement issued here on Sunday by the UP Congress, Vadra said Congress workers should stage a protest against the BJP government over inflation, unemployment, continuous increase in the price of petrol, diesel and cooking gas.“The anti-people policies of the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state have to be unravelled. People are crying due to inflation, government jobs are falling prey to corruption and the candidates selected for jobs are moving from pillar to post to get appointments,” she said.Vadra also said that opinions voiced by the organisation and that of the workers will be very important for the Assembly elections.The Congress general secretary also laid emphasis on revamping the booths and also remain active on social media.“During the Covid-19 pandemic, the way in which Congress party workers helped the migrant workers, arranged oxygen cylinders, concentrators, medical kits and ration kits, I want to convey my thanks. The Congress always derives unseen power from serving humanity during emergencies. This shows our association with the interest of the public,” she said.“The Congress will never leave people in the lurch, and this is our mantra of inspiration,” Vadra said adding that the party workers should stay firm on the path of ‘seva satyagraha’. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opinion-of-congress-workers-organisation-will-be-important-for-up-polls-priyanka-278175
04-07-2021||Pune||Quota demand: Members of Maratha outfits hold protest in Solapur without police nod||A large number of Maratha quota activists held a protest march without the police permission in Solapur city in Maharashtra on Sunday demanding restoration of the reservation in government jobs and education struck down by the Supreme Court in May this year, on the eve of the monsoon session of the state legislature. At least 3,000 people participated in the ‘Maratha Akrosh Morcha’ led by former MLC Narendra Patil, a senior police officer said and added cases will be registered against the organisers for violating the COVID-19 norms.Heavy security was deployed and several key roads leading to Solapur were barricaded by police to prevent members of the pro-Maratha outfits from reaching their protest venue near the statue of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj in the city. However, despite the heavy security, several protesters managed to reach the venue.The march started from the statue of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and culminated at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a distance of one km, followed by speeches made by leaders.A delegation of members of various Maratha outfits submitted a memorandum of their demands to the district collector.Solapur Police Commissioner Ankush Shinde told reporters that at least 3,000 people participated in the protest march.“We would register cases against the organizers for violating the COVID-19 rules and regulations,” he told PTI.In May this year, the Supreme Court struck down the Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas in admissions and government jobs.Talking to reporters at the protest venue, Patil said the government should not underestimate the power of Marathas.“The Maratha community is known for fighting back adversaries. Marathas are not scared of police’s high-handedness and this was evident during today’s protest march in Solapur,” said Patil.“Before the protest march, I had toured all tehsils in the district and met members of the Maratha community and various outfits. I received a huge response from them for the morcha. There will be a backlash if police try to stop members of the Maratha outfits,” he said.Patil said Maratha outfits will take out similar morchas in other districts of the state, and if denied permission, they will use guerilla tactics and barge into the collectorates.“The state government should not test the patience of the Maratha youth over the quota as they can enter the assembly during the session,” Patil said.The police commissioner said heavy security was deployed in Solapur to prevent any untoward incident.He said the protest march had not been given permission due to the COVID-19 situation.Solapur BJP MP Jaysiddheshwar Shivacharya Mahaswami, local party MLA Ram Satpute and some party leaders also reached the protest venue.Alleging that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government failed to effectively fight the legal battle for the Maratha quota in the top court, the BJP had last month organised ‘chakka jam’ or road blockade protests across Maharashtra. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quota-demand-members-of-maratha-outfits-hold-protest-in-solapur-without-police-nod-278174

After we could cure his lungs, he developed quadriparesis and could not move any limbs.“We treated that condition with the help of a neurologist. Then the patient developed pneumothorax in which air gets filled inside the lungs but he managed to overcome everything,” Awasthi said.Every three to four days, his kids would send him drawings to cheer him up, the doctor said.“He has a two-year-old son and another five-six year-old kid. They were waiting for him to come back home. The patient held his moral fort really well. Around him, people were dying and there was a lot of gloom around him but he is a fighter,” said the doctor.Currently, the patient has regained movement in his upper limbs but his lower limbs are still weak, the doctor said, adding that he can stand on his feet for just a few seconds.“He has a long road to recovery and still has to get back on his feet,” said the doctor.Delhi had been reeling under a brutal second wave of coronavirus with shortage of beds and lack of oxygen adding to the woes of patients.However, cases have started declining with recoveries outnumbering the daily hospital admissions since May 14.

This is highly objectionable as the B in BSP stands for Bahujan, which comprises of SCs, STs, OBCs and religious minorities. Since their numbers are high, they are called Bahujan.”“The C in Congress actually stands for ‘cunning’ party which left Bahujans helpless and made them slaves despite forming governments at the Centre and in states for a long time due to their votes. Eventually, the BSP was formed and at that time the BJP was not in power at the Centre or in the states,” she said.Mayawati alleged that as long as the Congress, the BJP or the Samajwadi Party are in power in Uttar Pradesh, no election can be held in a free and fair manner.When the BSP was in power, all elections, big or small, were held in a free and fair manner, she said.Reacting to Mayawati’s remarks, UP Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh tweeted, “Each and every voter of the state is saying that the BSP is the spokesperson of the BJP and Mayawati should accept this truth.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/c-in-congress-stands-for-cunning-mayawati-278154

It was interpreted as his unhappiness with the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) choice.However, talking to reporters, Dhami said there was no resentment in the party.Some other MLAs such as Bishan Singh Chufal, Yashpal Arya and Subodh Uniyal are also said to be unhappy with the decision to appoint Dhami as the chief minister. Their main grouse is with the party’s preference for youth over experience.Efforts are underway by senior party leaders to assuage the frayed tempers. Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt is said to have met Chufal to persuade him, while BJP in charge of Uttarakhand Dushyant Kumar Gautam is trying to pacify the sulking leaders at state party chief Madan Kaushik’s residence here to ensure that the swearing-in ceremony scheduled at 5 pm at the Raj Bhawan passes off without a hitch.However, former state BJP president Banshidhar Bhagat said there is no resentment anywhere and the party is united behind the high command’s decision. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dhami-meets-satpal-maharaj-efforts-on-to-persuade-sulking-bjp-mlas-in-uttarakhand-278152

04-07-2021||New Delhi||Heatwave claims over 17,000 lives in 50 years in India: Study||Heatwaves have claimed more than 17,000 lives in 50 years in India, according to a paper recently published by the country's top meteorologists.The paper said there were 706 heatwave incidents in the country from 1971-2019.The research paper was authored by M Rajeevan, Secretary of Ministry of Earth Science, along with scientists Kamaljit Ray, S S Ray, R K Giri and A P Dimri, earlier this year. Kamaljit Ray is the lead author of the paper.Heatwave is one of the extreme weather events (EWE). In 50 years (1971-2019) EWE killed 1,41,308 people. Of this, 17,362 people were killed due to heatwave -- a little over 12 per cent of the total deaths recorded, the study said.The maximum heatwave deaths were in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha, it added.Core Heatwave Zone (CHZ) is the most prone area for heatwave (HW) and severe heatwave (SHW) with the highest frequency of occurrence during May.The CHZ covers states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The study assumes significance in the backdrop of recent heat waves in different parts of the northern hemisphere. Earlier this week, an intense heatwave swept through parts of Canada and the US in North America claiming the lives of scores of people. Vancouver recorded a record-breaking temperature of more than 49 degrees Celsius.In India, the north Indian plains and the hills also experienced a heatwave. In the plains, temperatures rose above 40 degrees Celsius in many parts earlier this week.The paper also noted that there is an increase in mortality due to heat waves, extreme weather events, and lightning for vulnerable states.Heatwave over a station is declared only when the actual temperature of the station is 40 degrees Celsius for the plains and 30 degrees Celsius for hilly regions.However, when the maximum temperature is 40 degrees Celsius for coastal stations and 45 degrees Celsius for other stations, conditions are declared as a heatwave.A heat wave is declared when the actual maximum temperature is greater than the normal maximum temperature which is greater than 40 degrees Celsius.In a written response to a question on heatwaves in Lok Sabha in January 2020, Earth Sciences Minister Harsh Vardhan had said the latest studies show an increase in temperatures as well as the occurrence of heatwaves in many parts of the country during the recent years.“One of the reasons for the increase in heat waves is global warming associated with the increase in greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide, methane etc in the atmosphere,” he had said.In 2017, there were 30 instances of a heatwave in the country -- Andhra Pradesh (1), Jharkhand (2), Maharashtra (6),  Odisha (8), Telangana (12), West Bengal (1).The year 2018 recorded 12 instances of heatwave -- Uttar Pradesh (2), Maharashtra (5), Jharkhand (1), Kerala (3), Chattisgarh (1).In 2019, there were 26 incidents of a heatwave in Maharashtra (15), Kerala (6), Bihar (4), Rajasthan (1).Heatwave is also associated with health risks. Four common health impacts resulting from excessive exposure to heatwaves include dehydration, cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke. It is also learnt that there is a sharp rise in the number of cases of acute gastroenteritis and food poisoning due to spoilage of food and reduction of its shelf life owing to high temperatures.There is also a rise in the number of cases of anxiety, palpitations, nervousness and behavioural change linked to extreme temperature rise, Vardhan had said.

I think voters need to play a subtle drop shot on celebs trying to influence their decisions!.”         The BJP on Saturday claimed to have swept the elections to the posts of the district panchayat chief even as the SP alleged that the ruling party “kidnapped” voters and used “force” to stop them from voting.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP of making a mockery of the elections, saying it is strange that while most results in the polls for the district panchayat members were in favour of his party, the BJP gained in the contest for the district panchayat chief.Though the panchayat polls in UP are not held on the party symbol and the state Election Commission did not announce the party affiliation of the winning candidates, the BJP claimed that the candidate backed by it won on 67 of 75 posts, the elections for which were held on Saturday.

Petrol in state capital Gangtok is now priced at Rs 100.15 a litre and diesel comes for Rs 91.55.Petrol has crossed Rs 100 a litre mark in metro cities of Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune and it is over Rs 99 in other two cities of Delhi and Kolkata.Rates of diesel, the most used fuel in the country, have crossed the Rs 100-a-litre mark in Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh in Rajasthan as well in some places in Odisha. And on Sunday, Rewa, Shahdol and Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh saw those levels.The hike on Sunday is the 34th increase in price of petrol and 33rd in case of diesel since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 34 hikes, the price of petrol has risen by Rs 9.11 per litre. Diesel rates have soared by Rs 8.63 a litre in 33 instances of price increase.Oil companies revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15 days, and foreign exchange rates.International oil prices have climbed in recent weeks on optimism of a quick recovery in fuel demand. Brent crude touched the USD 75 per barrel mark, the first time since April 2019.

04-07-2021||Kolkata||Having lost his job, man with a violin winning hearts in Kolkata||Like many others, he lost his job during the lockdown but he took recourse to his artistic capability and impressed film director Raj Chakraborty and the Kolkata Police Commissioner with his violin. The newest Internet sensation Bhagwan Mali, an out-of-work hotel musician, is now hitting the streets and winning hearts in the city.Mali, who originally hails from Gujarat, came to Malda during the Gujarat earthquake. He then moved to Darjeeling and Siliguri and started performing in the tourist hotels there. When the pandemic hit, he lost all his income.Meet Mr. Bhagwan Mali, who is a very talented musician.Few weeks ago, a video of him playing his violin in the city streets, had gone viral on Social Media.Last week, he was financially assisted by our Community Policing Wing. Today, @CPkolkata gifted him a new violin. pic.twitter.com/750lYhZX0x  "During last year's lockdown I lost my job and at around the same time, my daughter, married and settled in Kolkata, was in an advanced stage of pregnancy. I had to move to Kolkata to take care of my daughter and because of the lockdown, I couldn't leave the city. Ever since my daughter delivered a baby, my wife and I have been living on the street as the one room in which our daughter and son-in-law live doesn't have enough space for us," Mali said.It was then that he started to play music to make ends meet. The local police in the Burotolla area of the city has provided him with a place to stay for now."Mali told us that he began performing on the streets to arrange food for himself and his wife. Whatever extra that he saved was spent in buying baby food and fruit for the baby and the mother. However, disaster struck yet again and Mali's violin got damaged a couple of weeks ago," a police officer of Burotolla police station said. That was when Burotolla police -- and later the community policing wing -- decided to step in.Kolkata Police Commissioner Somen Mitra was so impressed with Mali that he gifted him a violin on Monday under the community policing scheme."Met Mr Bhagwan Mali, who is a very talented musician. A few weeks ago, a video of him playing his violin in the city streets had gone viral on social media. Last week, he was financially assisted by our Community Policing Wing. Today, @/CPkolkata gifted him a new violin," he said.Director Raj Chakraborty, who is also the Trinamool Congress MLA from Barrackpore, first noticed Mali playing his violin on June 21 at Beadon Street and Girish Park crossing. Impressed with his music Chakraborty got in touch with the local MLA and minister Sashi Panja and arranged for his food and medicine.A video that has gone viral on the Internet shows Chakraborty speaking to Mali and offering him an opportunity in his film. Chakraborty also plans to give Mali a chance to perform in his forthcoming music reality show.Mali, who has so far refused any financial help stating that he will only accept money after performing, has also been provided with a roof over his head at Burotolla by the police."We have arranged some performances for him at some of the leading hotels and restaurant chains in the city. He has been performing for the past one week," said a senior officer of Kolkata Police.If you walk through the crossing of Beadon Street and Girish Park, you also might hear the magic melodies 'Diwana Hua Baadal' by Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi from the 1964 movie 'Kashmir ki Kali' and Lata Mangeshkar's 'Ajeeb dastan hai yeh' from the 1960 movie 'Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai' floating on the empty streets of North Kolkata.This octogenarian man who sits on the pavement with his violin to arrange food for his granddaughter will surely make everyone forget the harshest realities with his magic melodies.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/having-lost-his-job-man-with-a-violin-winning-hearts-in-kolkata-278097

Sharma also received money through “benami bank accounts” with a purpose of concealing his involvement in criminal activities, it added.The ED case is based on a Delhi Police FIR filed under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) and various sections of the IPC against Sharma last year, after which he was arrested by the special cell on September 14, 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-arrests-journalist-in-money-laundering-case-277879

Brazil overtook India as the lead contributor of weekly new Covid cases.The highest number of new cases was reported from Brazil (5,21,298 new cases; a 3 per cent increase over the past week), India (3,51,218; a 12 per cent increase), Colombia (2,04,132 new cases; 5 per cent increase), the Russian Federation (1,34, 465; a 24 per cent increase), and Argentina (1,31,824 new cases; an 11 per cent decrease).More than 57,000 deaths were reported in the past week, a 10 per cent decrease as compared to the previous week. Globally, Covid-19 incidence remains very high with an average of over 3,70,000 cases reported each day over the past week. The cumulative number of cases reported globally now exceeds 180 million and the number of deaths is almost 4 million.Although at the global level, trends in cases and deaths have been declining over the recent weeks, the world body said that well into the second year of the pandemic, “the global situation remains highly fragile”. “There is significant variation by region, by country and within countries. In all WHO regions, there are countries reporting sharp increases in cases and hospitalisations. Over the past 18 months, substantial progress has been made towards ending the acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the combination ofmore transmissible variants, increasing social mixing and sub-optimal vaccination coverage will delay the end of the pandemic,” warned the WHO.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-global-situation-highly-fragile-277857

CongressThe media report cited the financial crimes branch of the French public prosecution services, the PNF, as having confirmed the move yesterday in France. The investigation was focussed on alleged crimes of corruption, influence peddling, money laundering, favouritism and undue tax waivers surrounding the deal, the report said.Bid to weaken India: BJP"The way Rahul Gandhi is behaving, it will not be an exaggeration to say he is being used as a pawn by rival companies.

Bharat Biotech today announced safety and efficacy analysis data from Phase 3 clinical trials of Covaxin, a whole virion inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV2, developed in partnership with the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune.Announcing the summary of trials, Bharat Biotech said the vaccine significantly cut hospitalisation and showed potential to limit infection and transmission.The analysis demonstrated Covaxin to be 77.8 per cent effective against symptomatic Covid-19, through evaluation of 130 confirmed cases, with 24 observed in the vaccine group versus 106 in the placebo group. The efficacy was 93.4 per cent in severe symptomatic cases. Safety analysis demonstrated that adverse events were similar to placebo with 12 per cent of subjects experiencing commonly known side-effects and less than 0.5 per cent feeling serious adverse events.“Covaxin demonstrated 63.6 per cent protection against asymptomatic Covid-19 and 65.2 per cent against the SARS-CoV-2, B.1.617.2 Delta variant,” Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella said. “Covaxin was well tolerated and the Data Safety Monitoring Board has not reported any safety concern related to the vaccine. The overall rate of adverse events observed was lower than that seen in other Covid-19 vaccines. The safety profile of Covaxin is now well established, based on inactivated vaccines technology,” a company statement said.Importantly, no licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has so far reported efficacy against asymptomatic infection in a randomised controlled trial. Covaxin is the first to do so.ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said, “Covaxin works well against all variant strains of SARS-CoV-2. The successful development of Covaxin has consolidated the position of Indian academia and Industry in the global arena.”Bharat Biotech is undertaking additional clinical trials to establish Covaxin safety and efficacy for children aged 2 to 18 years. A trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose is also in process.Performance cardGathering norms eased in HimachalShimla: The Himachal Government has announced more relaxations in restrictions following decline in the positivity rate to 1.3 per cent.

04-07-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court had ruled out corruption, given clean chit in 2018||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 3The Congress may be feeling vindicated at the appointment of a French judge to lead a judicial investigation into alleged “corruption and favouritism” in the Rafale jet deal with India, but the Supreme Court has already put the controversy to rest.In its December 14, 2018 verdict, a three-judge Bench led by the then-CJI Ranjan Gogoi had dismissed a petition seeking probe into India-France deal for procurement of 36 jets, holding there was no commercial favouritism and occasion to “really doubt the decision making process” warranting setting aside of the contract. On November 14, 2019, it had dismissed petitions seeking review of its verdict, saying they were without any merit.Alleging irregularities in the deal, petitioners Arun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha, Prashant Bhushan and others had demanded registration of an FIR and a court-monitored probe into it.However, the Bench, which also included Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice KM Joseph, gave a clean chit to the deal on all three contentious issues--decision-making process, comparative pricing and the choice of Indian offset partners (IOP), saying, "We find no reason for any intervention by this court on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircraft by the Indian Government."On decision-making process, it had concluded, "We are satisfied that there is no occasion to really doubt the process, and even if minor deviations have occurred, that would not result in either setting aside the contract or requiring a detailed scrutiny by the Court." On comparative pricing, the top court had said, "It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present. We say no more as the material has to be kept in a confidential domain."On offset partner, it had said, "We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian Government, as the option to choose the IOP does not rest with the Indian Government."The Congress has been demanding a probe by a joint parliamentary committee into the deal. However, the top court had said, "Perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters."The Bench, which had summoned four top IAF officers during the hearing to explain various aspects of the deal, had said empowerment of defence forces with adequate technology and material support was a "matter of vital importance". The process of acquisition had started in 2001 and India was to purchase 126 twin-engine Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) but the contract negotiations reached a stalemate and Request for Proposal (RFP) compliance was finally withdrawn in June 2015. During the protracted process India's adversaries modernised their combat capabilities, the Government contended.It was in this background that India signed an agreement with France in September 2016 for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft in a fly-away condition as part of the upgrading process of the Indian Air Force equipment.

With this, 67 of the 75 candidates backed by the saffron party and its ally Apna Dal won, including in the prestigious Gorakhpur and Varanasi.Main rival in UP, the Samajwadi Party, could manage only five, RLD one and others two.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called it an indication of the people’s confidence in ‘sushashan’ of the ruling BJP.Congratulating winners, Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya tweeted saying “kaho dil se, 2022 pe bhajapa phir se”. Incidentally, “kaho dil se, Akhilesh phir se” is also a slogan of SP.Crying foul, Akhilesh Yadav charged the BJP with “making a mockery of the elections”, alleging that the party “kidnapped” voters and used “force” with the “help of police and administration to stop them from voting”. “The BJP made a mockery of all democratic norms, something not seen earlier,” he claimed. Hitting back, BJP leaders said Yadav was trying to get out of owning defeat by blaming them.Political analyst Sudhir Panwar, who is also associated with the SP, said “BJP’s massive victory is in confrontation with people’s mandate in panchayat elections in April. The rural electorate is feeling cheated and is determined to teach the BJP a lesson in Assembly polls, next year”.The rural body polls had become a prestige issue for the ruling BJP.The elections were primarily a contest between the BJP and the SP and its ally RLD. The Mayawati-led BSP boycotted the elections, citing misuse of official machinery and the Congress lost the only seat it contested in Rae Bareli, the bastion of the Gandhi family.Given that these elections are not fought on party symbols but political affiliations, as many as 747 SP members were elected in the elections held in April, followed by 690 of the BJP and 381 of the BSP.The BJP was under severe criticism over the “mishandling of the Covid pandemic” and results were seen as a reflection on the governance of CM Adityanath. Though, according to the BJP, all Independent candidates were its members and therefore it won 981 seats.Soon after the results in May, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy made an interesting extrapolation of panchayat results on the Assembly constituencies’ map, claiming that the SP had won 243 Assembly seats, the BJP 67 and others 47.According to Swamy, 46 of 403 Assembly seats in the state were “purely urban” and therefore, panchayat polls covered 357 rural Assembly seats. Swamy said out of 357 seats, “SP wins 243 and BJP wins 67 and the rest 47. If I have it wrong, correct me”.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi credited CM Yogi Adityanath's policies for the party's “historic victory” in the local body polls.“The glorious victory of BJP in the UP zila panchayat elections is the blessings of the people for development, public service and rule of law. The credit for this goes to the policies of Chief Minister Yogi ji and the tireless work of the party workers.

Media reports said only a small number of the 27 member states have announced the acceptance.In response to concerns that people from the UK may be denied entry when traveling to the EU, Keersmaecker said the European Commission is working to solve the problem.“In order to assure a coordinated approach here, the Commission is obviously in contact in discussion with the member states to go through these different vaccines and to see which is the best coordinated approach,” said the spokesman.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covishield-vaccine-jab-receivers-may-be-denied-entry-to-eu-277728
04-07-2021||New Delhi||Congress, BJP trade allegations over Rafale deal as France opens judicial probe||Opposition Congress traded allegations with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party—a development that comes as France opens a judicial investigation into the controversial Rafale jet deal. The deal has been dogging the ruling BJP-led central government ever since a controversy over the deal for 36 jets erupted soon after India inked a deal with France in 2016.The Congress claimed on Saturday that France's action of opening investigations into the deal is a vindication of allegations of a "shady" dealing in the inter-governmental deal between India and France on April 10, 2015, for off-the-shelf purchase of 36 Rafale jets. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala addressed a press conference to demand that the French prosecution agency's action of opening an investigation into the deal for “prima facie corruption” should be enough for a joint parliamentary committee probe. “If the French prosecutors can investigate the deal along with the role of former French President Francois Hollande and incumbent French president Emmanuel Macron, why should we in India, where the deal originated, not have a JPC probe?”Asked whether the Congress would move the courts with its demand, Surjewala said the Supreme Court while previously hearing the Rafale matter had said: “It had no jurisdiction to question the PM, the defence minister or the defence ministry officials in the matter”.“That’s the reason the Congress never went to the SC with this case that involves national security, exchequer money and defence procurement propriety. We have always sought a JPC probe because the JPC can summon all the documents related to the deal, can also question the PM with powers of a civil court,” said Surjewala.To a question on the SC having given a clean chit to the deal and whether the Congress should have waited a while before the French prosecutors delved deeper into the matter, Surjewala reiterated that the apex court had cited lack of jurisdiction in the matter and that with the French prosecutors already  probing the deal it was “imperative for the PM to constitute a JPC.”Claiming that the stand of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had been vindicated, Surjewala said the decision of the French prosecution agency to investigate the deal had “unmasked the role of the NDA government and its sweetheart deals here.”“The developments expose the role of the government. Anil Ambani’s Reliance is also under question now. We all know the French government had said it had no role in choosing Reliance, the Indian partner of Dassault,” alleged Surjewala.The Congress questioned the role of Dassault Reliance Aerospace in which Reliance had 51 per cent and Dassault had 49 per cent stake and yet of the169 mn euros investment cap, Dassault brought in 159 mn euro and Reliance 10 mn euro.Surjewala recalled the March 25, 2015 statement of Dassault chief executive officer Eric Trappier who had said that Dassault and HAL agreement (for technology transfer) was on track.“A day later we hear Dassault had entered into an agreement with Reliance and on April 10, 2015 PM Modi goes to France and signs the deal for off the shelf purchase of 36 Rafales for 7.8 billion dollar, much higher than what the Congress led UPA had negotiated along with technology transfer to HAL,” said Surjewala.The Congress further questioned the September 2016 government decision to drop the anti-corruption clause of the defence procurement policy wondering why the clause was compromised despite the defence ministry officials stressing its importance.“There are serious question marks on the deal. A JPC is in order,” the Congress said.The BJP countered the allegations to accuse Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of "being used as a pawn by other competitive bidders” to sell their products to India.The party also accused Gandhi and his party of raking up allegations of corruption in the Rafale deal in an attempt to “weaken” India.Downplaying the appointment of a judge in France to lead a judicial investigation into the alleged corruption and favouritism in the Rs 59,000 crore Rafale deal BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told media at a press briefing that the development was the outcome of a complaint by an NGO and should not be seen as a matter of corruption.This is akin to a competent authority in India writing down in a file that “please act accordingly” when a matter is brought before him, Patra said and charged the Congress of spreading “lies and misconceptions” over the issue and said Gandhi and his party has become “synonymous” of the two negative terms.“The way Rahul Gandhi is behaving, it will not be an exaggeration to say that he is being used as a pawn by competing companies. He has been lying right from the beginning on the issue. Probably, he is acting as an agent or some member of Gandhi family has been for a competing company,” Patra alleged.The Congress has demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the Rafale deal, saying it is the only way forward to find the truth about “corruption” in the purchase of the fighter jets.Defending the government, Patra also cited a Supreme Court (SC) verdict and a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, both of which had found nothing wrong was committed in the deal between the Indian and French governments.The government won a judicial verdict as well as 2019 Lok Sabha elections with improved numbers in the Lower House at a time when the Congress made the allegations of corruption in the Rafale deal as a key poll plank in its campaign.The BJP spokesperson also cited a number of allegations leveled by Gandhi, including his attributions to former French president Francois Hollande and incumbent Emmanuel Macron to back his charge of corruption against the government, and noted that both French leaders had immediately denied making such comments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-bjp-trade-allegations-over-rafale-deal-as-france-opens-judicial-probe-277718
04-07-2021||New Delhi||BJP has thrown Uttarakhand into political instability, betrayed people: Congress||The Congress on Saturday hit out at the BJP leadership, saying instead of ushering in development, it has thrown Uttarakhand into political instability and betrayed its people by repeatedly changing chief ministers.BJP leader Tirath Singh Rawat resigned as the state's chief minister on Friday after holding the post for less than four months. He had replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat in March.The BJP has insulted the 'devbhoomi' of Uttarakhand, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and its president JP Nadda are responsible for the current situation, the Congress alleged.Starting with Nityananad Swami, the BJP will have eight chief ministers in the state, senior Congress leader Harish Rawat said and added that in the latest four and a half years of the BJP's rule in Uttarakhand, there will be three chief ministers.The Congress condemns the BJP for insulting the state and its people by not doing anything to address its problems, he said."The BJP's high drama in Dehradun is an insult to the people of Uttarakhand. The Prime Minister had promised to give a double-engine government, but the state only received different chief ministers and no development," Harish Rawat, a former chief minister, said."The BJP has not solved the problems of Uttarakhand and has added to the rising unemployment in the state," he told reporters.It has "insulted the 'devbhoomi' (land of Gods) of Uttarakhand and the Congress condemns the BJP for giving political instability,” Harish Rawat said.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the BJP had betrayed the people and Modi and Nadda were responsible for this."This is BJP's example of lust for power, political instability, sharing fruits of power and failure of leadership. Instead of serving the people of Uttarakhand, they tried to distribute power, and Modi and JP Nadda are responsible for this. The BJP has brought Uttarakhand to such a turn where power means only sharing its fruits and nothing else," he alleged.Surjewala said in 2017, the people of Uttarakhand elected the BJP, but in five years instead of serving them and ushering in development, the BJP only "looted its resources".

04-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||Pushkar Singh Dhami to be new Chief Minister of Uttarakhand||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 3Two-time Khatima MLA Pushkar Singh Dhami (45) will be the new Chief Minister of Uttarakhand. The young BJP leader has on his shoulders the huge responsibility of steering a faction-ridden state unit to victory in the upcoming Assembly elections a few months from now in 2022. He will take oath as Chief Minister on Sunday.Also read: Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat resigns to avoid ‘constitutional crisis’BJP has thrown Uttarakhand into political instability, betrayed people: CongressDhami’s name was proposed at the Legislature Party meeting in Dehradun a day after Garhwal MP Tirath Singh handed over his resignation as the Chief Minister to Governor Baby Rani Maurya to avoid “constitutional crisis”.Speaking to the media after the announcement, Dhami said he would work towards taking the Centre’s schemes to the grass-roots level and try to win people’s hearts by serving them as the ‘pratham sewak’ of the state. He also said that he would try to “turn the challenge of 2022 Assembly elections into an opportunity” for his party.Dhami represents the Khatima constituency in Udham Singh Nagar district, the region known as ‘terai’ and dominated by farmers, largely belonging to the Sikh community, and the center-stage of protests against the three Central farm laws.Interestingly, he is only the second BJP Chief Minister from the Kumaon region. So far, the post has been dominated mostly by leaders from the Garhwal region, specifically Pauri.A ‘Thakur’ by caste, Dhami is believed to be close to former CM and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. He served as the Officer on Special Duty to Koshyari when he was the Chief Minister.Originally from the RSS/ABVP roots, Dhami held the post of the president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, BJP’s youth wing. He is also said to be close to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.Observers see his anointment as a message to the old guard in the state—Satpal Maharaj, Dhan Singh Rawat and Harak Singh Rawat.The youngest BJP Chief Minister has never held a ministerial position in the state Cabinet but is said to enjoy a strong sway among the youth.Dhami will be the third BJP Chief Minister during this regime of the party after Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat. He has the huge responsibility of steering the BJP to victory in the Assembly polls next year. Sources say his name was decided by the Central leadership and that his election in the legislature party meeting was merely a formality.The development comes amid reports of “deep divisions” in various factions.The buzz also is that the BJP feared landing in a bigger bind if Tirath Singh had lost the elections given the current situation in the state. The party was also worried over the fate of the Lok Sabha seat which Tirath Singh would have had to vacate to contest the Assembly elections, Gangotri or Haldwani.This is possibly the reason why the leadership went in for a change, selecting someone who already is an MLA. According to sources, neither Tirath Singh nor the Uttarakhand Government petitioned the Election Commission of India to hold by-elections to allow him to become a Member of the Uttarakhand Assembly before the due dateNotably, Tirath Singh, who took charge of Uttrakhand in March following “allegations of corruption and discontent” against then- Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat, had not resigned from the Garhwal Lok Sabha seat he was elected to in 2019.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pushkar-singh-dhami-to-be-new-chief-minister-of-uttarakhand-277686
