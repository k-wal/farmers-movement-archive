28-07-2021||Guwahati/Kohima||'Bhut Jolokia' chilli now heads to London||"Bhut/"Bhoot Jolokia", one of the hottest chillis in the world, was on Wednesday exported, for the first time, from Guwahati to London.Similar to "Naga jolokia", "Raja Mirchi", "Naga Morich" and "King chilli", grown in Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur, it was declared the hottest chilli pepper in the world by Guinness World Records in 2007.Airports Authority of India officials said the chilli was formally exported to London from the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport in Guwahati via an Air India flight.AAIs Regional Executive Director Ravi Kant said that this occasion is special, because "Bhut Jolokia", which has been conferred a GI tag for being the unique product of the northeast India, is getting exported from this region."We are very much enthusiastic that the cargo export potential from the airports in the northeast region would grow benefiting the local food producing organisations, specially the farmers.

28-07-2021||---||SC seeks to enforce time limit for arguments||New Delhi, July 28Faced with protracted arguments and written submissions running into hundreds of pages, the Supreme Court has sought to streamline the process by prescribing limits as to time and number of pages.“I’m left wondering how do we dispose of an appeal pending for 10 years? How do we justify to a litigant that while suits that began 85 years ago are pending? Some of the current matters are given priority and they go on for hours,” a Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said.While dealing with a case relating to revocation of senior designation of Gujarat High Court Bar leader Yatin Oza, the Bench asked lawyers to stick to time limits and refrain from filing voluminous written submissions with a larger number of verdicts cited.“Short synopsis to be filed in not more than three pages each, and not more than one judgement cited per proposition,” the top court said fixing the hearing schedule.It also fixed time limits for advocates for various parties to make their oral submissions.Frowning upon the practice of arguments running into hours, the Bench wondered if there was any country which allowed such practice. It said the synopsis had to be filed in advance and the lawyers confined themselves to their respective synopsis.“I would like to be enlightened, I have searched for it and I haven’t been able to find out what the structure is in different countries. Even in England I haven’t been able to find where such arguments can go on for ours. I would like to know if any system permits this,” Justice Kaul said.Maintaining that arguments should be finished within the given time, it warned that the case will be adjourned for a longer date, as that was the only way to enforce discipline with regard to time frame.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-to-enforce-time-limit-for-arguments-289583

In September last year, the Rafale aircraft were inducted into the 17 “Golden Arrows” Squadron.Addressing the personnel at the air force station, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said the induction of the Rafale jets at Hasimara was carefully planned, keeping in mind the importance of strengthening the IAF’s capability in the eastern sector.India and China have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year. In the northeast, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh share borders with China.The induction event included a fly-past heralding the arrival of the Rafale aircraft at Hasimara, followed by a traditional water-cannon salute, according to a statement issued by the IAF.India has so far received 26 of the 36 Rafale aircraft it has ordered from French firm Dassault Aviation, Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt informed the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.In his speech at Hasimara, the IAF chief recalled the glorious history of the 101 Squadron, which earned it the title of “Falcons of Chamb and Akhnoor”.“CAS urged the personnel to combine their zeal and commitment with the unmatched potential of the newly-inducted platform (Rafale),” the IAF said.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said he has no doubt that the squadron would dominate whenever and wherever required, and ensure that the adversary would always be intimidated by its sheer presence.“The IAF formally inducted Rafale aircraft into No. 101 Squadron at Air Force Station Hasimara in Eastern Air Command on July 28,” the statement said.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria presided over the induction ceremony. On arrival, he was received by Air Marshal Amit Dev, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Air Command.The multi-role Rafale jets, built by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, are known for air superiority and precision strikes.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, 2020, nearly four years after the country signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore.The Rafale jets are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The Rafale aircraft are capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor, a beyond visual range air-to-air missile, and the Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.

28-07-2021||New Delhi||SC reunites spouses involved in bitter legal fight for last 21 years||The Supreme Court Wednesday went an extra-mile in reuniting an Andhra Pradesh-based estranged couple involved in a bitter legal battle for last 21 years with a history of failed mediations by making the wife to agree to withdraw her plea seeking enhancement of jail term for her husband in a dowry harassment case.Chief Justice N V Ramana, heading the bench which also comprised Justice Surya Kant, took the special efforts by seeking the presence of feuding spouses for an interaction before it through video conferencing.As the woman was not comfortable in speaking English, the official language of the apex court, the CJI conversed in Telugu and also explained her statements to fellow judge.“If your husband goes to jail you will lose the monthly compensation as he will lose his job,” the CJI told the woman who has moved the top court for enhancement of jail term for her husband.Lawyer D Ramakrishna Reddy, appearing for the husband, a state government employee at Guntur district in the state, said the CJI explained the legal situation to the woman in Telugu making it clear that the enhancement of the jail term was not going to help either of the spouses.“If we enhance the jail term what benefit you will get ... you may have to forego the monthly compensation,” Reddy said quoting the CJI.The woman heard CJI’s advice patiently and instantly agreed to live with her spouse provided she and their only son are maintained properly by her husband.The top court then asked both the spouses to file separate affidavits in two weeks giving the undertaking that they want to live together.The wife has undertaken to withdraw her appeal against the high court verdict by filing an application to compound the dowry harassment case against her husband who, in turn, will be withdrawing his plea seeking grant of divorce decree from a trial court in Andhra Pradesh. The offence of dowry harassment under section 498A of the IPC is a compoundable offence in Andhra Pradesh only and in rest of India, parties cannot settle such cases on their own.The top court was hearing the appeal of the woman against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order by which though the conviction of her husband was upheld, but the jail term of one year, awarded by courts below, was reduced to the period undergone in prison by him.Prior to this, the trial court, in 2002, had convicted the husband under section 498A (dowry harassment) under the IPC and had awarded a jail term of one year besides imposing a fine. It however had acquitted her mother-in-law and the sister-in-law of same charge.The  appeal of the husband against the judgement was rejected by the revision court.Against this, a plea was moved in the high court which upheld the conviction while reducing the one year jail term to the period undergone by him in prison earlier. The wife wanted enhancement of the jail term.The couple had got married in 1998 and their relationship soured leading to filing of the criminal case by the woman in 2001. The litigation saw failing of several mediation bids at the instance of courts.

28-07-2021||---||China bristles at mention of democracy during Blinken visit to India||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 28Blinken's India visit figured during the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s briefing with its spokesperson Zhao Lijian stating “there are various ways to achieve democracy rather than a fixed formula or a standard answer”.Zhao was asked by a western media agency that Blinken seemed to be raising concerns about China when he called on the world’s two leading democracies to stand together in support of democratic ideals.“One-man, one-vote and a multi-party system is not the sole form of democracy. Democracy should not be used as a label or tool to belittle or smear other countries or stoke confrontations. Which country is a democracy and which is an autocracy should not be determined by a very small number of countries,” he said. “I would like to point out that, the key yardstick to measure a political system lies in whether it suits the national conditions of a country, whether it brings about political stability, social progress and betterment of people’s livelihood, whether it is supported by its own people, and whether it makes contribution to the cause of human progress.’’In a comprehensive reply, Zhao asked several provocative questions about the deficiencies in the democratic makeup of many nations. Zhao said some self-proclaimed democracies are deeply troubled at home by wealth disparity, social division, racial divide and political polarisation.“Is that what their so-called democracy looks like? In some countries, it’s “no money, no vote” and partisan interests above public interests. Is that democratic politics or money politics? Some countries blatantly meddle in other countries' domestic affairs, shift blames, and suppress and contain other countries’ development. Is this what a so-called democracy is all about?” he asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-bristles-at-mention-of-democracy-during-blinken-visit-to-india-289571
28-07-2021||New Delhi||Farmers discuss Contract Farming Act on Day 5 of Kisan Sansad||The fifth day of the Kisan Sansad that is running parallel to the Monsoon session of Parliament saw farmers deliberating on the Contract Farming Act, 2020, according to a statement by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Wednesday.Saying that the act was brought in by the government in “an undemocratic and unconstitutional manner” last year, the umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions said, “This is a legal framework to facilitate corporate farming and resource grabbing.”There were a total of three Kisan Sansad sessions held through the day that were moderated by farmer leaders from different states.Among the major topics of discussion were threat to food security and environmental degradation caused by contract farming.“Several members shared their personal experiences of contract farming like rejection of produce by companies under one garb or the other after an entire season’s toil by the farmer.“They talked about how the central law is about facilitating corporate farming and resource-grabbing. The potential threat to food security from contract farming was highlighted, in addition to environmental degradation,” the SKM said.It added that the debate on the Contract Farming Act would continue the following day.The Kisan Sansad is part of the latest strategy of the farmers who have been protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws at multiple Delhi borders since November last year.The farmers have expressed fear over the laws eliminating the Minimum Support Price system, and leaving them at the mercy of the big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.As part of these Kisan Sansad sessions, 200 farmers from the protest sites participate in a mock Parliament session at Jantar Mantar during which issues concerning the farming community are discussed.The SKM also expressed its concerns over the Indian Marine Fisheries Bill, 2021 that is listed for tabling in Parliament in the current session.“Fisher unions are pointing out how the Bill facilitates the takeover of ocean’s fishing resources by corporates, and envisages a registration and licensing process extremely difficult for traditional fishing communities and impinges on their fundamental right to life and livelihood,” the SKM said.It added that the drafting of the Bill has been “non-participatory”, and “no traditional fishers were consulted or included in the process”.Hailing the farmers’ perseverance to continue their fight through the rains, the farm union body said that the protesters have been agitating at the Delhi borders as well as at Jantar Mantar “cheerfully and without complaints”.However, it added, uneven and inadequate showers at the onset of monsoon this year had led to “significant deficit sowing in several states in the country”, and claimed that farmers hadn’t received any aid from the government authorities.

28-07-2021||New Delhi||Cloudburst a local event, occurs mostly in hilly areas which makes it difficult to predict: Experts||With Himachal Pradesh and Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh being hit by cloudbursts, experts on Wednesday said predicting this disaster is difficult as it is mostly a localised event and occurs in the hilly areas.If 10 centimetres rainfall is received at a station in one hour, the rain event is termed as cloudburst. This sudden discharge of large amount of water not only leads to human casualties but also loss of property.India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said cloudburst is a very small-scale event and mostly occurs over hilly areas in the Himalayas or in the western ghats.He said when warm monsoon winds interact with cold winds, it leads to formation of huge clouds, which is also due to the topography or orographic factors.Mahesh Palawat, Vice President (Meteorology and Climate Change) with Skymet Weather, said such clouds are called cumulonimbus and can stretch to even 13-14 kilometers in height.If they are trapped over a region or there is a no air movement for them to disperse, they discharge over a specific area.According to an explainer by the IMD on its website, "It is very difficult to predict cloudbursts due to its very small scale in space and time. To monitor or nowcast (forecasting few hours lead time) the cloudburst, we need to have dense radar network over the cloudburst-prone areas or one need to have a very high resolution weather forecasting models to resolve the scale of cloudburst." "Cloudbursts do occur at plains, however, mountainous regions are more prone to cloud bursts due to orography." This month, cloudburst events were recorded in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh ---- all hilly areas.Mohapatra said, "Cloudbursts cannot be predicted. But we do give alerts of very heavy rainfall. Incase of Himachal Pradesh, we had given a red (colour-coded alert)." M Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, said the incidents of cloudburst seem to be rising.Although, it is difficult to forecast cloudbursts, doppler radars can be very helpful in predicting them. Nowcasts can be given three hours prior to the event, he pointed out.But not every place may have a radar, especially the Himalayan region.According to a written response by Earth Sciences minister, Jitendra Singh in Lok Sabha on July 23, the Himalayan region has seven doppler radars --- two in Jammu and Kashmir (Sonmarg and Srinagar), one each in Uttarakhand (Kufri), Mukteshwar (Uttarakhand), Mohanbari (Assam), Meghalaya (Sohri) and Tripura (Agartala).Singh said two sites for installation of two Doppler Weather Radars (DWR) in Himachal Pradesh have been identified for which no objection certificate (NOC) is awaited from the state government. Completion of the project for installation of DWRs is expected by December 2022.Civil work for Radar Tower at Surkanda Devi, Uttarakhand is in progress for a X-Band Polarimetric DWR installation. The site for installation of another XB and Polarimetric DWR in Uttarakhand has been identified at Lansdowne. Installation of these DWRs is expected by December 2022.Senior meteorologist Kamaljit Ray, currently posted at the Ministry of Earth Sciences, said many cloudburst events also go unnoticed as not every place where the event occurs may have Automatic Weather Station to record the rainfall, especially the hilly areas. More importantly, the duration of the event is very short.Ray, who co-authored a paper along with Rajeevan and other meteorologists on deaths due to extreme weather events from 1971-2019, said cloudbursts are also not normal weather events as it leads to loss of lives and damage to the property. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cloudburst-a-local-event-occurs-mostly-in-hilly-areas-which-makes-it-difficult-to-predict-experts-289555

28-07-2021||New Delhi||Govt asks states/UTs to conduct state-specific serosurveys in consultation with ICMR||The Centre has advised all states and Union territories to conduct seroprevalence surveys in consultation with the ICMR to generate district-level data on seroprevalence, which is essential in formulating localised public health response measures.This was stated in a letter written by Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan to additional chief secretaries/principal secretaries/secretaries (Health) of all states/UTs, a statement by the Union health ministry said.The ministry also shared findings of the recent national serosurvey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) across 70 districts of the country, according to which the seroprevalence was found to be 79 per cent among the surveyed population in Madhya Pradesh, 58 per cent in Maharashtra, 44.4 per cent in Kerala, 76.2 per cent in Rajasthan, 75.9 per cent in Bihar.It was 75.3 per cent in Gujarat, 71.0 per cent in Uttar Pradesh, 69.8 per cent in Karnataka, 69.2 in Tamil Nadu, 68.1 per cent in Odisha, 66.5 in Punjab, 63.1 in Telangana, 50.3 in Assam and 60.9 in West Bengal.Referring to the findings of the fourth round of the national seroprevalence survey done by ICMR, the ministry has advised states/UTs to conduct the seroprevalence studies in their own regions in consultation with the ICMR, so that such studies follow a standardised protocol, and the findings can then be utilised by the respective state and UT to guide objective, transparent and evidence-based public health response to Covid-19."The national serosurvey by ICMR was designed to capture the extent of the spread of Covid infection at the national level. Therefore, the national serosurvey results do not reflect the heterogeneity of seroprevalence between districts and even between states," the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-asks-states-uts-to-conduct-state-specific-serosurveys-in-consultation-with-icmr-289543

28-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt's stand on plea claiming new Excise Policy seeks to reduce age of drinking liquor||The Delhi High Court Wednesday sought response of the Delhi government on a plea challenging a provision in the new Excise Policy, claiming that it seeks to reduce the age of consumption of liquor from 25 to 21.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Jyoti Singh issued notice and asked the Delhi government to file reply to the petition which has also sought to quash a provision in the new Excise Policy that there shall be no government-owned liquor vends and only privately-owned vends will be available for selling alcohol.The court listed the plea for further hearing on September 17.The plea by NGO All India Bhrashtachar Virodhi Morcha said there is an opinion among a lot of people that reducing the age of consumption of liquor will increase alcoholism amongst students and younger generation of the society, leading to other consequent problems and the decision to close government vends is not in public interest.The plea said the new policy states that "the age of selling or serving liquor should be in consonance with that of the neighbouring states".Advocate Vijay Sharma, representing the NGO, claimed that the Delhi government is effectively seeking to reduce the minimum age of consumption of liquor from 25 to 21 years, as is the case in neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh.Presently, the minimum age of consumption of liquor in Delhi is 25 years, while it is 25 and 21 in neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh respectively.The petitioner said Article 47 of the Constitution states that the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of consumption of intoxicating drinks, except for medicinal purposes, which are injurious to health.It said the consumers of liquor will also be affected as they are assured about the quality of alcohol when they purchase it from the government vends and this assurance would not be there in case of private vends.Several petitions have been filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 alleging that it was illegal, unfair, arbitrary and violative of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009.The petitioners have also sought to quash the June 28 e-tender notice of Delhi government, prescribing the procedure to be followed for inviting zone wise electronic bids for grant of 32 zonal licences of retail vends of liquor for supply of Indian and foreign liquor brands in the national capital.Delhi government has stated that its new Excise Policy 2021-22 aimed at minimising corruption and providing fair competition in liquor trade and that all apprehensions against it were only fanciful.The AAP government has said that there was full-scale assault on it on the issue and that a reply would be filed to make its stand clear. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-delhi-govts-stand-on-plea-claiming-new-excise-policy-seeks-to-reduce-age-of-drinking-liquor-289533

What is wrong in having the photos of the PM given that the Centre is providing free ration to people? Similarly, a ration stock of three months is being given free by the state government,” he told reporters on Tuesday.Singh said the pictures of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and the food minister of that state are printed on the ration bags.“The Union government is providing free ration to Chhattisgarh as well so they should ideally put a picture of the PM on the bags along with that of the chief minister (Baghel),” he said.Slamming the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, former minister and Congress MLA PC Sharma said the BJP has failed to provide free ration to intended beneficiaries but is doing the personal branding of the party leaders.“They are organising such programmes to dish out huge figures of beneficiaries of PDS for the PR work. The truth is that lakhs of BPL (Below Poverty Line) beneficiaries in Madhya Pradesh are yet to receive the ration of five months as announced earlier. Several such applications are pending with the district administration,” Sharma claimed while speaking to PTI.He alleged that the reality and the figures put out by the state government are contradictory. “Farmers are committing suicide due to mounting loan burden in the state,” he alleged.Madhya Pradesh BJP secretary Rajneesh Agrawal said the bags will bear the pictures of the PM and the CM and not of the state unit party president.“This is well under the Constitutional arrangement,” he said.Refuting Congress’ allegations, Agrawal said ration is being given continuously to beneficiaries and the distribution is monitored.“States ruled by Congress are in the dock over the issue of providing benefits to the poor under the PDS system. The Congress is anti-poor. They gave the slogan to eliminate poverty but they cannot see the good work in this direction,” he said.

28-07-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh can't avoid inquiry citing alleged vendetta: Maharashtra to HC||Senior IPS officer Param Bir Singh couldn’t avoid probe against him in criminal cases on the ground that it was the fall-out of his complaint against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, the Maharashtra government argued before the Bombay High Court on Wednesday. A Division Bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar was hearing a petition filed by Singh challenging two preliminary inquiries against him, one for alleged dereliction of duty and misconduct and another for alleged corruption. When the court asked about the progress of the two inquiries, additional public prosecutor Jayesh Yagnik said both the inquiries were still going on.Singh's lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani said the former Mumbai police commissioner has not received any summons or notice about these inquiries so far.Senior counsel Darius Khambata, appearing for the state government, said Singh's petition cannot be heard by the high court in the first place as it was a "service matter", and should be heard by an administrative tribunal.“The petition raised issues that are squarely covered under the provisions of the Administrative Tribunals Act and is purely a service matter,” he said.Khambata also termed as “bogus” the contention that the government's action was a form of vendetta for accusing Deshmukh of corruption.“Just because you have made some allegations against Anil Deshmukh does not immunize you from any action,” he said.The enquiries were initiated following a complaint by inspector Anup Dange, the lawyer said.“The complaint was given on February 2, 2021…before all this drama unfolded…before Singh wrote a complaint to the Chief Minister against Deshmukh,” Khambata said.“He (Singh) claims he has a cloak of immunity. In all matters he takes this defense. This is completely wrong. The complaints against him are serious and no one is above the law,” the state's lawyer argued.Jethmalani argued that the preliminary inquiries were set up hastily. It was "obvious from the circumstances that the inquiries were out of condemnation and vendetta,” he said.“Singh complained against Anil Deshmukh and instead of inquiring into that the state government has punished the whistleblower... They are trying to shoot the messenger and terrorizing the whistleblower,” Jethmalani argued.Senior counsel Navroz Seervai, appearing for Director General of Police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey, sought dismissal of the petition.“The allegations leveled in the petition against Pandey are completely false and is nothing but an attempt by the petitioner to dishonestly trap the DGP who is an outstanding officer,” Seervai argued.Khambata also pointed out that the two preliminary inquiries challenged in the plea did not continue as DGP Pandey, who was to head them, withdrew himself following the allegations by Singh.“The government ordered two new inquiries – one is headed by the Director General of the Anti-Corruption Bureau and the second is headed by the Additional Chief Secretary (Planning)," the state's lawyer said.Jethmalani alleged that the government, in conspiracy with DGP Pandey, was trying to find a way to make Singh withdraw his complaint letter against Deshmukh.“When this persuasion failed all the false cases followed,” he said.Singh was hurt by then home minister Deshmukh's statement blaming him, as the city's top cop, for intelligence failure after a car with explosives was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in south Mumbai, Jethmalani conceded.“But that does not mean the contents of the letter written by Singh (subsequently) against Deshmukh are false,” he said.The court reserved its order on whether the petition is maintainable.Singh was shunted out to Home Guard after (now dismissed) police officer Sachin Waze was arrested in the case of the car found near the Ambani residence. Deshmukh later stepped down as home minister when the high court, in another case, ordered probe into the corruption allegations leveled against him by Singh.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/param-bir-singh-cant-avoid-inquiry-citing-alleged-vendetta-maharashtra-to-hc-289531
28-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks govt to decide representation to form policy to protect kids from online games addiction||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the Centre to decide a representation seeking to formulate a national policy to protect children from online games addiction which is causing them psychological problems.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the concerned authorities to decide the representation in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the case and disposed of a petition which also sought to constitute a regulatory authority to monitor and rate the content of both offline and online games.The petition filed by NGO, Distress Management Collective (DMC), through advocates Robin Raju and Deepa Joseph, said the organisation has been receiving numerous complaints from parents who are concerned about children getting addicted to online games, as a result of which the kids are developing various psychological problems.The counsel told the court that they have already made a representation to the authorities on July 10.The plea said some recent news of children committing suicides or going into depression, and also committing crimes like theft due to online game addiction, compelled the NGO to file the petition."The pandemic period has posed a major problem in controlling and monitoring children from excessive gadget use. As classes are now online so parents are not in a position to reprimand children for being with a mobile phone like they did in the past. There are numerous studies that show the adverse impact of online games on the psyche of both young children (6-10 years) and adolescents (11-19 years),” the plea said.It stressed on the need for schools to give emphasis to counselling sessions and periodic sessions regarding the drastic effects of getting addicted to online gaming and said there is also a need for a national policy that lays emphasis on the role of schools and the Cyber Cell in tackling the issue. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-govt-to-decide-representation-to-form-policy-to-protect-kids-from-online-games-addiction-289530
28-07-2021||Mumbai||CBI opposes Chhota Rajan's bail plea in HC, says he has no respect for country's laws||The Central Bureau of Investigation opposed Chhota Rajan's bail plea in the Bombay High Court on Wednesday and said the gangster had no respect for the country's laws.Special Public Prosecutor Pardeep Gharat told a single bench presided over by Justice Anuja Prabhudesai that Rajan had multiple cases pending against him and was convicted and sentenced in a host of other cases.Gharat urged the high court not to grant bail to Rajan, saying the gangster was a "Z plus security threat".He said Rajan had fled India and travelled to several other countries on fake names and passports before he was finally arrested and extradited to India in November 2015.Rajan was extradited from Indonesia in 2015 and has been in judicial custody at the Tihar prison in New Delhi since then.Gharat was making submissions opposing an interim application filed by Rajan, seeking bail in a case of the attempt to murder a hotelier. Rajan was sentenced to imprisonment for eight years in the case by a special court in Mumbai in 2019 under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). However, Rajan's counsel, senior advocate Sudeep Pasbola, told the HC that there was no credible evidence against the gangster in the case. "I (Rajan) have been convicted on the charge of conspiracy only. All the other accused persons in the case, including those who were actual assailants, have been out on bail, so I deserve parity," Pasbola told the HC. "There is no direct evidence against me. Only a hearsay statement by two witnesses, which was not based upon their personal knowledge, was cited as evidence against me. These statements were based on information given by one of their co-accused, who is absconding," Pasbola said. Gharat, however, told the HC that while Rajan was in the CBI's custody in the case since April 2016, his co-accused, who were granted bail, were in custody since 2009. Besides, Rajan still had 14 to 15 cases pending against him, Gharat said. "The present applicant has no respect for the law of India. He absconded to various countries. He was travelling under fake name and fake passport. He was arrested after his real identity was discovered. And then, he was brought to India in 2015," Gharat said. "He (Rajan) has 71 cases against him before the CBI...14-15 (cases) are still pending.

28-07-2021||New Delhi||India skips London Climate Meet on technical reasons||As the environment and climate ministers from over four dozen countries concluded a meeting that took a step closer towards the COP26 on key issues related to actions to be taken to keep the global goal of restricting the temperature to '1.5C', India chose to skip the London Climate Ministerial citing technical reasons for not attending it.Apart from the '1.5C' goal (know so as the effort of climate negotiations is to restrict the emissions in a manner that the global temperature does not increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial levels of the 1880s), the London Climate Ministerial also discussed adaptation finance and concluded the Paris Rulebook.The Paris Agreement provides the framework for global action to cut down on emissions, but it is the rulebook that will set the Agreement in motion by laying out the tools and processes to enable its full, fair, and effective implementation.This event in London ahead of the annual November climate change summit (UNFCCC COP) was the first face-to-face ministerial meeting of its kind in more than 18 months.As announced by the office of Ashok Sharma, the president-designate of the Glasgow COP, said: "With fewer than 100 days to go until the critical UN climate change conference, Sharma is convening the meeting in London to shape the vision of the final outcomes from COP26, and build a 'unity of purpose to deliver them'." In all, 51 countries were to attend the event either face to face or virtually and it was only India that did not choose either option.Queries from IANS to the Ministry of Environment, Science and Climate Change received a standard reply from the Ministry spokesperson."India attended the G20 ministerial and made its stand clear. The UK climate ministerial was right after that. It was being held in the middle of the Parliament session so it was decided that this time we cannot be present. On an official level, we wanted to participate virtually but we couldn't because of various technical issues", the official spokesperson of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change Gaurav Khare said.At the G20 Climate Ministerial in Italy, India had participated virtually when it was held over the weekend. India has been asking the rich countries, the developed world to cut down on emissions so that there is scope for the poor countries, the developing world to improve the lives of their people that are most vulnerable to multiple extreme weather events.Following the meeting, Sharma said in London, "The steps we have taken over the past two days bring us closer to securing an outcome at Glasgow that people and our planet are crying out for. However, faultlines remain on some critical issues, and there is more work to do." --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-skips-london-climate-meet-on-technical-reasons-289520

It will learn the hunting and other survival skills as part of the procedure under our observation," he told PTI.According to the NTCA protocol, thetiger cub should be reared in an in situ enclosure for a minimum of two years."Normally, the animal would be released in the original forest after two years of re-wilding. Here, we will decide about its release after observing the nature and health condition of the animal," he said.Though the tiger cub was too fragile with bad hind-limbs and poor eye sight when it was rescued, the animal is perfectly healthy now, the official added.As part of the re-wilding process, the baby big cat would be shifted to a 'cage' which is spread in a nearly half-hectares of forest land inside the PTR.The enclosure would be widened in the later period as per the cub learning the hunting and survival skills.Fencing would be erectedconsidering the safety of the animal and it would be under strict camera surveillanceof the forest personnel throughout the day and night."The core objective of the procedure is to restore the wild nature of the animal which was reared under captivity for some period and make it self-reliant to live in an original forest," he said.Though the animal would be given some feed like domestic animals such as goat in the initial period, it is expected to learn hunting down prey in the later days."To give maximum feel of the original natural forest, the human presence in the enclosure will be made nil in the later months," the official said.Though it is an expensive procedure, the exact cost is yet to be estimated, he added.The tiger cub was suspected to have been abandoned by its mother, but officials spotted the tigress lurking around the Mangala Devi shrine in Periyar Tiger Reserve, nearly a week after it was rescued on November 21 last year.Officials believed the cub was left alone in the wild when the tigress engaged in a fierce internecine combat of tigers in the forest.Two wildlife doctors had been deployed to save the cub, whichcould hardly stand and if left abandoned, could have died, Department sources said.All Standard Operating Procedures of the National Tiger Conservation Authority were followed in rescue, they added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/international-tiger-day-a-rescued-tiger-cub-gets-re-wilding-lessons-in-kerala-forest-289507

Why are they causing disruptions of both the Houses.""Is it because they want to denigrate India? Is it because they want to defile the standing of the country as a Democracy?" Thakur said, addressing reporters outside Parliament.He said the government has been ready, and wanted to have discussions in both the Houses, but the opposition parties were shying away.He said Parliament is a forum to discuss issues germane to people at large, but the Opposition was interested in negativism.He referred to opposition Members not allowing Ministers to make replies in Parliament and also snatching papers from the Information and Technology Minister while he was making a reply.Thakur asked Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to introspect on the negative developments caused in Parliament, which was damaging the image of the country, and precious opportunity of discussing issues, lost.Such developments never happened before, since the days of Jawaharlal Nehru.Responding to allegations of the opposition parties, including Congress, that the government was not allowing discussions in Parliament under Rules they wanted, Thakur said these matters are decided by presiding officers of both the Houses in the meetings of the Business Advisory Committee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-government-hits-out-against-opposition-says-bringing-disrepute-to-country-289506

The entire family also took the two doses of Covishield vaccines in early-March and late-April.However, the family was perturbed when Dr Shrushti was infected for the second time - on May 29 - despite having been fully vaccinated, but recovered fully.The big shock came on July 11, when the entire Halari family was infected and hospitalised, put on Remdesivir, barely three months after their second vaccine doses.Not suffering from any comorbidity, Dr Shrushti's third encounter with Covid-19 stunned even the medical fraternity with the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation officials and other experts terming it as "an unprecedented, extremely rare occurrence".The BMC has taken the swabs of Dr Shrushti and Dhawal for further analysis by Foundation for Medical Research, to ascertain the type of Covid-19 variants that may have struck the Halari family - three with comorbidities, and after getting fully inoculated.The third time in July "was probably due to Dr Shrushti's low immunity levels on account of her two previous infections and the likely new strains of the virus that are coming to the fore in recent months", surmised Dr Vaishali."Actually, even the doctors initially did not believe it was possible, but after our physician Dr Mehul Thakkar's advice, she went for the tests which came positive and she was hospitalised early the next morning," added Dr Vaishali, narrating the harrowing time the Halari household had experienced."This has been very tough for the entire family. Now, we shall ensure there is no 4th time," Dr Shrushti said with soft determination.Dr Vaishali, 48, said the reason the family could emerge from Covid-19 successfully was due to their vaccination doses, medical knowledge, catching the symptoms in time and getting prompt treatment."We consider ourselves fortunate to be fully vaccinated as later it proved to be beneficial for all of us," Dr Vaishali, who is a severe diabetic patient, as also her son Dhawal, 21, and husband Dr Deepak, 56, who suffers from high blood pressure and cholesterol, told IANS.She pointed out that the vaccination doses also helped ensure that their infection was not so severe and now the entire family has completely recovered.Commenting on the issue, Mumbai researcher-cum-scientist Dr Pradeep Mahajan - Chairman of StemRx Biosciences Solutions Pvt Ltd, said that there's "no permanent cure" for Covid-19 in the world."It can strike even after full vaccination as the virus keep mutating, so inoculation is not a 100 per cent guarantee of avoiding Covid-19 altogether," Dr Mahajan - who has pioneered the unique stem cell/platelet-based remedy for the disease, told IANS.He said that at the rate the virus mutants are being detected, in the near future, vaccination may become compulsory every year, and some global pharma giants are already preparing to give a third booster dose to people in Europe and other countries.Now in the national limelight, the Halari family is keeping fingers crossed, taking all precautions and adhering to all Covid protocols to keep the virus from visiting their home again.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-attacks-will-avoid-4th-time-vows-thrice-infected-mumbai-medico-289503

28-07-2021||New Delhi||SC dismisses Kerala Govt's plea to drop cases against CPI(M) MLAs who vandalised assembly||Holding that elected representatives were not above the law, the Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the Kerala Government's plea for permission to withdraw criminal cases against CPI(M) MLAs who allegedly vandalised the state assembly in 2015."Privileges and immunity is not a gate to claim exemption from criminal law and that would be a betrayal to the citizens. Immunity of members from criminal law is for the purpose of enabling them to perform functions without hindrance, fear or favour,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.The order came on the Kerala Government’s petition seeking permission to withdraw criminal cases against CPI(M) leaders, including the state’s Education Minister V Sivankutty, for alleged vandalism on the floor of the state assembly in 2015, when the party was in the opposition.“Members are required to stay true to their oath and immunity is to help them discharge their functions freely. Privileges and immunity is not a mark of status which makes them stand on an unequal footing," the top court said."Committing destruction of property in the assembly cannot be equated to freedom of speech in the house. Allowing withdrawal of cases under these circumstances would amount to interference with the normal course of justice for illegitimate reasons," it ruled.Rejecting the state’s plea claiming immunity under Article 194 of the Constitution that grants certain legislative privileges to members of any legislative assembly, the Bench said the act of the accused MLAs crossed constitutional limits and can’t be covered under the immunity granted to lawmakers by the Constitution from criminal prosecution for acts done on the floor of the house.“Prima facie we have to take a strict view of this kind of behaviour. We will not condone this kind of behaviour of MLAs who, on the floor of the House, throw mic and destroy public property,” the Bench had earlier said during the hearing.Kerala Assembly had witnessed bedlam on March 13, 2015, as LDF members tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani -- who was facing allegations in the bar bribery scam -- from presenting the state budget. The CPI(M) MLAs had allegedly vandalised the Speaker’s dais, uprooted his chair, pulled out the mike system, and computers.Refusing to allow withdrawal of cases, the Kerala High Court had said elected representatives were expected to uphold the prestige of the House or face consequences. Earlier, Thiruvananthapuram Chief Judicial Magistrate had denied permission to withdraw prosecution against the accused, including sitting ministers.Citing legislative privileges under Article 194, the Kerala Government has contended, “The act of the accused persons being in relation to their function to protest as members of the legislative assembly the MLAs who are accused in this FIR, entitled to get protection under the Constitution,” the state government had contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dismisses-kerala-govts-plea-to-drop-cases-against-cpim-mlas-who-vandalised-assembly-289477

Leaders of all parties are here. Why did we have to come here because our voice is being suppressed in Parliament. We just have one question. Has the Government of India bought Pegasus, yes or no? Did the government use Pegasus weapon on its own people? Yes or no. That is all we wish to know. We have been clearly told...the government has told us that no discussion will happen,” Gandhi said.Terming the Pegasus matter an anti-national, treasonous act, Gandhi said “The PM has assaulted democratic institutions by using the weapons grade spyware against them. For me, this is not a matter of privacy, it is an anti-national act, treason. The weapon was used against me, SC, other leaders, journalists, activists. Then why should we not debate the issue in Parliament? What is the reason the discussion is not happening. This is the question.”On parliamentary disruptions, Gandhi said, “It is being said that we are disturbing Parliament. We are not disrupting Parliament. We only wish to discharge our responsibility. All of us want to discharge our responsibility. This weapon has been used against India. This weapon should be used against terrorists, against traitors. We are asking PM and HM why did you use it against democratic institutions? What has Indian democracy done that you have used the weapon against democracy?”He said, “This weapon has been used against democracy. This is not a matter of privacy. This is not a matter of privacy for me. It is an anti-national act. HM and PM have assaulted the democratic spirit of India. That is why we are seeking a Pegasus discussion and without this discussion we will not go anywhere,” said Gandhi.DMK, RJD, SP, Left and NCP leaders backed the demand for a debate and said only the PM could have ordered the use of spyware and HM could have been a party to it.“No one else could have done this. So the PM or HM must be present in the discussion on Pegasus,” Gandhi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-snooping-is-treason-not-going-anywhere-till-its-discussed-rahul-gandhi-289474
28-07-2021||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha adjourned for the second time||The Rajya Sabha was forced to adjourn the second time till the luncheon session after it assembled at noon during the Question Hour on Wednesday due to ruckus created by the Opposition Benches in the House.The Opposition Members intensified their protests during the Question Hour session, even as Deputy Chairman Harivansh Singh continued with the proceedings.Armed with placards these Members parked themselves in the Well of the House, on either side of the Chair while raising slogans, including against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.They were protesting against the alleged snooping with regard to the Pegasus spy software incident. They also raised slogans against the three Central farm laws.They collectively vocalised pejorative and taunting sounds, of phonetics of vowels.Many of them were without face masks, which was pointed out by the Chair."You do not have masks and not following Covid protocols," Harivansh Singh told the sloganeering Members in the Well.However, the Question Hour proceedings continued for a major part of the Session, before the House was adjourned.The Opposition Members apparently had a strategy: to disrupt the Ministers from answering to listed questions.While the Opposition Members whose names were called to question baulked citing deafening din and pandemonium in the House, the Members of NDA and usually neutral parties including BJD went ahead asking the questions.The Labour Minister Bhupender Singh Yadav, Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, among others, responded to their ministries-related question, projecting an air of insouciance in the midst of the din.Earlier, The House Chairman Venkaiah Naidu adjourned the House until noon, no sooner than he allowed commencement of the Zero Hour due to the ruckus by the Opposition BenchesSome members of the Opposition parties had come to the House with placards which were waved even while the customary papers were laid on the Table.The Members did not relent in spite of persuasion from the Chair against their disruptive conduct in the House.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-adjourned-for-the-second-time-289469

They included a Tibetan Ngodup Dongchung and Dr AK Merchant from the Bahai community which faces persecution in Pakistan.The US Secretary of State was careful in his responses to the media on the question. “We recognise that every democracy starting with our own is a work in progress. When we discuss these issues, I certainly do it, from the starting point of humility. We have seen challenges our democracy has faced in the past and faces today. This is common to all democracies,’’ he observed.  Terming strengthening partnership with India is one of the US’s top foreign policy priorities, Blinken said there are few relationships in the world that are more vital than the one between the US and India.Earlier, Blinken met NSA Ajit Doval and discussed strategic issues of importance in security, defence, economic and technology-related sectors. He rounded up his engagements by calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The discussions with the Indian leaders touched on regional concerns, multilateral institutions and global issues. Jaishankar said another issue was the “expanding Indian footprint, be it in Africa, South-east Asia, Caribbean or the South-pacific (that) has naturally broadened the shared agenda”.Among the many issues the two looked at, Afghanistan, the Indo-Pacific and the Gulf were the most prominent. “It is essential that peace negotiations are taken seriously by all parties. Unilateral imposition of will by any party will never lead to stability nor indeed can such efforts ever acquire legitimacy,” noted the Minister.On Afghanistan, Blinken told his Indian interlocutors that the US will remain engaged in the country even after the troop withdrawal as it is concerned about the Taliban advances. “There are reports of them committing atrocities in Afghanistan. It’s deeply troubling. It certainly doesn’t speak well about their intention for the country,” he said.Jaishankar said a solution needs to be worked out through dialogue and not on the battlefield since a unilateral imposition of will can never lead to stability in Afghanistan.Cooperation in battling the Covid pandemic figured prominently in Blinken’s talks with Jaishankar. Blinken also announced a $ 25 million assistance to support vaccination efforts across India and recalled with “gratitude” the aid and assistance India provided to the US early in the pandemic.The two leaders also discussed closer cooperation in the defence and security spheres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-corrected-historical-wrongs-jaishankar-tells-blinken-on-human-rights-concerns-289468
28-07-2021||Mumbai||Fresh FIR in pornography case names producers of Raj Kundra's firm, actress Gehana Vashishth||The Mumbai crime branch has lodged a fresh FIR in connection with a pornography case and named producers of businessman Raj Kundra's company as well as actress Gehana Vashishth in the new case, a police official said on Wednesday.The case was registered by the crime branch's property cell at Malwani police station on Tuesday after an actress approached the police and alleged she was forced to shoot for a pornographic film for the HotShots app. The First Information Report (FIR) was registered under various Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections, including 420 (cheating), 392 (punishment for robbery), 393 (attempt to commit robbery), and provisions of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act and the Information Technology Act, the official added.Also read: Raj Kundra, husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, was arrested by the crime branch on July 19 in a case related to alleged creation of pornographic films and publishing them through apps. The 45-year-old businessman, who was on Tuesday remanded in judicial custody for 14 days, earned at least Rs 1.17 crore between August and December last year from his business of production and online distribution of porn films, the police had told a magistrate's court. Kundra has contended that the films made by him, which the police claimed to be pornographic, did not depict direct or explicit sexual acts. After Kundra's arrest, Vashishth, who worked in three films produced for Kundra's app, had in a video said erotic content was different from pornography. Vashishth, who was arrested in February this year and later granted bail, and two others were recently summoned by the crime branch's property cell. Before the Mumbai crime branch took over the case, there was a complaint with the Maharashtra cyber department about the porn films racket, a senior police official earlier said. The Malwani police had filed FIRs on the basis of complaints received from two women, while another one woman had submitted a complaint at the Lonavla police station, around 120 km from Mumbai, he said. The Mumbai crime branch had started investigation into the case after some victims approached the Malwani police station in February 2021, he said. During the investigation, it came to light that some small-time artistes were lured by giving them break in some web series or short stories, he had said. These actors were called for auditions and were asked to give 'bold' scenes, which later turned out to be semi-nude or nude scenes, which were against the wishes of the actors, the official had said. During the investigation, it also came to light that there were many porn-related apps which were operating in the cyber world, he said.The police then arrested producer Roma Khan, her husband, actress Gehana Vashishth, director Tanveer Hashmi and Umesh Kamath (who used to look after India operations of Kundra's firm), he had said. At least 11 persons have been arrested so far in the case, according to the police.

The idea is to rehabilitate them, give them and their children education… such people have no choice and nobody wants to beg,” it said. While asking the Centre and Delhi Government to respond to a plea seeking vaccination and rehabilitation of beggars and vagabonds, the top court noted a large number of people, including children, were compelled to beg due to lack of education and employment.The Bench told the petitioner that it would not consider the prayer for a direction to the authorities to restrain beggars from begging on traffic junctions, markets and public places to avoid spread of virus in all states and UTs across India.It issued notices to the Centre and Delhi Government with regard to the prayer for a direction to the authorities for rehabilitation of beggars and to ensure that food, shelter and basic medical amenities including vaccination were provided to them.

The vaccine supply to the state was inadequate, she claimed.She also took up the issue of rechristening West Bengal. A proposal in that regard was sent to the Centre during her last stint, she said. The PM assured her to look into her demands, the CM said. She described her meeting with Modi as a “courtesy call”. After getting elected as the CM for the third term, it was her constitutional duty to meet the PM and the President, she said.On her meeting with the President, she said though she was fully vaccinated, she would still need a negative RT-PCR report to him.

But unfortunately the Congress boycotted that meeting, although other opposition parties attended. Their leaders asked for a special session to discuss Covid and were not present in the meeting the PM called on the issue. They are interested only in disruptions,” Naqvi said after Rajya Sabha was adjourned repeatedly on Tuesday.Joint opposition leaders appeared together and accused the government of running a dictatorship.Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said, “We have been demanding a discussion on Pegasus snooping and farmers issues but the government is not interested. Why is the government running away from accountability on the snooping issue? France, Israel and several other countries have ordered inquiries. Why can’t this government be transparent? To say that the government is ready for any discussion is one thing, but the reality is that they are not ready. Also, we have not been called for structured talks. Let the government call the opposition for talks and find a consensus to run the House. We want Parliament to run. The onus is on the government to find a way to run it. This is a dictatorship where democratic debate is not being allowed.”TMC’s Sukhendu Shekhar Roy also targeted the government for not conceding to a debate on Pegasus. He said, “Late leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley had famously said that disruption is also part of parliamentary democracy. We are demanding a debate and that must be held.”The opposition leaders again gave adjournment notices in both Houses on Tuesday, including a notice in Rajya Sabha to suspend the entire business and discuss the Pegasus snooping allegations in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah and institution of a judicial inquiry into the matter.Kharge said, “The allegations impinge on national security with reports that Army, judges and journalists were spied on.

Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China, met top officials of the Tibet Military Command and reviewed development projects in the region.In an interview to Fox News, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes said: "Just last week, you had Xi Jinping, the Chinese dictator, on the border with India, in Tibet, claiming victory. This was the first time in 30 years, I believe, that a Chinese dictator had been to Tibet, and also threatening India, over a billion people and also a nuclear power; threatening India that he's going to build a big water project, possibly cut off water to India."    During his visit to Nyingchi, Xi visited the Nyang River Bridge to inspect the ecological preservation in the basin of the Brahmaputra river, which is called Yarlung Zangbo in Tibetan language.China this year approved plans to build a huge dam over the Brahmaputra river during the current 14th Five-Year Plan, which raised concerns in the riparian states of India and Bangladesh.“So, no matter what you plug into the propaganda machine, you can build all the narratives you want here in Washington, DC, but then there's reality. The reality is that the Chinese are on the march, and the (President Joe) Biden administration is letting them do whatever they want," Nunes said.A senior Republican in the House of Representatives representing the 42nd Congressional district of California, Nunes was the chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee from 2015 to 2019.Xi's visit to Tibet took place amidst the current India-China military tensions in eastern Ladakh.
