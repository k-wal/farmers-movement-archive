Among the states, the highest number of sedition cases (54) was registered in Assam, followed by Jharkhand (40), Haryana (35), Karnataka (30), Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir and Kerala (25 each), and Uttar Pradesh (17),” Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG), an NGO ,stated.RRAG Director Suhas Chakma said there has been a 98 per cent increase in sedition cases from 2014 (47 cases) to 2019 (98 cases).Recently, the Supreme Court had sought to know from the Centre if the law on sedition was still needed after almost 75 years of independence. A Bench led by CJI NV Ramana had pointed out that sedition law was used by British against Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak and was now being misused with no accountability from the government."The government has repealed a number of laws...I don't know why you aren't looking into it," the CJI had wondered.“The data collated by the NCRB does not appear to reflect the actual number of sedition cases filed in the country. For example, the NCRB data stated that only 19 sedition cases were filed in Jharkhand during 2017 (1 case) and 2018 (18 cases) while the Jharkhand Police had filed 30 FIRs/cases against about 200 named accused and more than 10,000 unnamed people involved in the Pathalgadi movement of 2017-18.”  Chakma said.In its report “Sedition: India’s Silencer Gun” the NGO pointed out that as per the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), the BJP-ruled states dished out more sedition cases under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) since it started collecting data in 2014.“Complaints of sedition are mostly filed by private individuals who claim as nationalists or members or affiliates of mostly the ruling parties whether at the Centre or state level, against their real or perceived opponents, whether political or ideological and dissenters in a democracy. The most serious crime against a state i.e. to overthrow the government or threaten its sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been reduced to a matter of perception of a person’s own view on nationalism, a compliant police, and in some cases, a complicit judicial officer,” Chakma said.“The vindictiveness of the state, the grudges of the offended nationalists, or motivated actions of political activists, who invoke sedition clauses at the drop of a hat to silence the opponents and critics, cannot be regulated. The time has come for India to repeal Section 124A of the IPC relating to sedition,” he added.Section 124A of the IPC has put in jeopardy the right to freedom of opinion and expression itself because of vagueness of the terms like “hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the government”, and the inability of the state to restrict its application only in cases that “incite people to violence against the Government established by law or create public disorder” as enunciated by the Supreme Court in its Kedar Nath Singh judgment in 1962, Chakma said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abuse-of-sedition-law-assam-tops-the-list-ngo-demands-its-repeal-286347
21-07-2021||Pune||Those who have taken two doses of vaccine should be allowed to go out: Ajit Pawar||Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said on Wednesday that he was of the view that those who have received both the jabs of coronavirus vaccines should be allowed to "go out".He was going to discuss this issue with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, he told reporters here."In my opinion, those who have received two shots of COVID-19 vaccines should be allowed to go out, in a phased manner. I will speak with the CM on this subject in the next two days," he said.Pawar, however, did not elaborate on what exactly he meant by `going out'. While restrictions induced by the pandemic vary across the state, there is no curfew. In Pune and some other districts, people are not allowed to visit tourist spots.The deputy chief minister conceded that not everyone may agree with him. "Different institutes put forth their views, people from the medical fraternity have different views. Some people say the next 100 to 120 days are very crucial and everyone should follow the rules in true letter and spirit during this period," he said. Asked about the tardy pace of vaccination in Pune district, Pawar said the pace had not slowed down but it depends on the availability of the vaccines and it is the Union government that supplies them."The CM in every video conference with the prime minister raises the demand for supply of vaccine doses in proportion with the state's population," he said.Earlier it was told (by the Centre) that the production of vaccines would be ramped up and the states will receive the doses in sufficient quantity in July, but this has not happened so far, Pawar claimed. People are now coming forward to take the vaccine and there is no `vaccine hesitancy' which was a good development, he said. Speaking about the Pegasus spyware row, Pawar said measures such as phone tapping could be used against a person who is a threat to national security, but under the protection of laws enabling them, innocent people are being targeted. People must know what exactly happened and in whose tenure, the NCP leader said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/those-who-have-taken-two-doses-of-vaccine-should-be-allowed-to-go-out-ajit-pawar-286346
21-07-2021||Jaipur||In touch with Congress high command over party issues: Pilot||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Wednesday said he is in touch with the Congress high command over party issues raised by him and hoped that required steps will be taken by the top leadership.    Pilot and 18 other MLAs had rebelled against the leadership of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot last year. After a month-long crisis, the Congress high command had formed a committee to look into the issues raised by them.  “In-depth discussions were held on the issues which were raised in the context of Rajasthan. The AICC is taking steps for the betterment of the government and party organisation. We are in touch with the high command and I believe that the AICC is going to take necessary steps required to be taken,” he told reporters.  He said it is a collective responsibility of party leaders to ensure that the Congress retains power and suggestions in this regard were given by him.  “The workers who have given so much to the party should get political reward in proportion to their efforts. It is not about any post or position. We want to expand the Congress family...new people should be associated,” he said. Pilot said the decision of the party high command should be followed by all. “In the Congress, there can be our views or opinion but after the Congress president takes a decision following discussion with all, it should then be followed. The decision which is taken by the AICC is respected by all and this is an established tradition of the party,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-touch-with-congress-high-command-over-party-issues-pilot-286344
21-07-2021||Kolkata||Abhishek Banerjee calls for defeating Delhi’s ‘authoritarian duo’ as TMC aims for pan-India presence||Senior Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee on Wednesday asserted that his party will not be cowed down by the BJP’s “intimidation tactics” and it will ensure that the country is “freed from the shackles of the authoritarian duo sitting in Delhi” in 2024 Lok Sabha elections.The TMC national general secretary, who is also the nephew of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, also condemned the arrest of several party leaders and workers in Tripura for allegedly violating COVID-19 norms and taking part in the TMC Martyrs’ Day programme in the northeastern state.“We will not be cowed down by the threats and intimidation of the BJP. We need to ensure that India becomes free from the shackles of the authoritarian duo sitting in Delhi,” the Diamond Harbour MP said, without elaborating on whom he referred to as the “duo”.“I want to thank the leaders of various political parties who attended our event. We all need to fight together against the authoritarian regime. The TMC will fight under the guidance of Mamata Banerjee. West Bengal will be the beacon for the country,” he said, while concluding the programme after the TMC supremo’s speech.The parliamentarian, who was appointed as the party’s national general secretary after its massive victory in this year’s assembly elections, played a major role in ensuring that the annual Martyrs’ Day event was a gala programme and beamed live in various parts of the country.He has been given the charge of expanding the party’s base across the country.“We strongly condemn the attack on @AITCofficial supporters in @BJP4India ruled states. We will NOT be cowed down by such intimidation tactics! On #ShahidDibas, let me reiterate that TRINAMOOL will not budge an inch in its fight against the oppressive forces. COME WHAT MAY!” he tweeted.After the party’s massive victory for the third consecutive term, the TMC has vowed to spread its wings in other states to achieve a pan-India presence, and the Martyrs’ Day event was used to boost its national footprint.The virtual address was not only addressed by leaders of various parties, including the NCP, Congress, Shiv Sena and Samajwadi Party, but was also aired live in states like Punjab, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, New Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and poll-bound Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.Several senior TMC leaders were sent to these states to take part in the live streaming programmes.“We are in Uttar Pradesh today to spread the message of Mamata Banerjee for restoration of democracy in the country. The Samajwadi Party has supported us during the assembly polls. They are our allies. The BJP has to be defeated in both UP and across the country at any cost,” TMC chief whip in Rajya Sabha, Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, said.Banerjee’s speech was telecasted on giant screens across West Bengal, and also in other states.In West Bengal, the speech was telecasted as delivered by Banerjee, who spoke in English, Hindi and Bengali, while in other states, it was translated into local languages.In Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s home turf Gujarat, where assembly elections are due in 2022, the TMC aired Banerjee’s speech on giant screens in several districts in Gujarati.Graffiti and posters projecting Banerjee as ‘Amma’, a sobriquet attached to late AIADMK leader Jayalalitha, have come up in Chennai, as the TMC tries to make inroads into the southern states with its first foray being in Tamil Nadu.Also, the party’s mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’ became a daily from weekly from Wednesday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abhishek-banerjee-calls-for-defeating-delhis-authoritarian-duo-as-tmc-aims-for-pan-india-presence-286343

It is my utmost honour to serve the party with highest standards of ethics & behaviour. I urge everyone to act in accordance with party ethics & not indulge in protests/indiscipline that is disrespectful & embarrassing for the party,” Yediyurappa tweeted.Appealing to supporters not to give statements in his favour or indulge in protests, “based on the current political developments”, Yediyurappa in a Kannada tweet said, “your goodwill should not exceed the boundaries of discipline. Party is like a mother to me and disrespecting it will cause pain to me. I believe that my true well-wishers will understand and respond to my feelings”.          His statement came as support continued to pour in for him from Mutts, pontiffs, and political leaders.Leaders and pontiffs, especially from the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, also All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, have declared support to Yediyurappa and have urged for his continuation as the Chief Minister, while also warning “bad consequences” for the BJP if he is replaced.Striking a discordant note, dissident BJP MLC AH Vishwanath asked the Lingayat seers whether they were “backing corruption” by rallying behind Yediyurappa.Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Vishwanath, who has been vocal against Yediyurappa, criticised them, claiming that they are setting a “wrong precedent” by backing the Chief Minister and his government “instead of standing with the people”.Some BJP leaders like MP GM Siddeshwara and former legislator B Suresh Gowda have also expressed confidence that he will continue as CM, as the high command has not asked him to step down.Yediyurappa, who is completing two years in office on July 26, had visited Delhi last week, during which he had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and BJP president JP Nadda.The trip raised questions in some quarters if the party is now working out a succession plan.On his return from the national capital, Yediyurappa had, however, rubbished talks in some quarters that he is on the way out, and asserted that the central leadership has asked him to continue in the post.According to BJP sources, Yediyurappa’s dinner for BJP legislators, which was scheduled to take place on July 25, to mark his government completing two years in office, has been postponed.Sources also clarified that a BJP legislature party meeting has not been convened on July 26. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-leadership-change-buzz-yediyurappa-asks-supporters-not-to-indulge-in-protests-286342

21-07-2021||London||Suicide, Covid risks in Mumbai prison focus of Nirav Modi extradition appeal in UK||Nirav Modi faces a “substantial risk” of suicide amid an “overwhelming” impact of Covid-19 at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where he will be lodged on being extradited, the High Court in London was told during an extradition appeal hearing on Wednesday.The 50-year-old diamond merchant, wanted in India to face charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, observed the remotely held court proceedings from his Wandsworth Prison in south-west London as his lawyers argued for permission to appeal against his extradition ordered by District Judge Sam Goozee in February and certified by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel in April.During the “renewal application” hearing before Justice Martin Chamberlain, Nirav’s lawyers sought to establish the grounds for a full High Court appeal hearing by claiming it would be oppressive to extradite him due to his mental condition that could lead to suicidal impulses.Nirav’s barrister Edward Fitzgerald argued that Judge Goozee made a “succession of errors” in his ruling in favour of extradition in February, when he concluded that not only was Nirav’s severe depression not unusual given his incarceration, but that he did not exhibit an immediate impulse to commit suicide.“The District Judge was wrong to hold that there was nothing unusual about the Appellant’s (Nirav Modi) mental condition; and wrong to focus on his present fitness to plead,” said Fitzgerald.“As to the District Judge’s conclusion that ‘the Applicant’s condition will improve on his return’ and ‘there will be an amelioration of his current conditions of detention’, that finding was perverse on the evidence before him and unsustainable in the light of the new evidence. It was based on his assessment that the conditions in the prison at Arthur Road, Mumbai will be better than they are at HMP Wandsworth,” he noted.Nirav’s lawyers relied on expert evidence from forensic psychiatrist Dr Andrew Forrester, presented previously at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London.“In my opinion, Nirav Modi should now be considered at substantial (meaning high), albeit not immediate, risk of suicide,” reads Forrester’s assessment in his report dated August 27, 2020.The lawyers also submitted fresh evidence to claim the Covid-19 pandemic is “overwhelming to the effect that the new outbreak of Covid renders the healthcare system on the brink of collapse”.Fellow barrister, Ben Watson, argued that Judge Goozee was led into error when making his ruling in favour of a prima facie case against Nirav over the “scope” and nature of the PNB scam conspiracy.In relation to the Home Secretary’s extradition order, it was argued that she should not rely on Indian government assurances.“She [Priti Patel] failed totally to address the evidence of other breaches of commitments made to both the UK and to third states,” claimed Fitzgerald.The renewal hearing is expected to conclude on Wednesday after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on behalf of the Indian authorities and the Home Secretary’s counsel make their counter-arguments against permission to appeal, with a judgment likely at a later date on whether the case can proceed to a full appeal hearing in the High Court in London.Nirav is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added to the CBI case.India is a designated Part 2 country by virtue of the Extradition Act 2003, which means it is the UK Cabinet minister who has the authority to order a requested person’s extradition after all legal issues are dealt with in the courts.

21-07-2021||Washington/New Delhi||US issues security alert for citizens in view of farmers’ protest in New Delhi||The US on Wednesday issued a security alert for its citizens in India, advising them to avoid prominent areas, crowds and demonstrations along with taking steps for their own safety in view of the farmers’ protest in New Delhi.Farmers’ union on Tuesday said they will hold a ‘Kisan Parliament’ at Jantar Mantar during the ongoing monsoon session of the Parliament and every day from July 22, 200 protesters will go there from the Singhu border.“US Embassy New Delhi is aware of media reports of possible demonstrations in and around New Delhi on July 21 and 22 by farmers and counter-protesters. Previous such protests have sometimes led to violence,” the embassy said in a press release issued on Wednesday.Noting that the likelihood and location of protests taking place is unknown, it said that the farmers’ unions have requested permission for 200 protesters to walk to the Parliament in protest of the new farm laws.There may be more police on the streets, additional checkpoints, and an unknown number of demonstrators in and around Delhi, the press release said.It also advised them to avoid prominent areas, including Parliament, crowds, demonstrations, monitor local media for updates, be aware of their surroundings, review their personal security plans and heed instructions from law enforcement officials.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions spearheading the stir against the central farm laws, had planned that around 200 farmers will protest outside Parliament every day from July 22 during the monsoon session.The monsoon session of Parliament started on Monday and is scheduled to conclude on August 13.Thousands of farmers from across the country have been agitating at the Delhi borders against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws at major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.

21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Editor’s Guild condemns Pegasus snooping, demands independent inquiry||The Editors Guild of India demanded an urgent and independent inquiry into allegations of widespread surveillance on several Indians—a development that comes as the use of Pegasus spyware sent shocks across the country.Among several people allegedly on the so-called surveillance list are several journalists and civil society activists, as well as some prominent critics of the current dispensation. The Wire, which is among a consortium of 17 publications that have published data that was shared with them from a leaked database by Paris-based media nonprofit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International, mentions that although the mention of a phone number on a list indicates a degree of interest in that number by the agency that put it there, the only sure way of confirming the hack is an analysis of the said phone.Israel based NSO group, which sells Pegasus, has said it sells the software only to “vetted governments”, the reports say.The Editor’s Guild of India said in its statement on Wednesday that the surveillance was “a brazen and unconstitutional attack on freedom of speech and press”.“This act of snooping essentially conveys that journalism and political dissent are now equated with ‘terror’. How can a constitutional democracy survive if governments do not make an effort to protect freedom of speech and allows surveillance with such impunity,” the statement says.Here’s the complete statement.‘The Editors Guild of India is shocked by the media reports on the widespread surveillance, allegedly mounted by government agencies, on journalists, civil society activists, businessmen and politicians, using a hacking software known as Pegasus, created and developed by the Israeli company NSO. The reports, which have been published worldwide over the last few days by a consortium of 17 publications, points towards surveillance by multiple governments across the world. Since NSO claims that it only sells this software to governments clients vetted by the Government of Israel, it deepens suspicion of involvement of Indian government agencies in snooping on its own citizens.While some of the instances of surveillance might have been targeted against those who may be seen as credible national security threat, what is disturbing is that a large of such targets were journalists and civil society activists. This is a brazen and unconstitutional attack on freedom of speech and press. This act of snooping essentially conveys that journalism and political dissent are now equated with ‘terror’. How can a constitutional democracy survive if governments do not make an effort to protect freedom of speech and allows surveillance with such impunity.This is a moment that demands deep introspection and inquiry into the kind of society we are heading towards, and how far we may have veered away from the democratic values enshrined in our constitution.The Guild demands an urgent and independent inquiry into these snooping charges, under the aegis of Supreme Court of India. We also demand that this inquiry committee should include people of impeccable credibility from different walks of life- including journalists and civil society- so that it can independently investigate the facts around the extent and intent of snooping using the services of Pegasus.’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/editors-guild-condemns-pegasus-snooping-demands-independent-inquiry-286333

IAF deeply appreciates the support by UAE Air Force for in-flight refuelling during the non-stop ferry,” the IAF said in a tweet.Following the arrival of the new batch, the number of Rafale jets with the IAF went up to 24.The new squadron of Rafale jets will be based in Hasimara airbase in West Bengal.The first Rafale squadron is based in the Ambala air force station. A squadron comprises around 18 aircraft.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29 last year.India is expected to get more Rafale jets from France in the next few months.The Rafale jets, manufactured by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The Rafale jets are capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile, Scalp cruise missile and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.

21-07-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear pleas of Delhi Police against HC verdicts granting bail to three student activists||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Thursday the petitions filed by Delhi Police challenging the Delhi High Court verdicts granting bail to three student activists in a northeast Delhi riots case.The apex court had on June 18 expressed its displeasure over the high court discussing the entire anti-terror law UAPA in a bail matter and made it clear that the judgements shall not be treated as a precedent and may not be relied upon by any of the parties in any of the proceedings.The top court, which had agreed to hear the appeals filed by police and issued notices to JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita and Jamia Millia Islamia University student Asif Iqbal Tanha seeking their responses, had refused to stay the high court verdicts.The apex court had clarified in its June 18 order that release of these students on bail was not being interfered with at this stage.The pleas would come up for hearing on Thursday before a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta. While hearing the matter last month, the top court had taken note of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta's submission that the entire Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has been "turned upside down" by the high court in granting bail in the case and observed that the issue is important and can have pan-India ramifications.Mehta had said that 53 persons died and over 700 were injured during the riots which took place at a time when the then US president and other dignitaries were here.The high court had said although the definition of ‘terrorist act' in section 15 of the UAPA is wide and somewhat vague, it must partake the essential character of terrorism and the phrase ‘terrorist act' cannot be permitted to be applied in a “cavalier manner” to criminal acts that squarely fall under the Indian Penal Code.The Delhi Police has assailed the verdict, saying the interpretation of high court would weaken the prosecution in terror cases.The police further contended in its appeal that the high court had said the UAPA provisions can only be applied to deal with matters of profound impact on the ‘Defence of India', nothing more and nothing less.The high court had on June 15 granted bail to the three student activists saying in an anxiety to suppress dissent the State has blurred the line between right to protest and terrorist activity and if such a mindset gains traction, it would be a "sad day for democracy".The high court, in three separate judgments, had set aside the trial court's orders denying bail to these student activists and allowed their appeals by admitting them to regular bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with two sureties of the like amount.These three student activists were released from jail on June 17.The case relates to the last year's communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).In its three separate appeals filed in the apex court, the Delhi Police has said that the high court's findings are "perverse and contrary to record" and appeared to be based "more on the social media narrative than the evidence gathered and elaborated in the charge sheet".Kalita, Narwal, and Tanha are accused in four, three and two cases respectively relating to communal riots that broke out on February 24 last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-pleas-of-delhi-police-against-hc-verdicts-granting-bail-to-three-student-activists-286326
21-07-2021||Hyderabad||Telangana cops who tortured Dalit woman dismissed||Three Telangana policemen who were accused of killing a Dalit woman in their custody a month ago have been dismissed from service, officials said—a development that comes almost a month after the state’s high court ordered a judicial inquiry.Sub-Inspector V Maheshwar and police constables MA Rasheed Patel and P Janaiah were dismissed over the custodial death of Ambadipudi Mariyamma, a 40-year-old cook at the house of a priest, Father Balashouri, who accused her of stealing Rs 2 lakh. Police allegedly detained both her and her son Uday Kiran and kept in custody for four days, during which they allegedly beat them up to extract a confession, sources said. She was allegedly beaten up in front of her children, sources said.Mariayamma was a Mala caste woman from Chintakani in the Khammam district. Mala is e classified as Scheduled Caste by the Government of India.After the incident came to light, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes issued a notice to the Telangana government, Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of Police district Bhongir, Chief Secretary and Director General of Police Telangana and giving them a week to submit an “action taken” report.Uday Kiran told senior policemen that the suspects kicked his mother “on the stomach with shoes. Unable to bear the pain, she wet herself”.“Then she ell severely ill. At 9.30 am, when they tried to resuscitate her, she died in my lap,” Uday Kiran, who was hospitalised over his injuries at Khammam General Hospital, said.   Telangana High Court ordered a judicial inquiry into the case on June 24.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-cops-who-tortured-dalit-woman-dismissed-286323
21-07-2021||---||Deaths due to oxygen shortage: BJP says states did not report any such casualties to Centre||New Delhi, July 21The ruling BJP on Wednesday claimed that the blame for not reporting deaths due to oxygen shortage during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was with states and UTs since they did not report any such casualties to the Centre.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the data presented in Parliament, yesterday was not collated by the Centre but sent by states and union territories. “If the Opposition says the Centre has not given correct data, then they should ask their own state governments what went wrong,” Patra said, adding that opposition-ruled states claimed in courts that there was no death due to shortage of oxygen and made similar assertions in their response to the Centre.Patra said the Maharashtra government even told Bombay High Court that no one died due to the oxygen shortage and Chhattisgarh Health Minister T S Singh Deo also made similar claims.The government had told Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that no deaths due to lack of oxygen were specifically reported by states and UTs during the second COVID-19 wave, drawing sharp criticism from opposition leaders.The BJP spokesperson also accused opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi of the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal of AAP, of doing politics on the matter. He said states, where these parties are in power, claimed that no one died there due to lack of oxygen. Slamming Rahul Gandhi, Patra said he was acting like a “Twitter troll throughout the pandemic by writing two-line lies.”“It is painful that a former president of one of the largest parties behaved so irresponsibly… He should speak to chief ministers in the states where his party is in power instead of lying on Twitter and spreading confusion,” Patra said.With the AAP also targeting the Modi government over its reply in Rajya Sabha, Patra said a Delhi government committee told high court that there was no evidence to suggest that around 21 persons died due to shortage of oxygen in Jaipur Golden hospital after the hospital management reported the matter.As per Patra, opposition-ruled states talked of patients dying due to the oxygen crisis in the second wave because “they wanted to target the Narendra Modi government. But they have taken a different stand in writing and their submission to courts to politicise the whole issue”.On why Centre did not seek data from the states or collect it themselves, Patra said had this been done in Delhi or West Bengal, the state governments there would have accused it of “killing democracy”. “Rather we want to know why the Congress and the AAP abstained from the meeting that was called regarding the preparations of the third wave by the Prime Minister,” Patra said, referring to the meeting of the PM with the floor leaders of parties on Tuesday.Regarding BJP-ruled states, Patra said people might have suffered there too but they neither levelled allegations like the opposition-ruled states nor the issue was taken to high courts there in this manner. “State such as Uttar Pradesh had not been complaining of shortages. The UP CM never blamed any other state or the Centre,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-bjp-says-states-did-not-report-any-such-casualties-to-centre-286322
21-07-2021||New Delhi||India’s excess deaths during Covid pandemic may be between 3.4- 4.9 million, claims report||India’s excess deaths during the Covid pandemic could be between 3.4 to 4.9 million, according to a new report which suggests millions more may have died from the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the official count.The report, which was released on Tuesday, is co-authored by India’s former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, Justin Sandefur from the US-based think-tank Center for Global Development and Abhishek Anand from Harvard University.“Estimating Covid-deaths with statistical confidence may prove elusive. But all estimates suggest that the death toll from the pandemic is likely to be an order of magnitude greater than the official count of 400,000,” the authors said.“True deaths are likely to be in the several millions not hundreds of thousands, making this arguably India’s worst human tragedy since partition and independence,” the authors added in their report.Excess deaths between January 2020 and June 2021 are between 3.4 million to 4.9 million, they estimate.Excess deaths are additional deaths recorded during a pandemic, as compared to a corresponding period in pre-pandemic years, and could be a potential indicator of undercounting in India’s Covid toll.India’s official Covid-19 tally on Wednesday was 4,18,480 (4.18 lakh), the third highest in the world after the US and Brazil.Noting that India lacks an authoritative estimate of the death toll from Covid, the researchers based their estimate of excess mortality on three different data sources from the pandemic’s start through June this year.First, the extrapolation of state-level civil registration of deaths from seven states. This suggests 3.4 million excess deaths.Second, the researchers applied international estimates of age-specific infection fatality rates (IFR) to Indian seroprevalence data. This implies a higher toll of around 4 million.IFR assesses the proportion of deaths among identified confirmed cases and allows estimation of excess deaths.Third, the researchers analysed data from the Consumer Pyramid Household Survey (CPHS), a survey of over 800,000 individuals across all states. This yields an estimate of 4.9 million excess deaths.The researchers said they don’t favour any one estimate because each has merits and shortcomings.India is still emerging from a devastating second wave that started in March and is believed to have been driven by the more transmissible Delta variant.The analysis also suggests the first wave was more lethal than believed.  By March-end this year, when the second wave started, India had an official death toll of over 1,50,000 (1.5 lakh).Several experts have cast doubts on India’s official toll, blaming the way deaths are counted in the country rather than deliberate misinformation.Since official figures don’t represent the reality, there is need to use indirect methods such as an estimation of excess deaths due to all causes over the pandemic period, said Gautam Menon, professor, Departments of Physics and Biology, Ashoka University, Haryana.“The analysis leads to a broad range of possible values, of an undercounting by a factor of 3 at the lower end to an undercounting by a factor of 10 at the upper end.  All evidence suggests that the actual value lies within this range,” Menon, who has been a part of several COVID-19 modelling studies, told PTI.He said the relatively low official numbers for COVID-19 mortality at the end of the first wave were likely responsible for a sense of “Indian exceptionalism” and a consequent slackening of the required vigilance, leading to the devastating second wave.“Their results point to the importance of having accurate and timely mortality estimates and the need to reimagine and restructure our approach to how such data is collected.” On some points, the uncertainties in data overwhelm the calculation.For example, Menon explained, in estimating the mortality impact of the first vs the second wave, different methods give qualitatively, and not just quantitatively, different results. For this reason, he said he would tend to lean towards the more conservative end of the estimate in the US report.Murad Banaji, a senior lecturer in mathematics at UK’s Middlesex University, agreed.“We cannot be certain that total excess deaths have been 10 times higher than recorded Covid-19 deaths. But even the most conservative estimates give around 2.5 million excess deaths to date, roughly six times the official Covid-19 death count,” Banaji told PTI in response to the findings.Banaji, who has been looking at India’s Covid-19 mortality figures, said the report suggests that during the pandemic, India has seen a surge in deaths many times higher than the official Covid-19 death-count.Noting that there is no easy way of determining how many of the excess deaths are from Covid-19, he added that epidemiological and international data suggests a large part of the excess mortality is likely to be from the disease.“We can say with confidence that India has only counted a small fraction of its Covid-19 deaths. In fact, it is very likely that India has recorded fewer than one in five of its Covid-19 deaths to date.” According to Banaji, the main takeaway from the report is that while mortality has been high, disease surveillance and transparency have been very poor.“Weak death recording, and dishonest and misleading narratives around mortality have hampered efforts to understand and predict the course of COVID-19 in India. They contributed to complacency and to the mismanagement of the second wave of the epidemic in the country.”   It is important for every country to capture excess mortality, WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Tuesday.“… -- only way to prepare the health system for future shocks & to prevent further deaths. It’s also why we need to invest in strong civil registration & vital statistics, so policies can be adjusted based on real data,” she said in a Twitter post.On Wednesday, India recorded a single day rise of 3,998 coronavirus fatalities and  42,015 new cases as Maharashtra carried out a |data reconciliation exercise, according to the Union Health Ministry. While the death toll went up to 4,18,480, the case tally is now 3,12,16,337 (3.12 crore/31.2 million) with a daily positivity rate of 2.27 per cent—it has been less than three per cent for 30 consecutive days.

However, angry villagers eventually traced them to a neighbouring village and brought them back to Chiliyavant on Tuesday morning. The accused tied the duo to a tree and thrashed them with sticks," the Deputy Superintendent of Police said. The victim in her complaint has claimed that the accused were angry because a local tradition bars marriage of man and woman from the same village, it was stated. A similar incident took place in Dhada village under Rangpur police station a month ago, where a tribal couple was assaulted by five men as a punishment for eloping. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-tribal-couple-tied-to-tree-thrashed-with-sticks-for-eloping-nine-held-286312

21-07-2021||Guwahati||Assam CM calls for secularism in context of Indian civilisation, accuses media of bias||Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday asserted the concept of secularism needs to be defined in the context of ‘Indian civilisation’ and accused the media of being partial towards Left-liberals.Attacking Leftist intellectuals, liberals, and the media, Sarma,  at a function where RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat launched a book, claimed the country’s intellectual society is still dominated by the left-liberals with the media giving them more space while ignoring alternate voices.“An intellectual terrorism has been unleashed and the Left in the country are more leftists than Karl Marx. There is no democracy in media....they have no space for Indian civilisation but there is space for Karl Marx and Lenin”, he claimed.India’s right-wing has long disputed the concept of secularism as espoused by both western thinkers and Indian intellectuals who propound that the state needs to be equidistant from adherents of all religions.Mediapersons may agree in private to an alternative narrative but they prefer giving space to left -liberals saying that this reflects an independent view, Sarma alleged.“The left thinking has to be challenged and more thought provoking books based on history, of our long struggle for existence must be documented in the right perspective”, he said.India has been a secular country since the Rig Vedic Age and “we have given the concept of secularism and humanity to the world. Our civilisation is five thousand years old and we have accepted diversity of thought, religion, and culture since ages”, the Chief Minister said.Referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act, Sarma said that there are two perspectives on this- for protestors outside Assam, the demand is why Hindus alone should be given citizenship, Muslim migrants too should be covered.In Assam, however, the protest against the Act was that neither Hindus nor Muslims from other countries should be given citizenship.“It was the so-called secular protestors at the national level who tried to give a communal colour to the entire protests”, he said.The CAA is for those “who are victims of partition and not beneficiaries of a communal country created on the basis of religion”, he said.The CAA says Indian citizenship may be granted to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsis and Christians from neighbouring countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who have come in before end-December 2014 and had suffered “religious persecution or fear of religious persecution” in their country of origin.—     PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-cm-calls-for-secularism-in-context-of-indian-civilisation-accuses-media-of-bias-286307
21-07-2021|| New Delhi||Serum Institute writes to Union Health Minister proposing reforms in drug regulatory system||The world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, Serum Institute of India (SII) has written to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya suggesting reforms in the existing drug regulatory system, including allowing manufacturing and stockpiling of non-Covid vaccines while undergoing clinical trial.According to official sources, Prakash Kumar Singh, Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Pune-based SII, in a letter, referred to a gazette notification by the Union Health Ministry on May 18, 2020.He said it allowed manufacturing and stockpiling of Covid-19 vaccine under clinical trial for marketing authorization for sale or distribution.“Because of this rule, it became possible for us to manufacture and stockpile the Covid-19 vaccine during clinical trial and we could make the vaccine available in such a short span of time period to protect millions of lives.“It will be a big help for the vaccine industry if this rule is implemented for non-Covid-19 vaccines also,” a source quoted Singh as having communicated in the letter to the minister.Singh also sought permission to use the remaining quantities of batches of Covid and non-Covid vaccines for commercial purposes which have been used in clinical trial.In this context, he said the Health Ministry had issued draft rules dated April 12, 2018, to allow remaining quantities of batches of vaccines which have been used in clinical trial for commercial use after granting of permission in form 46 (now it is form CT-23) and manufacturing licence in Form 28D.“However, the gazette notification in this regard has not been issued so far for the implementation of the same,” Singh said. He also sought the implementation of recommendations of a high-powered inter-ministerial committee for reforming the Drug Regulatory Systems in India.The letter stated that on the directions of the prime minister, a high-powered Inter-Ministerial Committee for reforming the drug regulatory systems in India was formed under the chairmanship of then OSD, Rajesh Bhushan who is presently the health secretary.“Recommendations of this inter-ministerial committee should be implemented immediately in line with ‘ease of doing business”.The letter highlighted few other points also related to regulatory reforms and stated, “If few rules/regulatory provisions are amended, it will be a great help and encouragement for the vaccine industry to grow faster. We are putting forward the following points w.r.t. Reforms in the Drug Regulatory System for your kind consideration which will take the Vaccine Industry of our country to further new heights.”       “In view of the genuine difficulties being faced by the vaccine industry, I sincerely request for your kind intervention for the regulatory reforms. This will also be in line with our prime minister’s vision of ease of doing business in India and will further encourage his dream project ‘Making in India for the World’,” Singh mentioned in the letter. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/serum-institute-writes-to-union-health-minister-proposing-reforms-in-drug-regulatory-system-286305
21-07-2021||Mumbai||Kangana moves HC against defamation case filed by Javed Akhtar||Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut has approached the Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of proceedings initiated by a city magistrate on a criminal defamation complaint filed against her by lyricist Javed Akhtar.In an appeal filed through advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, Ranaut claimed that the Andheri metropolitan magistrate's court initiated proceedings against her by relying only on the police's report and did not examine witnesses independently.Akhtar filed a criminal complaint against Ranaut in November 2020 before the magistrate for allegedly making defamatory and baseless comments against him in television interviews.In December, the court directed the suburban Juhu police to conduct an inquiry. After the police stated in its report that an offense was made out on the face of it and further probe was needed, the court initiated criminal proceedings against Ranaut and issued a summons to her in February 2021."The metropolitan magistrate did not use his own powers to conduct an inquiry but instead blatantly used the police machinery to collect the signed witness statements...which is completely unheard of," the actor's plea said.It was likely that the witnesses were influenced by the police and the magistrate should have recorded evidence of witnesses under oath to "establish if an actual case was made out", it said.The high court is likely to hear Ranaut's plea next week. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-moves-hc-against-defamation-case-filed-by-javed-akhtar-286304
21-07-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala's first transgender RJ Anannyah found dead, state govt orders probe||Noted trans-activist Anannyah Kumari Alex, Kerala’s first radio jockey (RJ) from the third gender community, was found dead at her apartment in Ernakulam district, following which the government ordered an immediate inquiry.The 28-year old trans-woman was found hanging from the fan in the bedroom of the apartment near Edappally on Tuesday night and a case of suicide was suspected, police said.Social Justice Minister R Bindhu and Health Minister Veena George directed the officials concerned to conduct the probe into the incident and submit reports.George asked the medical director to carry out an inquiry into the incident as the organisation of the third gender community alleged that the deceased trans-woman was suffering from severe pain for some time following a sex reassignment surgery.An expert panel would be set up soon to study the issues related to gender reassignment surgeries, she said.Meanwhile, Bindhu said here in a statement that the social justice department secretary had been asked to submit a report on the trans activist’s death after carrying out a comprehensive probe.A meeting of the transgender justice board would be convened on July 23 to discuss the issues generally faced by the marginalised community, she said.Also a celebrity makeup artist, a TV news reader and an established stage show anchor, Anannyah recently grabbed media attention as the first transgender candidate in the Assembly elections in the state when she became the candidate of theDemocratic Social Justice Party in Vengara in the April 6 polls.Her fellow transgenders alleged that Anannyah was suffering from severe physical pain for some time after undergoing a sex reassignment surgery at a private hospital here last year and complained of medical negligence against the doctor who conducted the procedure.A trans-woman, a friend of the deceased person, also said Anannyah had told the friends that she could not even stand for long or do any work due to the physical discomfort post the medical procedure.“She was actually a victim of medical negligence and surgical error. We have to depend private hospitals and subject to their exploitation as there is no facility for the sex reassignment surgery in the government sector,” the transgender person added.Minister Bindhu said guidelines would be prepared to carry out such surgeries in a more scientific and error-free manner.“The government will explore the possibilities of setting up trans clinics to deal with the issues including gender reassignment surgery and the physical and psychological challenges faced by the community,” she said.Stringent measures would be taken to end the exploitation and fraudulent practices adopted by some institutions in this regard, the minister added.Hailing from an ordinary family in Perumon in Kollam district, Ananyah, a plus-two drop out, had to leave home and family as they could not understand her worries over gender.

21-07-2021||Mumbai||No death due to oxygen shortage in Maharashtra: Health minister Tope||Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said the state government never reported any death due to shortage of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19.Notably, in April this year, 22 patients died after the oxygen supply was disrupted at a Nashik hospital due to leakage in an oxygen storage plant, local officials had said.Tope had then said a thorough probe will be conducted to find out if negligence led to the leakage of oxygen at the hospital.On Tuesday, the Union government had told the Rajya Sabha that no deaths due to lack of oxygen were specifically reported by states and UTs during the second Covid-19 wave, drawing sharp criticism from opposition leaders.When asked by a TV channel about the Centre’s statement, Tope said, “We never said people died due to oxygen shortage in the state. Many of them had issues like co-morbidities and other illnesses. No death has taken place due to the shortage of oxygen”. Earlier in the day, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, whose party shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra, said people whose relatives died due to oxygen shortage should “take the Union government to court”.Noting that opposition-ruled states claimed in courts that there was no death due to shortage of oxygen during the second Covid-19 wave and made similar assertions in their response to the Centre, the BJP on Wednesday hit back at its rivals amid a row over the Modi government’s reply in Parliament on the matter.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra noted that the central government’s reply was based on the figures provided by states and UTs as health is a state subject.No state sent any data about patients dying due to oxygen shortage, he asserted.He said the Maharashtra government also told the Bombay High Court that no one died due to the oxygen shortage and Chhattisgarh Health Minister T S Singh Deo has also made similar claims.Shortly after the statement in the Rajya Sabha was made over the issue in a written reply by Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar on Tuesday, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal accused the minister of having “misled” the House.Describing the statement as “condemnable”, Venugopal, a Rajya Sabha MP to whose question the reply was given, had said he will move a privilege motion against the minister. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-death-due-to-oxygen-shortage-in-maharashtra-health-minister-tope-286302

Before leaving, Benny would cook for the three women, and do the same on returning.Cleaning the rooms and other chores were also done by the father-son duo all these months, as the women would only venture out to relieve themselves."These three feared that if they contract Covid, they cannot afford treatment in the hospital as they were poor. So they thought it is better not to come out and stay in the home itself," he said.According to police, nobody suspected what was happening because the men would come out of the house. Otherwise, the police official said the state's ward and village volunteer system would have detected what was happening, considering one volunteer has been tasked to take government schemes to 50 households.After tolerating his mother and sisters' behaviour for a long time, Chinnababu finally approached the police.Police said that the women didn't heed the word of Benny as well as Chinnababu."The father-son took the matter to mahila police in the village secretariat. From them, we received the information, leading the sub-inspector to visit and counsel them," the officer said.Following this, the three women were shifted to a hospital in Razole and are said to be stable now, though malnourished and feeble.All these 15 months, the three women did not even bathe, and when they finally emerged, their hair was in a bad state too. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-paranoia-makes-3-andhra-women-stay-locked-up-for-15-months-286300
21-07-2021||Vijay Mohan||DRDO’s Dehradun lab to develop coastal and harbour surveillance system||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 21As part of the ongoing efforts to beef up maritime security, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is developing a new electro-optical system for coastal and harbour surveillance.The system, being worked upon by Instruments Research and Development Establishment, Dehradun, will comprise thermal imagers and optical cameras to detect and track targets and provide requisite inputs for decision-making.The all weather, day and night capable system will be installed at strategic locations along the coastline, including vicinity to harbours and ports, to monitor shipping traffic as well as other sea-faring vessels. It will be controlled remotely and will be operated by the Indian Coast Guard.According to DRDO sources, the electro-optical system’s detection range is expected to be up to 25 kilometers or more and it should be able to identify a target at a distance of at least eight kilometers, besides being able to auto-track multiple targets as small as a 5-meter long boat.India has a coastline of 7,516 km along the mainland and islands covering 13 states and union territories. Besides major densely populated cities, a large number of strategic and commercially vital installations as naval bases, nuclear plants, missile and satellite launch centers, ship building docks, oil refineries, industrial units and harbours are located on or adjacent to the coast. There are 13 major and over 200 minor ports in India that handle 90 per cent of the trade.India’s coastline have always been vulnerable to anti-national activities like smuggling of weapons, explosives, contraband and narcotics as well as infiltration of terrorists. In 1993, the sea route was reportedly used to smuggle explosives for the blasts in Mumbai wile in 2008, it was used to infiltrate terrorists for the terror attacks in the same city.After the 2008 attacks, coastal security was reviewed by the central government and several new measures were recommended that were to be implemented in a phased manner. Some of them are still hanging fire due to administrative, technical or financial issues.Peacetime coastal security within Indian territorial waters is the responsibility of the Indian Coast Guard. A surveillance mechanism, called Coastal Surveillance Network (CSN), comprising of a chain of static sensors having radars, automatic identification system, day/night cameras and weather sensors at 46 locations along the coastline and Islands has been established. In addition there are 34 radar stations for surveillance.The Indian Navy has established four Joint Operations Centres (JOC) at Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Kochi and Port Blair, from which all coastal security operations are coordinated. These are manned round the clock by naval and coast guard teams and are also networked with state police and other agencies such as the Intelligence Bureau, Customs and ports authorities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdos-dehradun-lab-to-develop-coastal-and-harbour-surveillance-system-286299

21-07-2021||New Delhi||Human-to-human transmission of bird flu rare, no need to panic: AIIMS chief||As the country reported the first confirmed case of human death due to Avian influenza, AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria on Wednesday said that human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus is very rare and there is no need to panic.However, there is a need to do contact tracing and also take samples and look for any poultry deaths in the area from where the child who died due to the virus was residing, the AIIMS director told PTI.Read alsoA 12-year-old boy from Haryana, who was infected with the H5N1 virus, recently died at AIIMS Delhi.The National Institute of Virology, Pune had confirmed the infection, Dr Guelria said."The transmission of the virus from birds to humans is rare and sustained human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus has not yet been established and therefore there is no need to panic."But then people working closely with poultry must take precautionary measures and maintain proper personal hygiene," Dr Guleria said.Dr Neeraj Nischal, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at AIIMS, said Avian influenza or bird flu is predominately a zoonosis, and there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission so far. "Although few isolated family clusters have been reported, transmission in these clusters may have occurred through common exposure and in rare situation a very close physical contact; there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission via small-particle aerosols," he said."Serologic surveys have not found evidence of asymptomatic infections among contacts of active cases and nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers has not been documented," Dr Nischal said."There is no need to worry if one is eating properly cooked poultry products. There is no evidence so far that it can be spread to people through properly cooked food. The virus gets destroyed when the food is cooked at high temperature. One should avoid contact with infected poultry, especially ill or dying chickens," he said.Dr Guleria said in the past when H5N1 avian flu influenza cases were reported from poultry, culling of poultry in those areas has been done to prevent the spread of infection and tackle it early.The H5N1 is usually transmitted to poultry through migratory birds, he said.People who work in close contact with poultry are at high risk of getting the infection, Guleria added.An AIIMS source had said the 12-year-old boy was admitted to AIIMS on July 2 with pneumonia and leukaemia. He died on July 12. While undergoing treatment, tests for COVID-19 and influenza were conducted. "His samples tested negative for COVID-19. It came out positive for influenza but was non-typable. It was sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune, where they confirmed it to be positive for H5N1 avian influenza," the source had said.Details of the case have been conveyed to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and their team has started surveillance and contact tracing and to see if there are any more cases with similar symptoms with whom the child has come in contact, sources said.Meanwhile, all staff at AIIMS who were exposed to the deceased have been asked to monitor themselves for any symptoms of flu and report to the authorities immediately.In January, some states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Chhattisgarh culled poultry birds after the disease was reported.According to the WHO, almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Currently available epidemiologic information suggests the virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be rare. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 per cent.According to the World Health Organisation poultry and poultry products can be prepared and consumed as usual, with no fear of acquiring infection with the avian flu virus. One should continue to follow good hygienic and cooking practices. The virus is destroyed at a temperature of 70 degrees C for 30 minutes. After handling poultry and eggs, one should clean hands and other exposed parts, it said.

21-07-2021||Melbourne||How does the Pegasus spyware work, and is my phone at risk?||A major journalistic investigation has found evidence of malicious software being used by governments around the world, including allegations of spying on prominent individuals.From a list of more 50,000 phone numbers, journalists identified more than 1,000 people in 50 countries reportedly under surveillance using the Pegasus spyware. The software was developed by the Israeli company NSO Group and sold to government clients.Among the reported targets of the spyware are journalists, politicians, government officials, chief executives and human rights activists.Reports thus far allude to a surveillance effort reminiscent of an Orwellian nightmare, in which the spyware can capture keystrokes, intercept communications, track the device and use the camera and microphone to spy on the user.How did they do it?There's nothing particularly complicated about how the Pegasus spyware infects the phones of victims. The initial hack involves a crafted SMS or iMessage that provides a link to a website. If clicked, this link delivers malicious software that compromises the device.The aim is to seize full control of the mobile device's operating system, either by rooting (on Android devices) or jailbreaking (on Apple iOS devices).Usually, rooting on an Android device is done by the user to install applications and games from non-supported app stores, or re-enable a functionality that was disabled by the manufacturer.Similarly, a jailbreak can be deployed on Apple devices to allow the installation of apps not available on the Apple App Store, or to unlock the phone for use on alternative cellular networks. Many jailbreak approaches require the phone to be connected to a computer each time it's turned on (referred to as a “tethered jailbreak”).Rooting and jailbreaking both remove the security controls embedded in Android or iOS operating systems. They are typically a combination of configuration changes and a “hack” of core elements of the operating system to run modified code.In the case of spyware, once a device is unlocked, the perpetrator can deploy further software to secure remote access to the device's data and functions. This user is likely to remain completely unaware.Most media reports on Pegasus relate to the compromise of Apple devices.The spyware infects Android devices too, but isn't as effective as it relies on a rooting technique that isn't 100% reliable. When the initial infection attempt fails, the spyware supposedly prompts the user to grant relevant permissions so it can be deployed effectively.But aren't Apple devices more secure?Apple devices are generally considered more secure than their Android equivalents, but neither type of device is 100% secure.Apple applies a high level of control to the code of its operating system, as well as apps offered through its app store. This creates a closed-system often referred to as “security by obscurity”. Apple also exercises complete control over when updates are rolled out, which are then quickly adopted by users.Apple devices are frequently updated to the latest iOS version via automatic patch installation. This helps improve security and also increases the value of finding a workable compromise to the latest iOS version, as the new one will be used on a large proportion of devices globally.On the other hand, Android devices are based on open-source concepts, so hardware manufacturers can adapt the operating system to add additional features or optimise performance. We typically see a large number of Android devices running a variety of versions — inevitably resulting in some unpatched and insecure devices (which is advantageous for cybercriminals).Ultimately, both platforms are vulnerable to compromise. The key factors are convenience and motivation. While developing an iOS malware tool requires greater investment in time, effort and money, having many devices running an identical environment means there is a greater chance of success at a significant scale.While many Android devices will likely be vulnerable to compromise, the diversity of hardware and software makes it more difficult to deploy a single malicious tool to a wide user base.How can I tell if I'm being monitored?While the leak of more than 50,000 allegedly monitored phone numbers seems like a lot, it's unlikely the Pegasus spyware has been used to monitor anyone who isn't publicly prominent or politically active.It is in the very nature of spyware to remain covert and undetected on a device. That said, there are mechanisms in place to show whether your device has been compromised.The (relatively) easy way to determine this is to use the Amnesty International Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT). This tool can run under either Linux or MacOS and can examine the files and configuration of your mobile device by analysing a backup taken from the phone.While the analysis won't confirm or disprove whether a device is compromised, it detects “indicators of compromise” which can provide evidence of infection.In particular, the tool can detect the presence of specific software (processes) running on the device, as well as a range of domains used as part of the global infrastructure supporting a spyware network.What can I do to be better protected?Although most people are unlikely to be targeted by this type of attack, there are still simple steps you can take to minimise your potential exposure — not only to Pegasus but to other malicious attacks too.1) Only open links from known and trusted contacts and sources when using your device. Pegasus is deployed to Apple devices through an iMessage link. And this is is the same technique used by many cybercriminals for both malware distribution and less technical scams. The same advice applies to links sent via email or other messaging applications.2) Make sure your device is updated with any relevant patches and upgrades. While having a standardised version of an operating system creates a stable base for attackers to target, it's still your best defence.If you use Android, don't rely on notifications for new versions of the operating system. Check for the latest version yourself, as your device's manufacturer may not be providing updates.3) Although it may sound obvious, you should limit physical access to your phone. Do this by enabling pin, finger or face-locking on the device. The eSafety Commissioner's website has a range of videos explaining how to configure your device securely.4) Avoid public and free WiFi services (including hotels), especially when accessing sensitive information. The use of a VPN is a good solution when you need to use such networks.5) Encrypt your device data and enable remote-wipe features where available. If your device is lost or stolen, you will have some reassurance your data can remain safe.

21-07-2021||Washington||1,19,000 Indian children lost caregivers to Covid during first 14 months of pandemic: Report||More than 1.5 million children in 21 countries, including 1,19,000 from India, lost their primary and secondary caregivers to COVID-19 during the first 14 months of the pandemic, according to a study published in The Lancet.The study funded in part by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), stated that 25,500 children in India lost their mother to Covid-19 while 90,751 lost their father and 12 lost both their parents.The study estimates that 1,134,000 children lost a parent or custodial grandparent due to Covid-19. Of these, 10,42,000 children lost their mother, father or both. Most lost one, not both parents.Overall, 1,562,000 children are estimated to have experienced the death of at least one parent or a custodial or another co-residing grandparent (or other older relative), the NIH said in a media release.The countries with the highest number of children who lost primary caregivers (parents or custodial grandparents) include South Africa, Peru, United States, India, Brazil, and Mexico, it said.The countries with rates of Covid-associated deaths among primary caregivers (>1/1000 children) include Peru, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Iran, United States, Argentina, and Russia, it added."Though the trauma a child experiences after the loss of a parent or caregiver can be devastating, there are evidence-based interventions that can prevent further adverse consequences, such as substance use, and we must ensure that children have access to these interventions," said NIDA Director Nora D Volkow.According to the report, 2,898 Indian children lost either of their custodial grandparents while nine lost both of their custodial grandparents.However, the 0.5 rate of loss of primary and custodial parents per 1,000 children in India is much less than other countries like South Africa (6.4), Peru (14.1), Brazil (3.5), Colombia (3.4), Mexico (5.1), Russia (2.0), and the US (1.8)."When examining how variations by sex and age in deaths and average numbers of children influenced estimates of paternal versus maternal orphans, we found that, with the exception of South Africa, deaths were greater in men than women in every country, particularly in middle-aged and older parents," the report said.

Bharambe revealed that he forged a partnership with his UK-based brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi's Kenrin Limited.Bharambe said, "As he couldn't upload these videos from India on adult app called Hotshot, he provided the content to a foreign platform by sending videos via WeTransfer. All the content was created at his office and sent to a London-based Kenrin Limited, owned by his brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi."Apart from Hotshot, Kundra had another backup planned that was in case this app got banned. It was termed as 'Plan B, Bollyfame'.The police stated that Kundra was aware that he was violating the law as the app Hotshot was banned from Google Playstore and Apple last year.The crime branch has recovered several WhatsApp chats that suggest Raj Kundra's 'Plan B Bollyfame' and talks about removal of "bold" content from Hotshot."The free to download app was yanked off by both Apple and Google Playstore for the type of its content. The Mumbai Police have recovered incriminating evidences like several HotShot films, video clips, WhatsApp chats, etc. during the investigation," Bharambe.As for his earnings, the growth of the business led to Raj Kundra earning in lakhs daily. While he initially earned Rs 2-3 lakh per day, the amount later increased to Rs 6-8 lakh daily. "Documents of financial transactions run into thousands. We are analysing the details to get exact earnings. The same will be treated as proceeds of crime. So far, we have frozen Rs 7.5 crore in various accounts,” Bharambe said.During the press briefing, the police also revealed how new or aspiring actresses coming to Mumbai from all over India were lured with work offers in short films, web series and other movies. "They were called for auditions and after selection made to do bold scenes, which went onto semi-nude and then full-nude shoots. Some of them strongly opposed this and had approached the police," Bharambe said.  However, Raj Kundra aides have denied allegations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raj-kundra-earned-lakhs-daily-from-hotshot-had-another-adult-app-plan-b-bollyfame-as-backup-mumbai-police-286245

The MDL is largely owned by the MoD while L&T is a private entity.The two Indian companies will collaborate with any of the shortlisted foreign submarine makers — Naval Group, France; TKMS, Germany; JSC ROE, Russia; Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co Ltd, South Korea; and Navantia of Spain.A foreign manufacturer will tie-up with an Indian partner to make these submarines under what is termed as strategic partnership (SP) model. This is the first project on which this new ‘SP model” policy is being tried.The project envisages indigenous construction of six conventional submarines.Indian Navy has asked for the vessels to have a fuel-cell based Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology, which allows a vessel to dive for 12-15 days, much more than the 4-5 days of endurance of existing subs.India at present has 17 submarines, including one nuclear powered INS Chakra on a 10-year lease ending March 2022. Meanwhile the US Department of Defence report ‘Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020’ talks about a growing threat from China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ministry-of-defence-invites-bids-for-submarine-project-285973

Husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, Kundra has dabbled in many businesses, including restaurants, precious metals, gaming and TV shows.Born in the UK, Kundra’s first business stint is said to be with pashmina shawls in Nepal that he sold to fashion houses in the UK. Since then, right from diamonds to sports, he has been associated with various enterprises and as many controversies.Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale said, “A case was registered with the Mumbai crime branch in February 2021 on creation of pornographic films and publishing them through apps. We have sufficient evidence against him.”Kundra’s Viaan Industries had a tie-up with London-based firm Kenrin, which owns “Hotshots” app, allegedly involved in publishing porn films, a police official said.“Though the company was registered in London, the content creation, operation of the app and accounting was done through Viaan Industries,” said Milind Bharambe, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime). Kenrin is owned by Kundra’s brother-in-law. Kundra allegedly made money in lakhs through pornographic content.In a 2020 case related to pornography, Kundra allegedly had applied for anticipatory bail last month. Kundra is accused of making struggling artistes act in porn videos.An FIR was registered against Kundra after a woman approached the police in February 2021. The case was later transferred to the crime branch.He was sent to the police custody with his alleged partner Ryan Tharp.Reportedly, some WhatsApp chats between Kundra and his partners are said to be the key evidence in the case. As per reports, in the chats, Kundra and his partners were discussing profit earned, revenue gains and content as shared on the mobile app on which pornographic films were allegedly uploaded.Meanwhile, actress Gehana Vasisth, who is out on bail in connection with the same case, said, “The law will take its course. We have full faith in the Mumbai police, but they should not mix up porn with erotic or bold content.”Ironically, Kundra had written a novel “How Not to Make Money” in 2013.Once co-owned IPL team Rajasthan royals||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/betting-to-porn-racket-raj-kundras-tryst-with-controversy-285974

The purpose of such a move was to reduce stress and enhance the happiness quotient of the troopers, which will effectively reduce the cases of suicides and fratricidal killings.Officials in the ministry said the plan was yet to be made “fully operational” and, hence, the MHA recently sent a communication to these forces to update it about the development of software managing transfers and postings of the personnel.They said as per the plan, the software was going to be the precursor to “at least 100 days with the family per year” proposal. A considerable time has elapsed since the Home Minister gave the direction and the proposal is yet to see the light of day.“It is envisaged that the digitisation of posting and transfer processes for soft, hard and very hard locations will eliminate personal bias and allow a free-and-fair system leading to easy rotation of the troops,” a senior MHA official said.The over 10-lakh personnel strong paramilitary or the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) include the CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF and SSB apart from the Assam Rifles which draws its officer strength from the Army. Officials in the MHA said while the CISF, ITBP and the SSB have developed their respective software, the CRPF, BSF and the Assam Rifles are still in the process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-seeks-report-from-capf-on-100-day-leave-plan-for-jawans-285975

Last time, in such a situation, people faced a severe food shortage, but this time the government ensured that no one slept hungry,” Joshi said quoting the PM.The PM told party MPs that providing relief to the people was their responsibility and not a favour, Joshi said.Meanwhile, according to the sources, the PM asked BJP MPs to effectively counter allegations of the opposition on the government’s Covid-19 response and the availability of vaccines. He also told the MPs that considering the apprehensions of a third Covid-19 wave, they should prepare adequately and be ready for more boots on the ground, they added.He pointed out that in Delhi nearly 20 per cent of frontline workers were still not vaccinated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/counter-opposition-on-covid-response-modi-to-party-cadre-285977

21-07-2021||Srinagar||J&K DGP: Probe into drone attack hints at Pakistan role||Drones have added a new dimension to security threats from terror groups and investigations into the attack on the Jammu IAF station last month show the involvement of “non-state actors” supported by state actors, such as the ordnance factory of Pakistan, J&K DGP Dilbag Singh said on Tuesday.He also pointed out that in the past, drones from across the border had been used to drop currency, arms and ammunition on the Indian territory and with the introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in terror activities, more efforts are required to see to it that this new and emerging threat is neutralised effectively.Singh, a 1987-batch IPS officer, spoke on various issues, and these included the present situation on the militancy front and the new threats that have emerged with the use of drones by terror outfits like the banned Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT).“Drones have come recently. First, that came as a big surprise, but we were able to gear up our resources to counter that threat. We were able to intercept around 32 sorties out of roughly 40 sorties which were made,” he said.“Picking up this kind of a target has added a new dimension to our security threats from terrorists,” Singh said.When asked to give details of investigations into the drone attack on the IAF station in Jammu, he said the probe suggests a couple of things, like the flight path of the drones suggests they came from Pakistan right to the airfield, and the aerial distance from the IAF station to the international border is 14 km. The second and most important part that emerged during the investigation was the expert opinion “suggesting the IEDs might have been fabricated by a well organised unit, such as an ordnance unit,” the DGP said.The other aspect was that the explosive material which was used in the IEDs was RDX and this is not available in the open market. It is a military grade explosive material and definitely must have been sourced from a government agency from across the border, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jk-dgp-probe-into-drone-attack-hints-at-pakistan-role-286114

But the unions insisted only on the repeal of laws.The Congress, RJD, CPI, CPM and the AIMIM also skipped the meeting citing other issues.Asked why the Congress was skipping the meeting, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said, “Why should the PM brief only the floor leaders on the issue of national importance? He should speak in Parliament so that all MPs can listen.”SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “We have been urging the government to call an all-party meeting on farmers’ issues, understand sentiment of farmers and repeal the black laws. Since they are not responsive, we will boycott today’s meeting by the PM.”AAP’s Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann said, “What to speak of attending the PM’s meeting outside Parliament, we will not let him speak even inside Parliament till he adequately responds to the concerns of agitating farmers.”Earlier in the day, farmers’ issues were raised in both Houses and the proceedings remained disrupted.Congress’ Lok Sabha members Manish Tewari and JS Gill and party’s Rajya Sabha MPs Deepender Hooda and Partap Singh Bajwa gave adjournment notices for the suspension of business of the two Houses to discuss the demands of agitating farmers.Akali Dal’s Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Aam Aadmi Party’s Bhagwant Mann also submitted notices for the second straight day.All parties repeated the call to repeal the three laws besides assuring farmers as regards the minimum support price regime and the role of agricultural produce marketing committees. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla disallowed the notices with the Members of Parliament of the Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party vowing to move adjournment motion notices every day during the session.Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu also turned down Deepender Singh Hooda's notice for suspension of business of the House to discuss farmers' stir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-akalis-aap-skip-pms-covid-meeting-over-farmers-stir-285986

It shows 67.6 per cent people above 6 years of age have developed antibodies to the virus, indicating past infection.Balram Bhargava, Director General, ICMROpen primary schools firstChildren can handle viral infections better. Our advice will be to open primary schools first and then secondary sections.Over half of the children surveyed were sero-positive and showed infection, with the ICMR advising the state governments to open primary schools first provided all school staffers have been fully vaccinated.“Children can handle viral infections better. Younger children have lesser ace receptors in the lungs, which the virus uses to bind to the cells. The survey tells us that the level of exposure of children is almost the same as adults. Moreover, the Scandinavian nations didn’t close primary schools through any Covid wave. Our advice would be to open primary schools first and then the secondary sections, but all school staffers must be fully vaccinated,” said Balram Bhargava, Director General, ICMR.The survey shows that a higher proportion of vaccinated people have antibodies. “The sero positivity was 62.3 per cent among the unvaccinated, 81 per cent in those with one vaccine dose and 89.8 per cent in people with both doses,” he said.

There was an acute shortage of sensitivity and truth then. There is an acute shortage of sensitivity and truth now. The reply came in response to a question by Congress Rajya Sabha MP KC Venugopal who asked the Health Ministry whether a large number of Covid patients had died on roads and hospitals due to acute shortage of oxygen during the second wave.In her reply, Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar said, "Health is a state subject. Detailed guidelines for reporting deaths have been issued by the Union Health Ministry to all states and UTs. Accordingly, deaths are being reported on a regular basis, but no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by states/UTs."Mallikarjun Kharge, Rajya Sabha LOP Toll much moreThe govt is giving fake figures (of Covid toll)… it comes to 52.43 lakh.

The Left parties sought a joint parliamentary committee probe.Earlier in Parliament, Congress, NCP, Trinamool, DMK, Left, RJD and Shiv Sena MPs sought accountability and probe, a day after the government rejected snooping allegations as “impossible with the checks and balances of Indian laws”.In the Lok Sabha, Congress and Trinamool MPs flashed placards seeking answers after reports alleging that phones of Rahul Gandhi and TMC member Abhishek Banerjee, the nephew of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, were potential spying targets. The Lok Sabha Speaker’s repeated pleas to the MPs to go back to their seats fell flat as the first adjournment came five minutes after the House assembled and the final one at 3 pm.While the government maintained again today that the allegations were a “conspiracy to defame Indian democracy and disrupt Parliament”, the Opposition flagged the third alleged expose claiming the spyware was used on the eve of the toppling of an elected government in Karnataka.Taking a swipe at Home Minister Amit Shah, who yesterday questioned the chronology of events and the timing of Pegasus leaks, Surjewala said, “You can all see the chronology now. The fact is the Pegasus spyware was used to topple an elected government. The Modi government has murdered the people’s mandate. This is treason. Who knows further exposes reveal that the Congress’ Madhya Pradesh government was similarly toppled.”Earlier, leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge held a joint opposition meeting after which the parties moved common adjournment notices on the spyware issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/treason-opposition-wants-sc-led-or-jpc-probe-into-pegasus-snoopgate-285989

They were reportedly selected for potential targeting when the Congress-JD(S) government was attempting to win back the rebels, but failed to do so. The rebel MLAs, who were disqualified by the Speaker, later joined the BJP and most of them won the bypolls on its ticket. In the absence of digital forensics, it is not possible to establish whether any of these phones were infected or even subjected to an attempted hack.A spokesperson for Israeli technology firm NSO, which owns Pegasus software, said the so-called list had no connection with the company. “It is not a list of targets or potential targets of NSO’s customers, and your repeated reliance on this list and association of the people on this list as potential surveillance targets is false and misleading,” said the spokesperson.The claim about Imran Khan and the diplomats was made by the French newspaper Le Monde, which wrote a list of potential targets from 2017-21, including Delhi-based diplomats and ambassadors such as the Pakistan’s High Commissioner to India.Ministry of External Affairs officials said so far no country had raised the issue with them in their meetings.The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also had no comment to offer. There was no reaction from Hari Menon, the India head of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.France, meanwhile, has become the first country to open a probe into charges of Morocco having targeted its journalists. The investigation will examine 10 different charges, including whether there was a breach of personal privacy, fraudulent access to personal electronic devices and criminal association.The Indian Government has said, “There has been no unauthorised interception by government agencies.” Pegasus, a military grade software used in 40 countries, can access all data on a mobile phone and turn it into an audio or video recorder.France first nation to order investigationFrance has become the first country to open a probe into charges of Morocco having targeted its journalists via Pegasus.‘Operation lotus’ 2019||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-leak-before-cong-jds-govt-fell-aides-of-hdk-siddaramaiah-may-have-been-snooped-285990

21-07-2021||Mumbai||‘Web’ of deceit, firms, apps: Cops say Raj Kundra co was running ops of UK entity linked to porn||A company of businessman Raj Kundra, arrested in a porn films case, was running operations for a London-based firm floated by a close relative which was into producing pornographic content for India, the Mumbai police claimed on Tuesday.Kundra (45), husband of Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty, was arrested by the crime branch on Monday night in a case, which it said, related to alleged creation of pornographic films and publishing them through some apps.On Tuesday, he was produced before a court which remanded him in police custody till July 23.Kundra’s Viaan Industries had a tie-up with London-based company Kenrin, which owns ‘Hotshots’ app,  allegedly involved in publishing pornographic films, a senior police official said.Read also“Though the company was registered in London, the content creation, operation of the app and accounting was done through Kundra’s Viaan Industries,” said Milind Bharambe, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), at a press briefing.Kenrin is owned by the brother-in-law of Kundra, he said.The police have gathered evidence which establishes connections between the two business entities, the officer said.They have found their WhatsApp groups, e-mail exchanges, accounting details and some porn films after a search of Kundra’s Mumbai office, Bharambe said.“As incriminating evidence was collected in this case, we arrested Raj Kundra and his IT head Ryan Thorpe,” he said, adding “our probe in the case is on”.“We have not been able to any find any active role of Shilpa Shetty yet,” he added.On Monday, the police had described Kundra as the “key conspirator” of the case, which was registered on February 4 at the Malwani police station in suburban Mumbai.Speaking about the delay in Kundra’s arrest in the case in which a charge-sheet was filed in April, Bharambe said there were many electronic evidence to be scanned to build a strong case.Transfer of money, real ownership of accounts, the content and publisher were to be verified before the police could take coercive action, he added.The police found transfer of money in various bank accounts, Bharambe said, adding victims of the porn films racket used to get only a few thousands rupees.During the investigation, it came to light that a company named Armsprime had prepared the app (Hotshots) for Kenrin and there were individual apps also, he said.Viaan Industries had an agreement with Kenrin about the responsibility of content creation and money for that used to be transferred to Kundra’s firm by the UK-based entity, the police officer said.Subscription money (for using apps) used to come in the name of Kenrin though the management was from Mumbai, he said.Before the Mumbai crime branch took over the case, there was a complaint with the Maharashtra Cyber about the racket, Bharambe said.The Malwani police had filed FIRs on the basis of complaints received from two women, while another one woman had submitted a complaint at the Lonavla Police Station, around 120km from Mumbai, he said.The Mumbai crime branch had started investigation into the case after some victims  approached the Malwani police station in February 2021, he said.During investigation it came to light that some small-time artistes were lured by giving them break in some web series or short stories, he said.These actors were called for auditions and were asked to give ‘bold’ scenes, which later turned out to be semi-nude or nude scenes, which were against the wishes of the actors, Bharambe said.During the investigation, it also came to light that there were many porn-related  apps which were operating in the cyber world, he said.The police then arrested producer Roma Khan, her husband, actress Gehna Vashishth, director Tanveer Hashmi and Umesh Kamath (who used to look after India operations of Kundra’s firm), he said.In all, 11 persons have been arrested so far in the case, the police officer said.The crime branch has so far frozen at least Rs 7.50 crore in various accounts of apps operators as a crime proceeds, he said, adding there are some wanted accused too.“After the investigation, we laid our hands on some documentary evidence, some electronic evidence and some other evidence that came to us,” the officer said.Because of the content, the app at the centre of the racket was taken down from the Apple store in June 2020, he said.“As of now what we see is that Kenrin might have got established only to bypass laws because in India it was not allowed...but all the content creation, operations and account management were done in Mumbai,” he said.

21-07-2021||New Delhi||India may become first country to have DNA-based Covid vaccine: Mandaviya||Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday said several Indian companies are increasing their production of Covid-19 vaccines and that the country may become the first in the world to develop a DNA-based vaccine.Replying to a short duration discussion on Covid-19 management in Rajya Sabha, the minister said technology transfer to several companies has started and they will begin production in the coming days to reduce vaccine shortage in the country.Read also“Cadila has completed third phase trial of its DNA vaccine and has applied for emergency use authorisation before DCGI (Drugs Controller General of India). Our expert team is looking into it. When this will come in the market, India will be the only country where scientists have developed a DNA vaccine,” Mandaviya said in Rajya Sabha.He said that the country has started getting 11-12 crore doses of Serum Institute’s Covishield vaccine per month and Bharat Biotech will supply 3.5 crore doses of its Covid vaccine in August.He said that the states are given vaccine availability projections 15 days in advance and that it’s their responsibility to plan the inoculation drive accordingly.The minister said that Biological E is conducting third phase of trial of its vaccine and it is expected to come in the market by September-October with 7.5 crore doses.“Zydus Cadila and Bharat Biotech have started trials on children. I expect their trials to be successful. We need to trust our scientists. I trust my scientists and indigenous companies,” Mandaviya said.On the allegation of suppressing Covid deaths, the minister said that the registration of Covid deaths is done by states and that the central government has never asked any state to record less deaths or cases.It is not appropriate to say that the Covid third wave will hit children more, the minister stressed citing experience of the previous waves.Mandaviya told the House that 316 oxygen plants out of the total 1,573 planned have been commissioned and the rest will start operations by August-end.Earlier, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge said that the government’s Covid-19 death toll figure of 4-5 lakh is “false” and conservative and claimed the average number of deaths cannot be less than 52.4 lakh so far in the country.

Health workers showed the highest sero prevalence at 85.2 pc.
