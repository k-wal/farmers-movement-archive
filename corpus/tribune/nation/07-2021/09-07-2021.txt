He sought to stall the probe by the state agency, and has demanded that the matter be probed by the CBI or other independent agencies,” Bhaduri said.Based on documents recovered during the raids, Raipur police had, on Thursday, registered a sedition case against Singh for allegedly promoting enmity and hatching a conspiracy against the established government and public representatives.

09-07-2021||Pune||Exposed on OBC quota, Maha government got 12 BJP MLAs suspended: Fadnavis||Twelve BJP MLAs were suspended from the Maharashtra Assembly for a year because the state government got exposed on the issue of OBC quota in local bodies, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Friday.Talking to reporters here, he said the two-day monsoon that concluded recently was conducted in a "one-sided manner" and when his party MLAs tried to protest against this "locking up of democracy", the MVA government got the 12 MLAs suspended claiming they had misbehaved with presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav. "When the MVA government realised it had been exposed, it suspended 12 of our MLAs. Not a single MLA from the BJP hurled abuses at Jadhav or indulged in manhandling. Yes, there were heated arguments. It (suspension) was pre planned and pre meditated," he said. On the suicide of MPSC aspirant Swapnil Lonkar in Hadapsar area here some days ago, Fadnavis said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar's statement on filling up MPSC vacancies as well as appointment of MPSC board members getting completed by July end showed the government was not serious about the issue. "Pawar said Lonkar's appointment was halted due to stay on SEBC quota. However, Lonkar belongs to the OBC category. The state government cannot shrug off responsibility this way," the BJP leader said. On renowned scholar Professor Hari Narke's claim that the previous BJP government had tried to seek empirical data (on OBCs) from the Centre, Fadnavis said he had told the Assembly at the time that the case was about quota going above 50 per cent in five districts in the state. "We sought empirical data from the Centre to justify this quota going above 50 per cent in five districts. When the Centre declined to give this data, we issued an ordinance and reservation above 50 per cent was saved. Professor Narke is a leader of society and should not talk like the spokesperson of a party," Fadnavis said. He also rubbished Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana's claim that Rajya Sabha MP Bhagwat Karad was made a Union minister to finish off the career of former MLA Pankaja Munde. Fadnavis said Karad was closely associated with late Gopinath Munde, and Pankaja Munde was more than happy than anyone else on Karad becoming minister as he is like family to them. On the Shiv Sena opposing the creation of a cooperation ministry at the Centre since cooperatives etc were part of the state subject, Fadnavis said the National Cooperative Development Corporation had been giving funds to state-level milk federations. sugar mills, textile units etc. He said the new ministry, created for the first time in 70 years, will benefit sectors associated with it in all states, including Maharashtra. He reminded detractors that the Centre had revived the fortunes of the sugar sector by giving minimum support price, packages and an attractive ethanol policy. The former CM also added that Union Home Minister Amit Shah was given charge of this ministry as he was part of the cooperative sector earlier and had a great deal of knowledge about it. "Now it is another fact that some people develop cold feet when certain things or a ministry goes to Amit bhai," Fadnavis quipped. Queried on rising fuel prices, he said Maharashtra was levying "tax on tax", which had led to petrol retailing at Rs 104 per litre in the state while it was between Rs 90-92 in neighbouring Gujarat. He ridiculed the combativeness of the state government towards the BJP-led dispensation at the Centre by claiming: "In this government, if any minister is beaten by his wife, they will blame the Centre for the same". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/exposed-on-obc-quota-maha-government-got-12-bjp-mlas-suspended-fadnavis-280591

09-07-2021||New Delhi||Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh summoned by ED in money laundering case||The ED is soon expected to question and record the statement of former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh in a money laundering case linked to his allegation of a Rs 100 crore bribery-cum-extortion racket in the state police establishment that led to the resignation of former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, officials said on Friday.They said 59-year-old Singh has been issued summons to appear before the investigating officer of the case in Mumbai and the senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer has sought some time to depose apparently owing to an health issue.The summons has been issued to Singh some time ago as part of the investigation into the case involving him and Deshmukh, they said.Singh, a 1988-batch IPS officer, is currently the director general of Maharashtra Police home guards unit.He was removed as the Mumbai Commissioner of Police (CP) after multiple investigations were launched into an instance of security scare that was reported from near the Mumbai house of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani in the capital city of Maharashtra.The investigation in the alleged bribery case gathered pace after the ED late last month raided the premises of Deshmukh, 72, and his aides in Nagpur and Mumbai and later arrested two of his staffers.The former home minister was also summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) thrice but he skipped the dates.Deshmukh, some days ago, moved the Supreme Court seeking protection from any coercive action by the ED in this money laundering case.The ED case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations of at least Rs 100 crore bribery made by Singh.In his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the police commissioner’s post, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked suspended Mumbai Police assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Deshmukh had to resign from his post in April following the allegations and he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.The ED has questioned Waze in this case twice at the Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai and it is expected that it may grill him again on Saturday after it obtained a court permission to record his statement for three days.Waze is in jail after he was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with a case related to parking of an explosives laden SUV near the residence of Ambani and the murder case of businessman Mansukh Hiran.He had also told the ED that he attended a meeting at the official residence of the former home minister Deshmukh wherein he was given a list of bar and restaurant owners and asked to “collect Rs 3 lakh per month” from each of these businesses in Mumbai.

09-07-2021||New Delhi||No case of SARS-CoV-2's Lambda variant found in India yet: Centre||No case of the Lambda variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been found in India so far, the government said on Friday.Responding to a question at a press briefing, joint secretary in the health ministry, Lav Agarwal, said Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is closely monitoring the variant."Lambda was the seventh variant of interest identified by the WHO (World Health Organisation) on June 14 and it has been detected in 25 countries," he said. "In our country, no cases have been reported and INSACOG is monitoring it and we are watchful. In Peru, 80 per cent of infections were from this variant. It has also been found in South American countries and also in the UK and European countries, and any public health impact will be monitored," Agarwal said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul said the Lambda variant is a variant of interest so its total significance is still being explored."As far as we know it has not entered our country, we have not detected this variant in our country. Our surveillance system INSACOG is very effective and it will detect it if it happens to enter our country because when you do sequencing, all this will be picked up. So we should watch for that," he said. Paul said the Lambda strain is a variant of interest which means its public health significance is being watched but it has not been proven for excessive transmissibility, for impact on excess severity, or any other public health issues like those related to vaccines. "We should be watchful for these variants because the virus is under pressure and when it goes under pressure then it tends to pick up characteristics that tend to help it in survival but as of now we should be watching such variants for their presence in our country but as of now we have no evidence that this has been detected in any part of our country," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-case-of-sars-cov-2s-lambda-variant-found-in-india-yet-centre-280550
09-07-2021||New Delhi||India welcomes greater Russian interest in Asia Pacific||In the run-up to this year’s summit meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Valdimir Putin, Foreign Ministers of India and Russia on Friday discussed Indo-Pacific ties and the situation of Afghanistan, and vaccine certificates for foreign travel besides reviewing progress in their bilateral strong-points of defence, space, nuclear energy and petroleum.Discussing the contentious topic of Indo-Pacific where the shadow of Quad makes Russia uneasy, Jaishankar invited Moscow to be a more active participant and assured that New Delhi’s endeavors will reflect the multi-polar and rebalanced character of politics. “Because of larger geopolitical compatibility with Russia, we see a more active Russian presence and participation the region as something very important,” he said, adding that “we are very much committed to the centrality and unity of ASEAN.”Speaking at a joint press conference with his counterpart in Moscow, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar noted that energy cooperation had grown very significantly in the last few years, reflected in new potential investments and long term commitments in oil and gas. Defence and industrial collaboration has been strengthened with Jaishankar pointing out that the Russian interest in the make-in-India program is very visible.India and Russia are making common cause in the issue of vaccine certificates, with Jaishankar stating:  “If people have been tested before travel and on arrival that is a good basis. Some have introduced the concept of vaccination, so we will have to reach some understanding to ensure we are not discriminated against”.Concerned over the direction of events in Afghanistan due to its direct implications for regional security, Jaishankar said: “we believe the immediate need of the day is reduction in violence if we have to see peace within and around Afghanistan. It is important for India and Russia to work together to ensure much of the progress on economic, social and democratic terms is maintained”.Jaishankar said though in many cases whether there is volatility, we leave it to the people of the country to work it out. Afghanistan is a different case because for more than 30 years it has had implications for regional stability. “We must see a reduction in violence. It can’t be a solution for the situation in Afghanistan. Who governs Afghanistan has a legitimacy aspect to it,” he observed.Going beyond established areas, Jaishankar noted a “new dimension” which will be talks in the two plus two format or the two foreign and defence ministers meeting simultaneously. Talks also in this sphere covered greater inter-regional cooperation with the Russian Far East and some agreements in this regard will be signed. The two foreign ministers also discussed connectivity, especially the North-South corridor. “Overall the sense of economic cooperation was very positive,” said Jaishankar.On regional and global issues, Jaishankar said as India is poised to hold the Presidency of the UN Security Council for August he shared with Lavrov New Delhi’s plans and ideas for that month. As India is the current chairman of BRICS and RIC, and the SCO Foreign Minister will meet next week in Dushanbe, theJaishankar said the Indo-Russia relationship had shown that though many things are changing as a result of the Covid pandemic, “Our time-tested and trust-based relationship remains strong and continues to grow. We see that in different ways”. He appreciated Russian support during the second wave when four consignments were flown in on a very-expedited basis. India has also become a partner in the production and use of Sputnik vaccine. “It is good for the two of us but also positive for the rest of the world,” he noted.When the annual bilateral summit takes place this year, the development of cooperation will be very much on display, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-welcomes-greater-russian-interest-in-asia-pacific-280543
09-07-2021||New Delhi||Maharashtra, Kerala reported 53 pc of India's total Covid cases last week: Centre||Maharashtra and Kerala recorded more than half of the Covid-19 cases registered in India last week, the Centre said on Friday, as it stressed that the pandemic is far from over and there is no room for complacency.In a press conference, a senior official said, "The country is still dealing with the second wave, and we need to introspect if we can afford misplaced belief that Covid-19 is over."The government said visuals from tourist spots and the way people are mingling without following Covid protocols is "a serious cause of concern" and that such negligence will increase the risk of virus spread.Joint secretary in the health ministry Lav Agarwal referred to recent spikes in cases in some countries, including Russia and the UK, to caution people against lowering their guard.He pitched for strictly following Covid-19 protocols such as wearing of mask and maintaining of physical distancing.He said more than half of the Covid-19 cases reported in India last week were from two states—Maharashtra (21 per cent) and Kerala (32 per cent)—and stressed on following containment measures.The official said 80 per cent of the new Covid cases in India are reported from 90 districts in 15 states and union territories, which indicates the need for focussed attention in these areas.He also said 66 districts across 17 states and UTs reported Covid-19 positivity rate of more than 10 per cent in the week ending July 8.The government said no case of Lambda variant of Covid-19 has been reported in India.India logged 43,393 new coronavirus infections taking the total tally of cases to 3,07,52,950, while the active cases have declined to 4,58,727, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday.The death toll has climbed to 4,05,939 with 911 fresh fatalities.NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said Covid-19 in pregnant women can increase certain risks like pre-term delivery, that is why it is important for them to take vaccine. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-kerala-reported-53-pc-of-indias-total-covid-cases-last-week-centre-280539
09-07-2021||New Delhi||35 percent of India's tiger ranges are outside protected areas: Report||Thirty-five per cent of India's tiger ranges are outside protected areas and human-animal conflict affects over 75 per cent of the world's wild cat species, according to a new report.The study, which has been done by WWF and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) with contribution from 155 experts from 40 organisations based in 27 countries, also stated that human-wildlife conflict is the greatest threat to animals."Currently, 35 per cent of India's tiger range, 40 per cent of the African lion range and 70 per cent of the African and Asian elephant ranges are outside protected areas," said the report—'A future for all-The need for human-wildlife coexistence'."Marine species, such as turtles and whales, that travel thousands of kilometres annually, are also increasingly interacting with people. With so much overlap, effective HWC (human-wildlife conflict) management becomes increasingly necessary," it said.The report said that human-wildlife conflict—when struggles to arise from people and animals coming into contact—often leads to killing of animals in self-defence or as pre-emptive or retaliatory, which can drive species to extinction."Marine and terrestrial protected areas cover only 9.67 per cent of the globe, and most of these protected areas are disconnected from each other. Therefore, many species depend on human-dominated spaces for their survival, and shared landscapes where both humans and wildlife exist outside protected areas play an increasingly important role for the survival of key species such as large predators and herbivores," the report said.It said that many other terrestrial and marine carnivore species such as polar bears and Mediterranean monk seals and large herbivores such as elephants are also getting affected due to HWC."In India, data from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change indicates that over 500 elephants were killed between 2014-2015 and 2018-2019, most related to human-elephant conflict. During the same period, 2,361 people were killed as a result of conflict with elephants," the report said.According to it, India faces an increasing challenge of human wildlife conflict, which is driven by development pressures."With the world's second-largest human population along with the largest wild populations of tigers, Asian elephants, One-horned rhinos, Asiatic lions, and other globally threatened species, India faces urgent problems of human wildlife conflict that must be addressed to achieve a socially just form of conservation. India's elephants probably embody the problem the best," it said.Elephants in India are restricted to just three- four per cent of their original habitat, with their remaining range plagued by deforestation, invasive species, and climate change. This is pushing elephants to seek resources outside of forests and protected areas, the report said."As a result, marginalised people face the brunt of elephants' increasing reliance on crops. As many as 500 people are killed by elephants, and thousands of families face crop and property loss to elephants annually," it said.Margaret Kinnaird, Global Wildlife Practice Leader at WWF, said the global wildlife population has fallen by an average of 68 per cent since 1970."Within a human lifetime, we have already seen extraordinary and unparalleled changes to our planet. Global wildlife populations have fallen an average of 68 per cent since 1970. Human-wildlife conflict, in combination with other threats, has driven the significant decline of species that were once abundant, and species that are naturally less abundant have been pushed to the brink of extinction," Kinnaird said.Unless urgent action is taken, this devastating trend will only worsen, wreaking detrimental and, in some cases, irreversible impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, Kinnaird said.According to Director of UNEP's Ecosystems Division Susan Gardner, this report is a clarion call to elevate the problem of HWC and give it the attention it deserves in national and international processes."It is a call for the adoption of approaches that identify and address the deeper, underlying causes of conflict while developing systemic solutions with affected communities as active and equal participants in the process. As demonstrated in many of the case studies in this report, coexistence is both possible and attainable," she said.The report said that "while people the world over reap the benefits of maintaining flourishing wildlife populations - healthy ecosystems that allow us to survive, provide food and enable livelihoods - catastrophic impacts such as injury and death and the loss of property and livelihoods put tremendous stress on those who live alongside wildlife, often in developing nations rich in biodiversity, leading to financial insecurity and poor physical and mental health".It said completely eradicating human-wildlife conflict is not possible, but that well-planned, integrated approaches to managing it can reduce conflicts."An example of this can be seen in Sonitpur District, Assam, where large-scale deforestation and degradation were driving increases in elephant crop-raiding that led to accidental human deaths and retaliatory killings of elephants," it said.WWF India during 2003-2004 developed the Sonitpur Model, by which community members were connected with the state forest department and given training on how to work with them to drive elephants away from crop fields safely and human habitations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/35-percent-of-indias-tiger-ranges-are-outside-protected-areas-report-280537

09-07-2021||New Delhi||Police on look out for third suspect in murder case of former Union minister's wife||Three Delhi Police teams are conducting raids to nab the third suspect in the murder of Kitty Kumaramangalam, the wife of late Union minister P Rangaraja Kumaramangalam, police said on Friday.The late Union minister's wife was smothered to death on Tuesday night during an attempted robbery at her home in southwest Delhi's Vasant Vihar, police said.The police had arrested two accused—Raju (24) and Rakesh Raj, (34)—and taken them into police remand for two days on Thursday, officials said.Raids are being conducted in Rajasthan and areas in and around the national capital to nab Suraj, the third suspect in the case, who is suspected to have fled to Jaipur with the robbed gold ornaments to sell them, the police said."We have deployed three teams who have been working round-the-clock to locate and nab Suraj. His last location was near Jaipur in Rajasthan, but he keeps switching off his mobile phone. Technical surveillance has also been mounted to track him," a senior police officer said.Financial crisis during the Covid pandemic and the greed for money led the three men to execute the murder-cum-robbery, which they had been planning for over a month, police said.The victim was an easy target for them as Raju had been working in the area as a washerman for over five years and visited the victim's house on a regular basis, the officer said.As Raju kept the washed clothes back in the victim's cupboard on many occasions because she trusted him and had known him personally, he was aware of the locker and the valuables kept inside the cupboard, police said.The locker looted by the accused was recovered from Raju on Wednesday, the day he was arrested, but it only had essential documents while Rs 60,000 robbed cash was recovered after Rakesh was arrested, they said.The scooty on which the three accused had arrived to execute their plan, has also been recovered, as their entry into the building was captured on a CCTV camera, police said."The two accused have confessed to their crime, but the actual truth will be known after the third suspect is nabbed and interrogated, following which each of their versions will be corroborated," the officer said.The 70-year-old lawyer was smothered to death on Tuesday night by the three men during the attempted robbery. They first overpowered the victim's house help Mithila, who sustained injuries but was left alive as the accused were in hurry to escape after executing the robbery.P Rangarajan Kumaramangalam served as a Union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government between 1998 and 2001. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-on-look-out-for-third-suspect-in-murder-case-of-former-union-ministers-wife-280525
09-07-2021||New Delhi||Apollo study evaluates patient data of 2 years to assess impact on non-Covid services||Seeking to get a broader understanding of the impact of Covid-19 on healthcare delivery system, a leading private facility in Delhi has conducted an observational study based on data related to patients spanning two years, hospital authorities said on Friday.The study included a thorough observation on the impact of the pandemic on various medical and surgical specialities, since the onset of the pandemic, and compared it with the preceding pre-pandemic period (June 1, 2019-March 31, 2020).The first case of Covid-19 in Delhi was reported on March 1, 2020 and over 14.34 lakh cases have been recorded till date, as per official figures.The study is titled 'Severe impact of Covid-19 pandemic on non-Covid patient care and health delivery: An observational study from a large multi-speciality hospital of India'. It was done by Apollo hospital here, and was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Sciences in July.The pandemic period considered for the study was April 2020 to March 21, hence the data on cases during the second wave (April-June) of the Covid-19 is not included in it, a spokesperson of the hospital said."The study evaluated the data of 6,77,237 cases (599,281 outpatients and 77,956 hospital admissions) in the past two years (pandemic and pre-pandemic)," said P Shivakumar, Managing Director, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals here.It found that there was a "significant effect" of the Covid-19 pandemic on most spheres of clinical practice, including the outpatient attendance and elective surgeries, officials said."Attendance of both new and follow-up cases dropped by 57.65 per cent. The outpatient cases attendance saw a significant reduction of 89.2 per cent, followed by a reduction of 80.75 per cent in surgical work," Shivakumar said.Going forward, healthcare providers need to factor in the impact of fear which resulted in patients ignoring their healthcare needs, which can be detrimental, he added.The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare delivery across the globe. The entire healthcare delivery facilities had to undergo a transformation to combat the spread of this highly infectious viral disease, doctors said.The mandatory travel restrictions and increasing Covid-19 cases have had a significant impact on the healthcare delivery system, they said.The only medical speciality that saw more patients was respiratory medicine with a significant increase of 314.04 per cent in admissions, because of Covid-19 factor, said Dr Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director, Apollo Hospitals Group."The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on both the hospital's major medical and surgical specialties. The surgical work was reduced significantly across all the specialties, with bariatric surgery (87.5 per cent) and ophthalmology (65.45 per cent), being affected the most and general surgery (32.28 per cent), and neurosurgery the least," he said.It was observed that all the medical and surgical specialities dealing more with critical and emergency care were less affected than the others. The most urgent surgical and interventional work was undertaken with due precautions, such as liver (56.46 per cent) and kidney (54.89 per cent) transplants, urgent neurosurgery (65.62 per cent), cardiac surgery (44.56 per cent), and surgical oncology (53.6 per cent)," Sibal said, sharing data from the study.Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Fortis hospital, Max hospital, were among the leading private facilities which saw a huge rush of Covid patients, confirmed and suspected, during the pandemic period in 2020 in the national capital.Senior consultant, orthopaedics at Apollo hospital, and co-author of the study, Dr Raju Vaishya, said, "In the pandemic period spanning, April 2020–March 2021, the number of admissions for Covid-19 was 3,746. The number of admissions for Covid-19 cases accounted for 12.09 per cent of the total number of admissions (30,975) in that year. The backlog of patients who didn't seek care will now be addressed, and patients should no longer delay availing care".Doctors at leading government and private hospitals had earlier said that as the majority of the machinery is engaged in fighting the deadly Covid on a war-footing and movement restrictions were in place, non-Covid patients who needed surgeries or have issues and have to be examined physically and pregnant women were especially at a loss. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/apollo-study-evaluates-patient-data-of-2-years-to-assess-impact-on-non-covid-services-280523

No doubts will remain about when the lockdown will be imposed or when it will open. In the meeting, there was also discussion about the Delta plus variant. We have to stop this variant from spreading in Delhi, for which the government is taking all necessary steps," Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.The colour codes based on positivity rate (on two consecutive days), cumulative number of new cases (over a week) and average oxygenated-bed occupancy (for a week) will designate four levels of alerts.The graded response will involve restricting economic activities as per the level of alert linked with the severity of the pandemic. Shops and establishments of essential goods and services will be allowed to open during all the four levels of alerts."After detailed deliberations and presentations made by the health department and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), it was decided to notify the Graded Response Action Plan that will objectively and transparently ensure an institutional and automatic response in regard to enforcement measures, lockdowns and unlock based on criteria such as test positivity rate and quantum of cases,” an expert present at the meeting said.Concerns arising out of new variants such as Delta Plus and LAMBDA were discussed at length and measures like vaccination, genome sequencing, testing, tracking and surveillance were suggested as the most effective steps to mitigate their spread, experts said.People travelling in large numbers to tourist destinations and violating Covid-19-related guidelines were also flagged as an area of concern, they said The meeting also stressed on having 12,000 ICU beds, sufficient oxygen, drugs and ambulances etc to deal with another surge in cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/graded-response-plan-to-deal-with-possible-third-covid-wave-passed-by-ddma-kejriwal-280515
09-07-2021||New Delhi||HC dismisses illegal detention plea by student activist Gulfisha Fatima; calls it misplaced, not maintainable||The Delhi High Court Friday dismissed a plea on behalf of student activist Gulfisha Fatima, claiming her detention in a Delhi riots case to be illegal, saying it was “completely misplaced” and “not maintainable”.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the writ of habeas corpus would not lie in respect of a person who is in judicial custody.A habeas corpus petition is filed seeking direction to produce a person who is missing or illegally detained.“The facts will show that the petitioner is in judicial custody and detention, therefore, cannot be termed as illegal,” the bench said.It further said if Fatima is aggrieved by court orders passed in judicial proceedings before the trial court, she has the legal remedy to challenge them before appropriate forum in proper proceedings.“This petition is completely misplaced and not maintainable. Same is accordingly dismissed,” the bench said. In the habeas corpus petition, Fatima, through her sibling, claimed that her custody in an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case relating to the alleged larger conspiracy that led to the north-east Delhi riots last year was illegal and she should thus be released.During the hearing, the bench asked advocate Jatin Bhatt, representing Fatima, whether he was willing to withdraw the plea as it was of the view that writ of habeas corpus was not maintainable in this case.To this, the counsel said his instructions were not to withdraw.Advocate Amit Mahajan, representing Delhi Police, said the habeas corpus petition filed by Fatima was not maintainable and it was nothing but blatant abuse of the process of law and deserves to the dismissed with cost.He also told the court that a habeas corpus petition by Fatima's brother on the same relief was dismissed by the high court last year.On July 5, another bench of the high court refused to hear the matter after taking a strong exception to Fatima's advocate Mehmood Pracha taking recourse to “heckling” and placing reliance on facts that were not on record.The previous bench had recused and directed that the petition be placed before another bench.Asserting that the petition is not maintainable, the police reply stated that on September 16, 2020, the charge sheet was filed before the trial court against Fatima and other accused and cognisance was taken the next day and the woman is in judicial custody pursuant to the trial court's order, therefore, her detention in judicial custody is legal and valid.Fatima was arrested in the case on April 11 last year and is currently under judicial custody. Besides this, she is also accused in three other riots related cases. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24, 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

Also, action will be taken against those without masks and not following social-distancing.  Also read: Police to be stricter on tourists to abide Covid norms in Kullu-ManaliThe new norms have come into force days after a video went viral on social media that showed a large number of tourists bathing at Kempty Falls without wearing masks or maintaining social-distancing.Like Uttarakhand, Himachal, too, has been facing a similar predicament. The overcrowding of tourists at most hill stations in the state, with social-distancing norms being thrown to the winds, is giving anxious moments to the locals as well as health experts.Most popular towns like Shimla, Kullu-Manali, Kasauli, Dharamsala-McLeodganj and Dalhousie are bursting at the seams as tourists are rushing to hills to escape the sweltering heat of the plains. The callous and irresponsible behaviour of tourists, who are roaming around without masks, littering around and engaged in spat with policemen trying to discipline them has angered even the locals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-viral-video-only-50-tourists-allowed-at-a-time-at-kempty-falls-in-mussoorie-280469

Localisation also allows developing local solutions to local challenges by empowering provincial and local levels of government."There is no 'one size fits all' approach for localisation, but we can certainly share experience and learn from each other," he said.Tirumurti said that the global pandemic is threatening to disrupt the “Decade of Action”."It goes without saying that we need to work together collectively to ensure that all countries, especially vulnerable ones, stay their course on the 2030 SDG Agenda," he said.

Maurya, who was in Ayodhya, lashed out at then CM Mulayam Singh Yadav and lamented that the SP government had fired bullets at unarmed Ram devotees, who had come for Ram Lalla “darshan”.Reacting to the state government’s proposition, senior UP Congress leader Rashid Alvi said the BJP came to power on the promise of establishing “Ram rajya”. “But after almost five years now, the state government has left people with no choice but to chant ‘Ram nam satya hai’,” he said.This, he said, was evident from what happened in the state during the second Covid wave, with hundreds of bodies floating in the Ganga.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-name-roads-after-kar-sevaks-killed-in-ayodhya-up-dy-cm-280426

The international community is well aware of Pakistan’s credentials when it comes to terrorism. “This is acknowledged by none other than its own leadership, which continues to glorify terrorists like Osama Bin Laden as ‘martyrs’,” said Bagchi.The MEA also said it was not abandoning Afghanistan as was suggested by some media reports.

The people belonging to the ruling party are openly throttling democracy and the police administration is watching this murder of democracy as mute spectators. The ruling partymen indulged in anarchy and violence during the nomination-filing process held on Thursday and made a mockery of democracy,” he said in a release issued by the SP.Yadav said former Uttar Pradesh Assembly speaker Mata Prasad Pandey’s car was damaged in Siddharthnagar district’s Etwa block.He also said the nomination papers of his party candidate in Hardoi’s Sandi block were torn while in Sambhal, Basti Ka Gaur, Jhansi’s Baragaon block, Sitapur’s Kasmanda block, Kanpur’s Bilhaur and Shivrajpur, Bulandshahr, Lalitpur, Unnao, Ghazipur, Gorakhpur, Mahrajganj’s Siswa, Paratawal, Paniyara, Sadar, Deoria’s Bhatni, Chitrakoot’s Manikpur and Karvi, Etah’s Marhra, BJP workers created hurdles in the nomination-filing process of the SP-backed candidates.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister cited similar cases in Bahraich and Mahrajganj, where he said SP workers were beaten up when they protested against such tactics and were injured. Journalists were beaten up and taken hostage in Kannauj while covering the nomination process, he said, alleging that the administrative officers are working as the agents of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“This is an act of polluting the democratic system,” Yadav said.The SP chief also demanded fresh arrangements to give another opportunity to the candidates who have not been able to file their nominations or that the entire process is carried out again.“The BJP has done a lot of harm to democracy. Constitutional rights are being violated in Uttar Pradesh. Candidates are being threatened. In many districts, the BJP did not allow the nomination process. The nomination papers of the SP candidates were snatched,” he alleged.“There is a huge public anger against the BJP, they will do full justice in the Assembly polls in 2022,” Yadav added.The State Election Commission (SEC) had on July 5 issued the notification for the election to the posts of chairpersons of the kshetra panchayats in the state for which nominations were filed between 11 am to 3 pm on Thursday.The last date to withdraw the candidature is July 9. Voting will be held on July 10 from 11 am to 3 pm and the counting of votes will be held the same day after 3 pm.The chairpersons of the kshetra panchayats (block-level) will be elected members of the kshetra panchayats.The kshetra panchayat of Mujhena in Gonda district will not be participating in this election as more than six months of its tenure are left, a senior SEC official said.
