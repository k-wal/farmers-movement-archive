However, due to worsening prognosis, she was shifted to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in an extremely critical condition the next day.“But all the efforts of the family and friends could not deter the dark tragedy as the little girl’s ten days’ struggle between life and death came to a halt as she could not be revived and subsequently...was declared brain dead on July 18,” according to the PGIMER statement.It further said the transplant coordinators at PGIMER approached the grief-stricken father to request if he could consider organ donation.“The resolute and brave heart father showcased immense grit and consented for organ donation,” it said.Prof Ashok Kumar, Additional Medical Superintendent, PGIMER and acting nodal officer, Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (North), while giving details of the case, said, “As the donor family wanted their daughter to relive in others, it became our moral duty as well to respect their wish.”“Following the family’s consent, we secured her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas. Once the donor organs became available, everyone swiftly got into action.... As the cross-matching indicated no matching recipient for heart in PGIMER, we immediately got in touch with other transplant hospitals to explore options for matching recipients and finally, heart was allocated to Sir H N Reliance Hospital, Mumbai with the intervention of NOTTO (National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation).”     Kumar said, “To ensure safe and speedy transport of the harvested organs, a green corridor was created...from PGIMER to airport at Chandigarh at around 6.35 am...for the onward flight to Mumbai.”The remaining organs were transplanted on patients at PGIMER, Chandigarh.

For millers, the limit will be the six months’ production or 50 per cent of annual installed capacity, whichever is higher.For retailers, the stock limit will remain unchanged same at five tonnes.“This relaxation for millers will have a down-streaming effect in terms of giving an assurance to farmers at this critical juncture of kharif sowing of tur and urad,” the statement said.Importers, millers, retailers and wholesalers should continue to declare their stocks on the portal fcainfoweb.nic.In case the stocks held by them are higher than the prescribed limits, they should bring it to the prescribed stock limits within 30 days of issue of this notification dated July 19.The decision by the government was taken after a meeting with stakeholders on July 17. All major associations have assured their full cooperation towards declaration of stocks on the web portal and in ensuring there is no hoarding and artificial scarcity, it added.The move comes amid several representations from pulses associations against the government’s earlier order with regard to stock limits on pulses.Welcoming the decision, India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) Vice Chairman Bimal Kothari said the association’s continuous and sustained efforts have borne fruit.“We are confident that this will smoothen the supply of pulses in the coming months and stabilise the prices of pulses during the forthcoming festive period,” he said in a statement.On June 2, the government had imposed stock limits on all pulses, except moong, held by wholesalers, retailers, importers and millers till October to prevent hoarding and check price rise.The stock limit of 200 tonnes was imposed on importers and wholesalers, five tonnes on retailers, while in case of millers, the stock limit was of last three months of production or 25 per cent of annual installed capacity, whichever was higher.Meanwhile, the government said it has been making continuous efforts to crackdown on prices of essential commodities like pulses and had taken various measures.Wholesale prices of all the pulses (except masoor) have fallen by 3-4 per cent in the past two months, and retail prices over the same period for all the pulses (except masoor ) have fallen by 2-4 per cent, it said.In a short span of two months, there were 8,343 registrations by entities and stocks worth over 30.01 lakh tonnes declared on the web portal.The government also said it is committed to adopting timely measures for curbing prices and has substantially alleviated the concerns and anguish of the common man.At the same time, the policy interventions are monitored closely to gauge the impact and calibrated as per emerging developments to safeguard the interests of all sections of society, it added.

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Amit Shah hits out at Cong, global organisations over snooping allegation||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday hit out at the opposition Congress and international organisations for suggesting that the government was involved in surveillance of phones of politicians, journalists and others, saying such “obstructers” and “disrupters” will not be able to derail India’s development trajectory with their conspiracies.In a hard-hitting statement, Shah said the report about the alleged snooping has been amplified by a few whose only aim is to do whatever is possible to humiliate India at the world stage.“This is a report by the disrupters for the obstructers. Disrupters are global organisations that do not like India to progress.“Obstructers are political players in India who do not want India to progress. People of India are very good at understanding this chronology and connection,” he said.The home minister said he wanted to assure the people of India that the Modi government’s priority is clear – ‘National Welfare’ - and it will keep working to achieve that no matter what happens.Opposition parties on Monday hit out at the government over the alleged phone-tapping of prominent personalities in the country using Israeli Pegasus spyware and demanded an independent judicial or parliamentary committee probe.  An international media consortium reported Sunday that more than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two serving ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and one sitting judge besides scores of businesspersons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through the Israeli spyware sold only to government agencies.Shah said those who intend to derail India’s progress are peddling the same old narratives about the country.“To see the rudderless Congress, jump on to this bandwagon is not unexpected.“They have a good past experience in trampling over democracy and with their own house not in order, they are now trying to derail anything progressive that comes up in Parliament,” he said.

19-07-2021||Naveen S Garewal||Telangana Congress alleges land scam, demands CBI probe||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, July 19The Telangana Congress has accused the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government of selling land worth several crores of rupees in the Kokapet area for much less than the market price to people close to Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR).Terming it as the state’s biggest land scam, Congress has demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the e-auction and an investigation into those who bought the 49.92 acres of land from the state.The Telangana State witnessed heavy political activity throughout the day with the State police descending upon the house of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president Revanth Reddy at 3 am and putting him under house arrest on the charge that he was trying to create a law and order situation in the Kokapet area.A part of Hyderabad, Kokapet is a fast emerging commercial and residential hub in Ranga Reddy District. It is known for its luxurious complexes and is regarded as one of the most expensive commercial and residential locations in the city.During the day several senior Congress leaders who were planning a protest in the area where the lands were e-auctioned, were placed under house arrest. Reddy has claimed that he was detained while he was leaving to attend the Monsoon Session of Parliament. He has sent a complaint against the state government to Om Birla, Speaker of the Lok Sabha, seeking action under breach of privilege against the state government.The other person detained is the All India Youth Congress National General Secretary Anil Kumar Yadav has also been placed under house arrest by Hyderabad Police.Police said that Reddy and Yadav have been detained to maintain the law and order situation as they were planning to visit Kokapet where there is tension and they took this step as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order.Congress it is learnt was planning a demonstration against the auctioning of prime lands by the state earning Rs 2,000 crore. Congress alleged a scam in this sale where the state has lost Rs 1,000 crore. Last week the auctioning was conducted by the Hyderabad Municipal Development Authority selling under the “Swiss Challenge”.He claimed that all those who bagged these land parcels were either benamis of CM KCR or those who have close links with him. He alleged that even relatives and bureaucrats close to Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had benefitted.Reddy is the Lok Sabha member from the Malkajgiri Parliamentary constituency and was recently made the TSCC chief by replacing Uttam Reddy. The MP sought the Speaker’s intervention to enable him to attend Parliament and proceed against authorities mentioned by him for violation of parliamentary privileges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-congress-alleges-land-scam-demands-cbi-probe-285426

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Hospitals have become like real estate industries instead of serving humanity: SC||The Supreme Court Monday said hospitals have become like huge real estate industries instead of serving humanity in the face of Covid-19 tragedy while directing that ‘nursing homes’ running from 2-3 room flats in residential colonies which pay little attention to fire and building safety norms should be closed.The apex court also pulled up the Gujarat government for extending the deadline till July next year for hospitals to rectify the building by-laws violations, and said the “carte blanche” notification was in teeth of its order of December 18 last year and people will continue to die in fire incidents.“These hospitals have become like a huge real estate industry instead of serving the cause of humanity in the face of human tragedy.“You (Gujarat government) have been extending the deadline, which cannot be done in view of our December 18, last year order. Hospitals are meant to provide succour to the patients in distress but instead they become money minting machines,” said a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah.Hospitals have become huge industries at the time of this tragedy and “these kinds of nursing homes, running from two-three room flats in a residential colony, should not be allowed to work”, it added.“It is better that these hospitals are closed and the state should provide necessary infrastructure. We cannot allow these hospitals and nursing homes to continue working. This is a human tragedy which is taking place,” the bench said while referring to a fire incident in Nashik, Maharashtra, where some nurses and patients were killed last year.The top court indicated that the Gujarat government will have to withdraw the notification, saying it appears to be in the teeth of its last year’s order and sought explanation on issuance of the notification within a week.It said that once a direction has been issued by the top court, “it cannot be overridden by an executive order and now you (Gujarat government) have issued a carte blanche saying the hospitals don’t have to adhere to rectifying the violations till July, 2022”, and people will continue dying and getting burnt till then.It also took exception to the report filed in a sealed cover by a commission on the issue of fire safety in hospitals saying that “it is not a nuclear secret but just a report. Why in a sealed cover”.It asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to look into the issue of notification and take it up with the Gujarat authorities and asked the state to file a comprehensive statement explaining the notification and details of fire safety audits which were conducted pursuant to the top court’s order of last year.The top court listed the suo motu case on proper treatment of COVID patients after two weeks. On December 18 last year, the top court had directed all the states to constitute a committee in each district to conduct fire audit of COVID-19 hospitals at least once a month, inform the management of medical establishments about any deficiency and report to the government for taking follow up action.It had said that Covid-19 hospitals, which have not obtained no objection certificate from the fire department concerned, should be asked to immediately apply for NOC and after carrying necessary inspection, a decision shall be taken in this regard.“Those Covid hospitals who have not renewed their NOC should immediately take steps for renewal on which appropriate inspection is taken and decisions be taken. In event, Covid hospital is found not having NOC or not having obtained renewal, appropriate action be taken by the state,” it had said.The top court had directed that all states and Union Territories should appoint one nodal officer for each Covid hospital, if not already appointed, who shall be made responsible for ensuring compliance of all fire safety measures. The apex court had last year taken cognisance of the fire incident at a Covid hospital in Gujarat’s Rajkot in which five patients had died.It had also taken note of similar incidents which had happened earlier in other Covid hospitals. It had taken note that Gujarat government has appointed Justice D A Mehta led commission to undertake enquiry with regard to fire in Shrey Hospital, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, in addition to enquiry into the incident of fire in Uday Shivanand Hospital, Rajkot. It had said that the state would extend all co-operations to the enquiry commission so that enquiry report is submitted at an early date and the appropriate remedial action be taken by the state.The top court noted that the Centre has also directed the states and UTs to update their respective local building bye laws/fire services, synchronising them in line with the ‘Model Bill on maintenance of fire and emergency service, 2019’, circulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs on September 16 last year.The issue of Rajkot fire incident had cropped up in the top court which was hearing a suo motu case on proper treatment of Covid-19 patients and dignified handling of bodies in hospitals.

If true, the Modi government seems to have launched a grave and sinister attack on the Right to Privacy - constitutionally guaranteed to Indian citizens as a Fundamental Right. This is an affront to democracy and has ominous implications for our freedoms." Her remarks came a day after The Wire reported that over 40 journalists, three major opposition figures, one constitutional authority, two serving ministers in the Narendra Modi government, current and former heads and officials of security organisations and scores of business persons were in the snooping database.Among the numbers in the Pegasus Project database is one that was registered in the name of a sitting Supreme Court judge. However, The Wire has not been able to confirm whether the number, which the judge gave up before it was added to the list, was still being used by him for WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging apps when the number was selected."Until such time as we are able to establish the number's actual user during the period in question, we are withholding the name of the judge," it said.The Wire and its partners said that they will also not be revealing the identity of any names that appear to be the subject of counter-terrorism.Congress MP Pradip Bhattacharya also raised objection to the alleged snooping and demanded for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe.Speaking to the media outside Parliament, Bhattacharya said, "There should be an investigation. If necessary, a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) should be formed as phone tapping is done against the democracy of our country." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/grave-attack-on-right-to-privacy-priyanka-on-pegasus-report-285407
19-07-2021||Kolkata||Scientists from Kolkata, Kharagpur develop new self-healing organic material||Imagine a mobile phone which falls, its screen cracks and then heals by itself.This may well be possible in the future as scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata and IIT Kharagpur, have discovered a new self-healing material which can repair itself in the blink of an eye.The development which could have many applications including in self-healing electronic gadgets and in the optical industry has been published in the prestigious US- based Science (AAAS) journal.The researchers say while self-healing materials have been developed earlier and are used in aerospace, engineering and automation, the difference is that they have now synthesised a new class of solid material which they claim is 10-times harder than other competing material.Earlier materials developed were in contrast soft and amorphous (without a clearly defined shape) in nature and needed light, heat or a chemical to help them repair by themselves.However, the new material is hard and does the repair by itself using its own electric charges.“During repair, fractured pieces travel with honeybee wing-like motion with acceleration comparable to diesel cars,” one of the researchers Prof. Bhanu Bhusan Khatua of IIT Kharagpur explained Monday.Prof. C Malla Reddy, who won the prestigious Swarnajayanti fellowship from the Indian Governments Department of Science and Technology, in 2015, and his team at IISER Kolkata synthesized the new class of solid materials.The highly crystalline materials, when broken into pieces, can self-propel and re-join in the blink of an eye, and repair themselves so precisely that they become indistinguishable from the undisturbed materials, the scientists said.Prof. Nirmalya Ghosh and his team from IISER Kolkata, used a custom designed state-of-the art polarisation microscopic system to probe and quantify the structural order of the piezoelectric self-healing organic crystals with nano-metre scale spatial resolution.Piezoelectric means an electrical charge is created when the material is put under physical stress such as when it falls.The self-healing quality of the piezoelectric organic crystals uses the electrical charges created to repair the material when damaged, in the same way that a human tissue often heals itself after being damaged by a fall.Research showed that these crystals, under pressure, or vice-a-versa, can heal exceptionally well and retain their crystalline nature which is important for many applications, Ghosh said.Prof. Khatua said, “There is a crystal formation in Android mobiles, LED television sets, and most electronic applications. Our research since 2019 has brought up a self- healing material that can reassemble and realign even after suffering cracks. These piezoelectric crystals can generate electricity when pressure is created by force and make the widening cracks heal in nanoseconds.”He added “our team used a needle to trigger mild to severe cracks in such piezoelectric objects and saw how the cracks disappeared very, very soon.”Materials applied in technologies constantly undergo mechanical impact which often damage the devices beyond repair. Therefore, scientists have been searching for self- repairing materials for prolonging the life time of devices.Wound healing in living tissue and bone has inspired many synthetic self-healing polymers, gels and other soft materials in the last decade or so, the scientists said.However, replicating such repair in crystalline materials remained a challenge as they are rigid and prevent diffusion of material at the damaged part due to dense and regularly arranged molecules in them, Khatua pointed out.The first author of this paper, Surojit Bhunia from IISER Kolkata added Here, taking cues from nature we explored the inherent piezoelectricity of crystalline materials for finding self-healing property.The application possibilities of the new material are immense. “From mobile screens to modern microscopes self- healing materials can be used where the damaged particles can join by themselves, Prof. Khatua said.“It is long known that piezoelectricity plays a key role in initiating self-healing in mechanically wounded natural biomaterials, like bone and collagen. Hence, our discovery in organic materials may provide further insights into complex natural materials.

The press report appeared a day before the monsoon session of the Parliament.“This cannot be a coincidence. In the past similar claims were made regarding the use of Pegasus on WhatsApp. Those reports have no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties.... The press report of July 18, 2021, also appeared to be an attempt to malign the Indian democracy and a well-established institution,” the Minister said.More than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two serving ministers, over 40 journalists, three Opposition leaders and one sitting judge besides scores of business persons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through an Israeli spyware sold only to government agencies, an international media consortium reported on Sunday.The government, however, had dismissed allegations of any kind of surveillance on its part on specific people, saying it “has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever”.

We shared views on further strengthening bilateral ties. PM Modi assured early supply of Covid Vaccines to Nepal. I thanked him for his warm words of congratulations,” Deuba tweeted.Earlier on Monday, Modi in a tweet said, “Spoke with Prime Minister @DeubaSherbdr to convey my congratulations and best wishes. We will work together to further enhance the wide-ranging cooperation between India and Nepal, including in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.”       Deuba, who was appointed as the prime minister for a record fifth time on July 12 following the Supreme Court’s intervention, secured 165 votes in the 275-member House on Sunday.“Congratulations Prime Minister @DeubaSherbdr and best wishes for a successful tenure. I look forward to working with you to further enhance our unique partnership in all sectors, and strengthen our deep-rooted people-to-people ties,” Modi tweeted on Sunday night.Responding to Prime Minister Modi’s tweet, Deuba thanked his Indian counterpart for his congratulatory message and expressed his desire to work closely with him to strengthen the bilateral ties between the two neighbouring countries.“Thank you very much, Prime Minister @narendramodi Ji, for your congratulatory note. I look forward to closely working with you to strengthen the relationship between our two countries and people,” Deuba tweeted late Sunday night.Previously, Deuba has served as the prime minister on four occasions; first from 1995 to 1997, then from 2001 to 2002, again from 2004 to 2005, and from 2017 to 2018.In his first foreign trip after he assumed office in June 2017, Deuba visited India in August 2017 and held bilateral  talks with Prime Minister Modi. Deuba had earlier paid three visits to India as prime minister, in 1996, 2004 and 2005.Deuba, the 75-year-old chief of the Nepali Congress party, won a trust vote in the reinstated lower House of Representatives, averting a general election in the Himalayan nation amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.Sunday’s outcome of the trust vote paves the way for Prime Minister Deuba to remain in office for the next one and half year, until a fresh parliamentary election is held.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).On February 23, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.The bilateral ties came under strain under then Prime Minister Oli after India opened an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8, 2020.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with a new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. India reacted sharply to the move.In June last year, Nepal’s Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.

The only way to become Baahubali to fight against corona is to get vaccinated. More than 40 crore people have become Bahubali in the fight against coronavirus," he said.The Prime Minister's remarks triggered reactions from netizens, who referred to the south Indian hit movie 'Baahubali' which had a very strong protagonist.Tagging Modi's remarks, a Twitter user said, "Makes sense - there are 2 parts to Baahubali - dose 1 and dose 2.""Corona virus is like Katappa and will attack again from behind. We can't be careless as in real life there would be no sequel," tweeted another user, referring to another character in the two-part epic movie.Noting that the pandemic has engulfed the whole world, Modi said he wanted that there should be a meaningful discussion regarding the pandemic.Modi said he wanted meaningful discussions in Parliament over the Covid pandemic."We want a discussion in the House as well as outside the House with all the floor leaders. I am constantly meeting chief ministers and all kinds of discussions are happening at different fora. So I want to meet the floor leaders as the House is going on and it will be convenient and we can talk about it (the pandemic) face-to-face," he said.

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Delta variant accounts for 80 per cent of new Covid cases: Govt expert panel chief||The Delta variant was primarily responsible for the second wave of Covid in the country, accounting for over 80 per cent of new cases, Dr NK Arora, co-chair of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium said, underlining that the cases may go up if a new, more infectious variant comes.The variant is also around 40-60 per cent more transmissible than its predecessor, Alpha variant, and has already spread to more than 80 countries, including the UK, the US and Singapore.The Delta Plus variant—AY.1 and AY.2—has so far been detected in 55-60 cases across 11 states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Madhya Pradesh and is still being studied for its transmissibility, virulence, and vaccine escape characteristics, Dr Arora said, according to a Union Health Ministry statement.The Delta variant has mutations in its spike protein, which helps it bind to the ACE2 receptors present on the surface of the cells more firmly, making it more transmissible and capable of evading the body's immunity, Dr Arora said."The B.1.617.2, a variant of Covid known as the Delta variant, was first identified in October 2020 in India, and was primarily responsible for the second wave in the country, today accounting for over 80 per cent of new Covid cases," he said.It emerged in Maharashtra and travelled northwards along the western states of the country before entering the central and the eastern states.On whether it causes more severe disease as compared to other variants, Dr Arora said there are studies that show that there are some mutations in this variant that promote syncytium formation."Besides, on invading a human cell, it replicates faster. It leads to a strong inflammatory response in organs like the lungs. However, it is difficult to say that the disease due to delta variant is more severe. The age profile and the deaths during the second wave in India were quite similar to that seen during the first wave," he stated.

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha adjourned for the day amidst ruckus by Opposition leaders||The Rajya Sabha was adjourned for the day after witnessing multiple disruptions as several Opposition members trooped into the Well of the House raising slogans and protesting over various issues.Also read: Ruckus in Lok Sabha as Opposition MPs don't allow PM to introduce new ministersAs soon as the House reassembled at 3 pm, Opposition members entered the Well and started raising slogans against the government.Deputy Rajya Sabha Chairman Harivansh, however, tried to conduct the business amid the din.Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge wanted to initiate a discussion under Rule 267 (suspension of rules) but was not allowed by the Deputy Chairman.Harivansh noted that the matter cannot be revisited as Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu had already given his decision on it which cannot be reviewed.Amid the din, Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal introduced the The Marine Aids to Navigation Bill, 2021. The Bill seeks to replace an over nine-decade-old law governing lighthouses.Subhash Chandra Singh (BJD), Banda Prakash (TRS), Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar (TDP) and GK Vasan (TMC -M) supported the Bill.As the Opposition parties continued with the sloganeering, the deputy chair adjourned the House for the day.The Marine Aids to Navigation Bill, 2021 seeks to provide for a fresh framework to establish and manage vessel traffic services besides use of the term “marine aids to navigation” instead of “lighthouse” to enable further use of modern forms of aids to navigation.The House witnessed three adjournments before the deputy chair adjourned it for the day.In the morning, when the House assembled on day one of the Monsoon Session, the proceedings were adjourned for an hour as a mark of respect to departed sitting MPs Raghunath Mohapatra and Rajeev Satav.No sooner did the House reassembled around 12.25 pm, Opposition members started raising slogans as Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu was making his opening remarks about the expectations from the current session amid the Covid pandemic.Amidst the sloganeering, the Chairman asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to introduce the newly inducted ministers to the House.However, the protesting members kept raising slogans and the Prime Minister could not introduce the ministers. Several Opposition members trooped into the Well of the House.Chairman Naidu had to adjourn the proceedings till 2 pm.As soon as the House reassembled at 2:00 pm, there were again uproarious scenes, and the House was adjourned till 3:00 pm by Deputy Chairmen Harivansh.Expressing anguish over the conduct of the protesting Opposition members, Modi questioned their “mentality” behind not allowing him to introduce women, Dalit and scheduled tribe MPs who have been made ministers. Modi said that when the new Union Ministers belonging to rural background and the children of the farming community were being introduced to the House, some opposition party members were not happy.He said a large number of MPs including women, Dalit and those belonging to scheduled tribes have been made Union Ministers, but some opposition members do not want to hear their names and give them the due honour.“What is this mentality?” he wondered.The Prime Minister further said it was for the first time that the House was witnessing “such a mentality”.As the Opposition members continued their uproar, Modi laid the list of newly inducted ministers on the table of the House.Meanwhile, the Chairman did not allow the 17 notices by different Opposition parties to suspend the scheduled business of the House and take up the matters raised by them.He said it was not feasible to take 17 issues in one go, and assured the members that all the important matters would be taken up in due course of time.But the assurance did not pacify the opposition members, forcing Naidu to adjourn the House till 2 pm.The new Leader of the House and Union minister Piyush Goyal said it was a tradition since the times of first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that new ministers are introduced to the House.Goyal condemned the “behaviour” of Opposition members and said such a conduct would be harmful for the democratic traditions of the country.

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Manipur-based activist, detained under NSA for criticising BJP leaders, released on SC order||Manipur-based activist Leichombam Erendro, booked under NSA for criticising BJP leaders on use of cow dung and urine as cures for Covid-19, was released on Monday evening following the Supreme Court direction to Imphal jail authorities, saying that he cannot be put in jail even for a day.Advocate Shadan Farasat, appearing for Erendro’s father who filed the plea for release, said, “He has been released at around 4.45 pm in compliance with the apex court order.”A bench of Justice D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said earlier in the day that his continued detention will be in violation of his fundamental right to life.“Having prima facie considered the contents of the petition, we are of the view that the continued detention of the petitioner before this Court would amount to a violation of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.“We accordingly direct that the petitioner shall be released forthwith as and by way of an interim direction of this Court, unless he is required to be in custody in any other case, subject to further orders, subject to his filing a personal release bond in the amount of Rs 1000,” the bench said.Manipur government shall comply with the order of this Court on or before 5 pm, the top court said.It directed that the Registrar (Judicial) of the top court shall communicate a copy of this order forthwith to the Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa. The bench listed the matter for Tuesday after Solicitor General Tushar Meha said that he was not contesting the plea but would file a response.At the outset, Farasat, appearing for L Raghumani Singh, Erendro’s father, said that preventive detention clause has been used in a case where not even simple penal provisions are required.The plea has challenged the preventive detention of the political activist under the National Security Act (NSA), alleging that it has been done “solely to punish him” for his criticism of BJP leaders purportedly advocating cow dung and cow urine as cures for Covid-19.The plea claimed that Erendro had on May 13 posted on Facebook that cure for coronavirus is not cow’s dung and urine.“The statement was made in the context of the death of the President of the Manipur BJP due to Covid-19, as a criticism of the unscientific position taken and misinformation being spread by several BJP politicians regarding cow urine and cow dung being effective in preventing/treating Covid-19,” the plea said, adding that the post was deleted soon after being posted on May 13 itself.The petition alleged that for this criticism Erendro has spent some days in custody pursuant to criminal cases initiated against him and thereafter in preventive detention after grant of bail.“The present case is a shocking instance of misuse of preventive detention law to stifle completely innocuous speech that is fully constitutionally protected and was made in public interest - Erendro, a Manipuri political activist, has been preventively detained solely to punish him for his criticism of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders for advocating cow dung and cow urine as cures for Covid-19,” the plea alleged.It has sought quashing of May 17 detention order and the grounds of detention issued by District Magistrate, Imphal West District.The plea has also sought direction to the concerned authorities to set Erendro, who is the co-convenor of political outfit Peoples’ Resurgence and Justice Alliance, at liberty forthwith.It said that appropriate compensation, including cost of litigation, should be awarded to the petitioner and his son for the alleged illegal detention that Erendro has suffered.The plea has claimed that his detention is in violation of the apex court’s April 30 order and a separate contempt petition has also been filed in the top court.On April 30, the apex court, while hearing the suo motu case on distribution of essential supplies and services during the pandemic, had warned authorities—from the Centre down to the police chiefs—against silencing people and their pleas for help on the presumption that they are raising false grievances on the internet.The top court had made clear that any attempt to clampdown on free flow of information on social media including the call for help from people would be treated as the contempt of court.The plea said that four FIRs have been registered against Erendro by Manipur Police.It said Erendro was arrested on May 13 itself and was remanded to police custody till May 17, the date on which his bail application was to be listed for consideration before the trial court.It alleged that in anticipation of the trial court’s consideration of the matter and “knowing fully well about the completely flimsy nature of the criminal proceedings”, the district magistrate passed an order for preventive detention under the NSA to “render infructuous the bail” to be granted by the court.The plea said Erendro was granted bail but was not released due to the detention order.

Known as the Flying Sikh, Milkha Singh was the first athlete of independent India to have won a gold medal at an international sports event (Asian Games, 1958), Naidu said.Naidu added that the sprinter had lost both his parents at a very young age in the pre-Partition riots but managed to overcome the challenges thrown at him by life and shine as an athlete.Paying glowing tribute to Yusuf Khan (Dilip Kumar), Naidu said an era ended with the death of Dilip Kumar. Known as “the tragedy king”, Dilip Kumar’s iconic films included ‘Devdas’, ‘Mughal E Azam’ and ‘Ram aur Shyam’. His films were popular both in India and abroad, Naidu said.Since making his debut in 1944, Dilip Kumar’s career lasted for five decades, the chairman said. Born in Peshawar in undivided India, Dilip Kumar had received the Fimlfare Award a record eight times, Naidu noted. The iconic actor was a recipient of the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award of the country, Naidu said.After observing silence for a minute to mourn the 13 departed souls, Naidu adjourned the House for an hour in deference to the memory of Raghunath Mahapatra and Rajeev Satav, sitting members.Mahapatra, an architect and a sculptor, was a nominated member of the House, who died of coronavirus infection in May this year.

19-07-2021||Lucknow||Porn content leaked into Lucknow University's study WhatsApp group||Pornographic material and lewd remarks started flashing in a WhatsApp group created by under-graduate students of ancient Indian history and archaeology (AIHA) department in the Lucknow University (LU), leaving the students aghast.The chief proctor of the university lodged a complaint with the Hasanganj police station in this regard on Sunday. The miscreant is yet to be identified.The pornographic images and obscene messages were posted late on Saturday night in the WhatsApp group that was created by a female student on the direction of the faculty for sharing paper presentations.Around 170 BA students were added via a link circulated by the teachers to get automatically added to the group.Some students exited after posting lewd messages and later re-joined the group.Students say that the mobile number of the miscreant which was showing in the group, belonged to a male student of the same class. When the latter was asked, however, he denied his involvement."Around 11.58 p.m. on Saturday, the first sexually explicit picture was posted on the group with the name and phone number of our male classmate. The picture was followed by a message that targeted four girl students through lewd messages," said a girl student.She said that the person continued with abusive and objectionable language for female students of the class and teachers as well.In the screenshots of the group shared by students, a number of messages from female students requesting faculty, late at night, to look into the matter and take strict action could be seen.Even after repeated requests, the unruly element dropped a second message abusing four male students of the class and went on to tarnish the name of a faculty member. He then again posted pornographic images."When the abuses crossed all limits and objectionable words were used for our faculty member, I took to Twitter, tagging vice-chancellor Prof A.K. Rai and dean, student welfare, Prof Poonam Tandon to look into the matter," said one of the students."The unruly element posted porn images, wrote disrespectful messages and immediately exited the group. He joined back again with a different name and number to drop messages all over again," said the student.When no action was taken by the LU authorities, nearly 50 per cent of the students exited from the group in protest.Later, on Sunday, a complaint was forwarded by AIHA head of department Prof Piyush Bhargava to the LU proctor office on the basis of which an application for an FIR was given by chief Proctor Dinesh Kumar at Hasanganj police station."We have lodged a police complaint with the Hasanganj police station in this regard.

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Over 300 phone numbers of ministers, journos, activists, bizmen in India 'hacked': Report||More than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two serving ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and one sitting judge besides scores of business persons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through an Israeli spyware sold only to government agencies, an international media consortium reported on Sunday.The government, however, dismissed allegations of any kind of surveillance on its part on specific people, saying it "has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever".Asserting that "India is a robust democracy that is committed to ensuring the right to privacy to all its citizens as a fundamental right", the government dismissed the media report as an attempt to playing "the role of an investigator, prosecutor as well as jury".The report was published by The Wire news portal from India as also 16 other international publications including Washington Post, The Guardian and Le Monde, as media partners to an investigation conducted by Paris-based media non-profit organisation Forbidden Stories and rights group Amnesty International into a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers from across the world that are believed to have been the target of surveillance through Pegasus software of Israeli surveillance company NSO Group.The Wire reported that forensic tests conducted as part of the media investigation project on a small cross-section of phones associated with these numbers revealed clear signs of targeting by Pegasus spyware in 37 phones, of which 10 are Indian.The report came just a day before the start of the Monsoon Session of Parliament and could see the matter being raised in two houses, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, beginning tomorrow. Some opposition leaders are also expected to give notices for adjournment or debate on this issue.The Wire said the numbers of those in the database from India include over 40 journalists, three major opposition figures, one constitutional authority, two serving ministers in the Narendra Modi government, current and former heads and officials of security organisations and scores of businesspersons, as also a sitting judge.Responding to the reports, the government referred to its reply given to the media consortium and said similar claims were made in the past as well regarding the use of Pegasus on WhatsApp by India and those reports also had no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties, including WhatsApp in the Indian Supreme Court."This news report, thus, also appears to be a similar fishing expedition, based on conjectures and exaggerations to malign the Indian democracy and its institutions," the government said.It further said that there is a well-established procedure through which "lawful interception of electronic communication is carried out in order for the purpose of national security, particularly on the occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety, by agencies at the Centre and States" and the procedure ensures that any interception, monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource is done as per a due process of law.NSO Group, the Israeli company which sells Pegasus worldwide, says its clients, are confined to “vetted governments”, believed to number 36, according to The Wire.Forbidden Stories, which accessed the data, stated that it comprises records of phone numbers selected as targets by NSO clients, a claim the company formally denied while conceding that its clients might have used these numbers for “other purposes”.A majority of the numbers identified in the list were geographically concentrated in 10 country clusters: India, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.The leaked data includes the numbers of top journalists at big media houses like the Hindustan Times, India Today, Network18, The Hindu and Indian Express, The Wire said.The mobile phone of a former Delhi University professor was also allegedly targeted, while the database also included at least nine numbers belonging to eight activists, lawyers and academics arrested between June 2018 and October 2020 for their supposed role in the Elgar Parishad case.The Wire, however, added that the mere presence of a phone number in the leaked data does alone not reveal whether a device was infected."Indeed, it is not possible to know whether their phones were targeted by Pegasus spyware... without digital forensic analysis," it said.The government, in its response, said India is committed to ensuring the right to privacy to all its citizens as a fundamental right and for that, it has also introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, to protect the personal data of individuals and to empower users of social media platforms.The commitment to free speech as a fundamental right is the cornerstone of India's democratic system, it said."We have always strived to attain an informed citizenry with an emphasis on a culture of open dialogue. However, the questionnaire sent to the Government of India indicates that the story being crafted is one that is not only bereft of facts but also founded in pre-conceived conclusions," it said, referring to the queries it had received from the media consortium."It seems you are trying to play the role of an investigator, prosecutor as well as jury. Considering the fact that answers to the queries posed have already been in the public domain for a long time, it also indicates poorly conducted research and lack of due diligence by the esteemed media organizations involved," the government said in its response to the global media collective that worked on 'Project Pegasus'.

But when I am not here, you do not pay any attention. But our work is going on.

Apparently, the party and its ideological fountainhead, the RSS, are also planning an overhaul in states where the BJP is in the opposition, the first indication of which came from Rajasthan when the state BJP yesterday expelled former state minister Rohitashav Sharma for six years on the charge of breach of discipline.According to sources, the party is trying to bring in new leaders in states like Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.“The sangh also believes that the BJP should promote young leaders so that the party has a fresh line of leadership in the next few years,” they say. Notably, the meetings come in the wake of the results of the Assembly elections and feedback of the second Covid wave.Yediyurappa has announced the convening of the BJP legislature party meeting on July 26. It remains to be seen whether he will make some announcement on the day to pave way for the change the BJP and RSS are looking for in the southern state.Meanwhile, several names are doing the rounds as a replacement, including Union Minister Prahlad Joshi and General Secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leadership-mulls-changes-in-state-units-285267

19-07-2021||Aditi Tandon and Rajmeet Singh||Navjot Sidhu appointed Punjab Congress chief||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi/Chandigarh, July 18After days of speculation, the Congress on Sunday appointed cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu as the next president of the Punjab Congress, ignoring persistent opposition from CM Capt Amarinder Singh and leaders close to him.Former Amritsar MP and sitting MLA from Amritsar East, Navjot Sidhu replaces Sunil Jakhar.The party also named four working presidents. They are Urmar MLA Sangat Singh Gilzian, Jandiala legislator Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra and Pawan Goel from Jaito in Faridkot.The announcement came late Sunday night by AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal. The appointments spell a setback for Capt Amarinder who had put up a stiff resistance to Sidhu’s elevation, urging Congress president Sonia Gandhi to make Sidhu either the campaign committee chairman or a prominent minister, even Deputy CM.Also read: The Congress has struck a balance in the appointments with three-time MLA Gilzian representing the OBCs and Doaba region. He hails from Hoshiarpur. Gilzian started out as a sarpanch. He then went on to contest zila parishad elections and fought his first Assembly election in 2002 from Tanda Urmar.Gilzian lost the first poll. He was elected as an Independent in 2007 from the same segment, which he went on to retain in 2012 and 2017 on the Congress ticket.Danny, an MLA from SC (reserved) segment Jandiala, is former vice-president of the Punjab Youth Congress and son of SS Bandala, former Excise Minister in the Congress government in 2002- 2007.Two-time MLA Nagra, considered close to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, represents the Jat Sikhs. Nagra is AICC in-charge of Sikkim, Nagaland and Tripura. He has been relieved of the charge.While Gilzian is from Doaba, Danny is from Majha and Goel and Nagra are from Malwa. The appointments signal a mix of experienced and young leaders with the CM’s stamp evidently missing.Sonia Gandhi’s Punjab announcements today could potentially herald a change in the Punjab politics with Sidhu emerging as Capt Amarinder’s successor.Recent Congress history reveals that state unit presidents have gone on to become CMs – Capt Amarinder Singh was Punjab unit chief ahead of becoming CM in 2017 andKamal Nath was Madhya Pradesh Congress chief ahead of becoming CM. Sidhu’s top challenge would be to take the CM on board and put up a united front.He is expected to energise cadre||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navjot-sidhu-appointed-punjab-congress-chief-285150

The government said there was no concrete basis for such allegations and claimed that WhatsApp had denied the claim it made before the US court.The media outlets claimed to have independently identified the owners of over 1,571 mobile numbers in 10 countries. The forensic testing of some of the phones confirmed the use of Pegasus spyware, including in some Indian numbers.Some of the Indian phones were found to have been targeted, but not infected while the tests were inconclusive on some of the phones.The list includes the number of a murdered freelance journalist in Mexico whose mobile was never found, thus not established whether the software had been infected.The “revelation” comes a day ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament and international publications in the UK, EU and the US began publishing the details on Sunday night itself. The government has already said in Parliament that “no unofficial spyware has been bought or used in India”. Asked whether there was a breach in established procedure, then IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said, “as far as I know no unofficial notice has been given”. The NSO says the Israeli Defence Ministry vets export applications for the software which is sold only to “trusted” governments. It has declined to give its list of customers. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/israeli-software-snooping-on-40-scribes-government-denies-285152

The court said its main concern was the “misuse of law” leading to the rise in the number of cases.Showing an increasing trend in the number of cases with sedition charges, the NCRB data revealed that FIRs filed under the law were 47 in 2014, 30 in 2015, 35 in 2016, 51 in 2017, 70 in 2018 and 93 in 2019 with the highest 54 in Assam.Of the total 326 cases, chargesheets were filed in 141, while just six persons were convicted for sedition in six years. Jharkhand reported the second highest number (40) of such cases during that period. Chargesheets were filed in 29 cases, trial completed in 16 and only one person was convicted. In Haryana, 31 cases were registered under the sedition law, chargesheets were filed in 19 and trial completed in six cases with only one conviction.Bihar, Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir saw 25 such cases each. While no chargesheet was filed in any such case in Bihar and Kerala, three chargesheets were filed in Jammu and Kashmir. However, no one was convicted in any of the three states.One sedition case each was filed in Maharashtra (in 2015), Punjab (2015) and Uttarakhand (2017). No sedition case was filed in states and UTs of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Chandigarh, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli during that period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/326-sedition-cases-filed-during-2014-19-but-only-6-convictions-285153

The expert said the peak of the third wave could stretch into 2022 and though it might not be as severe as the second wave, the ferocity would depend on multiple factors, including loss of immunity the population acquired so far due to natural infection or vaccination and presence of mutants and their ability to escape vaccine among other factors. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3rd-covid-wave-likely-in-august-icmr-scientist-285194

19-07-2021||New Delhi||FATF review of India's anti-money laundering, terror financing regime postponed again to 2022||An evaluation by global organisation Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to analyse the effectiveness of India's anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing regime has been postponed for the second time in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and is now slated to be initiated next year, officials said.The scheduled assessment for the country by the Paris-headquartered watchdog was originally slated for September-October, 2020.However, these dates were postponed and pushed to February this year by the FATF secretariat in view of the coronavirus outbreak that gripped the world, including India."The schedule for FATF mutual evaluation has again been postponed from February, 2021, and it is tentatively expected to begin in September, 2022 now," a senior government officer told PTI.As per this re-scheduled assessment calendar, the technical evaluation of Indian anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing and the role of relevant legal framework and agencies enforcing these measures would begin in September next year followed by an on-site visit of FATF experts to the country in February, 2023, another official privy to the development said.The FATF plenary that is expected to be held in October, 2023, will discuss the Indian assessment and its mutual evaluation report will be published for public consumption after 10 months from the date of the on-site visit (February 2023), he said.The FATF is a global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog that sets international standards to prevent economic and financial crimes in a country with inter-connected linkages across the world.It conducts "peer reviews of each member on an ongoing basis to assess levels of implementation of the FATF recommendations and provides an in-depth description and analysis of each country's system for preventing criminal abuse of the financial system."The last such review of India's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regime was held in June, 2010 and it is usually taken up again after a period of 10 years.The FATF, post this review, had said in 2013 that "India had made significant progress in addressing deficiencies identified in its mutual evaluation report and (the FATF) decided that the country should be removed from the regular follow-up process."In 2019, India had set up a joint working group comprising 22 central investigation, intelligence gathering and regulatory agencies to make presentations, hold discussions and brief the FATF experts, drawn from various countries, once the process starts.Some of the prominent agencies in this grouping supervised by the Department of Revenue under the Union Finance Ministry include the Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), CBI, Customs Department, market regulator SEBI, banking regulator RBI and insurance regulator IRDAI.The FATF too made a public declaration saying the dates for mutual evaluation of certain countries including India "will be rescheduled as soon as practicable.""Due to the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) emergency, the FATF and FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs) are implementing precautionary measures that impact scheduled on-site visits and mutual evaluation discussions." "As the situation evolves, this information will be regularly updated but remains subject to further change," it said.It specifically says India's possible on-site period is "tbc (to be confirmed)".During this evaluation, Indian financial regulatory and enforcement agencies are expected to showcase their action taken reports and dossiers for the enforcement, regulatory and investigative work undertaken by them under the anti-money laundering law, criminal tax evasion instance and for strengthening the CFT (combating financing of terrorism) regime."The guidelines and rules framed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), their outcomes and strict adherence to Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are some of the very important aspects that the FATF experts will be informed about," the officer quoted in the later part said.The enactment of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act in 2018, the anti-black money Act of 2015, amendments brought in the PMLA over the years, curbing tax evasion under indirect taxes by bringing in the GST (Goods and Services Tax), new protocols to better regulate suspect transactions in banks and financial intermediaries and the 2016 demonetisation of two large currencies are part of the Indian presentation, an officer had said last year.The high number of domestic and international attachment of assets and penalties issued under the PMLA, and charge sheets filed by various probe agencies under criminal sections of the law against financial crimes and terror funding will also be part of India's presentation to the FATF review team.The wide spectrum of offences from wildlife smuggling to use of smart electronic tools to generate black money being probed by Indian agencies will be part of the dossier, officials informed.The new compliance regime brought in by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for banks, other financial institutions, casinos and payment gateways to report suspect transactions and counterfeit currency will also be part of the presentation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fatf-review-of-indias-anti-money-laundering-terror-financing-regime-postponed-again-to-2022-285026

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Who is Sanjal Gavande? Maharashtra-born woman behind Jeff Bezos' blue origin space rocket||Following the grand Richard Branson show where he carried Andhra Pradesh-born Sirisha Bandla and fellow space travellers on his shoulders after successfully flying to the edge of space, it is time for Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos to applaud Sanjal Gavande, one of the key engineers who designed the New Shephard rocket set to take Bezos and the crew to space on July 20.Billionaire Bezos is set to fly to the edge of space aboard what is touted as the world's first unpiloted suborbital flight.Born in Kalyan, Maharashtra, Gavande is a systems engineer at Blue Origin who always dreamt of designing aerospace rockets.After completing Bachelor's in mechanical engineering from the University of Mumbai, she flew to the US in 2011 to pursue Master's in mechanical engineering from the Michigan Technological University.She also applied for an engineering job at the US space agency NASA, but finally landed her dream job at Blue Origin.Bezos, his brother Mark, aviation pioneer Mary Wallace 'Wally' Funk and other passengers are set to liftoff from west Texas and travel just beyond the edge of space on July 20.Blue Origin announced this week that Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old high school graduate from the Netherlands, would join the crew.Oliver is the son of millionaire Joes Daemen, Founder and CEO of the Dutch investment company Somerset Capital Partners. Blue Origin, however, did not reveal how much Daemen paid for his son's trip to space.Bezos chose July 20 as the launch date to honour the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.The launch site for Blue Origin's first human flight will be in a remote location north of Van Horn, Texas, from where the firm had launched New Shepard for previous flights.Blue Origin has received final approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to carry humans on the New Shepard rocket into space.On July 12, Bandla touched the edge of space with three others, including Virgin Galactic's billionaire CEO Richard Branson.Bandla vaulted into space onboard VSS Unity 22. After the successful spaceflight, Branson carried the Indian-American on his shoulders while celebrating their flight to space, at Spaceport America in New Mexico. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-is-sanjal-gavande-maharashtra-born-woman-behind-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-rocket-284983
19-07-2021||Mumbai||25 die as heavy rain triggers landslides in Mumbai; rail, road traffic hit||Twenty-five people died in house collapses triggered by landslides following the incessant overnight rain in Mumbai, which caused severe water-logging and disruption of suburban train services and vehicular traffic in the financial capital on Sunday, officials said.The Western Railway and Central Railway briefly suspended suburban train services in Mumbai after the heavy rains, and many long distance trains were terminated or regulated at various stations, officials said.Seventeen people died as a compound wall came crashing down on some houses located on a hillock after a landslide, a fire official said.The retaining wall of the Bharatnagar locality in Mumbai’s Mahul area collapsed at 1 am, the official said. Seven people were injured and taken to nearby Rajawadi hospital, he added.Seven hutment dwellers died as six shanties collapsed after a landslide following incessant overnight rains in Mumbai’s Vikhroli suburb at 2.30 am, a civic official said. Two persons were injured and were sent to a nearby hospital, he added.A 16-year-old boy died after a forest department compound wall collapsed in suburban Bhandup, an official said.A viral video showed a two-wheeler being dragged in water in an inundated street in Chinchpokli area.The suburban train services were suspended due to water logging on the tracks due to the overnight heavy downpour, railway officials said, adding the services were resumed in the morning.Before the pandemic, both the Central Railway and Western Railway used to ferry over 75 lakh commuters a day in over 3000 suburban train services which are now allowed only for emergency services staff and government employees.The rain fury reminded some Mumbaikars of the the 24-hour rainfall figure of 944 mm on July 26, 2005.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for Mumbai in the backdrop of heavy rains, a BMC official said.Alerts by the IMD are colour-coded from green to red. A ‘green’ alert stands for ‘no warning’: no action needs to be taken by the authorities, and the forecast is of light to moderate rain. A ‘red’ alert stands for “warning”, and asks authorities to “take action”. An ‘orange’ alert indicates that the authorities are expected to “be prepared”.A sudden change in climatic conditions led to Mumbai witnessing over 100 mm rainfall in six hours, the IMD said in an early morning bulletin. It also changed the rains forecast for the city from orange to red alert.The IMD said that till 6.30 am on Sunday, Mumbai and adjoining areas received over 120 mm rainfall in preceding 12 hours.Mumbai would receive “heavy to very heavy” rainfall at a few places with extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places, the IMD said.Extremely heavy rainfall means precipitation of more than 204.5 mm in 24 hours, while heavy rainfall ranges between 115.6 mm to 204.4 mm rainfall, as per the IMD.The bulletin issued at 3 am said IMD recorded 213 mm rainfall at Santacruz, 197.5 mm at Bandra and 174 mm at Colaba in the city.

19-07-2021||Chandigarh||For first time, astronomers discover star-like objects that appear and disappear||An international collaboration of astronomers, including Indian scientists, has identified a curious occurrence of nine star-like objects that appeared and vanished in a small region within half an hour on a photographic plate.Such a group of objects appearing and disappearing at the same time have been detected for the first time in the history of astronomy.Astronomers collaborating across counties track vanishing and appearing celestial objects by comparing old images of the night sky with the new modern one, register unnatural phenomena, and probe deep into such phenomena to record changes in the Universe.Scientists from India, Sweden, Spain, the USA and Ukraine investigated early forms of photography that used glass plates to capture images of the night sky from April 12, 1950, that had been taken at Palomar Observatory in California, and detected these transient stars which were not to be found in photographs half an hour later and not traced since then.The astronomers have not found any explanation in established astrophysical phenomena like gravitational lensing, fast radio bursts, or any variable star that could be responsible for this cluster of fast changes in the sky.Scientists from Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, participated in the study, which has been published in Nature's "Scientific Reports", according to a statement issued today by the Ministry of Science and Technology.The study used the 10.4 meter Gran Telescopio Canarias at Spain, the largest optical telescope in the world, for deep 'second epoch' observations. The team hoped to find a counterpart at the position of every object that had appeared and vanished on the plate. The counterparts found are not necessarily physically connected to the weird objects.The scientists are still exploring the reasons behind the observation of these strange transient stars and are still not sure about what triggered their appearance and disappearance.“The only thing we can say with certainty is that these images contain star-like objects that should not be there. We do not know why they are there,” Dr Alok C. Gupta from ARIES said.The astronomers are examining the possibility that the photographic plates were contaminated with radioactive particles, causing false stars on the plates. But if the observation is proven to be real, another option is solar reflections from reflective, unnatural objects in orbit around Earth several years before the first human satellite was launched.The astronomers have still not sorted out the root cause of the “nine simultaneous transients”.They are now exploring for more signatures of solar reflections in these digitized data from the 1950s in the hope to find aliens.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-first-time-astronomers-discover-star-like-objects-that-appear-and-disappear-284119
