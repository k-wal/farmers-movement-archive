If the government gets us arrested, it will, and if it does not, we will return to the borders in the evening only to go back the next day again,” another leader said.The leaders also urged their fellow protestors, particularly those who would be demonstrating at the parliament, to submit their identification details, including photographs and Aadhar cards to ensure a “peaceful protest”.A tractor parade in Delhi on January 26, that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agriculture laws, had dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.“We have asked the protestors for their details. If there is any wrongdoing on the part of any farmer, they will be punished accordingly,” a farmer leader told the press conference.According to an SKM statement, a special protest march outside parliament exclusively by women farmer leaders and volunteers will be organised on July 26 and August 9.“Women farmers have been at the forefront of this long and historic struggle of farmers for their livelihood and future. The special marches on these two days shall highlight the unique and memorable role that women have played,” it said.Announcing their strategy for the next few months, Rajewal said their upcoming move would be ‘Mission UP and Uttarakhand’.“Our next target is to strengthen our agitation in Uttarakhand and UP. From August 1-25, we will hold meetings across districts. On September 5, there will be a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Muzaffarnagar,” he said.It has been over seven months since the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations, began.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/issued-peoples-whip-for-mps-to-raise-farmers-demand-during-parliament-monsoon-session-skm-283142

14-07-2021||Mumbai||Third wave of Covid pandemic in India looks more real now: Foreign brokerage||Even though the second wave has ebbed, the increased presence of the Delta variant and the subsequent mutations of the coronavirus make the third wave a real risk for the country, a foreign brokerage has warned.The risks are real and rising because the pace of vaccination has slowed down to under 3.4 million doses daily from 4 million earlier and also as many as 45 per cent of the daily infections are being reported from rural areas, points Tanvee Gupta-Jain, the chief economist at UBS Securities India.On the other hand, economic activity has improved sequentially for the seventh consecutive week to July 12, as some states have gradually eased mobility restrictions, notes the report.Although the second wave is behind us, the risk of a third wave has increased. With the presence of the Delta variant and subsequent mutations of the virus, we consider a third wave a real risk. The number of daily new cases seems to have plateaued but still remains much above the 2021 trough and the decline in active cases has started narrowing,  she said in a note on Wednesday.What is more worrying, according to the report, is the fact that in over 20 per cent of the top caseload districts where the second has ebbed, the third wave has set in firmly, which was only 5 per cent a month ago.In over 20 per cent of the districts where the cases have bottomed on daily bases new cases till last week, going by the new cases it is clear that third wave has firmly set in. This compares to only 5 per cent a month ago, she notes in the report. Another big worry is the slowing pace of vaccinations. Daily doses stood at 3.4 million as of July 12, compared to 4 million in June and 2 million in May, on supply constraints and vaccine hesitancy.As of July 12, only 381 million doses were administered: while 22.7 per cent of the population above 18 have received the first dose, only a paltry 5.4 per cent of the 900 million who are to be inoculated have received both the doses.Gupta-Jain further says though economic indicators are normalising they are still mixed. Railway and domestic airline passenger traffic has improved further but toll collections have plateaued for the latest reporting week, according to the UBS-India activity indicator.Also, while power demand was up 11 per cent partly on summer season demand, railway freight has declined by 1.9 per cent w-o-w and to cap it all vehicle registrations contracted 9 per cent as of July 12, the first time since the last week of May, may be due to the price hike announced by auto companies to offset the increased production cost.Again, while the labour force participation rate improved to 40.6 per cent from 39.6 per cent end-June, urban and rural unemployment has picked up marginally.Further, the below-trend monsoons so far could have adversely affected summer crop sowing to the tune of a negative 10 per cent in rural areas.

Consequently, 147 more women officers are being granted PC, taking the total PC granted to 424 out of the 615 officers considered,” the ministry said in a statement.The results of a few women officers have been withheld for administrative reasons and awaiting the outcome of the clarification petition filed by the Central government in the Supreme Court, it added.The apex court, in a landmark ruling in February 2020, had directed the Centre to ensure that women SSC officers are given PC in the Army, including command postings.Therefore, the Army had constituted a special selection board in September 2020 to screen women officers. The results were declared in November 2020.The women officers who were not granted PC in November 2020 moved to the Supreme Court. The top court in March this year found that the “evaluation criteria set by the Army constituted systemic discrimination” against these women officers.The Supreme Court, in its March order, laid down revised parameters on the basis of which the women officers would be evaluated for the permanent commission in the Army.The Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that all women officers, who have been granted PC, would undergo special training courses and challenging military assignments to empower them for higher leadership roles in the Army.A batch of 33 women officers has already successfully completed the mid-level tactical orientation course from Army War College Mhow recently, it added.The ministry said all women SSC officers, who were considered by the Army’s selection board and not granted PC, will still be eligible for pension subject to serving for a minimum of 20 years in service.

Identified as Aleti Nihar Reddy, the younger son of Laxma Reddy and Shobha Reddy, the software engineer hails from Bhorigaon village in Echoda Mandal. As the news of Aleti reached the village, the entire neighbourhood went into mourning.According to relatives, who first heard about the accident from the parents of the deceased, Aleti was holidaying at the waterfalls, Lake Sammamish, a popular tourist spot of Washington DC, when his foot slipped, and he fell into the lake.The entire family was together, but none could rescue him. By the time help arrived, he had drowned and declared dead upon being pulled out. “It was an accident, his foot slipped at a slippery spot, and he fell into the lake, resulting in his drowning as he did not know how to swim,” a local repeated as the family told him.Aleti and his brother Nikhil moved to the USA about three years ago. Two years ago, he married a girl from Hyderabad in 2019 and is now expecting their first child. The parents of the deceased were visiting the two sons, and all had decided to enjoy Sunday by going for a picnic. The incident has sent shock waves among family and friends.At the same time, Jaya, the wife of one Shanmukha, who hails from Vishakhapatnam in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, has appealed to the government for help as her husband has been arrested and jailed in Dakar, Senegal, on charges of drug trafficking. She has said her husband has been framed as the employer did not want to pay the accumulated salary.Giving details to the media, Jaya said her husband was working in Uganda but had come to India due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since he did not find work here, he took up the offer to sail, something he did before marriage. She said four out of the seven crew members arrested from the ASSO 6 cargo ship were Indians — Shanmukha from Visakhapatnam and Mahesh from Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh, and two others, Chandan and Krishna.She said her husband told her that he had no clue that the ship was carrying drugs and that he and the other Indians were innocent. All have been detained in a Dakar prison, and they are only able to communicate with their families through a Senegalese man they had met in jail who has since been released. Jaya said that she was seeking support from Indian authorities to get her husband and other crew members released and brought to India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/software-engineer-from-telangana-drowns-in-usa-283112
14-07-2021||New Delhi||Over 9k trafficked kids rescued by law enforcement agencies since beginning of Covid: KSCF||Over 9,000 trafficked children were rescued from trains, buses and factories by law enforcement agencies since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, the Kailash Satyarthi Foundation said as its founder Kailash Satyarthi appealed for urgent passage of anti-trafficking bill in the Monsoon Session of Parliament.The Women and Child Development Ministry has invited suggestions from stakeholders on the draft 'Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021' which proposes severe punishment for aggravated forms of trafficking.Elaborating on the draft bill, the ministry said its objective is to prevent and counter trafficking of people, especially women and children, to provide care and protection to victims, rehabilitate them, while respecting their rights, and creating a supportive legal, economic and social environment for them and also to ensure prosecution of offenders, and for connected matters.In the light of an alarming rise in cases of trafficking and forced labour in the country due to further impoverishment of poor families, Satyarthi has appealed for urgent passage of the bill in the upcoming Monsoon Session without further delay.The passage of the bill through both Houses of Parliament will fulfill the demand of 12 lakh Indians who marched across 22 states and 12,000 km demanding a strong law against trafficking, said Satyarthi."The current pandemic has led to an aggravation of vulnerabilities of the marginalised children in India. They are now much more prone to various kinds of exploitation, especially trafficking and child labour," The Kailash Satyarthi Foundation said in a statement.Bachpan Bachao Andolan, a sister organisation of the KSCF, has rescued more than 9,000 trafficked children from trains, buses and factories along with law enforcement agencies since the beginning of the pandemic from across the entire country.On the importance of the bill, Satyarthi said, "A strong anti-trafficking law is the moral and constitutional responsibility of our elected leaders, and a necessary step toward nation-building and economic progress. As long as children are bought and sold at lesser cost than cattle, no country can call itself civilised.""Covid-19 has caused a rise in trafficking, especially of women and children. We cannot take this lightly. A law for prevention, timely investigation, punishment for traffickers, and the protection and rehabilitation of survivors is a matter of urgency. I call on all parliamentarians to pass a strong and comprehensive anti-trafficking law in the upcoming session of Parliament. Our children, their freedom and dignity cannot wait," he said.Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021 covers aspects of trafficking by including various pertaining to trafficking, including aggravated forms of trafficking. It creates a dedicated institutional mechanism at district, state and national level to prevent and counter trafficking, and also for the protection and rehabilitation of victims of trafficking.The existing bill has expanded definition of trafficking and victim and covers new forms of aggravated trafficking for the purpose of forced or bonded labour, debt bondage, slavery, servitude, sexual exploitation, biomedical research or trials, carrying out unlawful activities in places such as placement agencies, massage parlours, spas, travel agencies, circus, etc.The bill also provides stringent punishment for offences of trafficking of women, or children, or transgenders under institutional care. The existing bill also ensures immediate monetary relief and compensation.Under the bill, the designated court is entrusted the duty to record the statement of the victim through video conferencing, especially in case of transborder and inter-state crimes where the victim has been repatriated to any other State or country and is unable to appear before the court for the reasons of safety or confidentiality. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-9k-trafficked-kids-rescued-by-law-enforcement-agencies-since-beginning-of-covid-kscf-283106
14-07-2021||New Delhi||See if dispute can be settled, Delhi HC tells Sushant Singh Rajput's father, filmmakers||The Delhi High Court Wednesday suggested that Sushant Singh Rajput's father and the makers of a film purportedly based on the late Bollywood actor's life make an attempt at finding a solution to their dispute."Talk to each other and see if it can be worked out," said Justice Talwant Singh while hearing Krishna Kishore Singh's appeal against the single-judge order refusing to stay the release of the film 'Nyay: The Justice'."Independent of the proceedings, we will try to resolve," said senior advocate Jayant Mehta, representing Kishore Singh.Senior advocate Chander Lall, appearing on behalf of the film director, also agreed to the suggestion and said that there was “no intention to take advantage”.Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who was heading the two-judge bench, remarked however that the case did not seem like “one of those cases where settlement is possible”.The court issued notice and granted a week to the filmmakers to respond to Kishore Singh's application seeking a stay on further circulation or publication of the movie.The court noted that the application contained certain documents which were not before the single-judge, and thus suggested that an application for the said relief be filed before the single judge itself.Lall highlighted that in the judgement under challenge, the single-judge has already given liberty to Kishore Singh to come back to it after the release of the film in case of any fresh grievances.Mehta, however, stated that he would want to take his chance before the division bench and that the documents only reinforced the stand already taken by his client in the plea before the single judge.He argued that the single judge had erroneously ruled that celebrity rights ceased to exist after death and that the movie was merely inspired from the life of Rajput.Mehta emphasised that there were media interviews given by the actors associated with the film that it was based on the late actor's life, and having a disclaimer at the start of the film was not sufficient.Inspired is a convenient stand. It is not correct, Mehta said, as he contended that even the victims have a right to fair trial.Mehta urged the court to pass a direction to restrain any further multiplication of film between Wednesday and the next date of hearing.Lall said that he would not give any assurance in this regard as his client had a judgement in his favour and the film had already been released.The court declined to pass any order at this stage.Last week as well, the court had refused to pass any such direction to restrain further circulation, observing that the film had already been released on a website.In the application, Singh said that the release of the film on website called lapalap original was “nothing but a sham” as it was “incomplete, completely smudged, blur and hazy throughout”.Since the movie is incomplete, it has not been released, the application said.Last month, a vacation bench of the high court had issued notice in the appeal.The single judge had earlier said it found merit in the submissions of producers and directors that if information of events which have occurred is already in the public domain, one cannot plead any violation of right to privacy on a movie inspired from such events.Some of the upcoming or proposed movie projects based on his son''s life are -- ''Nyay: The Justice'', ''Suicide or Murder: A star was lost'', ''Shashank'' and an unnamed crowd-funded film.The court had directed the filmmakers to render complete accounts of the revenue earned from the films, if any case of damages is made out in future and listed the suit for completion of pleading before the joint registrar.The suit claimed that in case a "movie, web-series, book or any other content of similar nature is allowed to be published or broadcasted, it would affect the right of the victim and deceased for a free and fair trial as it may cause prejudice to them".The matter would be heard next on July 26. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/see-if-dispute-can-be-settled-delhi-hc-tells-sushant-singh-rajputs-father-filmmakers-283105

India will also be pursuing the goal of zero tolerance to terrorism under the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) which it has been pushing unsuccessfully since 1996.India will be in a particularly sweet spot because Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid will be the President of the UN General Assembly, though his term begins in September. This aspect was noted in a phone call by PM Narendra Modi to Maldives President Ibrahim Soli on Wednesday.Incidentally, it was Shringla who visited Male in November last year to announce India’s backing to the Maldivian candidate. Maldives has since repaid the favour with Shahid appointing India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, K Nagaraj Naidu, as his Chef de Cabinet.India is a non-permanent member of the UNSC for two years from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022.As the UNSC President, India will have a number of signature events, including on UN peacekeeping.

14-07-2021||London||Covid: 90-year-old woman dies with double variant infection||A 90-year-old woman became sick and later died, with the Alpha and Beta Covid variants first identified in the UK and South Africa.Experts say it is possible to catch two Covid variants at the same time after seeing the double infection in the woman, who died in March 2021 in Belgium. She had not been vaccinated.Her doctors suspect she contracted the infections from two different people, the BBC reported.They believe it is the first documented case of its kind and, although rare, similar dual infections are happening.Her case is being discussed at this year's European Congress on Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases.In January 2021, scientists in Brazil reported that two people had been simultaneously infected with two types of coronavirus, one of them a variant of concern called Gamma.Researchers from Portugal, meanwhile, recently treated a 17-year-old who appeared to have caught a second type of Covid while still recovering from a different, pre-existing Covid infection.The 90-year-old, who was infected with the two "variants of concern" - the most worrying new versions of coronavirus that experts are tracking - had been admitted to hospital after experiencing some falls, but later developed worsening respiratory symptoms.Laboratory tests on samples taken when she was admitted revealed she had Covid-19, caused by two different mutated versions of the pandemic virus, simultaneously - Alpha and Beta.Lead researcher Dr Anne Vankeerberghen, from the OLV hospital in Aalst, Belgium, said: "Both these variants were circulating in Belgium at the time, so it is likely that the lady was co-infected with different viruses from two different people. Unfortunately, we don't know how she became infected."She was a lady who lived alone, but she got a lot of helpers coming in to care for her. Whether the co-infection of the two variants of concern played a role in the fast deterioration of the patient is difficult to say." Viruses constantly evolve by mutating as they replicate. This creates new versions or variants.Covid has undergone some important changes that may give it an advantage - for example, by increasing its ability to replicate or dodge some of our existing immunity from past infection or vaccination.The most concerning ones are being closely monitored by scientists and are called variants of concern.Currently, in the UK, it is the Delta variant that is spreading the most. Experts are confident that existing vaccines offer good protection against it.Scientists are designing new Covid vaccines that will be an even better match for new variants, and could be used as boosters.Prof Lawrence Young, an expert in virology at the University of Warwick, said: "Detecting two dominant variants of concern in a single person is not a surprise - these could have been passed on by a single infected individual, or by contact with multiple infected people."He said more studies were needed to determine whether such infections in any way compromise the efficacy of vaccination, or make for a worse case of Covid-19. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-90-year-old-woman-dies-with-double-variant-infection-283096
14-07-2021||Bilaspur||Chhattisgarh HC allows minor rape victim to terminate pregnancy||The Chhattisgarh High Court has granted permission to a 15-year-old rape victim to terminate her less than 20-week pregnancy, an official said on Wednesday.A single Bench of Justice Goutam Bhaduri on Tuesday passed the order directing that the victim is entitled to medical termination of pregnancy, the petitioner’s lawyer Anis Tiwari said.In the order, Justice Bhaduri said that it is obvious that if the victim was subjected to rape and if she is forced to give birth to a child, she would have to face a lifelong anguish, besides the fact that the child would also have to face disdain of the society, the lawyer said.The court further stated that in order to carry out the abortion, the state government will have to form a panel of expert doctors at the district hospital in Korba as early as possible, and the hospital must take due care of the victim’s health and provide her all the medical support.The court also directed that the DNA of the foetus should be preserved considering the fact that the victim has lodged a complaint of rape, and the information may be required at a future date, Tiwari said, adding that the girl has been directed to appear at the district hospital in Korba on July 14.

14-07-2021||New Delhi||Can courts venture into executive domain on Covid-19 management and how far, SC to examine||The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would examine how far can constitutional courts venture into issues which are exclusively in the domain of executive related to Covid-19 management.The top court said that the courts need to respect the demarcation of power given under the Constitution even though the objective was in fairness to everybody. It said that the court will examine whether at all the Allahabad High Court needed to tread in this arena and whether its ‘Ram Bharose’ comment was justified. The remarks of a Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari came while hearing an appeal against the Allahabad High Court order relating to management of the Covid-19 situation in Uttar Pradesh in which it had said that the entire healthcare system in villages and small cities of the state was “Ram bharose” (at God’s mercy).The Bench said, “What we want to lay down is how far a constitutional court can venture into an issue like this. Whether at all the High Court needed to tread on this arena? Despite the objective being in fairness to everybody we have to respect the demarcation. How far ‘Ram Bharose’ comments justified”.Justice Saran said, “There were questions like how many ambulances are there, how many oxygen beds are there. We don’t want to comment on these questions. It’s not that you cannot give suggestions but how can you ask local companies to take vaccine formula and manufacture it? How can such direction be given?”           Justice Maheshwari also said that there are certain issues which are the domain of the executive and moreover at the time of crisis everybody has to proceed cautiously and have to take note of what is to be done by whom. “We may have 110 suggestions but can we make it part of an order? We have to remember that we are a constitutional court”, Justice Maheshwari said, adding that collective efforts are needed at the time of crisis, but good intent in itself does not give everybody a right to enter into other’s arena. The Bench said that although there cannot be a straightjacket formula for every problem but there are certain norms within which every institution works.The top court at the outset, asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta about the status of the case to which he replied that a Bench of acting chief justice in the high court is hearing the case now. Mehta said the court may set aside the order of the High Court.The Bench said that in its earlier order it had already stated that directions of the High Court should be treated as suggestions and therefore no formal set aside is required.It told Mehta that his assistance is required in collating all the orders passed by the court in the case and at present since High Court is dealing with the matter, this court does not intend to take it up. Senior advocate Nidesh Gupta, who has been appointed as amicus curiae in the matter, stated that the High Court has said that viability of its directions has to be seen by the state. He said that the court may ask the Uttar Pradesh government to do what it is proposing to do before the third wave as it is a lull before the storm. The Bench said it will take up the matter on August 12 and the High Court can continue hearing the case. The state government in its affidavit has said that it has a total of 2200 basic life support ambulances in addition to 250 advanced life support ambulances. It has said that there are 298 community health centres in the state and 177 oxygen concentrators have been provided to 273 such centres and it is purchasing over 20,000 oxygen concentrators. On May 21, observing that high courts should refrain from passing directions which are not implementable, the top court had stayed the High Court order passed on May 17.

14-07-2021||Chennai||Majority of representations to panel said ‘they don’t want NEET,’ says Justice Rajan||A high-level committee led by retired Madras High Court judge A K Rajan on Wednesday handed over its report to Chief Minister M K Stalin on the impact of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test in Tamil Nadu and related issues due to its implementation.The full report, which runs into 165 pages, has been presented to Chief Minister Stalin and his attention was also drawn to its key aspects, Justice Rajan said, adding the recommendations made to the government cannot be disclosed.The report was prepared after looking into about 86,000 representations from stakeholders, a majority of whom said they “don’t want NEET”, he told reporters at the Secretariat after giving the report to Stalin.The impact of the national test among aspirants, people and several sections of society has been dealt with and the report is completely based on data and not on personal opinions, he said answering a question.Asked if there are other major ‘problems’, vis-a-vis NEET, besides the adverse impact for rural and government school students, he said there are several problems, including psychological, economical and even legal and all such aspects have been covered in the report.The work of the panel is over and “definitely we are satisfied about the work,” he said.Last month, announcing the Justice Rajan panel, the Chief Minister had said the committee would analyse if the national test had an adverse impact on students from backward classes.If it was so, the panel would recommend remedial measures to the government suggesting an alternative admission procedure that would benefit all.The panel was tasked to study data related to medical admissions in Tamil Nadu and make necessary recommendations to safeguard the interests of students from the backward sections.“The government will initiate the next course of action after considering the recommendations,” the state government had said.Stalin had said that Tamil Nadu always had the historic duty of upholding social justice and to fulfil that duty continuously, the government is determined to take all steps to address the consequences due to the NEET.A petition in the Madras High Court, seeking to quash the Tamil Nadu government notification, constituting the high- level committee on NEET, has been dismissed by the court.Most parties, including the ruling DMK and main opposition AIADMK, are on the same page on NEET and have been demanding that the test be scrapped, arguing that it went against social justice, rural and government school students.Besides Justice Rajan, who led the panel, there were eight other members, including Dr G R Ravindranath (Doctors Association for Social Equality), Jawahar Nesan (educationist) and six top government officials like the Principal Secretary of Medical and Family Welfare Department.The previous AIADMK government had in October last year introduced 7.5 per cent reservation to government school students who clear NEET in medical admissions.

14-07-2021|| New Delhi||Cabinet extends by 5 years centrally-sponsored scheme for developing infrastructure for judiciary||With several courts still functioning on rented premises, the Union Cabinet Wednesday approved a five-year extension for a centrally-sponsored scheme for developing infrastructure for the judiciary, a statement said.The Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary has been in operation since 1993-94. An official statement said that in the extended term, it would continue from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2026, during which Rs 9,000 crore would be spent with the Central share of Rs 5,357 crore, including Rs 50 crore for the Gram Nyayalaya Scheme. Several courts are still functioning on rented premises with insufficient space and some in dilapidated conditions without basic amenities, the statement pointed out. The lack of residential accommodation to all the judicial officers also adversely affects their work and performance, it observed."The present government has remained sensitive to the needs of providing well-equipped judicial infrastructure to subordinate judiciary to facilitate administration of justice in a manner that allows easy access and timely delivery of justice to all. "Adequacy of judicial infrastructure is critical for reduction of pendency and backlog of cases in courts," it said.The decision will help in the construction of 3,800 court halls and 4,000 residential units (both new and ongoing projects) for judicial officers of district and subordinate courts, 1,450 lawyer halls, 1,450 toilets complexes and 3,800 digital computer rooms, it said.The Cabinet also approved a proposal to support Gram Nyayalayas by providing recurring and non-recurring grants for a period of 5 years with a total outlay of Rs 50 crore. However, funds will be released to states only after the notified Gram Nyayalayas are operationalised and Nyayadhikaris appointed and reported on the Gram Nyayalaya portal of Department of Justice, it said.A review will be undertaken after one year to assess whether Gram Nyayalaya Scheme has successfully achieved its objective of providing speedy and affordable justice to the rural and marginalised populace, it said.Though the primary responsibility of infrastructure development for the subordinate judiciary rests with the state governments, the Central government through the scheme augments the resources of states for the construction of court buildings and residential quarters for judicial officers in all the states and UTs, the statement said. The present proposal allows additional activities like the construction of lawyer halls, toilets complexes, and digital computer rooms.This will add to the convenience of lawyers and litigants, besides reducing digital divide, the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-extends-by-5-years-centrally-sponsored-scheme-for-developing-infrastructure-for-judiciary-283089
14-07-2021||New Delhi||Gandhinagar Capital: India's 1st upgraded rail station set to open, will offer 'airport experience'||The Gandhinagar Capital railway station, the country's first redeveloped station set to be inaugurated this week, will provide an airport-like experience to passengers with facilities such as a luxury hotel, theme-based lighting, an interfaith prayer hall and a separate baby feeding room, officials said Wednesday.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the station on July 16.  Its redevelopment was conceptualised in 2016 as part of the railways' ambitious project to transform stations into world-class 24x7 transport and business hubs.

The roof is in the shape of an arch.The structure is designed and provided with green building rating features and has already obtained sustainability standards green certification from the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM)."The station has been developed at par with airports for enhanced public satisfaction. We have tried to incorporate all the best facilities that our passengers require for a pleasant experience at a railway station," Railway Board Chairman Suneet Sharma said."In the project to redevelop stations, we are striving towards creating new sources of revenue for the railways as well new experiences for our passengers. It is truly a ‘Naye Bharat ka naya station (new station of New India)'," he said.The redevelopment work on the Gandhinagar Capital station started in 2017 with a joint venture named Gandhinagar Railway and Urban Development (GARUD) being formed. The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) has 74:26 equity contribution from the Government of Gujarat (GoG) and the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC), the nodal agency and the main project development agency (PDA) for such stations. The project was envisioned with the Gujarat International Finance Tech (GIFT) city in focus which could emerge as a key international finance centre on the lines of other world famous cities.Among others facilities, the station has segregated entry and exit through landscaped area, Divyang-friendly special ticket booking counters, ramps, lifts, dedicated parking space, and a dedicated art gallery with live LED wall display lounge, the railways said.The station also has a state-of-the-art external façade with daily theme-based lighting, vertical green wall, a separate baby feeding room and a centralised AC waiting lounge, it said.In order to segregate the passengers, a concourse is planned for departing passengers, and two subways for arriving ones. The station is future-ready, and the concourse will be used for departing passengers when their numbers increase at the station, the railways said. Without the concourse, the redeveloped station has been designed to handle 1,500 passengers in peak hours and with the concourse, the capacity will go up to 2,200, it said.In the near future, it is planned to open retail, food and entertainment outlets in the area for passengers as well as the local population, it said. Market players such as Big Bazaar and Shopper's Stop have shown interest in opening their mini outlets at the station, the railways said, adding the redeveloped station will function like a "city centre rail mall" where travel will be one of the several functions. The platforms are well connected through two subways with adequate seating capacity and two each of escalators and elevators, it said.The station also has a luxury hotel on top of it. Spread across 7,400 square meters and built at a cost of Rs 790 crore, it has 318 rooms and is operated by a private entity, the railways said. It is expected that national and international guests who would come to attend seminars and conferences at Mahatma Mandir, a convention centre situated just opposite the property, would stay at the hotel, it said.While PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah would attend the inauguration virtually, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and other dignitaries are expected to attend the function in Gandhinagar, officials said. As part of the larger redevelopment project, work on 125 stations is in progress. Out of these, the IRSDC is working on 63, and the RLDA (Rail Land Development Authority) on 60 with two other stations being taken up by railway zones, the national transporter said. The total investment for the redevelopment of 123 stations along with real estate development is more than Rs 50,000 crore. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gandhinagar-capital-indias-1st-upgraded-rail-station-set-to-open-will-offer-airport-experience-283086

Rs 1,624 crore over five years for the Indian merchant shipping companies to make them favourite in global tenders floated by ministries and Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) for import of their bulk cargo.  A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of the Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said Information & Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur. Later in an official statement, the government said, “The registration shall be done online within 72 hours like the world’s best ships registries and this will make it easy and attractive to register ships in India and thereby aid in boosting the Indian tonnage”.It further said in addition to this, “It is intended to provide 30 days to any in-flagging vessel to replace the crew on board with Indian crew”.In order to address the cost disadvantage suffered by Indian flagships, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Union Budget speech for 2021-22, had announced a scheme providing Rs 1,624 crore over five years to promote flagging of merchant ships in India by providing subsidy support to Indian companies in global tenders floated by ministries and CPSEs.In the statement the government said, steps are also being taken to rationalise the manning requirements on the ships by aligning them with international standards.It also pointed out that despite having a 7,500 km long coastline, a significant national export-import trade that is steadily growing on an annual basis, “a policy of 100 percent FDI in shipping since 1997 and Indian shipping industry and India’s national fleet” has been proportionately small in comparison to their global counterparts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-gives-nod-to-subsidy-scheme-worth-rs-1-624-crore-for-indian-shipping-companies-283082

14-07-2021||New Delhi||In pictures: Another spell of rainfall in Delhi keeps the heat at bay||Another spell of rainfall in Delhi on Wednesday kept the heat at bay.The city had received the first rain of the monsoon season on Tuesday, 16 days after the usual date of June 27.The weather department said parts of the capital recorded light rain overnight. The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 29 mm rainfall in the 24 hours ending 8:30 am on Wednesday.Lodhi Road gauged 37.8 mm precipitation during the period.Delhi recorded a minimum of 26 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 34 degrees Celsius.Light to moderate rainfall is expected in Delhi over the next six days. Over the last one month, the weather department had struggled to accurately predict when the monsoon will reach the capital.After several wayward forecasts, the IMD Monday acknowledged that "such type of failure by numerical models in the prediction of monsoon over the capital is rare and uncommon". It had earlier said that the monsoon would hit Delhi on June 15, which would have been 12 days early, but the wind system entered a "break" phase.The monsoon finally embraced Delhi on Tuesday.The rains, however, eluded Central Delhi, which remains the most rain-deficient district in the country this season, receiving only 8.5 mm rainfall against the normal of 139.3 mm since June 1, when the season starts. It has recorded a shortfall of 94 per cent.Overall, Delhi has so far received 65 per cent less rainfall than normal, putting it in the category of "large deficient" states.

In 2019-2020, around 62 per cent of India's oil imports valued at approximately USD 66 billion came from the Gulf region, the Navy said."For the same year, India's exports and imports from the region stood at around USD 51 billion and USD 108.2 billion, respectively. These constitute 8.1 per cent and 11.4 per cent of India's total exports and imports, respectively," it noted.Despite diversification of sources for import of oil, Gulf countries are likely to continue as major suppliers of oil for India, it said."Due to the prevailing security situation in Persian Gulf, it is required to provide security to Indian-flagged merchant vessels transiting through the region by showing presence, escorting or providing close support to vessels as required," it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/operation-sankalp-sixteen-indian-flagged-vessels-provided-safe-passage-everyday-283053
14-07-2021||New Delhi||Contribution of neuro NCDs to India's disease burden more than doubled from 1990-2009||The contribution of non-communicable and injury-related neurological disorders to the total disease burden more than doubled in India from 1990 to 2019, whereas that of communicable neurological disorders reduced by three quarters, according to the findings of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative.The first comprehensive estimates of disease burden due to neurological disorders and their trends in every state of India from 1990 was published on Wednesday in The Lancet Global Health by the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative.According to the findings, the burden of non-communicable neurological disorders is increasing in India, mainly due to the ageing of the population. While communicable diseases contributed to the majority of total neurological disorders burden in children younger than 5 years, non-communicable neurological disorders were the biggest contributor in all other age groups, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in a release.Strokes, headache disorders and epilepsy are the leading contributors to neurological disorders burden in India, it said.In 2019, strokes caused 6,99,000 deaths, which was 7.4 per cent of the total deaths in the country. The burden of many neurological disorders varied considerably between the states, which has significant implications for the policies and programmes to reduce this burden, it stated.Among the known risk factors for neurological disorders burden, high blood pressure, air pollution, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass index are the leading contributors.The study was done by the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, a collaborative effort between the ICMR, Public Health Foundation of India, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and a number of other key stakeholders in India, including academic experts and institutions, government agencies and other organisations, under the aegis of the Ministry of Health.The state-specific findings described in this scientific paper highlight the extent of the effort needed in each state to reduce the burden of neurological disorders through state-specific health system responses aimed at increasing awareness, early identification, cost-effective treatment, and rehabilitation.The trends over about three decades reported in this research paper utilised all available data sources from India that enabled more robust estimates of neurological disorder burden across India than those available so far.Dr Vinod Paul, Member (Health) NITI Aayog said this scientific paper presents a comprehensive perspective of the burden of neurological disorders over the last 30 years and systematically highlights the variations between the states.Several government policies and initiatives are in place to address the burden of neurological disorders across India, however, more focused efforts are required for the planning of specific neurology services in each state, he said."There is a need to address the shortage of trained neurology workforce and strengthen early detection and cost-effective management of neurological disorders in the country to deal with their growing burden," he said.Dr Balram Bhargava, secretary, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Director General, ICMR said this research paper provides the first consolidated estimates on the burden of most neurological disorders for every state of India from 1990 to 2019."Neurological disorders contribute 10 per cent of the total disease burden in India. There is a growing burden of non-communicable neurological disorders in the country, which is mainly attributable to ageing of the population," he said.Prof Gagandeep Singh of Dayanand Medical College and the first author of the paper said the analysis in this paper highlights the key issues related to trends of neurological disorders in the states of India.Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in India. While the prevalence of epilepsy has increased over the past three decades, it is gratifying to note that India has made some gains in reducing premature deaths and morbidity of people with epilepsy over this period by reducing treatment gaps. There is, however, a need to scale up treatment coverage of epilepsy in governmental schemes such as the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram and Ayushman Bharat, he said.Policies and practices focusing on safe births, preventing head injury and stroke would help in averting a substantial proportion of epilepsies, he added.Professor K Srinath Reddy, president of Public Health Foundation of India, said the rise of non-communicable disease (NCD) related risk factors as the leading contributor to neurological disorders and resultant disability in India is not a surprise.It reflects the demographic, socio-economic and nutrition transitions that have steered the shift in our epidemiological profile over the past 30 years. What is helpful is the recognition that much of this burden of disease and disability is related to modifiable risk factors, which can be reduced at the population level and corrected at the individual level. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contribution-of-neuro-ncds-to-indias-disease-burden-more-than-doubled-from-1990-2009-283045

The language used by your close clique about my father and other leaders in the past has been detrimental to party unit in Bengal," he said"Even after the results of May 2, I had hoped you would take necessary steps and make the rectification which would send out a message to the people of the state that Bengal Congress would fight the BJP for the opposition space. Alas, that too never happened," he added.The resignation once again brought to the fore the infighting in the faction-riddled state Congress, which failed to win a single seat in the Assembly elections after joining hands with the Left Front and ISF.Mitra said that the party witnessed an ultimate downfall in the state and there are no signs of its revival."The change in your tone and the narrative towards the TMC government and the chief minister of West Bengal is a proof of that," he wrote in the letter.Chowdhury was not immediately available for comment.The name of Rohan's mother Shikha Mitra was announced by the BJP from the Chowringhee seat for the state elections after BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari met her.She then said that she was not consulted before the name was announced and she would not leave the Congress, forcing the BJP to change its candidate.The episode also drew the attention of the Congress high-command with party president Sonia Gandhi calling to congratulate her.Somen Mitra, the then state Congress president, died in July last year at the age of 78. Chowdhury replaced him. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-veteran-somen-mitras-son-resigns-as-partys-bengal-general-secretary-283043
14-07-2021||New Delhi||SCO must stop terror financing: Jaishankar at SCO meet||Combating terrorism and extremism is the key purpose of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and it must stop terror financing, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said at a key meeting of the grouping that was attended by his counterparts from Pakistan and China.In his address at the meeting in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, Jaishankar described the situation in Afghanistan as well as public health and economic recovery as pressing issues facing the region.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi were amongst the participants at the meeting. "Spoke at the FMM of SCO this morning at Dushanbe. Afghanistan, public health and economic recovery are pressing issues. Combating terrorism and extremism is the key purpose of SCO. Must stop terror financing and deter digital facilitation," Jaishankar tweeted.In his remarks, the external affairs minister also highlighted the "One Earth One Health" message and urged early universal vaccination to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.Jaishankar said he also spoke on reformed multi-lateralism and underlined the need to rejuvenate this domain.Earlier, in a separate tweet, Jaishankar said the 20th year of establishment of the SCO is an opportune time for the grouping to reflect on achievements and deliberate on challenges. "Afghanistan and post-Covid recovery are pressing concerns," Jaishankar said.Afghanistan witnessed a series of terror attacks in the last few weeks as the US looked to complete the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan by August-end, ending a nearly two-decade of its military presence in the war-ravaged country.The volatile situation in Afghanistan has triggered global concerns.The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, is an eight-member economic and security bloc and has emerged as one of the largest trans-regional international organisations. India and Pakistan became its permanent members in 2017.The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.India has shown keen interest in deepening its security-related cooperation with the SCO and its Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS) which specifically deals with issues relating to security and defence.India was made an observer at the SCO in 2005 and has generally participated in the ministerial-level meetings of the grouping which focus mainly on security and economic cooperation in the Eurasian region.

14-07-2021||New Delhi||Inferences drawn from comparison of HMIS, CRS data on Covid deaths fallacious: Govt||The Union Health Ministry on Wednesday dismissed as "conjectures" and "speculation" some media reports that claimed higher COVID-19 fatality figures based on data from the National Health Mission's Health Management Information System (HMIS). There have been some speculative media reports claiming higher fatality figures due to COVID-19 based on data from HMIS, the ministry said."'The report compares data from the Civil Registration System (CRS) and HMIS to draw erroneous inferences. Such reports are conjectures and speculation without any substantial basis," the ministry said.Citing the death numbers reported in the HMIS, the ministry in a statement noted that the media report goes on to say that “In the absence of other information, these deaths should all be considered as COVID-19 deaths”. As per the media report itself "over 2,50,000 deaths were from causes not known," it said.Attributing any death to COVID-19 without any basis than based on empirical data is fallacious and such inferences are mere figments of imagination, the statement said. The Centre, it noted, has been transparent in its approach to Covid data management and a robust system of recording all COVID-19 related deaths already exists. All states and union territories have been entrusted with the responsibility to update the data in this particular system continuously. In order to avoid inconsistency in the number of deaths being reported, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has issued 'Guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India' for correct recording of all deaths as per ICD-10 codes recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for mortality coding, the statement said. States and UTs have been urged through various formal communications, multiple video conferences and deployment of Central teams for correct recording of deaths following the prescribed guidelines. The ministry has also regularly emphasised robust reporting mechanisms for monitoring district-wise cases and deaths daily. There shall always be differences in mortality recorded during a profound and prolonged public health crisis such as the Covid pandemic and well-conducted research studies on mortalities are usually done after the event when data on mortalities is available from reliable sources, the statement said. The methodologies for such studies are well established, the data sources are defined as also the valid assumptions for computing mortality, it stated.

There have been no clashes in Galwan or any other area, as reported in the article," the Army said.It also said that the report mentioning that agreements with China had collapsed is "false and baseless"."Both sides have continued with negotiations to resolve the balance issues, and regular patrolling in respective areas continues. The situation on ground continues to be as earlier. PLA activities, including turnover of troops, continue to be monitored by the Indian Army," the Army said.India and China have been locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year.The two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong Lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.

Though she was repeatedly stable, her condition deteriorated and she died after reportedly having ice cream in the presence of doctors.In its order, the MHA said, “The Ministry has requested the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to inquire into the case of the deaths of Rosy Sangma and Samuel Sangma.”It further said, “The case relates to the death of Rosy Sangma in a hospital in Gurgaon on June 24 this year after she had complained of a medical condition. Later, Samuel Sangma, a relative of Rosy Sangma, suspecting medical negligence, had an altercation with doctors and staff of the hospital. On the next day, June 25 the Delhi Police received information regarding the death of Samuel Sangmain, New Delhi.”Her nephew and attendant, Samuel Sangma, had a fight with hospital staff accusing them of negligence. What raised many eyebrows was even he was found dead in a hotel room within 24 hours of Rosy's death.The family alleged negligence and foul play and had demanded a CBI investigation. The demand was supported by prominent leaders and residents of Nagaland who also ran a social media campaign in her support.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-to-investigate-nagaland-womans-death-at-gurugram-hospital-283003

In recent week, the US vaccines have landed in countries across the world, including Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.However, the vaccines to India could not be sent because the Indian government is yet to clear the necessary legal hurdles for such an emergency import."Before we can ship those doses, however, each country must complete its own domestic set of operational, of regulatory, and legal processes that are specific to each country. Now, India has determined that it needs further time to review legal provisions related to accepting vaccine donations," Price said."Once India works through its legal processes, our donations of vaccines to India will proceed expeditiously. We would need to refer you to the Government of India on the status of its discussions with Covax, which, in this case, is helping to facilitate that delivery,” he said."More broadly in the region, throughout South Asia, we're donating millions of vaccines to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Roughly 40 million doses have been delivered worldwide so far,” he added.Responding to another question, Price said that the Covid cooperation between the two countries is built on decades of successful partnership in health and biomedical research.

14-07-2021||Pradeep Magazine||Gritty Ludhiana batsman Yashpal Sharma who shone at 1983 World Cup||Yashpal Sharma, who died after suffering a heart attack on Tuesday, was a firm, resolute, stubborn character. He was groomed in the crucible of India’s First-Class cricket, where most players spent their playing lives striving to be noticed. It is never easy to forge ahead, especially if you are playing for a state which is languishing somewhere at the bottom of the Ranji Trophy Championship.His best knocksYashpal played for Punjab in the 1970s, when many more talented and ambitious players from the state would migrate to Delhi for greater exposure and recognition. The boy from Punjab and India’s hosiery hub, Ludhiana, chose a lonely path, accepting the challenge of carving out a successful career without abandoning his home turf.The Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy consumed all his attention, where his batting flourished with a consistency that was difficult for the selectors to ignore. Soon enough, an India call came and he was on the flight to Pakistan in 1978, though a Test debut eluded him there. He was the backdoor boy who needed to prove himself, which he finally did on the tour of England in 1979. It was a tour on which his batting reflected all those gritty qualities needed to survive in a world that does not look kindly upon those who are not born to rule.He would address journalists of his age as ‘veerey’ (‘brother’ in Punjabi), and always remind them that playing for India is no mean feat, especially if you have to look over your shoulder all the time. Maybe it was hard for him to fit and melt into a mould that may have given his career the foundation and longevity which it eventually lacked.It was not that Yashpal was always a sticky batsman lacking in aggression or innovation. Far from it. It is just that we may have chosen to ignore in our memory some of his more adventurous displays. We remember and celebrate the 1983 World Cup win but forget that Yashpal was one of its key architects, with second-most runs in the team after Kapil Dev.He scored runs in all crucial games, be the opening game against West Indies or the semifinal against England. We remember the catch that Kapil Dev took running backwards to dismiss Viv Richards in the final but forget the audacious flick off a Bob Willis yorker over square-leg for a six by Yashpal in the semifinals. It was a breathtaking stroke.That shot was not an aberration as in a One-day match held in Jalandhar against England, he had smacked Ian Botham for a crucial six in the penultimate over as India romped to an unlikely win. His running between the wickets was exceptional and on the field he was a dashing mover, among the very best outfielders India has had.It is hard to imagine Yash being no more, snatched away so suddenly by death at age 66. He was a proud cricketer and a memory of his, which shows how much he valued playing for the country, has stayed with me. It is from the time when he was hoping to make a comeback: “Yashpal, 37 Tests,” that is how he would always introduce himself.Also read: A fine cricketer, and much more||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gritty-ludhiana-batsman-yashpal-sharma-who-shone-at-1983-world-cup-282807

14-07-2021||New Delhi||Criminal, anti-terror laws should not be misused to quell dissent: Justice Chandrachud||As many activists charged under anti-terror laws languish in jail, Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud has said that criminal laws, including the anti-terror law, should not be misused to muzzle dissent.“The criminal law, including anti-terror legislation should not be misused for quelling dissent or for the harassment of citizens,” Justice Chandrachud said on Monday. He was speaking on the ‘Role of the Supreme Court in protecting fundamental rights in challenging times’ at a conference hosted by the American Bar Association with the Society of Indian Law Firms and Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.Citing his own judgement in Arnab Goswami’s case, Justice Chandrachud said: “Our courts must ensure that they continue to remain the first line of defence against the deprivation of the liberty of citizens. Deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one too many. We must always be mindful of the deeper systemic implications of our decisions”.Justice Chandrachud’s remarks come days after 84-year-old ailing activist Stan Swamy—arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in the Elgar Parishad case—died at a Mumbai hospital waiting for disposal of his bail plea.While granting bail to student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha booked under the UAPA in the 2020 Delhi riots case—the Delhi High Court had last month said that right to protest is a fundamental right that can’t be termed as a terrorist act.Akhil Gogoi — an activist in Assam arrested under the UAPA in connection with protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act—was recently exonerated after spending 17 months in jail.Noting that the Supreme Court plays the role of a “counter-majoritarian institution”, Justice Chandrachud said it’s the duty of the court to protect the rights of socioeconomic minorities.While some have termed these interventions of the Indian Supreme Court as “judicial activism” or “judicial overreach”, the Court plays the role of a counter-majoritarian institution and it is its duty to protect the rights of socio-economic minorities. As the guardian of the Constitution, it has to put a break where executive or legislative actions infringe fundamental human rights.“The Supreme Court has to act in furtherance of its role as sentinel on the qui vive (watchful guardian) and respond to the call of Constitutional conscience and it is this role that prompts it to address the challenges of the 21st century, ranging from the pandemic to the rise of intolerance, features which we find across the world,” he said.He, however, said while being acutely aware of this responsibility, judges were careful about maintaining separation of powers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/criminal-anti-terror-laws-should-not-be-misused-to-quell-dissent-justice-chandrachud-282599

He was also seen on a “temple run” before the second wave of coronavirus-locked the state. The regional party, which is emerging as the BJP’s main challenger in these elections, is often accused of “tushtikaran” (appeasement) by the saffron party.The SP leader, who call it an “obvious attempt to divert attention from the prevailing anger over mismanagement” of coronavirus by the Adityanath government, also says that they have been told “to refrain from making statements/actions that can be interpreted/ used by the BJP as ‘tushtikaran’ of Muslims by the party”.“In current circumstances, the normal mode of polarisation will not work. BJP supporters may still not vote for a Muslim candidate but the divisions that erupted in the region after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots are no longer so deep. A major contributor to this change has been the farmers’ agitation and the mismanagement by the government during the Covid pandemic,” he claims.     Interestingly, when Yadav began his election campaign from Chitrakoot, he was also accused of peddling “soft Hindutva” by detractors. Last year the former UP CM also visited Ayodhya, where the Ram Mandir is being built, to emphasise all the “religious work” his party has done in the city. Since then, he has been to several temples and met saints to seek their blessings, the pictures of which were also posted on his social media account. He has also announced that no tax would be collected from religious places if his party is elected next year.  According to the draft of the proposed population control bill, the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill, 2021, anyone violating two-child policy in Uttar Pradesh will be barred from contesting local bodies elections, from applying for or getting promotion in government jobs, and receiving any kind of government subsidy. Opposition parties have reacted cautiously over the move, perceived as specifically targeting the minority community.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/is-up-population-law%C2%A0to-counter-akhileshs-soft-hindutva-approach-deflect-focus-away-from-covid-mismanagement-allegations-282593

The affidavit is blank in respect of these particulars,” and pointed out that the fact that he was an actor came to light only after Vijay’s counsel made a mention.Rolls Royce Ghost, a luxury brand, is said to cost a few crores, with available information indicating its current market price could be in the range of around Rs 5 crore and go upwards.“The petitioner has imported a prestigious costly car from England. But, unfortunately not paid the Entry tax as per the statutes. He filed a writ petition in order to avoid payment of Entry tax for the car imported from England.”“The petitioner, who is a reputed cine actor, is expected to pay the tax promptly and punctually,” the judge said in his recent order.The court further said the actor has a large scale fan groups and they see them as “real heroes.”“In the state of Tamil Nadu, cine heroes rose as rulers of the state and therefore, the people are under the impression that they are the real heroes. Thus, they are not expected to behave like reel heroes.”“Tax evasion is to be construed as anti-national habit, attitude and mindset and unconstitutional,” the judge noted.“These actors are portraying themselves as champions to bring social justice....their pictures are against corrupt activities in the society. But, they are evading tax and acting in a manner, which is not in consonance with the provisions of the Statutes,” the court noted.In his petition, Vijay prayed for a writ of Mandamus to the respondents—Home Department (Transport), Assistant Commissioner (Commercial Taxes), Assessment Circle, Chennai, the Regional Transport Officer, Chennai South and the Motor Vehicle Inspector, Chennai South forbearing them and their subordinates from demanding or collecting entry tax.He submitted he had paid the import duty to the Customs Department.Dismissing the petition, the court directed Vijay to “pay the Entry tax as demanded by the respondents within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, by adjusting 20 per cent of Entry tax as ordered by this Court in the interim order dated 17.07.2012, if already paid.”In the absence of payment of Entry tax by the petitioner within the stipulated period, the respondents were directed to initiate all further actions by following the procedures.

Crowding must be prevented,” said the PM.He stressed the need to keep accelerating the vaccination process and asked states to enlist the help of social, educational institutes, celebrities and also faith organisations to address hesitancy issues.Referring to the recent Cabinet approval of the Rs 23,000 crore package for improving the infrastructure for testing and treatment, the Prime Minister said the package would help in strengthening the health infrastructure of the northeast.

14-07-2021||New Delhi||Drop one-child norm from draft population policy: VHP||The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has taken exception to the one-child norm proposed in the draft population control Bill of the Uttar Pradesh government.It has asked the UP Law Commission to “delete the one-child norm” and warned UP that it may lead to “imbalance among communities because they are known to respond differently to incentives and disincentives related to family planning and contraception”.The right-wing organisation pointed to an “alarming growing imbalance” in states such as Assam and Kerala, “where the overall growth of population has declined”. “In both states, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of Hindus has declined far below the replacement rate of 2.1, but that of Muslims is 3.16 in Assam and 2.33 in Kerala,” it said.In a letter to the UP Law Commission, Alok Kumar, working president of the VHP, said: “In these states (Assam and Kerala), one of the communities has thus entered the contraction phase, while the other is still expanding. UP should avoid getting into that situation. The policy needs to be tailored to redress the imbalance otherwise one-child policy may end up doing the opposite.”The letter also stated that the one-child norm went beyond the stated objectives of the UP Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill, 2021, of stabilising the population and promoting a two-child norm. “The preamble of the Bill states that this is a Bill (i) inter alia to stabilise the population and (ii) promotion of two-child norm and the VHP agrees with both objects.”The VHP, however, raised objection to Sections 5, 6 (2) and 7 of the Bill, which “incentivise public servants and others to have only one child in the family go well beyond the said objects”. “We also notice that the Population Policy of Uttar Pradesh has an object to bring the TFR to 1.7 within a certain time limit. We suggest that Sections 5, 6(2) and 7 of the Bill as also the object of bringing the TFR to 1.7 needs reconsideration,” the VHP stated in the letter. “A two-child policy is considered desirable for achieving population stability. A policy aiming at an average of less than two children per woman leads to a contraction of the population over time. Such contraction has several negative social and economic consequences,” the VHP said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drop-one-child-norm-from-draft-population-policy-vhp-282188
