One of his great achievements was on April 7, 2016 in Parasnath area where he found four containers of 40 kgs explosive each. That also contained detonators, cortex, mobile phone, walkie talky, GPS which helped in avoiding any mishap and saved valuable lives,” it said.He was part of an operation in Gumla, where with his bravery and sacrifice he saved a whole team of CoBRA commandos from a powerful IED blast around 0730 am but was himself martyred in the process, the CRPF statement said.“His selfless sacrifice will never be forgotten and will always be remembered as an act of valour. Shaheed Drone was cremated with a guard of honour and as per laid down procedure of the force,” the police said.Earlier the headquarters had said that extremists had laid vast traps of IEDs in the entire area and a few villagers had died while grazing cattle in similar IED blasts laid by extremists in the forests.In May this year, security forces had neutralised an extremist in an encounter in the same forest and recovered a stolen police pistol, .303 rifle, 63 live cartridges and 24 can-bombs.

The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, 2020, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of around Rs 59,000 crore.Currently, the IAF has around 25 Rafale jets and the remaining ordered aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2022.The first squadron will look after Pakistan border on western frontier and the northern frontier. The second squadron will look after the eastern frontier of India, the officials mentioned.The formal induction ceremony of the Rafale fleet had taken place at Ambala on September 10 last year. Later on, other batches of the fighter jet also arrived in India.The IAF officials said the second Rafale squadron would be operationalised at the next main operating base at Hasimara by July-end.A squadron comprises around 18 aircraft.The Rafale jets are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The Rafale jets are capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile, Scalp cruise missile and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.The IAF is also procuring a new generation medium-range modular air-to-ground weapon system Hammer to integrate with the Rafale jets.Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) is a precision-guided missile developed by French defence major Safran.The missile was originally designed and manufactured for the French Air Force and Navy.Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.

This is not a proper remedy, you should go to a single judge,” the court observed.Bindu had on July 3 moved the Kerala High Court seeking repatriation of her daughter and granddaughter to India.Nimisha was a Hindu before embracing Islam.She changed her name to Fatima and later married an alleged Islamic State (IS) operative from Kerala and both were reported missing, along with 19 others from the southern state in June 2016 before reaching an ISIS-controlled territory in Afghanistan.Fatima gave birth there in 2016.In her plea, Bindu had said the return of her daughter and minor granddaughter “shall not pose a threat to the security and sovereignty” of the country.She had contended that once they are repatriated, Fatima can face the due process of law and her minor daughter can be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.She has also said in her plea that India has an extradition treaty with Afghanistan from 2019 and since there is a Red Corner Notice against Fatima who is also wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), she can be brought back to face the due process of law here.Besides Fatima, three other IS widows of Indian origin, are also lodged in a Kabul jail.She and three other women had surrendered to the Afghanistan government in 2019 after their husbands were killed in the fight with the forces there.

No FIR has so far been filed in this connection and the matter is being probed, he said.But the version of district Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Umesh Tripathi differs.Tripathi said he got the matter investigated through the ACMO and a team also visited the village concerned but could not meet the victim.“No fault of ASHA worker has been found in the whole sequence of events. The sister-in-law of the man had misguided her and asked her to take him for the procedure, saying he has three children,” the CMO said.The sister-in-law had also claimed that Dhruv’s wife had gone away as he was jobless, the CMO said, adding that the medical team had no need to investigate whether the man is married or not.

We are not happy with the way the party in person is arguing,” the visibly irked bench observed.“We are unable to understand your arguments. You want to become a District Judge but you do not know how to argue a case,” the bench said.As the petitioner lawyer kept arguing, the bench, which was unable to decipher the submissions, ordered the high court registry by saying, “Please produce his answer sheets along with the multiple choice question papers in sealed cover.”The main examination for the HJS is scheduled to be held in the last week of August.The apex court has now posted his plea for hearing in the second week of August.

13-07-2021||New Delhi||School closure: 1 in 3 countries not implementing programmes to mitigate learning loss, says report||One in three countries where schools were or are still closed due to the Covid pandemic have not yet implemented remedial programmes to mitigate learning loss, according to a survey.The "Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures" was conducted by UNESCO, UNICEF, World Bank and OECD.At the same time, only one-third of countries are taking steps to measure learning losses to primary and lower second levels – mostly among high-income countries, the survey report stated.According to it, fewer than a third of low-and middle-income countries reported that all students had returned to in-person schooling, which indicates heightening risk of learning loss and drop-out.However, the majority of countries reported using at least one form of outreach to encourage students to return to school. These included community engagement, school-based tracking, modification to water, sanitation and hygiene services, financial incentives and review of access policies, the report stated."Remedial instruction is vital to help those children who have missed out on school to get back on track and reduce long-term learning losses,” global director for education at the World Bank, Jaime Saavedra, said.“This requires an urgent effort to measure students' learning levels today and collect good quality data to inform classroom practices, as envisioned under the UNICEF, UNESCO, and World Bank's Learning Data Compact," Saavedra said.The survey documents how countries are monitoring and mitigating learning losses, addressing the challenge of reopening schools and deploying distance learning strategies. In total, 142 countries responded to the survey that covers the period from February to May, and spans across the pre-primary, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary levels."Remote learning has been a lifeline for many children around the world during school closures. But for the most vulnerable, even this was out of reach. It is urgent that we get every child back into the classroom now,” global chief of education at UNICEF, Robert Jenkins, said."But we cannot stop there; reopening better means implementing remedial programmes to help students get back on track, and ensuring that we prioritize girls and vulnerable children in all our efforts," he said. The survey found that around 40 per cent of countries extended their academic year, and a similar proportion of countries prioritised certain curriculum areas.However, more than half of the countries reported that no adjustments have been or will be made, it said."Many countries improved health and safety standards at examination centres, still, 28 per cent of countries cancelled examinations in lower secondary and 18 per cent of countries did so in upper secondary education,” the survey report said."Reviewing or revising access policies was uncommon, especially for girls – a cause for concern as adolescent girls are at the highest risk of not returning to school in low- and lower-middle-income countries," it said.Low-income countries are lagging in the implementation of even the most basic measures to ensure return to school, the survey found. For instance, only less than 10 per cent reported having sufficient soap, clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and masks, compared to 96 per cent of high-income countries, it said.The survey also sheds light on the deployment and effectiveness of distance learning and related support in, more than one year into the pandemic.Most countries took multiple actions to provide remote learning. Radio and TV broadcasts were more popular among low-income countries, while high-income countries provided online learning platforms, it said. However, over a third of low- and lower-middle-income countries reported that less than half of primary school students were reached, the report stated.According to UNESCO statistics, in 2020, schools worldwide were fully closed across all four education levels for 79 teaching days on an average, representing roughly 40 per cent of total instructional days averaged across OECD and G20 countries. The figures ranged from 53 days in high-income countries to 115 days in lower-middle-income countries, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/school-closure-1-in-3-countries-not-implementing-programmes-to-mitigate-learning-loss-says-report-282591

A jirga is a traditional assembly of elders to make decisions by consensus.They said that the government had constituted the jirga which amicably resolved all the issues that created an unrest between the local Muslim and Hindu communities in the area.However, the Hindus maintained that despite assurances by the government, the construction of a resting area adjacent to the temple is being unnecessarily delayed, creating unrest among the minority community.Haroon Sarab Diyal, a Religious Scholar Hinduism-Minority and Human Rights Activist of the province, said: “We are not against peace and interfaith harmony but the way adopted for withdrawal of cases is quite against the jirga culture of the soil”.He complained that the local Hindu community has not been taken into confidence except Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Member of the National Assembly and Chairman of the Pakistan Hindu Council Dr Ramesh K Vankwani.The sources said that the interior department of the province had also written an official letter to the Anti-Terrorist Court, informing them of the decision of the jirga.The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had named 350 accused in the FIR for their alleged involvement in setting on fire the Samadhi of Prem Hans and an adjacent temple in Teri Karak district last year.As many as 109 people involved in the attack were arrested while 92 police officials, including the superintendent of police and deputy superintendent of police who were on duty at the time, were suspended.The Supreme Court had taken a suo moto notice of the case and directed the provincial government to reconstruct the Samadhi and the temple.The local Hindu community members in Teri Karak district said that a house adjacent to the temple was purchased by the Hindus for the worshippers visiting the temple from far flung areas to take rest.The move gave a wrong message to the local community who feared that the Hindus wanted to live there. Therefore, a local mob first burnt the under-construction house and then attacked the adjacent temple and burnt the Samadhi.The Samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj is considered sacred by the Hindu community. It was built where he died in 1919 in Teri village of Karak.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-govt-to-withdraw-cases-against-350-accused-in-temple-burning-case-says-hindus-pardoned-them-282589

He was not accused to have absconded or tampered with evidence or threatened the witnesses, it noted, granting Sheth bail.Sheth was the director of Gili and Nakshtra brands, part of the Gitanjali Group of Companies promoted by Choksi. The group is accused of fraud of over Rs 7,080 crore.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi allegedly siphoned off a total of over Rs 13,000 crore from the PNB, a public sector bank, by fraudulently obtaining Letters of Undertaking (LoUs). An LoU is a guarantee for a person/firm for obtaining a loan from an overseas branch of an Indian bank. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pnb-scam-mehul-choksis-aide-gets-bail-282579

We don’t know if you saw it, but not a single person was wearing a mask,” the HC told Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni.“The stadium was jam-packed and nobody but one lone woman was wearing a mask. One Indian cricketer was also present and he was without a mask too,” the judges said.“When will India see such a situation? Vaccinating everyone is the key to it,” the HC said.A third wave of the pandemic has reportedly arrived in some states, it said.“There are reports saying third wave has set in in two states in the North-East. We have to take measures,” the judges said, adding that “we are in much more comfortable situation now” but there should not be any “lowering of guard from here”.They have read news reports about active cases of the delta-plus variant of coronavirus being detected in Maharashtra, and the state must act to prevent the spread of infection, the judges said.The HC will hear the PILs next after three weeks.

13-07-2021||Kolkata||8 BJP MLAs quit as House panel heads to protest Mukul Roy’s appointment as PAC chief||Eight BJP legislators on Tuesday resigned as heads of various Assembly panels in protest against MLA Mukul Roy’s appointment as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari objected to Roy’s elevation, arguing that the MLA, who had crossed over to the ruling TMC last month after winning the polls on a BJP ticket, cannot be considered a legislator of the saffron camp.As per norms, a legislator of the main opposition party is made the PAC chairperson, and Roy hasn’t quit as a BJP MLA in the House, despite switching camps.Manoj Tigga, one of the saffron camp legislators, said after resigning from a standing committee that “Roy’s appointment is undemocratic and a naked display of partisan politics. In protest, we have decided to step down...”       Led by Adhikari, the eight MLAs, including Mihir Goswami, Bhisma Prasad Sharma and Tigga, later visited Raj Bhavan to apprise Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar of the “blatant violation of democratic norms by the ruling party”.TMC deputy chief whip in the House, Tapas Roy, in response, said it was a decision of the saffron camp, and he wouldn’t want to comment on that.“Appointments for any assembly panel should be left to the discretion of the speaker, who did go by the rule in this case. It has to be kept in mind that the BJP had been plotting to topple democratically elected governments all over the country to capture power. They don’t have any right to speak on democratic values,” the Baranagar TMC MLA said.BJP MLAs had staged a walkout in the Assembly on July 9 after Roy was made the chief of PAC, which keeps a tab on government spending.“This government does not let the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) conduct audits. It just wants its own people to know where it is spending,” Adhikari had said at a press meet after the walkout.He further said that BJP had pitched economist and party MLA Ashok Lahiri as PAC chairperson, but the speaker went by TMC’s recommendation and appointed Roy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/8-bjp-mlas-quit-as-house-panel-heads-to-protest-mukul-roys-appointment-as-pac-chief-282561
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Share MHA memo on deportation of illegal Bangladeshi migrants, Delhi HC tells Centre||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to share in a sealed cover its office memorandum pertaining to the deportation of illegal migrants from Bangladesh.Justice Rekha Palli passed the order after she was informed by central government counsel Dev Prakash Bhardwaj that the document was confidential in nature.“What is so confidential? Just because you appear for the Union you have the habit of saying confidential,” the court remarked.Bhardwaj then submitted that the document could be shared with the court in a sealed cover, although he himself had not seen it.The court was hearing a petition by three people claiming to be Bangladeshi nationals who seek to be repatriated to their country.The three, one of whom is a minor, assert that it is unclear as to how they reached here and were presently residing in a night shelter.Advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, representing them, submitted that his clients may be allowed leave and the petition be disposed of.The court, however, responded, “This is not so easy. I can’t pass such a simple order.” Bhardwaj said there was a procedure to be followed in such cases and they have to first get an “exit permit” from the Embassy of Bangladesh.In its affidavit filed in response to the petition, the Home Ministry and Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), Delhi, stated that since the foreign nationals here do not possess any travel documents such as visa or any document to prove their identity, they were illegal migrants who could be repatriated to their home country only after their nationality is confirmed.The affidavit further informs that task of detection and identification of illegal migrants from Bangladesh in the national capital was assigned to Delhi Police.Explaining the procedure for deportation, the affidavit submits that after receiving such Bangladeshi nationals, their movement is restricted and once arrangement for repatriation is made, they are sent to West Bengal where they are handed over to Indian Border Security Force for their passage through the immigration borders.It is also stated that since India shares a porous border with Bangladesh, there is an influx of illegal migrants from there and the procedure adopted for their repatriation is “different and simpler” from that of illegal migrants of other nationalities.“FRRO, Delhi being the civil authority has been repatriating illegal migrants of Bangladesh as per instructions issued by Ministry of Home Affairs... The above mentioned memorandums are secret in nature and can be produced in a sealed cover whenever ordered/required..,” the affidavit reads.On an earlier occasion, Delhi Police had informed the court that the three persons in question in the petition were not found to be involved in any criminal or other case.The court allowed Mishra to file a short response to centre’s affidavit. The matter would be heard next on August 2. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/share-mha-memo-on-deportation-of-illegal-bangladeshi-migrants-delhi-hc-tells-centre-282559
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Gross violations of Covid-appropriate behaviour being seen in parts of country: Centre||The government on Tuesday expressed concern over the “gross violations” of Covid-appropriate behaviour in several parts of the country and said this can nullify the gains made so far.Addressing a press conference on the pandemic situation in the country, Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said people talk about the third wave as a “weather update” but fail to understand that adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour or the lack of it is what will prevent or cause any future waves.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul, who was also present at the press conference, said globally, a third wave of Covid-19 is being seen and called on people to make efforts to ensure that it does not happen in India.Agarwal said approximately 73.4 per cent of the new Covid-19 cases reported so far in July were from Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.He said 55 districts reported Covid case positivity rate of more than 10 per cent in the week ending July 13.Central teams have been deputed to Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Meghalaya, Odisha, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura to support them in Covid-19 management, he added.India’s Covid-19 death toll climbed to 4,10,784 on Tuesday with 2,020 new deaths recorded after Madhya Pradesh reconciled its fatality data while 31,443 new coronavirus cases pushed the infection tally to 3,09,05,819, according to Union health ministry data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gross-violations-of-covid-appropriate-behaviour-being-seen-in-parts-of-country-centre-282558
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Twitter verifies 'small number' of fake accounts, suspends later||Twitter verified some fake accounts with identical followers during its public verification programme that was relaunched recently, a data scientist has revealed.None of the verified accounts with blue badges had posted a single tweet, and two used stock images for their profile pictures.Twitter has now permanently suspended the "small number" of fake accounts it mistakenly verified, reports Daily Dot."We mistakenly approved the verification applications of a small number of inauthentic (fake) accounts," the micro-blogging platform said in a statement."We have now permanently suspended the accounts in question, and removed their verified badge, under our platform manipulation and spam policy," it added.The fake verified accounts were spotted by Twitter user Conspirador Norteno, a data scientist focused on disinformation, who highlighted six newly-created accounts that had been verified."Meet @aykacmis, @degismece, @anlamislar, @aykacti, @kayitlii, and @donmedim, a sextet of blue-check verified Twitter accounts created on June 16th, 2021. None has yet tweeted and all have roughly 1000 followers (and mostly the same followers)," he said in a tweet."Two of these six accounts (@kayitlii and @aykacti) have photographs of people as their profile pics. Despite the presence of the blue verification checkmark, neither image is likely to depict the account holder as both images appear to be stolen," he said.The six accounts had 976 suspicious followers in common, all created between June 19-June 20, and large numbers of these were using AI-generated profile pictures.Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer, tweeted that the verification could have been an inside job."You might have a malicious or bribed insider. Something similar happened at IG (paid off by spammers, in that case)," he said in a tweet.Twitter in May relaunched its new verification application process, beginning with six categories, and review public applications globally to help users earn the blue badge on the micro-blogging platform.The six categories are—government; companies, brands, and organisations; news organisations and journalists; entertainment; sports and gaming; and activists, organisers, and other influential individuals. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-verifies-small-number-of-fake-accounts-suspends-later-282550
13-07-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case transferred to NIA as it pertains to national security: Probe agency to HC||The NIA told the Bombay High Court on Tuesday that the Centre suo motu (on its own) decided to transfer the probe into the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case from Pune police to the central agency as it had implications on national security.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) also said its credibility is being questioned, while it is fighting for the prevention of unlawful and terrorist activities in the country, in which "Naxal plague" has caused destruction at many levels. It further claimed that while considerable autonomy and functional prerogatives have been accorded to state governments, greater powers and prerogatives over a complex range of all-encompassing subjects are vested with the Union government.The central agency submitted its affidavit in the HC in response to a petition filed by human rights lawyer Surendra Gadling and activist Surendra Dhawale, both arrested in the case, challenging the January 2020 decision of the Union government to transfer the probe into the case from the Pune police in Maharashtra to the NIA.The petition, filed through advocate SB Talekar in 2020, alleged that the case was transferred by the central government after the BJP lost power in Maharashtra and hence, the decision was “politically motivated”.On Tuesday, Talekar told a division bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar that the probe into the case was transferred to the NIA two years after the FIR was registered. He submitted to the court that the NIA had filed an affidavit in the case, but the Centre and the Maharashtra government were yet to file their affidavits.However, NIA's counsel Sandesh Patil said he was not aware of the affidavit filed by the probe agency. “The earlier advocate appearing for the NIA must have filed it. I will have to check. Give me a week's time to put our house in order,” Patil said. The bench then posted the petition for further hearing on July 19. The NIA in its affidavit said considering the gravity of the offence and its "inter-state link and implications on national security", the Centre suo motu directed the NIA to take up the investigation into the case.“The present petition is malafide and vexatious as it is a desperate attempt by the petitioner to thwart the investigation into the case related to the Elgar Parishad,” the affidavit said.  It further said the petitioners were questioning the credibility of the agency which is fighting towards prevention of unlawful and terrorist activities in the country, in which the “Naxal plague” has caused destruction at many levels. The affidavit said the NIA was probing the case against the petitioners and other co-accused in a “responsible and impartial manner” and it had no personal agenda against them.After the NIA took over the probe into the case, a Pune court transferred the case to the special NIA court in Mumbai, it added. The NIA in its affidavit also said the “continuous preservation and promotion of national security is the first and final sovereign function of a country". It claimed that while considerable autonomy and functional prerogatives have been accorded to state governments,  greater powers and prerogatives over a complex range of all-encompassing subjects are vested with the Union government. “A contextual construction of the provisions of the Constitution of India would show that the sovereign function of maintenance of national security is squarely vested with the Union (government),” it said. The affidavit further said the primary objective to establish the NIA was to better tackle cross-border crimes with inter-state and international originations and ramifications.  Apart from Gadling and Dhawale, several other activists – Varavara Rao, Gautam Navlakha, Sudha Bharadwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Shoma Sen - have been arrested in the case.  They are accused of being active members of the CPI (Maoist) and propagating Maoist ideology and inciting violence.   The activists have been booked under provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), apart from various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Jesuit priest Father Stan Swamy was also arrested in the case. The 84-year-old tribal rights activist died in a Mumbai hospital last week in the middle of his fight for bail on health grounds. The Elgar Parishad case is related to inflammatory speeches made at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city. The police had claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elgar-parishad-case-transferred-to-nia-as-it-pertains-to-national-security-probe-agency-to-hc-282549

Finally, an audit is carried out after which the 'BHOG' certificate is issued, the official said.With the Covid-19 pandemic running in its second year, health issues have assumed more significance with an enhanced emphasis on hygiene.The religious places in the city were reopened recently after being closed for nearly two months, but visitors are still not allowed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/temples-gurdwaras-being-encouraged-to-go-for-fssai-certification-of-prasad-langar-282545

Why are other religious places not given a specific mention? Why such a harsh tone agnst Presidents/Secretaries & Sewadars of Gurdwaras?," he tweeted."We condemn this biased attitude of Delhi Disaster Management Authority either this order should be revoked or the circular must mention all religious places," Sirsa said.The National Capital on Monday recorded 45 Covid-19 cases, the lowest single-day rise in over a year, and three deaths, while the positivity rate stood at 0.08 per cent. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-gurdwaras-in-vasant-vihar-asked-to-follow-ddma-order-to-not-allow-visitors-282544
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Finally, monsoon arrives in Delhi||A day after official forecaster India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a detailed clarification over its inaccurate forecast on the progress of Southwest Monsoon to Northwest, including Delhi, the seasonal rains finally arrived over the National Capital on Tuesday, almost 16 days behind the normal date of onset. The rains also covered the entire country, later than the normal onset date of July 8.In 2020, Monsoon had covered India by June 27, almost 12 days in advance.The weather office said: “in association with the continued prevalence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal enhanced cloud cover and scattered to fairly widespread rainfall, the Monsoon today covered the entire country”.Under the influence of these conditions, “scattered to widespread to widespread rainfall” is very likely over parts of Northwest during next three days along with “isolated heavy to very rainfall” over Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and West Uttar Pradesh. It also warned of a thunderstorm with lightning over Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh and Bihar during the next 24 hours. This may cause injuries leading to casualties to people and animals staying outdoors", it cautioned.Meanwhile, “fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls” are also very likely along the west coast, adjoining inland areas, and peninsular India during the next four days.Facing severe criticism over repeated wrong forecasts on monsoon' arrival over Delhi, the weather department yesterday called such failure by numerical models in predicting its advance “rare and uncommon”.“Such type of failure by numerical models in prediction of monsoon advance over Delhi is rare and uncommon,” it said as it explained how rains progressed till June 13 in association with favourable atmospheric circulation and a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal since onset over Kerala on June 3.By June 13, it covered most parts of the country except for Northwest India.On June 13, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models suggested favourable conditions for its further advance following which a statement was issued indicating likely advance of monsoon to Delhi by June 15, the IMD said.However, on June 14, weather analysis based on satellite and NWP model consensus indicated the approach of a trough in mid-latitude westerly winds, leading to weakening of easterly winds over northwest India. Accordingly, the IMD issued an updated statement on June 14, indicating that further advance into the remaining parts of Northwest India, including Delhi, will be slow and delayed.“However, this development of interaction with westerlies could not be anticipated by the weather prediction models,” it said.On June 16, the IMD issued another statement indicating further delay and slow progress. Since June 20, there has been no further advancing due to weak/break monsoon conditions and statements were issued on June 22, June 24, June 26, and June 30 and July 1, indicating a delay in the remaining parts of Northwest, including Delhi and weak/break monsoon conditions over the country, the IMD clarified.Then on July 5, it issued another statement, stating that monsoon will advance into remaining parts of West UP, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan and Delhi on July 10.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/finally-monsoon-arrives-in-delhi-282540
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Will demand a full discussion on fuel prices in Parliament: Chidambaram||The Congress on Tuesday slammed the government for rising fuel prices, demanding a reduction in the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG; a review and reset of import duties to ensure essential goods are cheaper and a reduction in GST rates so that goods mass-consumed by the people are cheaper.Former finance minister P Chidambaram said Congress will raise the issue in the upcoming monsoon session and demand a full discussion on it.Congress also announced a press conference scheduled across India on the issue.Noting that the issue of high inflation will not go away if the government pretends that it does not exist, Chidambaram saidthe NDA dispensation has continued to pretend that the concern about price rise is a false concern and, if the government ignores the issue, the issue will go away.“The Congress party condemns the callous negligence of the government on the issue of price rise,” said Chidambaram and Congress media chief Randeep Surjewala at a press conference here.The leaders said the fuel prices have risen not due to liquidity or rise in consumption but because of faulty policies of the government.“The government and the RBI have set an inflation target: 4 plus/minus 2 per cent. Consumer price inflation has breached the upper limit of 6 per cent and is now, according to the NSO’s press release yesterday, 6.26 per cent. Urban CPI has spurted from 5.91 per cent in May to 6.37 per cent in June. Core inflation has moved up in a month from 5.5 per cent to 5.8 per cent.Food inflation is at 5.58 per cent. Will the government please tell the people what they should eat, how they should light their homes and how they should go to work?” asked the Congress veteran.He said inflation, even in a normal time, would be intolerable.“The present is not a normal time. A pandemic is raging across the country. The pandemic has resulted in jobs being axed, unemployment rising to 8.1 per cent and incomes/wages being cut for millions of working people. In such a situation of widespread distress, inflation has broken the back of the people, and we hold the central government under Narendra Modi directly responsible for the high inflation,” said Chidambaram.He also said that road transport minister Nitin Gadkari who has articulated people’s concerns on fuel price rise should “unmute himself and speak loudly in the union cabinet.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-demand-a-full-discussion-on-fuel-prices-in-parliament-chidambaram-282537
13-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt submits medical records of late priest Stan Swamy in Bombay High Court||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday submitted to the Bombay High Court the medical records of Jesuit priest and activist Stan Swamy, the 84-year-old accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case who died in a hospital here while being in judicial custody last week awaiting a medical bail.Chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai told a bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar that the state had submitted "a compilation of Swamy’s complete medical records" since the time he was lodged in the Taloja prison as an undertrial.Swamy was arrested by the National Investigating Agency (NIA) from Ranchi in October 2020. He was interrogated at the time of his arrest by the NIA but the central agency never sought his custody.Suffering from Parkinson's disease and a host of other medical ailments, Swamy, who was then 83, was remanded to judicial custody following his arrest. He was then admitted to the Taloja prison hospital in Navi Mumbai.After informing the high court about Swamy's death on July 5 this year, senior counsel Mihir Desai, who had represented the tribal rights activist in the High Court, had told the court that Swamy's death was a result of negligence on part of the NIA and the Maharashtra prison authorities who had failed to provide him timely and adequate medical aid.Desai had also urged the High Court at the time to keep Swamy's plea for medical bail and his plea challenging the bar on grant of bail under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act pending. He had also urged the High Court to call for Swamy's medical records.On Desai's request, the high court had passed an order calling for the medical records to ascertain the veracity of the allegations made against authorities.On Tuesday, Pai submitted that the "Taloja prison authority had placed on record a 300-page-long compilation of documents, including medical reports from the time Stan Swamy was brought to Taloja Jail till his post-mortem report".Besides the state government, the private Holy Family Hospital in Mumbai, where Swamy died during treatment, also submitted the late activist's medical records and the treatment provided to him.The high court took all the documents on record.The bench also said that since Swamy died in judicial custody, a magisterial inquiry into his death, as mandated by Section 176 of the CrPC, would be conducted."Whatever inquiry or investigation by the magistrate under Section 176 (CrPC) takes place, someone will have to participate in it now," the high court told Desai.Desai said he had some submissions to make on such inquiry and he would do so on the next date of hearing.The High Court will hear Desai and all other parties on July 19.The Elgar Parishad case is related to inflammatory speeches made at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city.The police had claimed that the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.

Post training, the successful trainees can earn livelihood by servicing oxygen concentrators."We believe that this initiative will contribute significantly in our battle against the pandemic, especially in the challenging terrains and remote areas of our country," ICICI Foundation President Saurabh Singh said.The partnership with BPL Medical Technologies will help in skilling lesser privileged youth to service oxygen concentrators, he added.ICICI Foundation has been engaged in the areas of skill development, sustainable livelihoods, environment conservation, financial inclusion, healthcare and education across urban and rural India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icici-foundation-to-donate-1-800-oxygen-concentrators-to-hospitals-in-himalayan-belt-tribal-areas-282534
13-07-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh/London||What Google CEO Sundar Pichai said about ‘jealousy’ with Jeff Bezos, the last time he cried and more||Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who was born in Tamil Nadu and grew up in Chennai, has said India is deeply rooted in him and a big part of who he is.In an in-depth interview with the BBC at the Google headquarters at Silicon Valley in California, the tech boss covered a wide range of topics, including the threat to free and open internet and also narrowed down two developments that he feels will further revolutionise the world over the next quarter of a century as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.During the conversation, Amol Rajan, the interviewer asked Pichai, when was the time he last cried.Pichai’s answer was: “Seeing the morgue trucks parked around the world during Covid. And seeing what’s happened in India over the past month." India in the month of mid-April to May witnessed a deadly second wave that left thousands dead and photos of dead bodies washing up in the Ganga river, and being burnt around the clock surfaced on the Internet."I'm an American citizen, but India is deeply within me. So it's a big part of who I am,” Pichai, 49, said, when asked about his roots.“I view it [artificial intelligence] as the most profound technology that humanity will ever develop and work on. You know, if you think about fire or electricity or the internet, it's like that. But I think even more profound," said Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet.When asked about whether the Chinese model of the internet based on surveillance is in the ascendant, Pichai said the free and open internet "is being attacked".While he didn't refer to China directly, he said: "None of our major products and services are available in China."On the controversial issue of tax, he said: “We are one of the world's largest taxpayers, if you look at on an average over the last decade, we have paid over 20 per cent in taxes.“We do pay the majority of our share of taxes in the US, where we originate and where our products are developed. I think there are good conversations, and we support the global OECD conversations figuring out what is the right way to allocate taxes, this is beyond a single company to solve,” he said.He was also asked about his own personal tech habits and encouraged everyone to adopt “two-factor authentication” when it comes to passwords to ensure multiple protections, and admitted he is constantly changing his phone to test out new technology.Apart from this, the Google CEO is also a bit jealous about Jeff Bezos’ space travel plans. Pichai told the BBC that he too would want to “see Earth from Space” and that he is a bit jealous. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-said-about-jealousy-with-jeff-bezos-the-last-time-he-cried-and-more-282526

13-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi High Court directs activist Gokhale to remove tweets against ex-diplomat Lakshmi Puri||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed activist Saket Gokhale to immediately delete alleged defamatory tweets against Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri and restrained him from posting “scandalous” tweets against her and her husband, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.In an interim order, Justice C Hari Shankar said if Gokhale failed to comply with the directions within 24 hours of the order, Twitter would take down the tweets.The court asked Puri, a former Assistant Secretary-General at the United Nations, also to implead Twitter as a party to the proceedings.Gokhale, in his tweets On June 13 and 26, made reference to certain property purchased by Puri in Switzerland and also referred to her husband.The court passed the order on a defamation suit filed by Lakshmi Puri seeking Rs 5 crore damages from Gokhale and a direction that he delete the tweets.In her suit, filed through Karanjawala and Company, she alleged that in the tweets, Gokhale had made false and factually incorrect, per-se defamatory, slanderous and libelous statements/imputations against her and her family.The court, while pronouncing the order, said: “The defendant (Gokhale) is directed to immediately delete from his Twitter account all tweets against the plaintiff (Puri) which the present plaint makes reference, as well as all connected tweets, which form part of the trail of tweets by the defendant against the plaintiff.“The defendant is restrained, pending further orders of this court, from posting any defamatory, scandalous, or factually incorrect tweets on his Twitter account against the plaintiff or her husband.”The court also issued summons to Gokhale on the main suit and directed him to file his written statement within four weeks and listed the case before the Joint Registrar on September 10.It said the observations made in the order are prima facie and made to decide the application for the interim relief.The high court on July 8 had questioned Gokhale for putting out alleged defamatory tweets against Puri, without verifying the facts from her or having approached any government authority.Observing that right to reputation is recognised as a fundamental right, it had asked Gokhale, also a freelance journalist, as to how he could vilify people, particularly when the tweets put out by him were prima facie incorrect.“So according to your understanding of the law, any Tom, Dick and Harry can write anything against anyone on Internet irrespective of the fact that it destroys and damages the reputation of a person,” the judge had remarked.The court had asked him as to what exercise he had carried out with public authorities before putting out the tweets on social media.During the arguments, senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing Puri, had contended that the tweets were defamatory, malicious and based on false information and that Gokhale was nobody to put questions to her.He had said Puri does not hold any public office for these details to be put in public domain and if he was putting her name in public, he should have the minimum civility to ask her before he publishes this which was deliberately ignored.Advocate Sarim Naved, representing Gokhale, had said as a citizen, he has the right to go into the assets of public functionaries.He had also said that Puri's husband is a Union minister and that assets of such persons, along with those of spouses, should be in public domain, but in this case, the money received from their daughter is not in public domain.

13-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||Lightning is killing more people in India than cyclones; 331 per cent rise in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 13With the shift in climate, meteorologists are warning of more lightning casualties in years to come. The trend is expected to increase with the rise in global temperature, they warned.According to the Earth Networks India Lightning Report of 2019, every year about 2,000 persons die due to lightning strikes, which is more than floods and cyclones. As per the IMD’s Annual Lightning Report 2020-2021, there has been a 34 per cent rise in lightning strikes in the country.“There has been a 34 per cent rise in lightning strikes in the country. It has advanced from 1,38, 00,000 strikes in 2019-2020 to 1,85,44,367 strikes in 2020-2021, an increase of 46,83,989 strikes.”“There are states with a very high rise in lightning strikes up to 331 per cent rise in Punjab. Bihar 168 per cent per cent Haryana 164 per cent Puducherry 117 per cent, Himachal Pradesh 105 per cent, and West Bengal 100 per cent are leading states. States like Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha need to take cognisance of it,” the IMD report adds.Now, the reason why India has such a huge lightning problem, according to the Earth Networks report, is because it is “located in a prime place for lightning”. “India’s geography near the equator and the Indian Ocean provide it with a lot of heat and moisture that generate thunderstorms. Lack of weather safety awareness and lightning warning tools that allow people to respond in time, especially those working outdoors,” it says.Meanwhile, Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather who suggests a “direct correlation between lightning cases and climate change,” adds: “Global warming has added more moisture to land, which in turn is the cause for lightning and thunderstorms. Because of climate change, extreme weather events are rising. Normally lighting and thundershowers occur in pre-monsoon months. Lightening’ strikes in this part of the year are rare”.With the monsoon trough shifting towards Central India, this year the monsoon has been delayed way past the accepted range in the plains of the Northwest. In 2002, the monsoon was delayed till July 19 while 2021 is expected to record the second-most delayed seasonal rains, till date, says Palawat.   Meanwhile, another reason for more deadly strikes appear to be a lack of tree cover.The majority of lightning deaths occur while standing under a tree. However, when there is dense tree cover, lightning strikes the tree and dissipates in the ground. If the number of trees is less, people are more exposed, say experts.Apparently, lightning also interferes with the electromagnetic field of mobile phones, which is also said to be another reason for more lightning deaths. Incidentally during pre-monsoon, fatalities are more as farmers are working in the agricultural fields. In the later parts, they are mostly those standing under tall trees or inside their huts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lightning-is-killing-more-people-in-india-than-cyclones-331-per-cent-rise-in-punjab-282478

13-07-2021||---||Pictures: Monsoon lands in Delhi 16 days behind schedule, brings rain; power supply snapped in Gurugram||New Delhi, July 13The Southwest Monsoon finally reached the capital Tuesday, 16 days behind the usual date of onset, making it the most-delayed in 19 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).             In 2002, monsoon had covered Delhi on July 19.Heavy rain also lashed Gurugram, where power supply was snapped across the city."The monsoon has arrived in Delhi," senior IMD scientist K Jenamani confirmed after a spell of rains drenched parts of South Delhi Tuesday morning.Normally, monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27. It covers the entire country by July 8. Last year, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 25 and covered the entire country by June 29.The weather department had a tough time forecasting the advancement of monsoon over Delhi this year.After several wayward forecasts, the IMD acknowledged Monday that "such type of failure by numerical models in the prediction of monsoon over the capital is rare and uncommon".The IMD had earlier said monsoon would hit Delhi on June 15, which would have been 12 days early, but the wind system entered a "break" phase.In early June, the Met office said the conditions will become favourable for the monsoon to advance to Delhi and other parts of northwest India by July 7.Later, it said Delhi will get its first monsoon rains around July 10.The weather department revised the forecast yet again on Saturday, saying the monsoon may reach the capital in the next 24 hours. But the wind system kept the city waiting on Sunday and there was hardly any rainfall on Monday too.As monsoon played truant in the region, Central Delhi is now the most rain-deficient district in the country, receiving only 8.5 mm rainfall against the normal of 132 mm since June 1, when the monsoon season starts. It has recorded a shortfall of 94 per cent.Overall, Delhi has so far received 67 per cent less rainfall than normal, putting it in the category of "large deficient" states.The IMD said it is continuously monitoring the further progress of monsoon into the remaining parts of the country.Heavy rains led to waterlogging on several road stretches, including near the AIIMS flyover in south Delhi.Public Works Department (PWD) officials said that only minor waterlogging complaints have been reported so far and efforts are being taken to remove water from such stretches.Some of the stretches where waterlogging was seen include underneath the AIIMS flyover, Sangam Vihar, Kirari among others. with PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pictures-monsoon-lands-in-delhi-16-days-behind-schedule-brings-rain-power-supply-snapped-in-gurugram-282471

It overturned Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House, second time in five months.Previous stintsBut the basis for the Supreme Court’s calculation was undercut by conciliation between Oli and his party rival Madhav Kumar Nepal, who had walked away with 25 parliamentarians to support Deuba.Oli had defended house dissolutionNepal has now made amends with Oli, which means Deuba of the Nepali Congress has the support of Nepali Maoists and a faction of the Madhesis which may now be inadequate.India bags hydel contractOn a parallel track, the Oli government conceded India’s demand and awarded it the Lower Arun hydel project despite competition from Chinese companies. India had put its foot down and actively pushed for the project since it is at the tail race of 900 MW Arun-3 hydel project which has already been bagged by an Indian company.India had argued that a “basin development approach” would result in the optimisation of resources and faster completion of project at lower cost.The MoU was signed on Sunday in the presence of Deputy PM of Nepal Bishnu Prasad Paudel and Indian Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra at Kathmandu and made public a day later. “It is learnt that other companies of neighboring countries were also interested in the project, but Nepal chose our central public sector undertaking based on its performance in Arun-3,’’ said RK Singh, Union Minister.As per the agreement, the developer will have to present a detailed project report within the next two years to the Nepalese authorities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oli-out-nepal-apex-court-asks-president-to-appoint-deuba-282186
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Jaishankar to push for conciliation in Afghanistan||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will be consulting almost all important players in the near neighbourhood, including China, Russia and Iran, this week amid signs that none of the three powers favour the Taliban’s winner-take-all approach for Kabul.Jaishankar will be closeted with Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Ministers on July 13 and 14 in Tajikistan, and may attend another back-to-back meet on connectivity in the neighbouring Uzbekistan.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will also be in the region, first visiting Turkmenistan, which also shares a border with Afghanistan, before joining Jaishankar in Tajikistan and, possibly, Uzbekistan. Other foreign ministers will be Shah Mehmood Qureshi (Pakistan), Haneef Atmar (Afghanistan), Javad Zarif (Iran), Sergei Lavrov (Russia) and their counterparts from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.SCO council meetingExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will be closeted with Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) ministers on July 13 and 14 in Tajikistan, and may attend another back-to-back meet on connectivity in the neighbouring Uzbekistan.Though China had maintained ties with the Taliban during the 90s, sources point to its Foreign Ministry’s statement on the eve of Wang’s departure that speaks of the “fight against three evil forces, namely, terrorist, separatist and extremist forces”.The worry among Chinese, Russian and Iranian is that a complete takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban could mean Afghanistan becoming an “emirate”, ruled by a single person holding both temporal and political powers. The Taliban is hedging on this issue and recently said the declaration of an “emirate” will be discussed during the peace talks.Afghanistan was declared an “emirate” during the previous Taliban rule (1996-2001), and amir al-mu’minin (commander of the faithful) Mullah Omar reportedly donned the cloak of Prophet Muhammad, symbolising himself as the successor. These pretensions inhibited him from handing over Osama bin Laden and allowed Kashmiri militants to get trained in Khost, said the sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-to-push-for-conciliation-in-afghanistan-282190

13-07-2021||New Delhi||Parliament digitises 4.2mn pages of history||The Parliament of India has digitized a whopping 4.2 million pages of historical records dating back to 1854 in a move that will expand the understanding of legislative and parliamentary evolution.The archives not only contain proceedings after the first Lok Sabha was constituted in 1952, they also feature debates between 1854 and 1952 to show how legislative reforms developed overtime.House evolutionThe treasure trove contains historical debates that explain the evolution of Parliament and of many legislations.The 99-year period is captured in a range of documented proceedings including The Indian legislative Council Debates which feature proceedings of the Legislative Council from 1854 to 1920. There are complete records leading to the passage of The Government of India Act of 1919, which gave effect to the Montague Chelmsford Reforms and established a bicameral Legislature at the Centre.“The Indian Legislature consisted of the Governor-General and the two Houses at that time - the Council of State and the Legislative Assembly. The debates of various sessions of the Council of State held from 1921 to 1946 and six Legislative Assemblies from 1921 to 1947 are included in the digital library. All the documents have been digitized including from the period before the first War of Independence in 1857 when the East India Company ran the affairs of the country based on charters from the Queen and also post 1857,” LS secretary general Utpal Kumar Singh said.The treasure trove covers the period that saw the replacement of the above two houses with the Constituent Assembly of India. The proceedings of the Constituent Assembly’s six sessions from 17 November 1947 to 24 December 1949 have been included. The Constituent Assembly later became the Provisional Parliament and exercised the powers of the two Houses of Parliament until the First General Elections were held in 1952 and the Lok Sabha was constituted.The digitized space consists of the Provisional Parliament Debates from 28 January 1950 to 5 March 1952, covering 276 days and shows how modern Indian democratic institutions took shape. The digital records allow an insight into the evolution of major legislations including the law offence of sedition.The November 25, 1870 debate on the subject of sedition contained under the head --The Proceedings of the Governor General of India Laws -- justifies the law as follows, “By some means …the Indian Penal Code contained no section by which you could punish conspiracies to wage war against the Queen or deprive her of the sovereignty of British India, unless the conspiracy proceeded so far as to be followed by open or actual preparations for rebellion. Besides this, the Code contained no provision with respect to exciting disaffection by speaking or writing, and that was a great defect and one which ought not to be permitted to exist in any rational system of criminal law whatsoever."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-digitises-4-2mn-pages-of-history-282196

With the global evidence available and the history of pandemics, the third wave is inevitable. It is the responsibility of every citizen to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour for at least three more months and get vaccinated,” IMA president JA Jayalal said.The IMA’s appeal came on a day when WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was worried about the Delta variant’s emergence which was leading to increased hospitalisations in several countries.The WHO said it did not recommend vaccination as a basis for permission to travel across the world, adding that its International Health Regulations Committee would meet on Wednesday to take a policy call on this matter.“In 10 days, we are coming out with guidelines on digital certificates which can be interoperable between nations,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/third-covid-wave-imminent-tourism-can-wait-ima-282176
13-07-2021||Hyderabad||Covid third wave might have set in on July 4, says Hyderabad scientist||A senior physicist, who was pro-vice chancellor of University of Hyderabad and has thoroughly analysed the Covid-19 pattern in India, said on Monday that the third wave appeared to have set in on July 4.Dr Vipin Srivastava, who has developed a method to observe the pattern of the number of cases and deaths for the past 463 days, said July 4 appears to be similar to what it was during the first week of February this year when the second wave was said to have set in.According to his analysis, whenever there is a crossover from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend in daily deaths or vice versa, the Daily Death Load (DDL) fluctuates ‘wildly’.“We had such wild fluctuations in DDL, starting at the end of the first week of February though the daily deaths were on the order of 100 or even less and we were rejoicing that the pandemic was over! But what was in store was so devastating.A similar behaviour is beginning to show since July 4,” he told PTI.With 37,154 new coronavirus infections, India’s total tally of COVID-19 cases rose to 3,08,74,376, while the total recoveries crossed three crore, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.The toll climbed to 4,08,764 with 724 fresh fatalities.The ministry stressed that more than 70 per cent of the deaths were due to comorbidities.“Let us hope and pray that DDL stays negative,” Dr Srivastava said.He said the bottom line was that having suffered a devastating second wave, people and administrations need to be extremely cautious and that any suspicion of the onset of a new wave should be treated with utmost care.He however, said even a large negative DDL is not good because that indicates that the number of new cases added in 24 hours is catching up with the number of patients recovering during the same period.Positive values of DDL are always “undesirable” as they are associated with the increasing number of deaths in 24 hour periods, the physicist said.

13-07-2021||New Delhi||Third Covid wave inevitable; pilgrimage, tourism can wait: IMA||The IMA expressed concern on Monday over governments and people being complacent and engaging in mass gatherings without following Covid-19 protocols, saying these events are potential super spreaders for a third wave of the pandemic.Stressing that tourist bonanza, pilgrimage travel, religious fervour are needed, but can wait for a few more months, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), in a statement, said global evidence and the history of any pandemic suggest that “the third wave is inevitable and imminent”.Read also“However, it is painful to note that in this crucial time, when everyone needs to work for the mitigation of the third wave, in many parts of the country, both governments and the public are complacent and engaged in mass gatherings without following Covid protocols. Tourist bonanza, pilgrimage travel, religious fervour, all are needed, but can wait for a few more months.“Opening up these rituals and enabling people without vaccination to go scot-free in these mass gatherings are potential super spreaders for the Covid third wave,” the IMA said.The statement by the doctors’ comes on a day when the annual Rath Yatra began in Puri and amid talks of allowing the “Kanwar Yatra” in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.The IMA appealed to all the states to control mass gatherings.Based on the experience of the last one-and-a-half years of the war with the virus and the emerging evidence, it is obvious that by making the universal vaccination drive reach the maximum number of people and strictly following Covid-appropriate behaviour, people can face the third wave with confidence and mitigate its impact, the doctors’ body said.“The consequences of treating a patient with Covid in a hospital and its impacts on the economy will be much better than the economic loss we suffer by avoiding such mass gatherings. It is the duty and responsibility of everyone at this moment to strictly enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour for minimum three more months and ensure that everyone near our houses is getting vaccinated,” the statement said.
