11-07-2021||New Delhi||74 per cent people in Trai’s DND list still getting pesky messages: Survey||Around 74 per cent of the people registered in the regulator Trai’s ‘Do Not Disturb’ list still get unwanted SMS, according to a survey report released by LocalCircles on Sunday.The ‘Do Not Disturb’ list is meant for protecting subscribers from pesky communications.The survey, which collected over 35,000 responses from citizens located in 324 districts of the country, found out that 73 per cent of citizens are getting four or more unwanted SMS on a daily basis.The survey follows recent measures proposed by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for stricter penalty norms on pesky callers.The DoT has created two special wings — the Digital Intelligence Unit (DIU) and the Telecom Analytics for Fraud Management and Consumer Protection (TAFCOP) — to coordinate with law enforcement agencies, financial institutions and other government agencies in cases involving frauds, using telecom resources or services.Regulations regarding pesky calls are managed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). It has provision to penalise pesky callers in the range of Rs 1,000 to Rs 10,000 per violation.“Despite being registered on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) ‘Do Not Disturb’ list, 74 per cent of citizens at the time said they still get unwanted SMS,” the survey said.In the same survey, 26 per cent of citizens said at least a quarter of the unwanted SMS comes from mobile service providers; while banking, insurance, real estate, local services and earning money offers were the primary drivers for spam SMS.The DoT has proposed to make the norms more stringent by reducing the slabs for levying penalty to Rs 1,000 per violation for 0-10 breaches; Rs 5,000 each for 10-50 violations; and Rs 10,000 each for more than 50 violations.Currently, the slabs under the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, are 0-100, 100-1,000 and more than 1,000 violations.The DoT arms have proposed blocking IMEI of devices from which the pesky SMS are sent and also blacklisting of IDs of telemarketers who continue to violate the rules.

11-07-2021||---||BSP has lost its identity, Azad Samaj Party alternative in UP: Chandra Shekhar Aazad||New Delhi, July 11Accusing the Bahujan Samaj Party of going soft on the Centre for the fear of central probe agencies, Azad Samaj Party chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad on Sunday pitched his new political outfit as an alternative to the Mayawati-led party which he said was losing its identity by working against the principles of its founder Kanshi Ram.The Bhim Army chief, whose political outfit Azad Samaj Party, launched last year, is seeking to establish itself as a defender of the rights of Dalits, other backward classes and minorities, said a “grand alliance” is the need of the hour for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls next year and all those who are serious about stopping the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from coming back to power must join hands.In an interview with PTI, Aazad said he has no qualms in aligning with anybody, including the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), provided the objective is to forge a strong alliance to defeat the Yogi Adityanath government which he alleged was running a “dictatorial” administration.“We are in talks with all (opposition) parties. When any problem confronts the state and the country all parties discuss matters. In our party, the core committee is the supreme body and it will take a call on alliances,” the Azad Samaj Party chief said, adding his party has not formalised any tie-ups as of now for the assembly polls.“Our efforts are directed at forging a grand alliance to take on the BJP for the sake of the people. This misrule must come to an end. So a grand alliance should be formed to stop the BJP,” the 34-year-old leader stressed.Calling for a common minimum programme, he batted for having a coalition government in UP, saying when parties get a hold over power alone then dictatorial situations arise “as it is happening now”.Asked about the barbs directed at him by BSP chief Mayawati, he said, “I am not scared of criticism and allegations.To a pointed query on whether he was open to an alliance with the BSP for the assembly polls, he said he was open to an alliance with all “anti-BJP” parties.However, Aazad was also scathing in his criticism of the Mayawati-led party, but added that his differences with it were ideological, not personal.“The BSP has lost its identity and it is because of its own actions, not due to anyone else. Look at 2012 (UP assembly polls), 2014 (Lok Sabha polls), 2017 (state polls) and 2019 (LS polls), they are in decline,” Aazad, also known as ‘Raavan’, said.“Look at other states, now they (BSP) are getting less than 1 per cent votes, be it in Kerala, Assam, West Bengal. The BSP is in decline because its leaders don’t want to work on the ground level and only go to the people during elections and the people are understanding this,” he claimed. Azad alleged that the BSP was ignoring its founder the late Kanshi Ram’s ideals and was working against those principles.The BSP became a national party in 12 years on the basis of those principles but that status is also in danger now, he said. Pointing to the BSP’s “decline”, he said the Azad Samaj Party was not there in 2012, 2014, 2017 and 2019 polls, and the BSP was itself to blame for it.“We have given an alternative to the people and showed our mettle with our work on the ground. We pledge to be with people before and after elections,” the Azad Samaj Party chief said.He also accused the BSP of going soft on the Centre on various issues for the fear of central probe agencies.“When you have cases of CBI and ED, you are caught in the stranglehold of the Centre and cannot put forward your views strongly,” Aazad said.“There are several such cases (on Mayawati) and her brother,” he alleged, while asserting his party was playing the role of a responsible opposition despite being just over a year old.About the Congress as a potential ally in UP, Aazad said there was no rift with the party but his outfit was raising its voice wherever deprived were wronged and did so recently in Congress-ruled Rajasthan.“I don’t have a personal problem (with the Congress). All those who believe that the BJP must be stopped and that it has harmed the state, must come together,” he said.In the run up to the UP assembly polls next year, Aazad is leading a ‘Bahujan Cycle Yatra’ with the slogan ‘Jaati Chorho Samaj Jodo’ from July 1-21 to “counter the communal atmosphere in the country and for uniting people”.“The BJP works on the policy of divide and rule.  We work on the politics of brotherhood and equality. Caste divisions create animosity between the people and because of this the country has lagged behind in development,” he said.The message of the rally is to break caste barriers and establish brotherhood, Aazad said.He accused the UP government of undermining reservation in appointments and carrying out “recruitment scams”. He also alleged that there was a major issue of inflation and the declining law-and-order situation in the state.Aazad also hit out at the Yogi government over violence during filing of nominations in block pramukh polls, alleging democracy was being “abducted” in the state.“In the next few weeks, many people from the BJP, BSP, SP, Congress and other parties will join us. We will fight the 2022 polls with full might,” he said.The Azad Samaj Party stood third in the Bulandshahr bypolls, ahead of the SP-RLD alliance and the Congress, and did well in the Zila panchayat elections, particularly in western UP, he said.Aazad launched his political outfit the Azad Samaj Party last year on March 15—the birth anniversary of Kanshi Ram. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bsp-has-lost-its-identity-azad-samaj-party-alternative-in-up-chandra-shekhar-aazad-281648

11-07-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP to bring about sweeping organisational changes to crack whip on dissidents||Smarting under the assembly election defeat, the West Bengal BJP is likely to bring about a sweeping organisational reshuffle to crack the whip on recalcitrant leaders and a section of turncoats who joined the saffron party ahead of the polls.The state BJP is also mulling to put up a “screening window” while inducting leaders from other parties, and taking a “Bengal-specific political line” in tandem with its pan-India policy to take on the TMC’s sub-nationalism, party sources said.The BJP has decided to revamp the organisation by rewarding efficient party workers and leaders and remove several turncoats from local and district levels. It has also decided to rein in dissidence with a two-pronged approach.The proposed measures come in the backdrop of poll reverses, growing infighting and reverse exodus, the latest being the switchover of BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy to the ruling party in the state.After its defeat in the assembly polls in May, the state BJP has been a divided house with constant bickering among senior leaders who are blaming each other for the failure, the party sources said.“Discussions are underway for certain changes at various levels of the organisation. There have been some issues. It would have been better if such things could have been avoided,” state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh told PTI.Asked whether the BJP will take action against dissidents and TMC turncoats who are openly speaking against the saffron party, Ghosh said: “No one is above party discipline”.“There are some people who had joined the party in the hope of getting something if the BJP came to power. But now, as we have failed, they are speaking in a different tone. All of us have to follow the rules and discipline of the party,” he said.There is a growing resentment among rank and file as no action has been taken against TMC turncoats like Rajib Banerjee and Saumitra Khan who have been openly speaking against the BJP leadership since the poll debacle, party sources said.The situation worsened after the state leadership took action against some district leaders but did not touch the state-level turncoats who were openly defying the party.“There has been a lot of pressure from workers to take action against the errant leaders as this is not how a disciplined party like the BJP works. We have already zeroed in on dissidents and prepared a list, and action will be taken as soon as we get the central leadership’s nod,” a senior BJP leader, who is privy to the development, said.The party has decided to take a two-pronged approach to rein in dissidence—ignore statements of some errant leaders so that they become quiet, and issue show-cause notices to the more vocal ones, with the eventual aim to make them quit the party.“We don’t want people who are not keen on staying with us,” he said.Several other turncoats like Sonali Guha, Sarala Murmu, Dipendu Biswas and Bacchu Hansda have expressed their desire to return to the TMC.Learning from assembly poll “mistakes”, the party has decided to establish a “screening team” whose approval would be mandatory for anyone willing to join the party.“We have made a big mistake by admitting anyone and everyone from the TMC. As a result of this, we could not benefit from anti-incumbency in many areas, whereas in other places, party units got filled with turncoats thus alienating our tried-and-tested workers and leaders,” another senior state BJP leader said.He pointed out that in the 149 seats where the BJP fielded newcomers who had joined from other parties, the strike rate was just nine, whereas old-timers were fielded in 68 of 77 seats it won.“This figure shows that the strategy to take leaders from other parties was a complete flop,” he said.The state unit has also decided to adopt a “Bengal- specific political line” after approval from the central leadership to counter the TMC’s narrative that the “BJP is a party of outsiders”.“One of the main reasons behind our defeat in the polls was that we couldn’t strike a chord with the masses as we were branded as outsiders.”“Being a national party, we can’t have an approach like a regional party but we will have a Bengal-specific political line in tandem with our party’s national policy to take on TMC in the state,” he said.Although the BJP improved its tally from three to 77 in the state assembly, it miserably failed to achieve its much-hyped target of 200 plus seats, as the TMC stormed to power for the third consecutive term by winning 213 seats in the 294-member assembly.The ruling TMC, while reacting to the changes the saffron camp is planning, said the party would fall like a pack of cards as it went for an “inorganic growth by inducting leaders from other parties”.“The BJP’s end in West Bengal has already begun. It will fall like a pack of cards. They wanted to build a castle on the sand by allowing inorganic growth. Now they are facing the music as the party doesn’t have any base in the state,” senior TMC leader Sougata Roy said.Political scientist Suman Bhattacharya feels that the BJP won’t be able to arrest its slide as it has “lost the plot”.“Not just TMC turncoats, even veteran BJP leaders like Ganga Prasad Sharma are joining the ruling party in the state as the saffron party has lost the plot and narrative in West Bengal,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-bjp-to-bring-about-sweeping-organisational-changes-to-crack-whip-on-dissidents-281627

11-07-2021||New Delhi||IIT Delhi alumnus scales Mt Everest within seven weeks of recovering from Covid-19||Neeraj Chaudhary tested positive for Covid-19 on the day he was to start from Kathmandu for the Mount Everest but that did not deter the IIT Delhi alumnus who returned to the base camp within weeks of his recovery and ultimately managed to hoist the institution’s flag, besides the tricolour, atop the summit.While the country was reeling under the aggressive second wave of Covid-19, Chaudhary’s family members in Rajasthan were hooked to their phones waiting for an update about his wellbeing.Chaudhary, 37, did his MTech in Environmental Sciences and Management at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi during 2009-11 and he is currently working with the Rajasthan government’s Water Resources Department.He took to mountaineering in 2014, and in 2020 got selected as a member of Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF) Everest Expedition under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. However, the expedition was postponed due to the outbreak of coronavirus.This year, amid the uncertainty posed by the pandemic, he reached Kathmandu with the team to begin the expedition.“But I hit a roadblock when I tested positive for Covid and had to return to Jaipur. I was feeling fatigued since a few days but I had no other symptoms,” Chaudhury told PTI.“In that moment as well, I wasn’t really thinking of Covid. All I could think of was how much effort I had put in and the preparations I had done to reach there and that was my chance to complete it. I think that motivation of not having a second chance anytime soon helped me push my body harder and there I was,” he added.He tested positive on March 27 and was back in Kathmandu in April itself. He managed to scale the peak on May 31.Chaudhary recalls that once he was back in Kathmandu, after recovering from the infection, the news updates from India about the Covid situation worried him, while his family was on tenterhooks due to updates of cyclones in subsequent weeks.“It wasn’t easy mentally, and mountaineering is not just a physical effort. When I reached there, then also it took me three attempts within 36 hours to ultimately reach the top but once there, it was the best feeling. I managed to scale the peak on May 31,” he said.Crediting IIT Delhi for shaping his career and the alumni association for helping him start a fundraiser of Rs 24 lakh for the expedition, Chaudhary took the IIT flag with him.A flag in ceremony was held at IIT Delhi on Friday to mark the achievement.“It’s a matter of great pride that an alumnus of IIT Delhi Neeraj Choudhary, MTech, (Shivalik hostel) successfully scaled Mt Everest summit (8848.86m AMSL) on May 31. Neeraj carried the IIT Delhi flag with him and hoisted it on Mount Everest.“He started the summit push directly from Camp-II (6400m AMSL) on May 30 and after the summit on 31st, returned directly to Camp-II in a continuous effort of almost 36 hours,” IIT Delhi Director V Ramgopal Rao said.

11-07-2021||New Delhi||IMD's faulty monsoon forecast for North India: Wrong signals by models, difficulty in predicting wind patterns||Wrong signals by models, difficulty in predicting the outcomes of the interactions between the easterly and westerly winds were some of the major reasons behind the India Meteorological Department's monsoon forecast for parts of north India going haywire, experts pointed out as any relief from the oppressive heat eludes the region.The Southwest Monsoon has reached almost all parts of the country but has stayed away from parts of north India. It is yet to reach Delhi, Haryana, parts of west Uttar Pradesh and west Rajasthan. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted that monsoon is expected to cover these parts by June -- a little less than a month back, but its predictions are yet to come true. In its forecast on June 13, the IMD had predicted that the Southwest Monsoon will reach Delhi by June 15. However, a day later it said conditions are not favourable for its further advancement in this region.Then began a long 'break-spell' during which the Southwest Monsoon was weak over several parts of the country.On July 1, the IMD said conditions could be favourable for further advancement of the monsoon by July 7. The moist easterly winds in the lower level from the Bay of Bengal are likely to establish gradually over parts of eastern India from July 8, it had said. On July 5, the IMD again said the monsoon is likely to spread into northwest India covering Punjab and north Haryana by July 10. However, there were no signs of any relief even on July 10. On forecasting the onset of Southwest Monsoon over Kerala, the IMD said it would hit the southern state by May 31. Till May 30, the IMD, in its daily bulletin, said the onset of the monsoon over Kerala was expected to be around May 31. However, by the afternoon of that day, it revised it saying the onset is expected to be by June 3.“We could have told (the delayed onset) in the morning itself. However, we are monitoring all the defined parameters/ criteria for the onset of monsoon over Kerala. At present the criteria are not fully satisfied,” IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra had said on May 30.Mohapatra said the country's forecasting agency did issue a forecast that the monsoon will cover parts of north India including Delhi by June 15 as indicated by the models.“But we changed it the next day (June 14) when we realised that conditions are not favourable for its advancement.”  He said the forecast models did not show consistency in the interactions of the easterlies and the westerlies -- the two dominant wind patterns.Mohapatra added that the accuracy of the models is reasonably good when it comes to forecasts for up to two weeks but not as good for forecasts for four weeks. M Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, who has spent over 35 years studying the Southwest Monsoon, said the forecast models gave wrong signals. “The models have picked up very well some of the broader events like a break in the monsoon and its revival a week ago. But when it comes to local forecasts like its advancement over Kerala or rain over parts of north, there is an issue,” Rajeevan said.“With regards to the forecast of advancement of monsoon over parts of north India, including Delhi, it was too early. The IMD should not have issued the forecast. They could have waited for some more time,” he said. The IMD is an institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.  Tracking the interactions of the westerlies and the easterlies is the most difficult part of monsoon forecast, Mohapatra's predecessor K J Ramesh said.In a normal scenario, the Southwest Monsoon covers West Bengal and many parts of central India by June 15, just 14 days after it makes an onset over Kerala, making the official commencement of the four-month rainfall season over the country. It, however, takes nearly three weeks to cover parts of north India, Ramesh said. This is also because of the interactions of easterlies and westerlies. Between the westerlies and the easterlies, the former is a “big brother”, he said. The easterlies only gain strength when there is a low-pressure area that can help them advance further. This usually creates a “sea-saw” like situation. This is also one of the reasons when north India sees a break in the monsoon, he explained.“They (the IMD) must have seen some strength of monsoon capable of moving westwards (towards) north India which is why they issued the forecast (of monsoon covering the remaining parts of north India, including Delhi). The anticipation of the see-saw effect, the judgement, did not come true,” Ramesh said. Ajit Tyagi, former IMD Director-General, said the forecasting agency had predicted that in the first surge the Southwest Monsoon could cover the country by June 15-16. But then it weakened and there were clear signs that it would not revive before July 10. That was indicated. If one looks at the Medium Range Forecast of 10-15 days, it was right, Taygi said.“Initial forecasts were not realised but the IMD did make course corrections,” he added.

11-07-2021||Mumbai||Late Harappan-era artefacts found at virgin site in Jalgaon||A Maharashtra archaeologist may have hit a jackpot by discovering several potteries and artefacts, dating back to the later era of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), at Yawal in Jalgaon district.The finds are mainly big and small pieces of pottery and vessels, depicting Harappan-style pictographic scripts that excited the discovery team led by Bhujang R. Bobade, Director, Heritage Foundation."We found the pottery pieces in the white mounds near the entrance of the Nimbalkar Fortress, around 20 km from Bhusaval... It's a virgin territory, hitherto unexplored by any archaeologist," an enthusiastic Bobade told IANS from the site.Scores of pottery pieces, which was the major industry during the IVC with its unique potteries like glazed, incised, perforated or knobbed, have been found in barely 500 sq ft area after the first dig at Yawal.Bobade said that while most potteries of that era were plain, the others were uniquely painted with scales, chequers, images of trees, birds, animals or fish, mostly with plain bases and some with ringed bottoms.The pottery pieces discovered here are mainly wheel-made wares, both plain (red clay, with or without a fine slip) and painted (in red and black colours), as was common in the flourishing IVC era over 3,000 years ago."Another unique thing here is that besides the ancient Harappan-style artefacts, we also found some pieces dating much later, to the medieval era, or 15th-16th AD. This is probably unprecedented anywhere in India," Bobade said.He said the "twin discoveries" indicate that this particular region of north Maharashtra was inhabited for an extended period, very long after the IVC faded away into the pages of history.The Director of the Directorate of Archaeology, Tejas Garge, said that it could also date back to the Satavahana period, or roughly the time when the famous paintings were said to have been made in the Ajanta Caves, now a UNESCO World Heritage site.Incidentally, the 76m long, 68m wide and 45m tall Nimbalkar Fortress, which stands near the site, was built by the local ruler, Rao Dhar Nimbalkar, in 1788 and at one time it was in the possession of the royal family of Gwalior, the Scindias.However, several discoveries of bronze artefacts during excavations in 1958, 1974 and 1978 in Daimabad and Ahmednagar suggest that the late Harappan culture may have extended to this region of modern-day Maharashtra, said Bobade.Nevertheless, the potters' wheels, which were made of wood, have not survived the ravages of time, but the remnants of their creations are found scattered here, over 1,000 km away from the heart of the Harappan Civilization.The team members, including Bobade, Samadhan Mahajan, a government official, and his son Parth Mahajan, consider this as 'truly astonishing' and said this will need massive further excavations, study and research."Yet, it's still a mystery as to how such a large geographical area exhibited a uniform pottery tradition in forms, paintings and pottery designs similar to Harappa," Bobade said.The IVC was at one point the largest ancient human civilisation in terms of its geographical spread, with a core area of over 1,500 km, along with the 3,200 km-long Indus River system of north and north-west India before it drains into the Arabian Sea near Karachi, Pakistan.Bobade is confident that after the latest discoveries in Jalgaon, the Archaeological Survey of India and other experts will carry out further excavations and investigations to reveal more of the ancient era to the modern world. --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/late-harappan-era-artefacts-found-at-virgin-site-in-jalgaon-281570
11-07-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh/Northampton||PM Narendra Modi congratulates Harleen Deol on 'phenomenal' catch; see post||Harleen Deol's superb catch has caught Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention as well. The Prime Minister took to his Instagram story, and praised the 23-year-old for her stunning catch of Amy Jones. The Prime Minister wrote: “Phenomenal, well done". Here’s the post:Harleen took a magnificent catch on the boundary, to get rid of Amy in the 19th over of the first innings.Also read:Meanwhile, Harmanpreet and Harleen pulled off splendid catches in the rain-hit first T20I which England won by 18 runs here on Friday night."When you play a team game, you need a momentum and it can come from any member of the team. When I took the catch, it created a sort of energy in the team and then Harleen also took a brilliant catch. So to create that energy, you need to take some extra effort," Harmanpreet said during the virtual press conference."Throughout the game, our ground fielding was good, we saved a lot of runs, and we also took some brilliant catches, so I think it is a great sign that our fielding has improved a lot."  In the penultimate over, Harmanpreet, fielding at long on, put an end to Nat Sciver's brilliant innings by diving to pouch the ball inches over the ground.Two balls later, Harleen put an end to Amy Jones' innings, as she jumped to take a superb reverse-cupped catch at the boundary above her head before losing her balance. She threw the ball in the air as she stepped out of the boundary rope only to jump back in, diving forward to complete the catch.ODI skipper Mithali Raj and batting great Sachin Tendulkar lauded the stunning effort put by Harleen during the catch, the video of which has gone viral since.Talking about the contribution of the fielding coach, Harmanpreet said: "Abhay sir has been with us for quite some time, his little awareness makes you a better player. That is being refleted in our fielding."Earlier also, we used to make a lot of effort but the little adjustments that he has done with our fielding, the individual sessions that he has taken with the players that have helped."The most important point was he judged every player where it can do better fielding, so we are getting the results day by day from the effort that we have put in, which is a great positive."  Sharma is into his second full series with the women's team following the home series against South Africa in March. India, however, has lost yet another match, going down by 18 runs in the first T20I.Asked what would be the approach in the next two T20Is, she said: "We always play to win, unfortunately, we lost a few wickets... so the approach will be the same. The wicket is good to bat on, so if we bat first we can score 10-15 runs extra, but the next two games the approach will remain the same." — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-narendra-modi-congratulates-harleen-deol-on-phenomenal-catch-see-post-281566

Parminder Pal Singh, chief general secretary of JAGO, said Sirsa shockingly gave himself a clean chit.Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), accused his predecessor Paramjit Singh Sarna of “lying” after the latter alleged that there was a “lookout circular” against Sirsa.Sarna cited an order of the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, saying a “lookout circular had been issued over suspicion that Sirsa might flee the country fearing arrest in connection with the ongoing court case on the alleged misuse of funds of the DSGMC”. Countering him, Sirsa, at a press conference, cited the same court order and said, “There was no lookout circular. Sarna is lying.”On the allegation that the court has directed the investigating officer (IO) in the case to ensure that the accused does not flee from justice, Sirsa said, “There is no question of fleeing. The matter is under investigation. The IO has informed the court that he was examining the funds and their outflow.” Sarna, who heads the SADD, alleged Sirsa had sold off his properties. He challenged the Badals (Parkash Singh and Sukhbir) to sack Sirsa to prove their claims that they were custodians of the Sikh cause. Sirsa, on his part, accused the Sarna brothers (Paramjit and Harvinder) saying, “Let them prove at least one allegation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sarna-dsgmc-president-sirsa-exchange-barbs-over-court-hearing-281350
11-07-2021||Aditi Tandon||Children develop Covid antibodies better than adults||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 10The immune systems of children are better placed to fight Covid-19 due to the nature of the antibodies they produce, a new research has found.Published in PubMed, the digital repository that archives work published in the world’s leading journals, the study shows that distinct antibody response children develop to Covid-19 explains the mild nature of illness they experience as against adults who tend to progress to severe Covid.The study reveals that children produce antibodies aimed at the spike protein the virus uses to enter human cells, while adults develop antibodies to what is called the nucleocapsid protein, which is key to viral replication in the body.The nucleocapsid protein is released when the virus has replicated enough in the body and is widely prevalent. Children don’t produce antibodies to nucleocapsid protein which indicates their immune system’s ability to fight the virus before it replicates. This could answer why children get mild and asymptomatic Covid.“Clinical manifestations of Covid-19 are associated with age. Adults develop respiratory symptoms, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome in the most severe form, while children are largely spared from respiratory illness but can develop a life-threatening multisystem inflammatory syndrome. We see distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection,” the researchers say.They find that adult Covid-19 cohorts have anti-spike antibodies as well as anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, while children with and without MIS-C predominantly generate antibodies specific to spike protein but not the N-protein. “The results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children,” the study notes, explaining in part why children, even with antibodies to Sars-Cov2, do not turn up RTPCR positive. They don’t have enough viral load to be caught by an RTPCR test.Commenting on the new evidence that explains why children’s immune systems are better trained to respond to Covid, paediatric expert Vipin Vashishtha says the reason children can neutralise the virus is also that their T cells are relatively naive and untrained and may have a greater capacity to respond to new viruses.Response to novel viruses||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/children-develop-covid-antibodies-better-than-adults-281346

While most key players want statehood to be restored before the UT goes to the polls, the Centre wants elections once the Delimitation Commission completes its exercise of reorganising boundaries of segments and carving out new ones.Gupkar alliance spokesperson MY Tarigami said the mistrust between J&K and the Centre had given rise to the suspicion that the “Delhi model” of statehood may be imposed in J& K. “There is apprehension that statehood may not be restored anytime soon if the elections are held. There is no timeframe, no guarantee, but a lot of mistrust. The Centre should undertake confidence-building measures and assure the people that it is not playing games with them,” he said.The Congress had raised the “Delhi model” apprehension at the meeting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi held with J&K leaders. “In Delhi, the L-G and the Delhi Government are constantly engaged in a tug of war. This means little work gets done. We suggested that the L-G could be elevated as Governor,” Congress PCC chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir said, adding that there was talk of statehood being restored with the rider that the Centre would keep the Home and Finance Departments.Political observers believe the parties are keen on restoration of statehood before the elections so that they can claim credit for it and woo the voter. “With the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act-2019, the state lost its special status and was made UT. On what grounds will the political parties seek votes? If the statehood is restored, they will have something to show to the people,” a faculty member of the University of Kashmir explained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-may-thrust-delhi-model-fear-jk-parties-281288

Other symptoms included persistent fatigue, dizziness and insomnia, but these were not frequently observed, The Straits Times reported on Saturday, citing the study by the country’s top infectious disease body which is focusing on Covid-19 treatment. The study also found elevated inflammatory markers regardless of whether the person had a serious or mild case of the disease. These proteins in the blood have been associated with conditions affecting the circulatory system and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.Long Covid is a serious concern from a societal perspective and, if widespread, will likely put a strain on the society and economy for years to come, experts maintained.Home Secretary reviews situation at tourist spotsUnion Home Secy Ajay Bhalla on Saturday held a review meeting on steps taken to check the spread of infection at hill stations and tourist destinations.

11-07-2021||New Delhi||Youth Congress chief takes 'for sale' jibe at Scindia, BJP hits back||Congress' youth wing chief Srinivas B V on Friday took a jibe at BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on being appointed as the civil aviation minister with a meme showing Air India mascot telling Scindia "we are both for sale", drawing a sharp reaction from the BJP which said it reflected the opposition party's frustration.MP: Cong leader sends Burnol to BJP minister over Scindia's elevationThe meme was first shared from the social media account of the Congress' Madhya Pradesh unit but it gained a lot of traction after it was shared by the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) chief. Srinivas shared the meme which showed Air India Mascot 'Maharaja' telling Scindia, "Aiyye Maharaj, hum dono bikau hain (Come Maharaja, we are both for sale)", and added the caption, "Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi..".बिकाऊ को बेचने का काम मिला,ग़द्दारी का उसे कुछ यूँ इनाम मिला। pic.twitter.com/ynksXAorWi  Last night, the Madhya Pradesh Congress shared the meme and wrote, "Bikau ko bechne ka kaam mila, Gaddari ka use kuch yu inaam mila (One who is up for sale has been given the job of selling, got a reward for being a traitor)." Hitting out at Srinivas' post, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said the Congress stooping to such levels to target a "young and enterprising" leader like Scindia shows its frustration."The message is very clear that the BJP is a party which taps talent, which knows how to recognise people of merit and substance. In Congress, the mantra is that if anybody has more potential than the so-called prince of the Congress then don't let him rise and keep him in the shadow of Rahul Gandhi," he told a TV channel.Slamming the Congress for using the term 'Bikau', Bhatia said this comes from people who are out on bail on corruption charges. There were also several social media posts taking a dig at Scindia and also many in which the Congress was slammed for targeting him.Scindia (50) resigned from the Congress and joined the BJP in March last year and his move triggered a chain of events which finally culminated in the collapse of the Kamal Nath government just 15 months after its formation, paving the way for the saffron party to assume power which it lost towards the end of 2018. On joining the BJP, he was made a Rajya Sabha member, while Shivraj Singh Chouhan came back as the chief minister.The scion of the former royal family of Gwalior had started showing signs of restlessness after the Congress high command chose veteran Kamal Nath over him to take over as the chief minister in December 2018. Things came to a head when Scindia warned of "hitting the streets" against his own party-led government if promises made to people in the manifesto were not fulfilled.The then chief minister Kamal Nath's retort that Scindia was free to carry out his threat to launch an agitation, finally proved his undoing.
