10-07-2021||Bhopal||MP: Congress leader sends Burnol to BJP minister over Scindia's elevation||Trading barbs over the induction of Jyotiraditya Scindia in the Union cabinet, a Congress leader on Saturday sent tubes of Burnol cream to Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra to "ease pain".Mishra on Thursday had said that those who are feeling jealous about Scindia, a former Congressman, getting into the Narendra Modi cabinet should be given Burnol (which is used to treat minor burn injuries).  "When the Congress issued a statement about a betrayal by Scindia, Mishra said he would send us Burnol. Now we have sent two tubes of the ointment to Mishra because he needs them more,” state Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja said.The tubes were sent through an e-commerce platform, he said."One tube is from Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, because Mishra was eyeing his post. Another tube is from state Congress chief Kamal Nath because Mishra is obsessed with him and continuously talks about him," Saluja said.State BJP secretary Rahul Kothari said it was a cheap stunt. “This is a cheap tactic being used by the Congress. The opposition party should tell us what kind of ointment Nath needs, because he travels only by air and now Scindia has become the aviation minister," Kothari retorted.Scindia brought down the Kamal Nath government in MP last year when he and 22 Congress MLAs loyal to him quit the party and joined the BJP. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-congress-leader-sends-burnol-to-bjp-minister-over-scindias-elevation-281135

It has been conducting virtual buyer-seller meets and festivals to promote mango exports.

10-07-2021||Bengaluru||ISRO swinging back to full action; plans to launch geo imaging satellite on August 12||The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is getting back into launch activity fully at Sriharikota spaceport with the planned orbiting of geo imaging satellite GISAT-1 on board GSLV-F10 rocket on August 12.It’s going to be only the second launch of the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency in the Covid-19-hit 2021.ISRO successfully launched PSLV-C51 mission on February 28 with Brazil’s earth observation satellite Amazonia-1 and 18 co-passengers, including some built by students, on board.The 2,268-kg GISAT-1 was originally slated to be launched from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh’s Nellore district, about 100 km north of Chennai, on March 5 last year but was postponed a day before the blast-off due to technical reasons.Thereafter the launch was delayed due to Covid-19- induced lockdown which affected normal work.It was scheduled for March 28 this year but a “minor issue” with the satellite forced its postponement.The launch was later expected in April and then in May but the campaign could not be taken up due to lockdown in parts of the country triggered by the second wave of the pandemic.“We have tentatively planned the GSLV-F10 launch on August 12, at 05.43 am, subject to weather conditions”, an ISRO official told P T I on Saturday.According to ISRO, GISAT-1 will facilitate near real- time observation of the Indian sub-continent, under cloud-free conditions, at frequent intervals.GISAT-1 will be placed in a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit by GSLV-F10 and, subsequently, it will be positioned in the final geostationary orbit, about 36,000 km above earth’s equator, using its on board propulsion system.The earth observation satellite will provide the country near real-time images of its borders and also enable quick monitoring of natural disasters.Experts said positioning the state-of-the-art agile earth observation satellite in geostationary orbit has key advantages.“It’s going to be a game-changer in some sense for India,” a Department of Space official said.“With onboard high resolution cameras, the satellite will allow the country to monitor the Indian land mass and the oceans, particularly its borders, continuously,” the official said.Listing the objectives of the mission, ISRO had earlier said the satellite would provide near real-time imaging of the large area region of interest at frequent intervals.It would help in quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic and any short-term events.The third objective is to obtain spectral signatures of agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, disaster warning, cloud properties, snow and glacier and oceanography.

10-07-2021||---||Chirag taunts Paras upon landing cabinet berth; declares he won't give up||Patna, July 10Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan on Saturday paid a backhanded compliment to estranged uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras by congratulating him on joining the union cabinet, which he said was a goal he achieved by breaking up his own family.The beleaguered LJP leader, who has suffered a setback with the Delhi High Court rejecting his petition challenging the election of Paras as the party leader in the Lok Sabha, made it clear I am not going to give up my fight to reclaim the party nurtured by my late father Ram Vilas Paswan's blood and sweat.In an oblique reference to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who he suspects of engineering the putsch in the LJP, Chirag said I cannot allow the party to be taken over by those, who because of personal ambitions, are sitting in the lap of people who did not deign to come out with even a tweet on my fathers birth anniversary recently.The Jamui MP also hinted at his disillusionment with the BJP which has kept silent over the crisis in his party despite his unreserved adulation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.When asked by reporters whether he still considered himself a Hanuman to Modi, akin to the relationship between the monkey god and Lord Ram, Paswan cryptically replied this is a question you need to ask when elections are around the corner.The 38 years old, who has been reaching out to the family of his late father from the first marriage, also said I feel overwhelmed by emotions. After the death of my father and the betrayal of my family members many other dear relatives have come out with support.In the state since Monday as part of his ashirwad yatra, Chirag has paid visits to his step-sisters here besides his stepmother in his native district of Khagaria, in a charm offensive to win over his close relations. The former Bollywood actor has in the past been accused of condescension towards them.I am not a legal expert. So I will not comment much upon the Delhi High Court order until a meeting with my legal team in the national capital. But I am not going to give up, he asserted.After making his political debut in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, Chirag succeeded his father as LJP national president five years later. He opened a front against Nitish Kumar ahead of the assembly polls last year, claiming that the people of the state wanted a change in leadership and he was helping the BJP form its own government.The BJP, which had backed Kumar for a fourth consecutive term, distanced itself from Chirags politics of brinkmanship. It, however, ended up benefiting from the melee as it returned with a tally much higher than that of JD(U), for the first time.Paras, along with four other party MPs, staged a political coup last month when they broke away voicing disapproval of Chirag's stance towards the JD(U).Paras replaced Chirag as the party's leader in the Lok Sabha and was elected national president of the breakaway faction.The uncle and the nephew seem poised for a long legal and political battle with the former appearing to have the cadres' support but the latter capturing the public imagination as the heir to Ram Vilas Paswan, one of the tallest Dalit leaders of his generation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chirag-taunts-paras-upon-landing-cabinet-berth-declares-he-wont-give-up-281104
10-07-2021||Guwahati||Gorkhas of Assam welcome govt move to call community by preferred name||The indigenous Gorkha community of Assam welcomed the state Cabinet’s recent decision to describe its members as ‘Gorkhas’, saying that identifying them as Nepalis, as they had been called for many years, had made them feel like citizens of another country.The community also expressed satisfaction at the Cabinet decision to declare Gorkhas a ‘protected class’ as it will give the community members land rights, among other benefits, in tribal belts of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR).This ‘protected class’ status should also be extended to areas outside the BTR, community leaders said.“For years we have been demanding that our community be identified as Gorkha. Referring to us as Nepali creates a sense of alienation, as if we are from Nepal and not Indians,” Harka Bahadur Chetry, chairman of the Gorkha Autonomous Council Demand Committee (GACDC), told PTI.The demand was placed before the previous government also, during a meeting between the GACDC and then chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, on September 10, 2016.“Among the demands we had placed before the chief minister, one was that the term Nepali be substituted with the Gorkha in all existing gazette notifications,” Chetry said.The move is a welcome step in that direction, he said.The state Cabinet meeting on July 7 decided to notify Nepali Graziers and Cultivators of Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886, as Gorkha community and include it, along with some other communities, as a ‘protected class’ in the tribal belts and blocks in Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri districts comprising the BTR.The community members residing there from before 2003, when the districts came under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, will get the benefits. Gorkhas had ceased to enjoy the benefits of the ‘protected class’ when these four districts came under the Sixth Schedule.The Gorkhas have also been demanding the ‘protected class’ status in all tribal belts and blocks created post- Independence, as they currently enjoy it only in the areas thus demarcated prior to 1947.“This notification of protection of Gorkhas should be extended to other existing tribal belts and blocks being reviewed by the government, and also to those which the government is proposing to create,” Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh (BGP) national vice-president Yam Prasad Ghimire said.BGP Assam unit president Prakash Dahal said, “It (the decision) is historic for the Gorkhas battling identity crisis for years as we were being seen as foreigners due to the use of the word Nepali.”“Our forefathers were inhabitants of this land as much as were those of the other indigenous tribes and communities.But during the course of history, misguided by the governments, we came to call ourselves Nepalis, which assumed a different connotation once different countries were formed,” Chetry said.He claimed that the Gorkhas are a heterogeneous community formed by different tribes, many of whom have been living in Assam since, or even before, the Ahom rule started in the 13th century.The largest entry of Nepali-speaking people to the state in the later ages happened during the British period when they arrived as soldiers for the colonial rulers. As the Gorkhas also speak the Nepali language, they have always been perceived as foreigners.Chetry said that the problems compounded with the signing of the Assam Accord of 1985, which entails constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards for the ‘indigenous Assamese’ people of the state.The concept of ‘original inhabitants’ was floated afresh after a notification to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was issued in the state in 2013, leading to resentment among the Gorkhas as they were not included in that category.“When several other tribes of the state were declared original inhabitants and relieved of the need to provide documents to a great extent, we felt deprived and left out as we were not included in this list,” Chetry said.Getting the name right is a major step for ensuring the inclusion of the Gorkhas as a part of Assam, BGP state secretary and spokesperson Nanda Kirati Dewan said.The population of the Gorkhas is about 6 lakh in the state as per the 2011 Census but the figure actually is much higher, he claimed.“These 6 lakh people are those who are enlisted as Nepali-language speakers. But the Gorkha is a heterogeneous community and formed of many tribes and sub-tribes, who have their own languages, like the Limbus or Tamangs,” he said.

The injections were later found to be spurious.While denying relief to him, Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Bedi said that the offences are grave in nature and entail severe punishment.“The offences with which the applicant has been accused of are serious in nature, where the applicant in those unprecedented times attempted to play with the lives of patients, who needed urgent vials,” the judge said.Furthermore, the Additional Sessions Judge said that the offences committed by the accused not only attract punishment under the Indian Penal Code or the Epidemic Act but also the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.The accused is currently facing charges under sections 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order by public servant), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and various sections of the Essential Commodities Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.During the course of proceedings, the counsel for the accused claimed before the court that the alleged "recovery" shown from Garg was "planted by the police officials" and that there is nothing to indicate his involvement in the commission of the crime.Remdesivir injection, which is used in the treatment of Covid-19, was in high demand during the second wave of the pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-court-denies-bail-to-man-accused-of-possessing-fake-remdesivir-injections-says-played-with-lives-281095
10-07-2021||Jaipur||Cops turn disciples to arrest criminal hiding in ashram for 27 years||In an interesting turn of events, Rajasthan Police personnel had to turn into disciples to arrest a 'saint' wanted in a long-pending assault case, who was hiding at an ashram in Haryana for the past 27 years after absconding from the clutches of the law enforcement agencies.The head constable of Vishwakarma police station here, Saheb Singh, played a crucial role in arresting the accused who has been identified as Deshbandhu Jat, absconding since last 27 years from Jaipur and staying as a 'sadhu' in the ashram.Singh got a tip-off that the Jat was living as a sadhu at an ashram in Bapora in Bhiwani district of Haryana. But as the police were not sure that the person in the ashram was the same man who gave them slip for so many years, they decided to stay in the ashram as his disciple to find out his real identity.As the policemen talked to the person on different issues, the latter mentioned Jaipur, after which the cops became convinced that he had a Jaipur connection. Later during another round of discussions, they became sure that the man living in the guise of a sadhu was indeed Deshbandhu Jat.Presently, the Jaipur Police are running a campaign to arrest all the wanted criminals. Under this campaign, the police took steps to arrest Jat, who was wanted in a case registered in 1994.At that time, Jat used to work at a petrol pump in the Vishwakarma police station area where he had thrashed a customer who had complained that Jat was giving him less petrol. Subsequently, a case was registered against Jat.In order to convince the self-styled godman that they were indeed his disciples, the cops even had to smoke 'chillum' with him.There was even a commotion at the ashram before his arrest. As soon as the Rajasthan Police personnel informed that they were going to arrest Jat, one of his disciples called the other devotees over phone who soon gathered at the ashram.But the cops somehow managed to take Jat to the Bhiwani police station from where the accused was brought to Jaipur after high-level talks. A local court has now sent Jat to judicial custody. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cops-turn-disciples-to-arrest-criminal-hiding-in-ashram-for-27-years-281094
10-07-2021||Baharampur (WB)||Centre earned Rs 4.91 lakh crore revenue as fuel prices hiked 69 times this year: Adhir||Congress leader in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, on Saturday claimed that the Centre has earned Rs 4.91 lakh crore revenue as petrol and diesel prices have been hiked 69 times since January 1 this year.Chowdhury, also the West Bengal Congress chief, urged the TMC government in the state to follow the footsteps of the Chhattisgarh administration and do away with Value Added Taxes (VAT) to reduce fuel prices."Unmindful of the sufferings of the people, the Narendra Modi government in Delhi has effected 69 hikes in petrol and diesel prices since January 1 and earned Rs 4.91 lakh crore revenue."The BJP government is not showing any concern for the plight of the common man. We urge the Centre to roll back fuel price hike, as petrol breached the Rs 100-per-litre mark, diesel neared century and LPG rate touched Rs 850 per cylinder," the senior Congress leader told reporters.Chowdhury also claimed that the BJP-led government at the Centre has earned a total of Rs 25 lakh crore through repeated fuel price hikes since coming to power in 2014.He said that the petrol price dipped by Rs 12 per litre after the Congress government in Chhattisgarh did away with VAT, and urged other state administrations, including that of West Bengal, to follow its lead."We know that the TMC government in West Bengal will have to forego a revenue of Rs 1,300-Rs 1,400 crore yielded from VAT, but a party that has come to power with such a huge mandate shouldn't be found wanting in undertaking pro-people steps," Chowdhury said.Responding to a query, he said that the main opposition party is given the post of the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) both in the Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabha."I have been the PAC chairman three times. My name was recommended by our leader Sonia Gandhi. However, the speaker takes the final decision. Appointing the PAC chairman is his/her discretion," he said.However, Chowdhury did not directly comment on the controversy over the appointment of TMC leader Mukul Roy, who recently crossed over from the BJP, as the PAC chairman of West Bengal assembly by the speaker on Friday, which had sparked a walkout by saffron party members who are demanding his disqualification under the anti-defection law. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-earned-rs-4-91-lakh-crore-revenue-as-fuel-prices-hiked-69-times-this-year-adhir-281083

If this is how the "former shishya" of Kotwal Ramachandra treats his party worker, one can imagine what he would do with Others. Have you given DKS the "licence for violence", @RahulGandhi?" he asked.Karnataka BJP, hitting out at Shivakumar for his "behaviour" and calling him "Rowdi DKShi", said he should learn how to conduct himself in public.Posting a video of an earlier incident where Shivakumar can be seen hitting a youth who was clicking selfies, as he was about to address the media, the BJP in a tweet asked him to quit public life if "underworld-like behaviour" is unavoidable. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-congress-chief-shivakumar-slaps-man-for-trying-to-put-his-arms-around-him-281081
10-07-2021||New Delhi||Lack of dietary diversity among pregnant women, children worrying: Health experts||There is a lack of dietary diversity among pregnant and lactating women as well as children across the country with the consumption of fats and oils on the rise and that of green leafy vegetables seeing a decline leading to micronutrient deficiencies, top healthcare experts have said.Mini Varghese, Country Director, Nutrition International India, said the reasons for compromised dietary intake are two-fold."Firstly, the production of green leafy vegetables is generally seasonal, which impacts consumption patterns and overall nutrition outcomes. Secondly, at the family level intra-household dynamics are complex and define access to nutritious foods, with men generally getting preference for both quality and quantity of food," she said.In terms of existing programmes at the national and state level, she said there is a need for increased monitoring and tracking of critical growth parameters, weight and height of children under the age of two."It is at the time of complementary feeding after the age of about 8 to 9 months where the malnutrition slope starts. This is due to unsatisfactory complementary feeding. Further, when monitoring does happen, there is no system where alerts are generated. The system isn't dynamic enough to target children who are slipping on the growth parameters," Varghese said.Another contributing factor to the nutritional deficit is the pitfalls of the supplementation programmes such as the Take Home Ration (THR) system, she said.While it is claimed that the system is successful in meeting the calorific needs of children, it was found that children aren't always consuming the rations being provided and many times these rations have high sugar content to meet energy needs, Varghese added."Therefore, a stronger monitoring of the system is required, along with a focus on meeting nutritional needs rather than energy needs. The THR needs to be given to meet the deficits in children after reflecting on the regional and traditional state practices," she said.Dr Archana Chowdhury, Lead-Maternal New-Born Child Health, Nutrition International India said while the onus is on the government to address malnutrition and policies and programmes are in place, community participation can play an important role in the implementation of these."Encouraging community monitoring, tracking and assessing of services through capacity building of the local governance authorities and frontline workers can help generate data on the outcomes of the programme,” she said.“Moreover, while health and nutrition facilities and systems exist, the uptake is slow. This can be addressed through awareness building within communities and holding local authorities accountable for outcomes at the district level," Chowdhury said.Understanding the special needs of communities at a district level is needed for planning and ensuring equitable access to nutrition services, she added."Further, the quality and coverage of programmes is a challenge that needs addressing. The current system is very data and outcome oriented in measuring the success of the programme. There needs to be shifted of focus from outcome indicators to input and processing indicators," Chowdhury said.Dr. Sheila Vir, Director, Public Health Nutrition and Development Centre, said the rise in undernutrition in children to a great extent seems to be due to poor young child feeding practices comprising breastfeeding and complementary feeding.Appropriate feeding of semi-solid food of right quality (referred to as complementary feeding) in right quantity and frequency to a child along with continuation of breastfeeding seems to be the primary gap.Noting that poor growth under the age of two is largely irreversible, Vir said timely, frequent and effective counselling is essential."For influencing feeding practices, a well-planned and effective social behavioural and communication (SBCC) strategy is imperative since the behaviours are ingrained in society and in family traditions, and we need to reach mothers, caregivers, family members, and others in the extended circle of influence," Vir added.She said eating right through the life cycle should be a public movement and private medical practitioners should also address the issue of appropriate breastfeeding soon after delivery and introduction of child feeding practices at around six months. "The new education policy should include the practical details on feeding in the school curriculum," she added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lack-of-dietary-diversity-among-pregnant-women-children-worrying-health-experts-281075

10-07-2021||New Delhi||Petrol crosses Rs 100-mark in UP, Chhattisgarh, Nagaland||Petrol price on Saturday crossed the Rs 100-per-litre mark in some places in Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Nagaland after fuel prices were hiked yet again.Petrol price was hiked by 35 paise per litre and diesel by 26 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.This took fuel prices across the country to a fresh high.In Delhi, petrol price rose to Rs 100.91 a litre and diesel to Rs 89.88 per litre.The increase led to petrol price surge above Rs 100 per-litre- mark in Rampur district of Uttar Pradesh, Kanker, Jashpur and Narayanpur districts of Chhattisgarh and Kohima in Nagaland.The three states are in a growing list of places where the fuel is at over Rs 100-a-litre mark. States where petrol had reached those levels over the past few weeks are Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bihar, Punjab, Ladakh, Sikkim and Puducherry.Diesel, the most used fuel in the country, is above that level in some places in Rajasthan, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.Earlier this week, Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri refused to comment on the issue unless he was fully briefed."Give me some time. I need to be briefed on the issues," he had said soon after taking charge of the ministry on July 8. "It will be very wrong for me to comment on it (fuel prices) when I have just stepped into this building."Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as value-added tax (VAT) and freight charges.As much as 55 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol in Delhi is made up of taxes (Rs 32.90 a litre excise duty collected by the central government and Rs 22.80 VAT levied by the state government).Half of the diesel price is made up of taxes (Rs 31.80 central excise and Rs 13.04 state VAT).The hike on Saturday is the 38th increase in the price of petrol since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during Assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 38 hikes, the price of petrol has risen by Rs 10.51 per litre. During this period, diesel rates have soared by Rs 9.15 a litre in 36 instances of price rise.

Her relics were found in 2005 at the St Augustine Convent in Old Goa, India, on the basis of medieval Portuguese records. They are believed to have been brought to Goa in 1627 and interred in St Augustine Complex.At the instance of the Archaeological Survey of India, the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, carried out DNA analysis that confirmed its authenticity.In 2017, at the request of the Georgian government, India sent the relics to Georgia for an exhibition for six months. The relics were personally greeted by His Holiness and Beatitude Ilia II, the Catholicos-Patriarch of Georgia along with many Georgians. This loan of relics was extended for another six months and was returned to India on September 30, 2018. The Holy Relics spent the year travelling to different Churches of Georgia. Considering the persistent request from the Georgian side for permanent transfer of the Holy Relics and also taking into account the historical, religious and spiritual sentiments that are attached to the St Queen Ketevan by Georgians, New Delhi has decided to gift one part of Holy Relics to Georgia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-gifts-part-of-st-ketevans-relics-to-georgia-281049

But one thing is clear that our athletes will have to stay at the Tokyo airport for 5 to 6 hours after arrival," Baishya told PTI. "The first thing after arrival will be Covid tests of all the Indian contingent. Then we have to complete immigration and other required process. After that the Covid test results will come and only after that the Indian contingent will be allowed to board the bus." He said sailors will be among the first batch to leave for Tokyo."Without Covid test results, we cannot leave Tokyo airport. Then all the contingent will have to quarantine at the Village for three days. "The first contingent will leave on July 17 and sailing team will be in that.

The infection was first detected in a young pregnant woman on Thursday with the ICMR-National Institute of Virology confirming 13 cases on Friday. The infection mostly spreads by the bite of an infected mosquito. It can even cause birth defects.Symptoms Fever | Rash | Headache | Joint pain | Red eyes | Muscle painIndia saw 43,393 daily cases today and over 40,000 cases for the third day, with Maharashtra and Kerala accounting for 53 per cent of the new infections over the past week.The Centre’s warning came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi took stock of the efforts to install over 1,500 pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen plants across the country, which would support four lakh oxygenated beds. The plants were contributed by PM Cares Fund. The details of medical oxygen preparedness were discussed at a review meeting chaired by the PM, who instructed officials to ensure that the plants became functional at the earliest and adequately trained hospital staff were put in charge of their operation and maintenance. He said advanced technology should be deployed to track performance and functioning of oxygen plants. Officials said a pilot project was being conducted using the tracking technology for monitoring the performance of the oxygen plants and would be scaled up once outcomes are known.The meeting assessed the availability of medical oxygen amid a probable third wave with the government’s second wave arrangements found woefully wanting, leading to deaths of several patients for want of the life-saving gas.The officials said PSA oxygen plants contributed by PM Cares were coming up in all districts. A government statement said the PM had instructed close engagement with states to ensure adequate installed capacity of medical oxygen.Officials said they were working with the state governments to fast-track the installation of plants. The government is targeting training of 8,000 persons to operate and maintain oxygen plants across India.The meeting was attended by Principal Secretary to PM PK Mishra, Cabinet Secretary Rajeev Gauba, Secretary (Health) Rajesh Bhushan and Secretary (Urban Development) Durga Shanker Mishra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2nd-wave-not-over-protocol-must-states-told-pm-reviews-medical-oxygen-supply-280868

Facebook and WhatsApp have challenged a single-judge order refusing to stay the Competition Commission of India (CCI) order directing a probe into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy.India is the biggest market for WhatsApp, but its rival platforms, such as Telegram and Signal, have registered a significant surge in the number of users.

The policy is under challenge in the Supreme Court that issued notices to WhatsApp and the Centre on the issue on February 15.The policy is under challenge in the SC that issued notices to WhatsApp and the Centre on February 15. The petitioners against its new privacy policy alleged that it provided for lower standards of privacy for Indian users compared to their European counterparts.The SC had noted that people’s privacy must be protected in view of the allegation that users’ data was being shared with other companies. “You may be two or three trillion (dollar) companies, but people value their privacy more than money,” it had said.It’s the duty of the judiciary to protect citizens’ privacy and people have apprehensions that they will lose their privacy and it is our duty to protect them, it had noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-compel-users-new-privacy-policy-on-hold-whatsapp-to-delhi-high-court-280872

The world body said variants were currently winning the race against vaccines due to inequity in the production and distribution of jabs.The WHO has so far classified four variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and four variants of interest (Eta, Iota, Kappa and Lambda).A day after global Covid deaths crossed the 4-million mark, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described vaccine nationalism as morally indefensible and asked countries to show solidarity in defeating the virus.“The world is at a perilous point. We have just passed the tragic milestone of 4 million deaths, which likely underestimates the overall toll. Some countries are dropping public health social measures as if the pandemic is over. However, compounded by fast-moving variants and shocking inequity in vaccination, far too many countries are seeing spikes in cases,” the WHO chief said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-vax-nationalism-not-helping-covid-fight-280873

They also reviewed the progress in their bilateral strong-points of defence, space, nuclear energy and petroleum.Committed to centrality, unity of ASEANBecause of larger geopolitical compatibility with Russia, we see a more active Russian presence and participation in the region as something very important. We are very much committed to the centrality and unity of ASEAN. S Jaishankar, external affairs ministerNeed to check violence in AfghanistanConcerned over violence in Afghanistan, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said, “The immediate need is reduction in violence if we have to see peace within and around Afghanistan. It is important for India and Russia to work together to ensure that much of the progress on the economic, social and democratic front is maintained.”Discussing the contentious topic of Indo-Pacific, where the shadow of Quad makes Russia uneasy, his counterpart Sergei Lavrov, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar invited Moscow to be a more active participant and assured that New Delhi’s endeavours would reflect the multi-polar and re-balanced character of politics.Speaking at a joint press conference with Lavrov, Jaishankar noted that energy cooperation had grown significantly in the last few years, which reflected in new potential investments and long term commitments in the oil and gas sector.

Over 90 per cent of vaccine doses administered in Africa so far are Covishield.However, individual countries are given flexibility and this is what the 15 countries have exercised. Four vaccines are currently approved for use in the EU: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. Another four are under “rolling review” for possible approval: Russia's Sputnik, China's Sinovac, Germany's CureVac and Novavax of the US.The 15 countries have utilised a caveat that says, “Member states can, however, issue the certificate even to those who have been vaccinated with other vaccines if they are willing to do so”.Only 10 out of 31 EU/EFTA nations have fully followed the WHO guidelines by recognising all eight vaccines that have been granted a WHO Emergency Use Listing as valid for entry by tourists and other non-essential travelers. SII’s AstraZeneca, called Covishield, is among them. They are Finland, Germany, Latvia, Netherlands, Hungary, Spain, Sweden , as well as Iceland and Switzerland.Until last week, nine EU\EFTA countries had decided to accept Covishield as and when they opened their borders to citizens of countries hit by deadly Covid variants.  These countries were Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Spain, Switzerland and Estonia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/15-european-nations-accept-covishield-280593
10-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC backs Uniform Civil Code, says shouldn't remain 'a mere hope'||Noting that the modern Indian society was gradually becoming homogenous and the traditional barriers of religion, community, and caste were slowly dissipating, the Delhi High Court has said Uniform Civil Code (UCC) “ought not to remain a mere hope”.“The youth of India belonging to various communities, tribes, castes or religions who solemnise their marriages ought not to be forced to struggle with issues arising due to conflicts in various personal laws, especially in relation to marriage and divorce," Justice Prathiba M Singh said in a July 7 order made public on Friday.Highlighting the fact that the need for UCC was reiterated from time to time by the Supreme Court, Justice said, “it is unclear as to what steps have been taken in this regard till date”.The high court directed that a copy of the order be communicated to the Secretary, Ministry of Law & Justice, Government of India, for necessary action as deemed appropriate.The case related to a couple from Meena community—a Schedule Tribe in Rajasthan. As the husband had sought divorce, the wife contended that the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, didn’t apply to them as Meena was a notified Scheduled Tribe.Rejecting the wife's contention on the ground that both the parties had pleaded that their marriage was solemnised according to Hindu rites and ceremonies and they followed Hindu customs.However, it said such cases highlighted the need for a UCC applicable to marriage, divorce, succession, etc.This is not the first time that courts have talked about UCC. In the Shah Bano maintenance case (1985), the top court had said, “A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to law which have conflicting ideologies”. Again in the Sarla Mudgal case (1995), the SC said, “It appears that…the rulers of the day are not in a mood to retrieve Article 44 from the cold storage, where it has been lying since 1949”.While dealing with a Christian divorce case in 2015,  the Supreme Court had asked the government to take a quick decision on a uniform civil code to end the confusion over personal laws.Article 44 enjoins upon the state to work towards securing a uniform civil code across the country replacing personal laws of various religious communities. If a UCC is enacted, all personal laws will cease to exist and practices such as polygamy, triple talaq, and halala would be done away with. Article 44 is a part of the Directive Principles of State Policy, which are not enforceable by courts. But according to Article 37, the government is duty-bound to apply these principles in making laws. The top court has been reminding the government about having a uniform civil code.The Supreme Court had in December 2015 refused to direct the government to take a decision to have a UCC for all citizens across India.A bench led by the then CJI TS Thakur had declined to interfere in the matter, saying it was for Parliament to make laws. “Let Parliament take a view on it,” it had said||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-backs-uniform-civil-code-says-shouldnt-remain-a-mere-hope-280580

In the United Kingdom, during Euro 2020 matches, a sudden surge in cases was observed. Russia is seeing a third peak in cases. Bangladesh witnessed more cases in the third peak than the second peak.”Pointing to the decline in daily new cases in the country during the second wave, he said: “More than half of the total cases in the country are primarily reported from two states—Maharashtra and Kerala and spread of infection concentrated in limited geography.”He said that 66 districts have reported more than 10 per cent positivity for the week ending July 8 and 80 per cent of new cases are reported from 90 districts which need focused attention.

Only Rs 208 crore was allocated for the AIF in the revised Budget of 2020-21, and Rs 900 crore in the Budget for 2021-22," it added.The morcha claimed even in terms of loans, "only Rs 3,241 crore was sanctioned from the AIF as of March 2021 (Rs 4,300 crore as per some subsequent media reports), whereas the AIF was announced to be a Covid-19 rescue package as though it would immediately infuse Rs 1 lakh crore into agriculture".“In the six months during which the three farm laws were in operation before the Supreme Court suspended them, the trade in most APMC market yards collapsed by almost half and their revenues dropped drastically. The Centre has shown that it has no commitment to building and expanding the public market and storage infrastructure for the benefit of small farmers, and has set upon facilitating the Adanis, Walmart and Reliance to build private markets, storage and processing facilities," it alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-dont-need-more-loans-but-freedom-from-indebtedness-samyukt-kisan-morcha-280499
10-07-2021||New Delhi||Privacy policy on hold till data protection bill comes into force: WhatsApp tells Delhi HC||WhatsApp LLC told the Delhi High Court on Friday that till the data protection bill comes into force, it will not compel users to opt for its new privacy policy as it has been put on hold and will implement it "if Parliament allows it".WhatsApp clarified before bench of Chief justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh that it would not limit the functionality for users who are not opting for new privacy policy in the meantime.Appearing for the instant messaging platform, Senior Advocate Harish Salve said, "We voluntarily agreed to put it (the policy) on hold... We will not compel people to accept." Salve said that WhatsApp would nonetheless continue to display the update to its users.In response to Salve's submission, the court observed that even though the implementation had been put on hold, the policy still continued to exist.“You are not implementing it, but the policy is with you and any day it can come,” the court said.Salve reiterated that the approach would be maintained till the data protection bill becomes the law.“Commitment is that I will do nothing till the Parliament's law comes in. If Parliament allows it, I will have it. If it doesn't, bad luck... I've taken it off till the Parliament makes a law. Either we fit in or we don't,” Salve said.The Personal Data Protection Bill seeks to regulate the use of individual's data by the government and private companies. The Joint Committee of Parliament examining the Bill has been given extension till the monsoon session to submit its report.The court was hearing the appeals of Facebook and its firm WhatsApp against the single-judge order refusing to stop the competition regulator CCI's order directing a probe into WhatsApp's new privacy policy.Last month, an application was moved by WhatsApp for interim stay on the probe.Salve argued that since the genesis of the probe -the privacy policy - has been stalled for now, the inquiry into the same by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had become academic.“Objectionable part was 'take it or leave it'. For present, 'take it or leave it' is something we are not doing. Opt in, opt out is not there. Everybody is using,” he said.He also urged the court to grant WhatsApp time till the end of July to respond to the questionnaire sent by CCI to it in relation to the inquiry.Salve informed the court that on June 4, WhatsApp received a letter from CCI, seeking information directly in relation to the issue of privacy, which is being looked into by the Supreme Court and the high court.“Please see the questions—month-wise number of downloads, number of active users, number of users left... number of users who opted out...80-90% is directly what your lordship is hearing,” he said Salve added that even the central government communication sent to it in May, asking it to withdraw the policy, established that the privacy policy was already a subject matter of hearing before the Supreme court and the high court.Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Facebook, submitted that the CCI was jumping the gun by initiating a probe into the privacy policy when a challenge to the same was pending before two higher courts.Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, appearing for CCI, said that as long as the privacy policy existed, its implications would continue to persist.He added that the matter before CCI was only at the stage of inquiry and “nothing is going to happen even if steps are taken”.“It is not as if by filing the reply anything detrimental will happen,” Lekhi said.Advocate Gurkaran Singh submitted before the court that his client Tapasi Kohli sought to intervene in the appeals on account of being the informant before CCI.The court proceeded to adjourn the matter till July 30 after it recorded that CCI's affidavit was not on record.The single judge on April 22 said that he saw no merit in the petitions of Facebook and WhatsApp to interdict the investigation directed by the CCI.He opined that though it would have been "prudent" for the CCI to await the outcome of petitions in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court against WhatsApp's new privacy policy, not doing so would not make the regulator's order "perverse" or "wanting of jurisdiction".In the petition challenging WhatsApp's privacy policy, Central government earlier told the court that the social messaging platform was trying to force its users to consent to the new privacy policy before the data protection bill becomes the law and is obtaining "trick consent".It urged the high court to restrain WhatsApp from implementing its new privacy policy and terms of service. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/privacy-policy-on-hold-till-data-protection-bill-comes-into-force-whatsapp-tells-delhi-hc-280492

Besides, secret assessments related to representatives and candidates of different assembly constituencies along with comments on serious issues of the concerned area were also written on it. The papers also contained critical comments on several government schemes, policies, social and religious issues,” it said.Similarly, the raid at the house of Mani Bhushan, an associate of Singh, here, unearthed a five-page document, in which comments were written in English against public representatives, officials, government schemes and policies, it added.The seized documents contain provocative contents that can promote hatred and dissatisfaction against the government, the FIR said.
