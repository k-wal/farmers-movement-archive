It’s about having a space of one’s own where our thoughts and being are not the instrument of someone else’s purposes. It is an essential component of dignity and agency,” submitted Sharma who had earlier filed PILs in Rafale deal, nullification of Article 370, 2019 Hyderabad police encounter and coal scam.Made by the Israeli software firm NSO Group, Pegasus is said to be capable of infecting smartphones without users’ knowledge and accessing all their data. Reports alleged that several opposition leaders, cabinet ministers, activists and journalists were in the list of the potential targets of Pegasus snooping. Pegasus was not just a surveillance tool but a cyber weapon unleashed on India, the petitioner alleged.Sharma contended that the top court needed to consider if buying of Pegasus software allegedly by central government violated Articles 266(3), 267(2) and 283(2) of the Constitution and attracted sections 408, 409 and 120-B of the IPC and provisions of the Information Technology and the Official Secrets Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-demands-court-monitored-sit-probe-into-pegasus-controversy-286798
22-07-2021||New Delhi||No grievance mechanism for class 10 CBSE students, NGO tells HC||An NGO Thursday told the Delhi High Court that CBSE’s evaluation policy for this year’s Class 10 board examination did not have any grievance mechanism for students.In the hearing before a bench of Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, the NGO—Justice For All—argued that Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) should make an arrangement for uploading the soft copy of the marking scheme followed by schools.Advocate Khagesh Jha, appearing for the NGO which has filed a petition concerning calculation of marks of class 10 students of CBSE-affiliated schools, emphasised that this year the schools were free to have their own marking policy.He stated that a student has no way to know how he/she was marked and thus like previous years, students should have access to the documents based on which evaluation is done.  “I have no marking scheme. I have no policy document or the evaluation sheet. Earlier there was a system and there was a process,” he submitted.The advocate added that in the absence of any policy on record, a student would not even be able approach the high court for any grievance redressal.“I have no document to know that if I got 19 marks, was it human error or some arbitrary policy of school,” he stated.Jha also objected to using historical background of a school as a factor in the marking scheme for class 10 students.“It affects my highest marks. If 30% students (in a school) failed last year, this year also 30% students are bound to fail even without writing the exam”, he explained as he submitted that this rule is most harmful to schools having children from slums and other economically backward areas.However, the court responded that there was no direction from CBSE to schools to “follow the same pattern”.“There is no direction that you follow the exact pattern. It (CBSE policy) just says you keep in mind. Read the policy.” The advocate clarified that he was not alleging any abuse of power by the CBSE but only sought to iron out the issues arising out of this year’s evaluation system.Hearing on the petition will continue on July 29.The high court had on June 2 sought response of the Centre, Delhi government and CBSE on the NGO’s petition claiming that the policy of the board for calculating marks of class 10 students based on the internal assessment by schools was unconstitutional and required to be modified.In its petition, the NGO has said: “The policy of moderating the average marks assessed by the school, based on the historical performance of the previous average result of the school, in terms of the best overall performance of the school would be injustice to the students as the performance of school is not relatable in any manner with the performance of the student.” It has also said moderating the marks in consonance with the overall average score of the district, national and state average “was absolutely unreasonable, illogical and punitive for the students of a school which would appear in the board exams for the first time”, with no previous data of performance.The NGO has alleged that it can also lead to the manipulation of marks and exploitation, extortion of the students and parents.

Attempts to change status quo last year, which also disregarded commitments under the 1993 and 1996 agreements, have inevitably affected ties. It was, therefore, in mutual interest that the two sides work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh, while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-pushes-for-military-talks-with-china-on-lac-pullback-286791

Muraleedharan said during the unprecedented crisis, the international community came forward with offers of solidarity and assistance for specific medicines and equipment that were not immediately available in the country.He said that foreign materials from 52 countries have been received to date including from government to government, private to government, private to private, Indian community associations and companies."Donations were cleared through the Inter-Ministerial Committee that includes representatives of Ministry of Health, MEA, Niti Aayog, DPIIT, MHA, MoHFW, etc," the Minister said.Giving details of the assistance received, the minister said India received 27,116 oxygen cylinders, 29,327 oxygen concentrators, 48 Oxygen PSA plants and 19,375 ventilators from 52 foreign nations during the second Covid-19 wave.The government also received 33,30,187 Favipiravir, 11,06,940 Remdesiver, 5,10,245 Tocilizumab from the foreign nations. A total of 19,88,985 rapid diagnostic kit was received during the Covid wave.In February, when India had gotten Covid-19 under control from the peak of the first wave last year, a second wave of the virus hit the country with existing health infrastructure unable to cope up with the rise in cases.On the ground, it was a heart-wrenching tragedy. Across the country, hospitals ran out of basic medical supplies and many patients died due to oxygen shortage. Family members were driving from clinic to clinic, frantically searching for ICU beds. Apart from that, people were looking for leads across the country for normal beds with oxygen facilities.The government then sought help from the international community for oxygen supply. Indian Air Force transport planes were pressed into service, Indian Navy warships were sent to friendly countries to get the required medical needs of the time.Eventually, the government started putting in all efforts to control the situation. And in June, the situation started improving with the number of cases coming down.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/52-countries-helped-india-during-2nd-wave-of-covid-centre-286785

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a “red alert” for the state saying, “very heavy to extremely heavy” rain was expected over the next three days.Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) has made special teams of officials to keep a close watch on the situation as most dams and reservoirs are already full and could threaten neighbouring populations in a spillover. It is expected that the rainfall would cause flooding in low-lying areas, water pooling on roads, and seasonal crops would be submerged.People of Hyderabad, who are yet to come to terms with the October 2020 flooding in the state, have panicked after the IMD predicted heavy rains. Similar predictions of heavy rains are also for Nalgonda, Suryapet, Janagaon, Yadadri Bhuvangiri, Rangareddy, Hyderabad, Medchal Malkajgiri, Vikarabad, Sangareddy and Medak districts. Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds with speeds up to 30-40 kph are also expected.“A cyclonic circulation lays over northwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood and extends up to 3.1 km to 7.6 km above mean sea level tilting southwestwards with height. Under this influence, a low-pressure area is very likely to form over northwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood during the next 48 hours, causing widespread rainfall in the next two-three days,” said IMD Hyderabad said in a statement signed by scientist K Naga Ratna.Besides the Southwest monsoon being vigorous over the state, a low-pressure area has formed over Northwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood under the influence of an existing cyclonic circulation over the same region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/heavy-rains-throw-life-out-of-gear-in-telangana-imd-issues-red-alert-286782

The data is “irrefutably linked to potential targets” of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, it said.The latest set of revelations touched India when it emerged that for two years, the closest circle of advisers around the Dalai Lama were potential targets of surveillance by a client of the Israeli spyware firm NSO Group.The numbers include that of the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorji, fled India in 2018 without the knowledge of the Indian intelligence services.The Dalai Lama’s envoy in New Delhi, Tempa Tsering, senior aides Tenzin Taklha, Chimmey Rigzen, Samdhong Rinpoche and Lobsang Sangay were also on the list.French PM Jean Castex said the President had “ordered a series of investigations’’ in order to “look at this very closely, given the potential seriousness.’’ The mobile phone of a former Minister has shown digital traces of activity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-project-dalai-lamas-inner-circle-may-have-been-targeted-286778

Many over-the-top allegations made around this story,” he said. “The press reports appeared a day before the monsoon session of Parliament. This can’t be a coincidence.”“In the past, similar claims were made regarding the use of Pegasus.... Those claims had no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties,” he added.Amid the ruckus, Vaishnaw implored all members of the House to “examine the issue on facts and logic”.The phone numbers of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and others were said to be the potential targets of surveillance using the Pegasus spyware, which allows clients to infiltrate phones and monitor text messages, camera feeds and microphones.TMC MP accuses Union minister Puri of verbally abusing himTMC MP Shantanu Sen has alleged that Union Minister Hardeep Puri verbally abused him in the Rajya Sabha and was on the verge of physically assaulting him before he was rescued by his colleagues.Sen, who snatched and tore Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw’s speech on the Pegasus issue as he was reading it out in the Rajya Sabha, claimed Puri even gesticulated rudely at him.“The union minister threatened me and abused me. He was about to assault me when my other colleagues came to my rescue,” alleged Sen in a press conference.

22-07-2021||New Delhi||14 post-Covid patients suffer large abscesses in liver, one dies: Ganga Ram hospital||Fourteen post-Covid patients, eight of whom had received steroids during treatment, were diagnosed with “unusually large” and multiple liver abscesses, and one of them died due to massive bleeding in abdomen, authorities at a leading private hospital here said on Thursday.Liver abscess (pus formation in liver) is commonly caused by a parasite known as entamoeba histolytica which is transmitted through contaminated food and water, doctors said.These patients, ten men and four women in the age group of 28-74, were brought to the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in the last two months with “unusual manifestations”, doctors said.“We saw for the first time in last two months unusually large and multiple liver abscesses in fourteen patients after recovery from COVID-19 infection,” a spokesperson of the facility said.Doctors suspect that poor nutrition and use of steroids could have led to pus formation and compromised their livers.“What we found unusual was that after recovery from Covid, patients who were otherwise immunocompetent, within 22 days had large areas of both lobes of liver filled with pus at multiple locations, requiring drainage and hospitalisation,” according to Dr Anil Arora, chairman, institute of liver gastroenterology and pancreaticobiliary sciences, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.While lives if 13 of these patients could be saved, one patient with large multiple abscesses died due to massive bleeding in abdomen after rupture of abscess in the abdominal cavity, he said, adding the rest are stable and have been discharged.Doctors said all the patients had “fever and upper abdominal pain and three of them also had associated lower GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding with black-coloured stool”.Eight of these patients had received steroids for the management of COVID-19 symptoms, Arora said.Six patients had multiple large abscesses in both lobes of liver of which five patients had unusually large abscess (more than 8 cm), the largest being 19 cm in size, the doctor said.“Three patients who had blood during stool discharge, showed ulcers in large intestine, which were detected by colonoscopy. Median duration between COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis of liver abscess was 22 days. Thirteen out of fourteen patients were successfully treated with antibiotics, Metronidazole medications and drainage of pus from the liver,” Arora added.In this pandemic time, a high index of suspicion of such infections in the form of fever and pain in right abdomen merits a timely intervention in the form of an early diagnosis and effective medical therapy can effectively save uncalled misery and avoidable hospitalization in these patients, said Dr Praveen Sharma, senior consultant, gastroenterology, at the hospital.“We believe that suppression of immunity by COVID-19 infection along with use of steroids to treat Covid infection per se, low index of suspicion for liver abscess and delay in treatment in patients recuperating from coronavirus infection probably led to development of multiple and large abscesses in liver,” Arora said.Entamoeba histolytica is a common parasite in countries with poor sanitation services. This parasite causes amoebiasis, an intestinal infection that is also called amoebic dysentery, the doctors said.After an infection has occurred, the parasite may be carried by the bloodstream from the intestines to the liver and causes liver abscess. Normally these abscesses are single and not very large and picked up early on routine ultrasonography of the abdomen as a part of work-up for fever and associated symptoms in immunocompetent patients, they said.Poor nutrition, immunocompromised status (like in HIV and cancer patients) and steroid use predisposes patients to these infections by amoeba causing liver abscesses, doctors said.

22-07-2021||London||UK Carrier Strike Group starts maritime exercises with Indian Navy||The United Kingdom’s Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 2021, led by the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, has met up with the Indian Navy in the Bay of Bengal for three days of complex maritime interactions, the British government said on Thursday.The maritime partnership exercise between the Indian Navy and the Royal Navy will see the two navies conducting a range of multi-ship, air, sea and sub-surface maritime evolutions, as well as close quarter manoeuvring.This enables both forces to advance their interoperability and cooperation ahead of further exercises when the CSG returns to the Indian Ocean in the autumn, the UK government said.The combined forces for the exercises equate to 10 ships, two submarines, approximately 20 aircraft and almost 4,000 personnel.“This is a month that will see the Royal Navy and Indian Navy meet and work together in two oceans – beginning in the Indian Ocean as the UK Carrier Strike Group arrives for the first of multiple UK-India exercises and events,” said Admiral Sir Tony Radaki, First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy.“Later this summer, both will participate in a separate exercise in the Atlantic Ocean. The deployment is proof of the strength, energy and significance of the growing relationship between our navies,” he said.An Indian warship will also exercise with the Royal Navy off the coast of the UK in August.“The UK and India are key defence partners and the Carrier Strike Group’s deployment is a symbol of Global Britain in action, showcasing our commitment to India, the Indo-Pacific region, and confronting threats to international order,” said Vice Admiral Sir Ben Key, the UK’s Chief of Joint Operations.According to the UK Foreign Office, both the UK and India are in the midst of a carrier renaissance, with the CSG spearheading the UK’s Joint Expeditionary capability.The joint endeavour is aimed at providing “tangible” security to friendly countries and a credible deterrence to those who seek to undermine global security.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, Commander United Kingdom Carrier Strike Group, added: “As HMS Queen Elizabeth and her Carrier Strike Group cross the Indian Ocean, it is only natural that we should exercise with the Indian Navy.“At the strategic level, the exercise is a muscular expression of the closer defence partnership that Prime Ministers Johnson and Modi envisaged when they agreed the UK-India Roadmap 2030 earlier this year.”         As part of its maiden operational deployment, the CSG will sail over 26,000 nautical miles, engaging with 40 countries from the Mediterranean to the Indo-Pacific and back again.The fifth generation HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier, at 65,000 tonnes, is said to be the largest surface vessel ever constructed in the UK and leads six Royal Navy ships, a Royal Navy submarine, a US Navy destroyer and a frigate from the Netherlands in one of the largest concentration of maritime and air power from the UK.The deployment has been termed a “step-change” in the UK’s engagement in the Indo-Pacific region, covering aspects of defending democratic values, tackling shared threats and seizing new trade opportunities.

22-07-2021||New Delhi||Rules amended for ex-officials writing books to prevent 'loss to the country': Govt||The government on Thursday said that the rules have recently been changed for retired officers planning to write on “sensitive subjects” pertaining to their erstwhile organizations to prevent “a loss to the country”.Responding to a written question asked in the Rajya Sabha Minister of State (MoS) for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Jitendra Singh said, “Stakeholders were consulted while amending Rule 8 of Central Civil Services (Pension) Amendment Rules, 2021 on July 1, 2021, it was notified in The Gazette of India.”According to the amendment the government prohibited retired officials of “security and intelligence organizations” from publishing anything related to “domain of the organisation, including reference or information about any personnel and his designation, and expertise or knowledge gained by virtue of working in that organisation” without prior clearance from the head of the organisation. The pension of the officer could be withheld if he did so.The Minister said that it was up to the official to decide whether the published material falls in the prescribed prohibited categories or not and if the officer felt that the material he is going to publish does not fall in the prohibited category then he could publish it without any prior approval from the government.“Later on, in case the Government comes to a conclusion that the published material comes or falls under the category of prohibited material, a loss to the country would have already happened. To prevent such situations, the current amendment has been made,” Singh said, explaining the rationale behind the decision.Many retired officers have expressed concern over the said rules, terming them unreasonable and said it was an effort to muzzle them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rules-amended-for-ex-officials-writing-books-to-prevent-loss-to-the-country-govt-286752

Kumar was arrested along with co-accused Ajay Kumar on May 23 from outer Delhi's Mundka area.He and his associates allegedly assaulted wrestler Sagar Dhankar and two of his friends Sonu and Amit Kumar on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over a property dispute.Dhankar, 23, succumbed to injuries later.Kumar, who is facing charges of murder, culpable homicide and kidnapping, was shifted to Tihar jail number 2 from Mandoli jail where he was lodged earlier.Police said 12 accused, including Kumar, have so far been arrested in connection with the Chhatrasal Stadium brawl case.The police have claimed that Kumar is the "main culprit and mastermind" of the murder and said there is electronic evidence in which he and his associates could be seen beating Dhankar.Last month, a Delhi court had dismissed an application filed by Kumar, seeking special food and supplements in the prison, saying that they are not the "essential need or necessity".Kumar had moved the Rohini court seeking special food, supplements and exercise bands in the prison, asserting that these are extremely necessary for him to maintain his health and performance. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prison-authorities-allow-sushil-kumar-to-watch-tv-ahead-of-tokyo-olympics-286743

22-07-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks Uniform Code for Religious, Charitable Endowments||A PIL was filed in the Supreme Court on Thursday seeking Uniform Code for Religious and Charitable Endowments and referred to the control of authorities on Hindu temples across the country, unlike certain other groups which are allowed to manage their own institutions.The plea filed by advocate and BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay contended that Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs should have similar rights to establish, manage and maintain their religious places like Muslims, Parsis and Christians, and the State cannot abridge this right.“It is submitted that the right to manage institutions conferred under Articles 26 is a natural right for all communities. But Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs have been denied this privilege,” said the plea filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey. The PIL stated that there are approximately four lakh temples out of nine Lakh temples across the country which are under government control. There is not a single Church or Mosque related religious body where any control or interference of government is seen, it said, added that as far as tax paying or endowments is concerned there is no payment of tax from Churches and Mosques in the country. "And due to the same reasons mentioned there is a need to change the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HRCE) Act, 1951 and other similar acts enacted by the States from time to time."This Act gives the government permission to control the temples as well the properties of the temples. There is almost 13 to 18 per cent of the service charge levied over the temples. There are almost 15 States in our nation which take control over the Hindu religious institutions. When the service charges are implemented over temples, it basically takes away the community rights as well as resources that are protecting its interests," the plea said.The petition said that Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs have similar rights to acquire and administer movable-immovable properties of their religious places like Muslims and Christians and the state cannot abridge that.All the Laws made to acquire and administer movable-immovable properties of temples-gurudwaras are arbitrary, irrational and offend Articles 14, 15, 26. Hence, void and inoperative, the petition stated."If necessary, the Court may direct the Centre or Law Commission of India to draft a 'Common Charter for Religious and Charitable Institutions' and 'Uniform Code for Religious and Charitable Endowments'," the plea said.

Singh said that Khatri was arrested on the basis of the complaint by the Canadian citizen who alleged that he misrepresented himself as a chairman of "All India Handicraft Association" and also proprietor of "TrimurtiImpex" and duped him of his 11-12 properties by falsely getting him into a fake partnership for the under-construction hotel in Aerocity.Khatri won the Canadian citizen's confidence with help of forged documents pertaining to deals for the hotel, as well as of the DDA land."Later on coming to India, the Canadian citizen was told by Khatri that the said hotel was not yet completed and was to be sold to some big business house. He said that he would return all his money and other assets, which did not happen even after many remedies and assurances," Singh said.Singh said that during investigation, it was found that Khatri had executed an equity deal with the complainant in 2012, wherein the accused assured him to transfer 50 per cent shares of the five star hotel and in return, the complainant would transfer his 11 properties located in Canada."Since the complainant was a NRI businessman, so he was easily allured based on the misrepresentation of accused. In order to convince the complainant, Khatri had also taken him to the 'construction site' in 2012 and documents of DDA land allotment were also forged," he said.The officer said that it was also misrepresented that the said hotel would be purchased by a big business house and fake papers were prepared by Khatri along with conspirators.Khatri also opened a company in the name of Ruhani Construction in Canada and the properties of complainant was got transferred in its name, Singh said."Thereafter, the properties of complainant was mortgaged at Canada and the loans obtained in lieu of properties were got misappropriated by the accused. Around Rs 5.50 crore was transferred from Ruhani Construction to the proprietorship TrimurtiImpex operated by Khatri," Singh said.During investigation conducted so far, it has been found that Khatri does not have any shareholding in the hotel, he said.He also pointed out that Khatri has opened several proprietorship firms or partnership firms and companies in order to show himself as a big businessman."Khatri created several forged documents and the linkage of forged documents proves that he showed himself as 100 per cent shareholder of the five star hotel," Singh said, adding that Khatri was also involved in other crimes. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-man-arrested-for-duping-canadian-citizen-of-crores-286721

But the farmer unions insisted only on the repeal of the farm laws,” he said.The Congress MPs wanted to know whether the government was “inclined to repeal the three farm laws” and “whether any specific proposals to meet the demands of the farmers are being discussed”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-ready-for-talks-as-farmers-protest-at-delhis-jantar-mantar-286707

22-07-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India still a tough place to do business: US State Dept||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 22Despite the major gains in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings, India remains a difficult place to do business and additional economic reforms are necessary to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth, says the US State Department’s latest report on the investment climate in the country.It noted that India’s economic growth has been strong in recent years, driven by private consumption and buoyed by reduced external vulnerabilities and key structural reforms. Similarly, rising government investment has played an important role in keeping the economy growing. However, India’s private sector investment has not increased, despite having the fastest growing major economy tag in the world. While foreign direct investment (FDI) into India increased significantly during the first two years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s term, the rate of growth has slowed over the past year.Non-performing assets continue to hold back banks’ profits and restrict their lending but relatively low inflation, weak credit demand, and strong intervention from the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), helped stabilise credit markets and mitigate fallout. Demographic increases mean India must generate over one crore new jobs every year – a challenge for the economy and policymakers.  While difficult to measure, given the large size of the informal economy, several recent studies, in 2017-18 suggest India’s unemployment rate has risen significantly to 6.1 per cent since the last official employment report was released in 2012. The Government, led by PM Modi’s BJP, actively courts foreign investment. In 2017, it implemented moderate reforms aimed at easing investments in such sectors as single brand retail, pharmaceutical, and private security. The Modi government also introduced two rounds of tariff increases in 2018, ostensibly in response to India’s large trade deficit with China, and related balance of payment concerns.“Whatever the actual intent, these tariff increases disrupted the supply chains of both domestic industry and foreign investors and led to the cancellation of both new investments and expansions of existing investments in India,” said the report.In April 2018, the RBI announced, “without prior stakeholder consultation”, that all payment system providers must store their Indian transaction data only in India. “The policy overwhelmingly and disproportionately affects US companies” that currently dominate the Indian payments market and depend on the free flow of data to achieve economies of scale and to protect customers by providing global real-time monitoring and analysis of fraud trends and cyber-security.The US companies have begun to implement the mandate, though at “great cost and potential damage to the long-term security of their Indian customer base”, who will receive fewer services and no longer benefit from global fraud detection.The draft Personal Data Protection Bill contained restrictions on cross-border transfer of personal data, stipulating that personal data that are considered “critical” can only be stored in India.While Indian officials argue these restrictions were mere “clarifications” of the existing policy, the new guidelines constituted a major regulatory change that created several extensive new regulatory requirements and onerous compliance procedures.“The disruption to foreign investors’ businesses was exacerbated by the refusal to extend the February 1, 2019 deadline for implementation,” it said.According to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report, it takes an average of nearly four years to resolve a commercial dispute in India, the third longest rate in the world. Indian courts are understaffed and lack the technology necessary to resolve an enormous backlog of pending cases—estimated by the UN at 30 million-40 million cases nationwide, it noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-still-a-tough-place-to-do-business-us-state-dept-286687

22-07-2021||Chennai||Chennai schools launch online complaint boxes against sexual offences||After a couple of teachers were arrested following complaints from students that they were sexually assaulted in schools and even during online classes, the Chennai schools have launched virtual complaint boxes to complain against misbehaving teachers.Schools have created Google forms on their websites to lodge complaints and some schools have created exclusive email IDs for registering complaints. While the virtual complaint boxes were launched a couple of days ago, no school has yet reported a case relating to the Prevention of Children Against Sexual Offenses(Pocso) Act.Justice P. Velmurugan of the Madras High Court has on July 19 directed the Tamil Nadu state government to install complaint boxes in schools for children to lodge complaints against sexual abuse on school premises.The Judge also said that this would help students come forward without any hesitation to lodge complaints against the top functionaries in the school including the managing committee, teaching, and non-teaching staff.Justice Velmurugan also ordered that the keys of the complaint boxes have to be in the custody of the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and the agency should check the complaint boxes kept in schools every week.The District Social Welfare Officer must also be with the DLSA during the inspection of these boxes, the court ruled.The complaints if any should be forwarded to the police.The judge also directed to constitute district level committees comprising officials from DLSA, Social Welfare department, women police officers, psychiatrists and physicians from government hospitals to support and help children in need of emotional backing.The directive was given while confirming the conviction imposed by a Mahila court in Salem against pastor S. Jayaseelan for having abused a school girl in 2013.Meanwhile, principal of Velammal Vidyalaya in Chennai, Shyamala Subbu told IANS, " We have created strong monitoring systems to make children safe and added that the school has a silent teacher or observer who attends every online class and whose presence and identity is not revealed. The observer reports to the superiors as to how classes are being taken."However, Child Rights activists and NGOs said that while complaint boxes are put up in schools, they are used rarely. Sujit Kumar Menon, Director, Thanal, an NGO, working among Children, told IANS, "Schools have to report Pocso cases if any to the law enforcement agencies and not to conduct their own investigations.The Pocso cases are to be properly taken up as this affects the child's physical and psychological behaviour in the long run. Help from professionals should be immediately sought."— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chennai-schools-launch-online-complaint-boxes-against-sexual-offences-286679

Before leaving, Benny would cook for the three women, and do the same in return.Cleaning the rooms and other chores were also done by the father-son duo all these months, as the women would only venture out to relieve themselves."These three feared that if they contract Covid, they cannot afford treatment in the hospital as they were poor. So they thought it is better not to come out and stay in the home itself," he said.According to the police, nobody suspected what was happening because the men would come out of the house. Otherwise, the police official said the state's ward and village volunteer system would have detected what was happening, considering one volunteer has been tasked to take government schemes to 50 households.After tolerating his mother and sisters' behaviour for a long time, Chinnababu finally approached the police.Police said that the women didn't heed the word of Benny as well as Chinnababu."The father-son took the matter to mahila police in the village secretariat. From them, we received the information, leading the sub-inspector to visit and counsel them," the officer said.Following this, the three women were shifted to a hospital in Razole and are said to be stable now, though malnourished and feeble.All these 15 months, the three women did not even bathe, and when they finally emerged, their hair was in a bad state too. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-family-stays-locked-in-for-15-months-read-to-know-why-286678

Binoy Vishwam of the CPI has already given notice for the privilege motion.The Congress on Wednesday had said that it will take action. Speaking to the media, Congress leader K.C. Venugopal said that he will move a privilege notice against the minister."This is a blind and unconcerned government. People have seen how many of their near and dear ones have died because of lack of oxygen," the Congress leader said.Venugopal, on whose question the minister had replied in the House, said everyone has seen how people died due to a shortage of oxygen in several states, including the national capital."Actually, the minister misled the House and I will move a privilege notice against that minister definitely because the minister misguided and misled the House by giving false information," he said.His remarks come after the government informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that no deaths due to lack of oxygen were specifically reported by states and union territories during the second wave of Covid.Pawar in a written reply said, "Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union Health Ministry to all states and UTs. Accordingly, all states and UTs report cases and deaths to the Union Health Ministry on a regular basis. However, no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by states and UTs."

22-07-2021||New Delhi||108-year-old man dies just before SC admits his land dispute case for hearing||A 108-year-old man did not live to see that the Supreme Court has admitted his appeal in a land dispute case he had been pursuing since 1968 and had remained pending before the Bombay High Court for 27 year before being dismissed.On July 12 this year, the apex court agreed to hear the appeal after Sopan Narsinga Gaikwad's counsel pleaded that the delay in filing the appeal may be viewed from the perspective that the aged petitioner belonged to a rural area of Maharashtra and learned of the high court verdict much later, and after that he got stuck due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic.The petitioner's counsel Viraj Kadam told PTI, “Unfortunately, the man, who pursued his case right from trial court to Supreme Court was not alive to hear that his matter has been agreed to be heard."He had expired before the court took up the matter on July 12 but the information about his demise from the rural area came just after the hearing. He will be now represented through legal heirs."     A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hrishikesh Roy has issued notice on the application for condonation of delay of 1,467 days and 267 days in moving the top court against the high court orders dated October 23, 2015 and February 13, 2019.The top court also sought response from opposite parties in eight weeks.  Justice Chandrachud said, “We have to take note of the fact that the petitioner is 108-years-old and moreover the High Court had not dealt with the merit of the case and the matter was dismissed due to non-appearance of the advocates”.The bench said that as the person is from rural area the lawyers concerned may not have been able to trace him after the case was dismissed in 2015.  It took note of the submission made by Kadam for the petitioner that the decree which was passed by the trial court was reversed by the first appellate court and the second appeal before the Bombay High Court was pending since 1988. Kadam submitted that on August 19, 2015, the second appeal was adjourned, and, thereafter, both sets of counsel appeared before the high court on August 22, 2015 and sought an adjournment to seek instructions.“The Second Appeal was adjourned to September 3, 2015, but was eventually taken up on October 23, 2015 and was dismissed in default,” Kadam said. The bench asked whether the petitioner had moved a restoration application to which Kadam said that they had filed an application for condonation of delay caused in filing application for restoration of Second Appeal but it was also dismissed in February 13, 2019.Gaikwad and others had filed second appeal before the high court challenging the judgment dated December 17, 1987 passed by trial court in first appeal at Latur where the decree given to him by the trial court on September 10, 1982, was reversed.Gaikwad had purchased a plot of land in 1968 through a registered sale deed after which he came to know that it was already mortgaged to a bank in lieu of the loan taken by the original owner. When the original owner defaulted on a loan, the bank issued a notice to Gaikwad for attachment over the property.Gaikwad moved the trial court against the original owner and the bank saying that he is a bona fide purchaser of the land and the bank may be asked to recover the loan by selling other properties of the original owner. The trial court accepted the contention of Gaikwad and passed a decree in his favour on September 10, 1982. The original owner moved the first appeal after which the decree was reversed in 1987.Thereafter, Gaikwad moved the high court in the second appeal in 1988, which was dismissed in 2015.

22-07-2021||Mumbai||Rain fury: Train services hit in Maharashtra's Konkan, 6,000 passengers stranded||Nearly 6,000 passengers were stranded as train services on the Konkan Railway route in Maharashtra’s Ratnagiri district were suspended on Thursday after a river overflowed following heavy rain, while incessant downpour badly hit road and rail traffic in several parts of the state, including around Mumbai, as authorities called in NDRF to help the administration in rescue efforts.So far, nine trains have been regulated due to disruption of services on the Konkan Railway (KR) route, meaning they have been either rerouted, short-terminated or cancelled, officials said.Major rivers in Ratnagiri and Raigad districts in the Konkan region are flowing above the danger mark as a result of incessant rain, and the government machinery is in the process of shifting a number of affected people to safer places, authorities said.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray took a review of the situation arising out of the continuous downpour in these two coastal districts, the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.During the meeting, Thackeray said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an alert of heavy rainfall in the coastal region for the next three days.He asked the authorities to remain alert and keep monitoring the levels of overflowing rivers and evacuate residents to safer places.Konkan Railway (KR) officals said stranded trains were at safe locations on different stations and the passengers in them were also safe and they were being provided food and water.Water level at the Vashishti river bridge between Chiplun and Kamathe stations in Ratnagiri has risen above the danger mark after the heavy downpour, an official said.“In view of the safety of passengers, train services in this section are suspended temporarily,” he said.According to rail officials, 5,500-6,000 passengers were stranded in trains which were regulated at various stations on the 756-km—long KR route, which is spread across three states - Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka - and passes through tough terrain.The Konkan Railway informed that due to the flood situation at Chiplun, so far nine long distance trains have been regulated.Out of these, the Dadar-Sawantwadi special train was regulated at Chiplun station and the CSMT-Madgaon Janshatabdi special train at Khed station. Konkan Railway spokesperson Girish Karandikar said passengers in these trains were safe.“We have made arrangements to provide tea, snacks and water to all the stranded passengers,” Karandikar said.Major rivers in Ratnagiri district, including Jagbudi, Vashishti, Kodavali, Shastri, Bav are flowing above the danger level.As a result, Khed, Chiplun, Lanja, Rajapur, Sangameshwar towns and nearby areas have been affected and residents are being shifted to safer places, the CMO said.Similarly, in neighbouring Raigad district, rivers including Kundalika, Amba, Savitri, Patalganga, Gadhi, Ulhas rivers are flowing above danger level, the CMO said in a statement.During the review meeting, Thackeray also took stock of the overflowing rivers in Ratnagiri and Raigad districts.Meanwhile, the CMO said Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill station in Satara district, has received 480 mm rainfall in 24 hours, due to which the water level of Savitri and other rivers was rising.Train services of the Central Railway in the Kasara Ghat section of Maharashtra’s Thane district and near Lonavala hill town in Pune district adjoining Mumbai were also severely affected after heavy rains caused flooding, washing out of tracks, boulder crashes and mudslides in that region, officials said.The train traffic between CSMT in south Mumbai and Kasara, over 100 km away, resumed on Thursday afternoon, 17 hours after a part of the track was washed away due to torrential rains, an official said.The traffic of long-distance trains would take some time to resume and buses have been arranged to ferry the stranded passengers, he added.Train services between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kasara were restored around 3 pm, said Shivaji Sutar, chief spoksperson, CR.As it rained heavily through the night, incidents of mudslide and boulder fall were reported at five or six locations in the 14 km Ghat (hill) stretch between Kasara and Igatpuri.Trains for North and East India from Mumbai travel through the Kasara Ghat.Three trains which were stuck in the Kasara Ghat section were taken to Igatpuri, while the CR arranged buses of the MSRTC, the state transport undertaking, ferry stranded passengers.Several roads in Kolhapur district, including a few state highways, have been shut for traffic as some of the stretches have gone under water as a result of incessant rains in the district over the past two days, officials said.In the 24-hour period that ended 8 am on Thursday, this western Maharashtra district recorded 93 mm rainfall, they said.The water level of Kolhapur’s Panchganga river recorded at the Rajaram weir has crossed the “warning level”, the district disaster management cell said.“There are three district roads that have seen closure as the rainwater has submerged of the stretches. In several rural areas, the bridges have gone under water, due to the traffic movement has been shut. A few state highways going through the district have also been affected,” an official said.The catchment areas of several dams in the region witnessed heavy rainfall in the last 48 hours, which led to rise in the water level of these reservoirs.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has earlier said that it has deployed nine rescue teams in Maharashtra and two of them have been sent to Kolhapur district.One of it will undertake rescue or preventive evacuation in the flood-prone Shirol tehsil, while the other one will conduct rescue work in Kolhapur city, it has said.Mumbai, its neighbouring Thane and Palghar and other districts in the Konkan region have been witnessing heavy downpour since the last few days, leading to inundation at several places and disruption of rail and road transport services.Water level of many rivers has risen and crossed the danger mark at some places.An official statement issued by the NDRF said four of its teams have been deployed in Mumbai, and one each in Thane and Palghar districts.Some villages in the Sahapur taluka of Thane were marooned, a local official earlier said, adding authorities with the help of the NDRF rescued hundreds of people from those places.Incidents of water-logging leaving people stranded were also reported from Mumbra, Bhiwandi, Titwala and Kasara areas of Thane district.Various places in Vasai, Virar and other locations in Palghar also witnessed flooding, but no loss of life was reported so far, officials said.Besides, people stranded in some inundated areas of Kasara and Titwala in Thane were also shifted to zilla parishad schools, they said.Thane’s regional disaster management cell chief Santosh Kadam said they received 34 calls of tree falls in the city, but no one was injured in these incidents.Water entered some houses in Thane’s Ganesh Nagar in the wee hours and around 40 people were later rescued from there by the disaster response teams, Kadam said.The Nashik-Jawhar route was closed following a landslide and operations there are likely to resume by Thursday evening, Palghar Collector Dr Manik Gursal said in a message.Various places witnessed flooding in Vasai, Virar and other locations in Palghar, but no loss of life was reported so far, officials said.

22-07-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||New UNGA President-elect arrives in New Delhi, India's UN representative holds talks with Volkan Bozkir||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 22Indian preparations for the forthcoming crucial sessions of the United Nations got into high gear with a meeting between President of the UN General Assembly (PGA) Volkan Bozkir and India’s Permanent Representative at the UN TS Tirumurti, who will be UNSC president for the month of August.At the same time, the new President-elect of the UNGA (PGA) President Abdulla Shahid arrived here on an official visit. Bozkir will demit office and the India-backed Shahid will take over as UNGA President, beginning with the high-level segment of UN in September.Tirumurti briefed Bozkir on India’s planned activities during its Presidency. It will focus on high-level open debates on maritime security, and on technology and peacekeeping, as well as a high-level briefing on the threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, said the readout of the meeting.The past year was tough for India with the Turkish diplomat as UNGA President since Ankara has close relations with Pakistan. Bozkir ruffled many feathers here by stating that it was Pakistan’s “duty” to raise the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in the United Nations “more strongly”. More galling for India, the comments were made during his visit to Islamabad.The MEA had countered his comments saying, “when an incumbent president of the UN General Assembly makes misleading and prejudiced remarks, he does great disservice to the office he occupies’’.However, there is little possibility of Shahid, currently Foreign Minister of the Maldives, visiting Islamabad since his government believes there is a Pakistani hand in the anti-India sentiments being whipped up currently in the Maldives.India is the first country that Abdulla Shahid is visiting in his official capacity as PGA-Elect since his election on June 7. Shahid, though, is visiting New Delhi in both his avatars. As Foreign Minister, he will hold talks with his counterpart S Jaishankar on high- impact community projects planned by India in the Maldives. As PGA-elect, he will “exchange views on several global challenges that the UN is currently seized with,” said an MEA release.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had visited New York a week back and met Bozkir. “We will be president of the UNSC in the month of August. We will make the best of our two-year term in the UNSC,” he had observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-unga-president-elect-arrives-in-new-delhi-indias-un-representative-holds-talks-with%C2%A0volkan-bozkir-286659

Earlier too, he was not Chief Minister for the complete term,” Siddalinga Swamiji said.He said all that the CM had said was that the PM, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP cheif JP Nadda had shown special care towards him, and he was the only one who was given the exception to continue in the top post despite completing 75 years of age. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lingayat-pontiffs-rally-behind-karnataka-chief-minister-bs-yediyurappa-286636

Among the States, the highest number of sedition cases (54) was registered in Assam, followed by Jharkhand (40), Haryana (35), Karnataka (30), Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir and Kerala (25 each), and Uttar Pradesh (17),” Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) – an NGO stated. RRAG Director Suhas Chakma said there has been a 98% increase in sedition cases from 2014 (47 cases) to 2019 (98 cases).Recently, the Supreme Court had sought to know from the Centre if the law on sedition was still needed after almost 75 years of independence? A Bench led by CJI NV Ramana had pointed out that sedition law was used by British against Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak and was now being misused with no accountability from the government. “The government has repealed a number of laws...I don’t know why you aren’t looking into it,” the CJI had wondered.“The data collated by the NCRB does not appear to reflect the actual number of sedition cases filed in the country. For example, the NCRB data stated that only 19 sedition cases were filed in Jharkhand during 2017 (1 case) and 2018 (18 cases) while the Jharkhand Police had filed 30 FIRs/cases against about 200 named accused and more than 10,000 unnamed people involved in the Pathalgadi movement of 2017-18.” Chakma said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abuse-of-sedition-law-assam-tops-the-list-ngo-wants-it-repealed-286635

Reacting to Patra’s charges, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the state did not have a record of deaths attributable to oxygen shortage because the Centre had not given a nod to the proposed panel to probe such fatalities.“The Centre is hiding its faults. Mismanagement and changes in oxygen distribution policy after April 13 led to shortages of oxygen and caused a disaster nationally,” said Sisodia.Echoing him, Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain asked: “If that (BJP’s account) was true, why would one hospital after another move the Delhi High Court for relief?” Across April and May, several Delhi hospitals sent out SOS calls regarding shrinking oxygen supplies and many of them reported deaths. Congress leader Priyanka Vadra also slammed the Centre, saying deaths occurred because the government exported oxygen and did not arrange proper transportation.While Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut termed as insensitive the Centre’s reply to Parliament that “states and UTs had not reported any specific deaths related to oxygen shortage”, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope admitted today that the state did not report any oxygen-related death.“The Maharashtra Government never reported any death due to shortage of oxygen during the second wave,” Tope said.On 22 patients dying after disruptions in oxygen supply at a Nashik hospital, Tope said a probe would be held to see if negligence caused a leakage in the oxygen storage plant which led to the tragedy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxygen-deaths-citing-maharashtra-chhattisgarh-bjp-blames-states-hiding-failures-says-oppn-286511

It also emerged that several more activists might have been targeted than earlier believed. The countries named by the media houses involved with the “Pegasus project” include UAE, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Rwanda, Azerbaijan and India. None of the countries has confirmed buying the spyware. They claimed to have identified some of the governments believed to be responsible for selecting individual numbers by “closely examining the patterns of selection”.The NSO Group, which sells the Pegasus spyware only to “trusted countries”, insisted that the purported database of 50,000 numbers had no relevance to the company. The fact that a number appeared on the list did not indicate that it was selected for surveillance using Pegasus, it countered.Amnesty International’s Security Lab claimed to have done forensics on 67 phones belonging to human rights activists, journalists and lawyers and found 37 might have been affected. It could not lay its hands on the phones of the leaders named in order to conduct digital forensics. It cannot be, therefore, conclusively established if the said phones were hacked or infected.The media organisations behind the expose, however, suggest that the appearance of the numbers on the list showed that they were persons of interest to a client of the NSO Group.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-spyware-10-pms-3-presidents-potential-targets-says-report-286473

Can’t you (SC) take suo motu cognisance as all phones are tapped? Please set up a panel to probe. Only judiciary can save the country,” she said, appealing to the apex court to come to the nation’s aid.The Chief Minister said she was unable to speak to Pawar, Chidambaram or other opposition leaders or chief ministers as all of them were allegedly being snooped and spied on by the Centre. “But snooping on us won’t save them in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,” she said.The Chief Minister said she would be coming to Delhi next week and if Chidambaram and Pawar could convene the meeting on July 27 or during the next two days, she would attend it and “talk about where the country was heading”.Chidambaram and Pawar were among the opposition leaders who had assembled at the Constitution Club in New Delhi where the Trinamool Congress had organised live-screening of Mamata’s address from Kolkata. Others present included Samajwadi Party MPs Ram Gopal Yadav and Jaya Bachchan; Manoj Jha (RJD), Priyanka Chaturvedi (Shiv Sena) and Balwinder Singh Bhunder (SAD).Mamata alleged her phone was tapped too. “I cannot talk to Sharad Pawar, the Delhi Chief Minister or Odisha Chief Minister... I have put sticking plaster on my phone camera. This government (central) should be plastered too,” she said.Attacking Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah over the scandal, she said, “Modiji, I have nothing against you personally. But you and your Home Minister are deploying (central) agencies against opposition leaders. You are misusing the agencies.”Editors Guild demands urgent SC-led inquiryNew Delhi: The Editors Guild of India today demanded an urgent and independent inquiry under the aegis of the Supreme Court into the snooping charges. “We also demand that this inquiry committee should include people of impeccable credibility from different walks of life—including journalists and civil society—so that it can independently investigate facts around the extent and intent of snooping using the services of Pegasus,” the Guild said.

No suspected cases had been found in Gurugram yet nor had the nurses or doctors who treated the child reported any symptoms, said the health ministry today.Read also“An 11-year-old child has been reported as the first human case of H5N1 from Gurugram, Haryana. He was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia at AIIMS paediatrics department in June. Later he developed symptoms of fever, cough and breathing and progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. He was admitted to AIIMS on July 2 and died on July 12 after multi organ dysfunction,” the health ministry said today.Advanced tests by the National Institute of Virology Pune, an ICMR lab, confirmed bird flu (H5N1) in the patient. Currently, whole genome sequencing and virus isolation are in process.The government today said the National Centre for Disease Control received the information about the case on July 16 and the information was communicated immediately to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme State Surveillance Unit, Haryana to initiate an epidemiological investigation into the case.“The matter was also reported to the Animal Husbandry Department of Haryana,” the government said.Based on the available information, the team of doctors and nurses treating the patient are being monitored since July 16 for development of any influenza-like illness with no one reported symptomatic till date, said the health ministry.Family members, close contacts and health care workers are still under surveillance and none have shown any symptoms yet, said a government statement.Contact tracing, an active search for any symptomatic case has been carried out in the hospital and area where the case resided, said the ministry.The government said people in Gurugram had been advised to report any symptomatic case to the health authorities but presently there is no symptomatic individual in the area.The Animal Husbandry Department has also not found any suspected cases of bird flu in the area and has enhanced surveillance in a 10 km zone as a precautionary measure.All about bird fluAvian influenza is caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with avian flu viruses (types H5, H7 H9) have occurred.How humans are infectedInfected birds shed avian influenza virus in their saliva, mucous and faeces. Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when a virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes or nose.SignsConjunctivitis, influenza-like illness, sometimes accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, shortness of breath, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, viral pneumonia, altered mental statusPreventionAvoid sources of exposure. Most human infections with avian influenza A viruses have occurred following direct or close contact with infected poultry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-probing-indias-first-bird-flu-case-in-humans-no-suspects-so-far-centre-286339

The missile was launched from a man-portable launcher integrated with thermal site and the target was mimicking a tank.The missile hit the target in direct attack mode and destroyed it with precision. The test has validated the minimum range successfully."All the mission objectives were met. The missile has already been successfully flight tested for the maximum range," DRDO said in a statement.The missile is incorporated with state-of-the-art miniaturised infrared imaging seeker along with advanced avionics.The test brings the development of indigenous third-generation man-portable Anti-Tank Guided Missile close to completion.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has congratulated DRDO and the industry for the successful test.On Tuesday, DRDO had indigenously developed a High Strength Metastable Beta Titanium Alloy that can be used in forging aerospace structures. The metal contains Vanadium, Iron and Aluminium.These alloys are already being used by many developed nations in recent times as a beneficial substitute for the relatively heavier traditional Nickel-Chromium-Molybdenum structural steels, to achieve weight savings.According to DRDO, the high strength beta titanium alloys are unique due to their higher strength, ductility, fatigue, and fracture toughness making them increasingly attractive for aircraft structural applications. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-successfully-flight-tests-indigenous-man-portable-anti-tank-guided-missile-286315

22-07-2021||New Delhi||Private candidates for Class X, XII  must take exams: CBSE||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday announced that Classes 10 and 12 exams for private candidates will be conducted from August 16 to September 15.The board ruled out declaring results of the private candidates on the basis of an alternative assessment policy like that for regular candidates saying neither schools nor CBSE has any previous assessment record for these students."The exams will be conducted from August 16 to September 15 and their result will also be declared in minimum possible time to avoid any difficulty to them in admission in higher education," CBSE Examination Controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said.Earlier in the day, a group of private candidates staged a protest outside the CBSE headquarters alleging disparity between them and regular candidates.The CBSE had cancelled board exams for Classes 10 and 12 this year, and instead asked schools to rely on special assessment policy to help calculate results. This criteria only applies to students taking the exams through schools. The board also extended schools' deadlines to help calculate Class 12 exams. The deadline has now been extended by three days from July 22 to July 25, examination controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said."With the last date for finalising the results approaching fast, the teachers are panicky and committing mistakes and sending request (sic) to CBSE to rectify these. CBSE is well aware about (sic) the constraints and problems faced by the schools and teachers," Bhardwaj said in an official order."Accordingly, CBSE has decided to extend the last date from July 22 to 25. Schools may continue to work towards compiling the result to avoid any last-minute rush. In case any school is left to complete the moderation of marks, the result of such schools will be declared separately," he added.The CBSE, however, did not clarify whether extending the deadline for schools will cause a delay in declaration of results which are due to be declared latest by July 31.— Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-candidates-for-class-x-xii-must-take-exams-cbse-286296
22-07-2021||Kolkata||Modi govt wants to establish ‘surveillance state’: Mamata Banerjee||Latching on to the Pegasus snooping row, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Wednesday accused the Narendra Modi Government of trying to establish a “surveillance state”.She also asked the Supreme Court to take cognizance of snooping scandal that purportedly targeted politicians, activists, journalists and even judges using the Pegasus spyware, and asked Opposition parties to come together to defeat the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.“The BJP wants to convert a democratic country into a surveillance state rather than a welfare state,” she said addressing the Martyrs’ Day rally in Kolkata online.The TMC observes Martyrs’ Day on July 21 every year to commemorate the killing of 13 people in police firing on a rally of Youth Congress workers against the then Left Front government in 1993 when Banerjee was in the Congress.The TMC supremo also accused the Centre of spending the money collected through tax on fuel and other commodities for spying using a “dangerous software” instead of funding welfare schemes.“I know my phone is being tapped. All Opposition leaders know that our phones are being tapped. I can’t speak to NCP leader Sharad Pawarji or other Opposition leaders or Chief Ministers because we are being snooped and spied on by the Centre. But snooping on us won’t save them in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,” Banerjee told the rally.Slamming the BJP-led NDA government for its “monumental failure” in handling the second wave of the Covid crisis, the TMC supremo termed the saffron party a “highly loaded virus party” which needs to be defeated at any cost.Banerjee thanked leaders of the Congress, NCP, SP, Shiv Sena and several other parties for joining her rally virtually from New Delhi.She said all those opposed to the BJP and its “authoritarian regime” should defeat it.“The BJP has taken the country to darkness, we all have to come forward to take it to new light,” the Bengal leader said.“Khela Hobe” (will play), she declared, renewing the battle cry she made during the state Assembly elections, adding the fight will continue till BJP is ousted from power.

22-07-2021||New Delhi||Opposition tears into Modi govt's 'no death due to oxygen shortage' claim||Opposition parties on Wednesday reacted strongly to the central government's claim in the Rajya Sabha that no deaths due to lack of oxygen were specifically reported by states and UTs during the second Covid-19 wave.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said people whose relatives died due to oxygen shortage during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic should "take the Union government to court".Reacting to it, Raut said, “Many people have died due to oxygen shortage in several states. Those whose relatives (Covid-19 patients) died due to oxygen shortage should take the Union government to court."  No death due to oxygen shortage in Maharashtra: Health minister Tope"The Union government is running away from the truth. I seems it is the effect of Pegasus (Israeli spyware),” the Rajya Sabha member said sarcastically while talking to reporters.The Sena's chief spokesperson further said it needs to be found out whether the people whose relatives died due to lack of oxygen supply believe in the Centre's response in Parliament over the issue.Covid paranoia makes 3 Andhra women stay locked up for 15 monthsDelhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said there have been many deaths due to oxygen shortage in Delhi and many other places across the country."If there was no shortage of oxygen, why did hospitals move court? Hospitals and the media had been flagging oxygen shortage issues daily. Television channels showed that how hospitals were running out of the life-saving gas. It is completely false to say that no one died due to oxygen shortage. There have been many deaths due to oxygen shortage in Delhi and many other places across the country," he said.The Union government on Tuesday said in the Rajya Sabha that there was an unprecedented surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave and it peaked at nearly 9,000 MT compared to 3,095 MT in the first wave, following which the Centre had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution among the states. But there was an unprecedented surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave and it peaked at nearly 9,000 MT compared to 3,095 MT in the first wave following which the Centre had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution among the states, it said.Responding to a question on whether a large number of Covid-19 patients died on roads and hospitals due to acute shortage of oxygen in the second wave, Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar noted that health is a state subject and states and UTs regularly report the number of cases and deaths to the Centre."Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union Health Ministry to all states and UTs."Accordingly, all states and UTs report cases and deaths to the Union Health Ministry on a regular basis. However, no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by states and UTs," Pawar said in a written reply.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday attacked the Centre over its statement that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen during the Covid second wave, alleging that the fatalities happened because the government increased oxygen exports in the pandemic year and did not arrange tankers to transport it.Hitting out at the government, Priyanka Gandhi said, "'No death due to lack of oxygen': Central Government. The deaths happened because -- in the pandemic year, the government increased oxygen exports by about 700 per cent."The Congress general secretary alleged that the deaths happened because the government did not arrange tankers to transport oxygen and ignoring the advice of the empowered group and a parliamentary committee, no arrangement was made to provide oxygen."No initiative was shown in setting up oxygen plants in hospitals," she said.The Congress on Tuesday accused Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar of misleading Parliament by giving "false information" that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen during the second wave.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-tears-into-modi-govts-no-death-due-to-oxygen-shortage-claim-286259
