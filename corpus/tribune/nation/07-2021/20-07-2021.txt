20-07-2021||Farukhabad (UP)||Non-bailable warrant against Salman Khurshid’s wife in misappropriation of funds case||A local court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Louise Khurshid, wife of former Union minister and Congress leader Salman Khurshid, in a case of misappropriation of over Rs 71 lakh received in central grants by Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust run by her.Chief Judicial Magistrate Praveen Kumar Tyagi issued the non-bailable warrant against Louise and Trust secretary Athar Farooqui and fixed August 16 as the next date for hearing     In March 2010, the Trust had received a grant of Rs 71.50 lakh from the central government for the distribution of wheelchairs, tricycles and hearing aids among physically challenged persons in 17 districts of Uttar Pradesh.Later allegations of corruption and forgery were levelled against the Trust’s office-bearers in 2012 when Khurshid was a minister in the then UPA government. However, the Khurshids had denied any wrongdoing.The Economic Offence Wing started a probe and in June 2017, EOW inspector Ram Shankar Yadav registered an FIR against Lousie Khurshid and Farooqui in Kayamganj police station here.Louise Khurshid was the project director of the Trust.The charge sheet in the case was filed on December 30, 2019.It was alleged that signatures of senior officials of Uttar Pradesh were forged and their fake seals were used to receive grants from the Union government for the welfare of the disabled.The trust had said it had organised camps for differently-abled children across over a dozen districts – Etah, Etawah, Farrukhabad, Kasganj, Mainpuri, Aligarh, Shajahanpur, Meerut, Bareilly, Moradabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Rampur, Sant Kabir Nagar and Allahabad—of UP for the distribution of equipment.It was claimed that equipment was distributed among children and Louise Khurshid had verified it as the director of the Trust in May 2010.However, it was later alleged that camps for the disabled allegedly existed only on paper.

20-07-2021||New Delhi||Farmers to hold ‘Kisan Parliament’ at Jantar Mantar from July 22||Farmers’ union on Tuesday evening said they will hold a ‘Kisan Parliament’ at Jantar Mantar during the ongoing monsoon session and every day from July 22, 200 protesters will go there from the Singhu border.After a meeting with Delhi Police officials earlier in the day, a farm union leader said they will hold peaceful demonstrations at Jantar Mantar demanding scrapping of the agri laws and no protester will go to Parliament where the monsoon session is underway.“We will hold ‘Kisan Parliament’ from July 22 till the monsoon session ends and 200 protesters will go to Jantar Mantar every day. One speaker and one deputy speaker will be chosen every day. In the first two days, there will be discussion over the APMC Act. Later, the other bills will also be discussed every two days,” the leaders said.Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh national president Shiv Kumar Kakka told PTI that farmers, wearing identification badges, will go to Jantar Mantar from the Singhu border to hold the protest.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions spearheading the stir against the central farm laws, had planned that around 200 farmers will protest outside Parliament every day from July 22 during the monsoon session.The monsoon session of Parliament started on Monday and is scheduled to conclude on August 13.“We informed the police that every day 200 farmers will go to Jantar Mantar from the Singhu border in buses during the monsoon session. It will be a peaceful demonstration and protesters will have identification badges,” Kakka said.“When police asked us to reduce the number of protesters, we told them to focus on the law-and-order situation and also gave assurance that the protest will be peaceful,” Kakka said.No written communication has been received from the police yet, he said.“Police were informed that the protest will be peaceful. We will sit at Jantar Mantar from 10 am to 5 pm. Nobody will go to Parliament and neither will we allow any political person to come to the protest,” he said.A tractor parade in Delhi on January 26, that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws, had dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.During a meeting on Sunday, the Delhi Police had asked farmer unions to reduce the number of people attending the protest, but it was declined by the farm union leaders.A day later, the SKM accused the Delhi Police of spreading misinformation by describing their protest outside Parliament as ‘Sansad gherao’.The SKM has already stated that there are no plans of laying siege to Parliament, and the protest will be peaceful and disciplined, it had said in a statement.The umbrella body of farmers’ union had earlier said that two days before the monsoon session begins, a “chetavani patra” (warning letter) will be issued to all opposition MPs to protest against the farm laws inside the House.Thousands of farmers from across the country have been agitating at the Delhi borders against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws at major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.

20-07-2021||Washington||Biden admn expected to continue expansion of bilateral partnership with India due to China factor: Report||The Biden Administration is expected to continue the expansion of the bilateral partnership with India and the driving force of the relationship is concern about China's growing economic and military power in the region, according to a Congressional report."Many speculate that the Administration would pay more attention to India's domestic developments, including on human rights, but considered broad policies unlikely to change due to the perceived overarching need to counterbalance China,” said the latest report on India-US relationship released by independent Congressional Research Service.“Independent observers widely expected the Biden Administration to continue expansion of the bilateral partnership (with India), and most saw concern about China's growing economic and military power as the driving force of the relationship,” said the report by the CRS, which is traditionally prepared for the American lawmakers to make informed decisions.CRS reports, prepared by independent experts, are not considered as an official report or view of the US Congress. Of late, the US Congress has been making many of these reports public.“Many analysts laud an expected US return to multilateralism - especially given India's recently warmer sentiments toward the Quad initiative - and were eager to see the extent to which the Administration would commit resources prioritising the Indo-Pacific region in its foreign policy,” said the report authored by several South Asia experts led by Alan Kronstadt.The US, Japan, India and Australia had in 2017 given shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the "Quad" or the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. In March, President Joe Biden virtually met Quad leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the first Summit of the bloc where he said that a “free and open Indo-Pacific is essential” for all and the US was committed to working with its partners and allies in the region to achieve stability.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims.Beijing has also built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.  The report notes that despite many areas of sometimes serious discord, the US Congress has remained broadly positive in its posture toward the US-India strategic and commercial partnership. The Biden Administration has indicated that it intends to maintain the expansion and deepening of US-India ties.Congressional legislation and oversight have and can continue to affect the course of US-India relations, including in areas such as resourcing for a US Indo-Pacific strategy, trade and investment (including bilateral defence trade) relations, immigration policy, nuclear proliferation, human rights, and cooperative efforts to address COVID-19 and climate change, among many others, it said.Observing that President Biden was a strong and consistent advocate of positive US-India relations and US support for India during his 36-year Senate career, the CRS notes that some analysts expect pressure to come on India in issues related to human rights private rather than public channels, with at least one contending that such messaging will be “predictable, but inconsequential.”CRS said that defence trade has emerged as a key aspect of the bilateral partnership. New Delhi seeks to transform its military into one with advanced technology and global reach, reportedly planning up to USD 100 billion on new procurements over the next decade to update its mostly Soviet-era arsenal.

20-07-2021||New Delhi||CBI arrests Goa-based man on charges of sexually abusing 25-30 children, selling videos||The CBI has arrested a Goa-based man for allegedly sexually abusing 25-30 children and selling videos of his illicit acts to Indians and foreigners through the dark web and social media platforms, officials said on Tuesday.The accused was booked by the CBI on June 22, 2020 after the agency got leads about his activities during the probe against a Chitrakoot-based alleged paedophile who was an engineer in the Uttar Pradesh irrigation department, they said.In the past year, the CBI searched for the victims of the Goa-based alleged paedophile, whose name is being withheld as the probe is at a sensitive stage. The agency managed to identify about 25 victims, some of whom are now adults.Some of the victims were not willing to come forward because of social taboo associated with such matter, the agency said.The accused was presented before a court for cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in Goa which remanded him to judicial custody, CBI spokesperson R C Joshi said.“It was alleged that the accused was involved in sexual abuse of children...in Goa and Maharashtra and also recorded these acts by using his mobile phones, digital camera and other electronic devices, etc.,” Joshi said.He allegedly traded and shared these photographs and films containing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) using the dark web with other Indians and foreigners, they said.“It was also alleged that the accused was using emails for connecting with other paedophiles outside the country; the internet to access cloud-based storage services for storing the illegal CSAM content; accessing free photo-sharing websites based in other countries and using other social networking websites and platforms i.e. Instagram, Whatsapp etc. for connecting to individuals abroad for sharing CSAM in huge quantities,” Joshi said.During searches, a mobile phone, hard drive, pen drive and laptop allegedly used by the accused to access CSAM were recovered, he said.Last year in November, the CBI had arrested 50-year-old Ram Bhuwan for allegedly abusing around 50 children in the age group of 4-16 years in three adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh—Hamirpur, Banda and Chitrakoot—for over a decade and selling those recorded sexually explicit acts through the dark web.

20-07-2021||London||UK imposes export bar on 1-mn pound colonial era Mughal dagger, scabbard||The UK government has stepped in to place a temporary export bar on an 18th century Mughal era dagger and scabbard, worth over 1 million pounds, to allow a British institution or buyer to bid for the rare historic artefact.The dagger was owned by Robert Clive, referred to as Clive of India for his early colonisation role, and collected during his time in the country.It is likely to have been acquired by Clive in 1757 following his victory for the East India Company at the Battle of Plassey in Bengal.“This beautiful example of a Mughal dagger and scabbard has a lot to teach us about both the British in India and the nature of diplomatic gifts at the time,” said UK Culture Minister Caroline Dinenage.“I hope a UK-based buyer is found so this magnificent item can be studied and enjoyed for years to come,” she said.Valued at 11,20,000 pounds (USD 15,21,458), experts say the dagger has an unusually formed jade hilt with an "unparalleled" arrangement of precious stones, some of considerable size, whilst the blade is a fine example of Indian watered steel.Dating back to 1650, the silk brocade cover on the wooden scabbard or cover for the dagger is Iranian, demonstrating the influence of Iran on India throughout the Mughal period.The fact that this dagger has retained all its components, including the precious stones, is exceptional, according to historians.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) decision to impose a temporary export bar follows the advice of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA).The committee agreed that this is a “fascinating object” and illustrative of the culture of court etiquette and diplomatic gift-giving observed at the imperial and regional courts in 18th century India.Despite the "undeniable controversial" figure of Clive, the object is hugely important to the study of the history of the British in India, the RCEWA believes.“This fabulously ornate dagger and scabbard shed outstandingly important light on the nature of Anglo-Indian diplomatic relations in the mid 18th century and on the personality of Robert Clive,” said Peter Barber, a Member of the RCEWA.“The flamboyantly adorned hilt of the dagger is stylistically atypical of Moghul workmanship. Revealingly for the mentalities of the time, it may have been altered, and enriched, to resemble what the imperial or princely donor – trying particularly hard to flatter and win influence with its all-powerful recipient – thought looked European and thus familiar to Clive,” he said.“The very splendour of the dagger and its embroidered hilt – and the fact that the precious stones have not been removed as was usually the case with diplomatic gifts – also provides important evidence in the ongoing re-assessment of Clive's personality and conduct,” he said.Barber is keen for the dagger and scabbard to be retained in the UK so that they can be researched and displayed as they illustrate an important chapter in the “long story of the UK's involvement with the Indian subcontinent”.The RCEWA made its recommendation on the grounds that its departure from the UK would be a misfortune because it was of outstanding significance for the study of 18th century Mughal weapons.The decision on the export licence application for the piece will be deferred until October 8. This may be extended until February 8, 2022, if a serious intention to raise funds to purchase it is made at the recommended price of 1,120,000 pounds, the DCMS said.The dagger with watered steel blade, nephrite jade hilt is set with rubies and emeralds in gold. The scabbard of wood covered with silk brocade, the nephrite jade locket and chape is set with rubies in gold, and tassel and threads of silk and metal. The dagger's length is 39.5 cm and the scabbard measures 30 cm in length.The condition of the jewelled jade components is said to be excellent and the condition of the silk scabbard covering, threads and tassel are relatively good given their inherent fragility.

20-07-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus issue: TMC says will continue to disrupt Parliament till govt comes clean on snooping charges||The Trinamool Congress Tuesday said it will continue to disrupt Parliament proceedings till the government comes clean on the charges of snooping and surveillance using the Pegasus spyware and discusses it in both Houses.The party said it will, however, not halt any discussion on the coronavirus situation or aspects related to it. "This (Pegasus spyware) is a serious issue and the TMC will not compromise on it. We will not let either House run till this government comes clean on the charges of snooping and surveillance. The government has spent millions to hack into phones at a time when the country is dealing with a pandemic," TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien said.An international media consortium reported Sunday that over 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and one sitting judge besides scores of businesspersons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through the spyware.Opposition members raised an uproar in both houses and demanded a thorough probe into the charges of snooping on journalists, politicians, ministers, judges and others using the Israeli spyware.One of those listed as being allegedly snooped upon is (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee.TMC Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra said, "We are saying on record that the IT minister lied on the floor of the House. We just want the PM, HM and the IT minister to answer if India is a client of NSO (Israeli firm that makes the Pegasus spyware) or not? We have a list of questions for the government and we will not allow Parliament to run unless these questions are answered."  Moitra then listed some questions -- has any department under the government of India purchased Pegasus? Is the spyware being used currently? Which agency has requisitioned this data and where is it being retained? IT and Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had Monday dismissed media reports on the use of Pegasus software to snoop on Indians, saying the allegations levelled just ahead of the Monsoon session of Parliament are aimed at maligning Indian democracy.In a suo motu statement in Lok Sabha, Vaishnaw said that with several checks and balances being in place, "any sort of illegal surveillance" by unauthorised persons is not possible in India.On the Union health secretary's scheduled briefing to all parties on Covid this evening, O'Brien said TMC floor leaders will attend the presentation as it does not want to politicise the issue. The Congress has announced that it will boycott the presentation.

During various rounds of discussions, government continuously requested the farmers' unions to discuss the provisions of the farm laws, so that if there is an objection to any provision, the advancement can be made towards a resolution of those," the minister said.But the farmers' unions insisted only on the repeal of the farm laws, he added."Government is always open to discussion with farmers' unions and will remain open to discussion with agitating farmers to resolve the issue," Tomar said.In all the rounds of discussions with the farmers' unions, the minister said the government had stressed that instead of insisting on the demand for the repeal of the laws, the unions should discuss their concerns on the clauses of farm Acts so that their concerns can be resolved.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for more than seven months in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP (Minimum Support Price).Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions.During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi's borders.The farmers' unions have been agitating against the three laws -- 'The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020', 'The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020' and 'The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The demands of agitating farmers' unions are repealing the three farm laws, keeping farmers outside the penalty provision on straw burning under Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020, withdrawing the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, and issues-related to procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP)."Giving top priority to the interest of farmers, government vide letter dated 9th December 2020 addressed to farmers' unions, explained point by point, how the concerns expressed by the farmers were being taken care of in the proposal of the Government of India."Government also proposed to constitute a small group consisting of representative of farmers' unions, who can deliberate on farm laws clause-wise in a time-bound manner and can also consider other issues related to farmers, which representatives of farmers' unions have not agreed. However, farmers' unions never agreed to discuss the farm laws except for demanding their repeal," Tomar said.The minister said these laws are intended to provide an ecosystem where the farmers can enjoy the freedom of choice relating to the sale of farmers' produce which facilitates remunerative prices to farmers through competitive alternative channels for selling their produce."These farm Acts will facilitate direct buying from farmers in trade area by traders, processors, exporters, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), agriculture co-operative societies etc., so as to facilitate farmers with better price realisation due to reduction in supply chain and marketing cost to enhance their income," he added.

20-07-2021||New Delhi||India engaging proactively with Switzerland to obtain info under tax treaty||The government on Tuesday said that India is engaging proactively with Switzerland to obtain information in relevant cases under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between the two countries.Replying to queries related to deposits by Indians in Swiss banks, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said certain media reports have stated that funds of Indians in Swiss Banks have risen in 2020.These media reports have also mentioned that the figures do not indicate the quantum of alleged black money held by Indians in Switzerland, he added."In respect of these media reports, the Swiss authorities have recently, inter alia, conveyed that the SNB's (Swiss National Bank) report provides a comprehensive picture of the Swiss banking sector and is based on the SNB's annual banking statistics," Chaudhary said in a written reply to Rajya Sabha.For these statistics, the minister said reporting banks provide balance sheet data on their bank office entity as well as on their foreign branches."Further, the Swiss authorities have also conveyed that customer deposits held with Swiss banks are not necessarily located in Switzerland. Thus, the SNB annual banking statistics should not be used for analysing deposits held in Switzerland by residents of India," he noted.The minister said that India is engaging proactively with Switzerland to obtain information in relevant cases under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Switzerland. Both countries are also signatories to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.Further, both sides have signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement pursuant to which, Automatic Exchange of Information is activated between the two countries for sharing of financial account information under Common Reporting Standard (CRS) annually.

20-07-2021||Prayagraj||Uttar Pradesh teacher demand 'Menstrual Leave' every month||Uttar Pradesh women teachers are now demanding three days 'Period Leave' or 'Menstrual Leave' every month, over and above other leaves available to them.They have cited the facility available to their counterparts in states like Bihar.The Uttar Pradesh Women Teachers' Association has submitted their demand to Anamika Chaudhary, a member of UP Women's Commission and now plan to approach Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.Anamika Chaudhary has promised to make the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath aware of the demand.The women teachers underlined the fact that menstruating women experience pain and bleeding, both of which affect their mental and physical state.Senior vice-president of the association's Prayagraj unit, Poonam Gupta, said that the Bihar government was extending this leave to women employees for the past 30 years."We want UP government to also extend three days' 'period leave', per month, for women teachers and employees," she said."All units are submitting similar memorandums to elected MLAs and ministers in their respective districts. Be it Azamgarh, Bareilly or Lucknow, the plan is to let every MLA and minister aware of our demands. In Prayagraj, we plan to submit a memorandum to Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya also," she added.It is noteworthy that Indian food delivery service Zomato has decided to give female employees up to 10 days of 'period leave' per year."A number of private companies provide the option to women workers to avail 'period leave' even in India. It is an optional leave at most places, and hardly anyone misuses it. Today, women teachers either have had to come to work on the most painful day of their menstrual cycle or make up some excuse. The leave cannot take away their pain and discomfort, but it can give them a break on the days they are most uncomfortable," said Poonam Gupta. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttar-pradesh-teacher-demand%C2%A0menstrual-leave-every-month-285847
20-07-2021||New Delhi||Detention of Manipur activist under NSA: SC seeks state govt reply on compensation||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Manipur government to file its response on granting compensation to political activist Leichombam Erendro, who was released on Monday evening from detention after being booked under the National Security Act for having criticised BJP leaders on use of cow dung and urine as cures for Covid.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that it was a serious issue as someone lost his liberty since May and the petitioners had prayed for grant of compensation to Erendro for detention.The bench said it was issuing notice to the state government and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.During the hearing, Mehta said this case was brought to light three months ago and as soon as the state government had noticed the fact, the charges were revoked.He said the state government had not defended the plea for release of the activist and, therefore, the matter should be allowed to rest here.The bench noted Mehta's submission that Erendro was released in compliance with the interim direction issued on Monday and charges against him under the NSA provision and the detention were revoked.Advocate Shadan Farasat, appearing for Erendro's father who moved the plea, said his prayer is for compensation as five cases were cited against the activist and no charge sheet was filed in any of them.The bench said, “We issue notice on the compensation aspect and you (Mehta) can file a reply on this aspect.”Mehta said this could have been avoided by a pragmatic approach but he would again urge that the matter should be allowed to rest as the petition was filed after three months.He said the state would have to satisfy the order on merits and this could have been avoided by a little pragmatic approach.Farasat submitted that in this case responsibility had to be fixed for the “illegal detention” since May 17.Erendro was released on Monday evening following the Supreme Court direction to Imphal jail authorities, saying he could not be put in jail even for a day.The top court had said, “Having prima facie considered the contents of the petition, we are of the view that the continued detention of the petitioner before this court would amount to a violation of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.”It had said that the Manipur government should comply with the order of this court on or before 5 pm on Monday.L Raghumani Singh, Erendro's father, had challenged the preventive detention of the political activist under the NSA, alleging that it had been done “solely to punish him” for his criticism of BJP leaders purportedly advocating cow dung and cow urine as cures for Covid.

The room number 4, bearing three name boards for years (of Atal Bihari Vajpayee; Chairman, National Democratic Alliance; and LK Advani), is right next to the BJP parliamentary party office.Though Vajpayee was allotted the room after he stepped down as the Prime Minister when the NDA lost the 2004 General Election, the room was mostly used by Advani after he stepped down as the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha following the coalition’s defeat in 2009 under his command.   Between 2009 and 2014, the room remained the hub of much political activity while the party was in the Opposition. In the years that followed, Advani used the room till he remained an MP. Though Vajpayee did not sit in it much for visitors to the Parliament building, the room with his and Advani’s name on it became a must-visit.The room has mostly been lying vacant.Today the nameplates of Vajpayee and Advani were removed.Nadda, a former Health Minister, is a member of the Rajya Sabha from Himachal Pradesh. Sources say Nadda, who has so far been sharing a room with former Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, Thaawarchand Gehlot, is likely to shift in the room.Meanwhile, Gehlot’s room has now been allotted to Piyush Goyal, the new Leader of the House in the Rajya SabhaIncidentally, the room was initially with the JD-U, an ally of the BJP. When Vajpayee was no longer the prime minister it was converted as the NDA chairperson’s room.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/room-of-vajpayee-and-advani-in-parliament-allotted-to-jp-nadda-285844

20-07-2021||FAQs on Pegasus in India context||What are Pegasus leaks and why is it a threat to your privacy; read||Q. How did the Pegasus revelations happen?A. Forbidden Stories, a website and Amnesty International, had access to a leak of 50,000 phone numbers of NSO clients selected for surveillance. NSO makes the Pegasus software.Q. Was the investigation targeted against India?A. The investigation was done by 17 media agencies across the world and covered 45 countries.Q. What has been the GoI response?A. The publisher of the report states that it cannot say if the numbers in the published list were under surveillance.The company whose technology was allegedly used has denied these claims outrightly.And the time tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur, IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in Parliament.Q. What did GoI say on surveillance?A. In India, there is a well established procedure through which lawful interception of electronic communication is carried out for the purpose of national security, particularly on the occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety, by agencies at the Centre and States.The requests for these lawful interception of electronic communication are made as per relevant rules under the provisions of section 5(2) of Indian Telegraph Act,1885 and section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Q. How many journalists numbers were under surveillance?A. 180 all over the world, including the biggest media platforms, of which 49 are Indian.Q. Which countries were found to be using Pegasus against journalists, activists and opposition leaders?A. The countries named in the reports are : Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and India.Q. Who all were the potential targeted in India?A. 49 Indian journalists, 3 opposition leaders, 2 Ministers, one sitting SC Judge were targeted. Business persons too were targeted.Q. How sure is the snooping?A. Amnesty International's Security Lab, in partnership with Forbidden Stories, performed forensics analyses on the phones of more than a dozen of these journalists—and 67 phones in total—revealing successful infections. They were later peer reviewed by a Canadian tech company which specialises in Pegasus.Both confirmed the infections.NSO, the company which owns the technology has said: "NSO Group believes that claims that you have been provided with, are based on misleading interpretation of leaked data from basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products.Such services are openly available to anyone, anywhere, and anytime, and are commonly used by governmental agencies as well as by private companies worldwide. It is also beyond dispute that the data has nothing to do with surveillance or with NSO, so there can be no factual basis to suggest that a use of the data somehow equates to surveillance." Q. Is it possible to snoop, and what are the procedures?A. Each case of interception or monitoring is approved by the competent authority. These powers are also available to the competent authority in the state governments as per IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009.There is an established oversight mechanism in the form of a review committee headed by the Union Cabinet Secretary. In case of state governments, such cases are reviewed by a committee headed by the Chief Secretary concerned.The law also provides an adjudication process for those adversely affected by any incident.The procedure therefore ensures that any interception or monitoring of any information is done as per due process of law. The framework and institutions have withstood the test of time, GoI said.Q. Has GoI accepted that there was snooping?A. GoI said it clearly emerges that there is no substance behind this sensationalism. The report itself clarifies that presence of a number does not amount to snooping. It quoted the report: "The presence of a phone number in the data does not reveal whether a device was infected with Pegasus or subject to an attempted hack.Without subjecting a phone to this technical analysis, it is not possible to conclusively state whether it witnessed an attack attempt or was successfully compromised". — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-are-pegasus-leaks-and-why-is-it-a-threat-to-your-privacy-read-285838
20-07-2021||sent in police custody till July 23; cops say he profited from porn films business||Watch: Raj Kundra sent in police custody till July 23; WhatsApp chats reveal 'financial dealings'; techie nabbed in porn film case||Mumbai, July 20Businessman Raj Kundra, remanded in police custody till July 23 by a Mumbai court on Tuesday in a porn films case, was involved in making and selling pornographic material and gaining financially from the illegal activity, the crime branch alleged while seeking his remand.Kundra (45), husband of Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty, was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch on Monday night in a case, which it said, related to the alleged creation of pornographic films and publishing them through some apps.The police claimed there were several WhatsApp chats that revealed Kundra was involved in the financial dealings of apps and their contents.The police also said three women have come forward with complaints in the case, saying they were "forced to act in pornographic movies".The accused persons took advantage of struggling models, actors and other workers, and made them work in these pornographic movies, the police said, adding these movies were shot in rented bungalows in Mumbai.Kundra was taken into custody after being booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act.The police also arrested another person, identified as Ryan Thorpe, who was working on a senior position with an app firm, from his office along with Kundra after an enquiry into the matter, an official said.Kundra and Thope were produced before a magistrate's court here, which remanded both of them in police custody till July 23.The police, while seeking maximum custody of Kundra, told the court that the businessman was economically gaining by making and selling pornographic material.In their remand note, the police alleged that the accused persons "made profits in lakhs in this illegal business of making pornographic films and uploading the same via some mobile apps for which subscription fees is taken from viewers".The police further alleged that the pornographic material was uploaded on an app 'HotShots' that was developed by a company, Arms Prime Pvt Ltd, owned by Kundra.They said another arrested accused Umesh Kamat, a former employee of Kundra, told police that the app was later sold to Kenrin Pvt Ltd, a c owned by Kundra's relative Pradeep Bakshi.The police said they have seized Kundra's mobile phone and its contents need to be scrutinised and also his business dealings and transactions have to be looked into.They said Kundra's custodial interrogation was required as he had to be confronted with the other accused in the case.Appearing for Kundra, senior counsel Aabad Ponda and advocate Subhash Jadhav opposed the police's plea for remand and said the investigation into the case can be carried out without custodial interrogation.Ponda argued that the police ought to have issued summons to Kundra first and recorded his statement, instead of arresting him directly in the case that was registered in February this year.The magistrate, after hearing arguments, passed an order remanding Kundra and Thorpe in police custody till July 23.As the case hit headlines, an actress claimed in an undated video in circulation on Tuesday that she was offered a role in a web series allegedly being produced by Kundra but was asked to audition for the part in the nude.In the video, actress Sagarika Shona Suman said she had received a call from Umesh Kamat, a co-accused, during the coronavirus-induced lockdown and was offered a part in a web series being produced by Kundra.She claimed after she showed a willingness to act in the web series, Kamat allegedly asked for an audition in the nude via video call.Suman, who claims to be part of the film industry for the past three to four years, said when she joined the audition via video call, three people had joined in, "one of whom may have been Kundra".Kamat was arrested in the case earlier. The police have claimed that he uploaded eight pornographic videos shot by actor Gehana Vashisht, also arrested in the case earlier, on a social media app for monetary gains.Earlier, the police on Monday said Kundra appears to be the "key conspirator" of the case."There was a case registered with the Crime Branch Mumbai in February 2021 about the creation of pornographic films and publishing them through some Apps. We've arrested Mr Raj Kundra in this case on 19/7/21 as he appears to be the key conspirator of this. We have sufficient evidence regarding this," police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said in a statement on late Monday night.An FIR was registered against Kundra after a woman approached the police and made certain allegations in her complaint, another official had said.On that basis, the FIR was registered and the case transferred to the Crime Branch.Kundra was booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention), 292 and 293 (related to obscene and indecent advertisements and displays), and relevant sections of the IT Act and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, the official said. Also read:This is the second case that Kundra faces in connection with the alleged creation of pornographic content.He had applied for anticipatory bail last month in connection with a case registered earlier by the Maharashtra cyber police in 2020.In that case, also, the cyber police had registered an FIR against various platforms, which, they alleged, were involved in showcasing pornographic content.The sessions court is yet to hear the anticipatory bail plea. — PTIA post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani)  A post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani)  A post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/watch-raj-kundra-sent-in-police-custody-till-july-23-whatsapp-chats-reveal-financial-dealings-techie-nabbed-in-porn-film-case-285834

20-07-2021||Bhubaneswar||A bodybuilder at Lord Jagannath yatra, read to know why 'Bahubali Sevayat' is trending||Thanks to the pandemic and social media many behind the scene faces have got their chance to bask in the limelight. Similar is the case of Anil Gochikar, who has gained popularity as the Bahubali Sevayat or body guard of Lord Jagannath.On the auspicious occasion of Bahuda Yatra of Lord Jagannath and his siblings in Puri, Gochikar, a 'Pratihari' servitor of the Puri Jagannath temple, has become famous for his well sculpted body and gentleman's attitude.The 43-year-old became an instant Internet sensation after a few photos of him went viral during the Rath Yatra. In one photo he was standing on the chariot while in another, he was pulling the grand chariots. People soon started calling him Bodyguard and Baahubali Sevayat.Gochikar's family has been serving part of the personal security force of Lord Jagannath over generations.Since childhood, he has been attending 'Akhada' (a place of physical fitness practices). "In 2010, I joined the gym and started doing exercise after being inspired by my elder brother Sunil, who is also a bodybuilder. Since then, I have been continuously doing physical exercise everyday in the afternoon," Anil told IANS.He had already carved a niche for himself in the field of bodybuilding, the advent of social media made him even more popular. He won several awards and medals at state-, national- and international level.Gochikar, who has the looks of an actor-model, has won the title of Mr Odisha seven times, Eastern India champion three times and Mr India four times. He also won gold at International Bodybuilders Championship in Dubai in 2016 and bronze at World Championship in 2014.Gochikar is a pure vegetarian and stays away from alcohol, cigarettes or any tobacco product.His diet includes dal, soybean, broccoli, etc for protein, desi ghee for fat. "However, if you are a vegetarian, you have to do more workouts compared to non-vegetarian," he explains.In 2020 and this year, due to the Covid-19 restrictions, no devotee has been allowed to participate in the Rath Yatra festival. Only the servitors are pulling the chariots. So, the importance of Gochikar has increased. He has been seen pulling the chariots on the Grand Road."Usually, we, 'Pratihari' servitors, were serving the Lords inside the temple. However, due to Covid-19, I got this golden opportunity to serve the Lords at Grand Road too. I will never forget this moment in my life," he said.Sharing his experience during last year's Rath Yatra, he said, till the last moment, no one knew that the festival would be held. As a sudden announcement was made for the festival and there was a fear among the people about Covid-19, a limited number of servitors were there to pull the chariots."The chariots cannot move with only 300 odd persons. It was due to the divine power of Lord Jagannath, the chariot moved," he said."What is the use of the body if it is not used in the service of Lord Jagannath. Earlier, there was no police force or administration, during that time, only the servitors had given protection to Jagannath," the Bahubali sevayat said.All three holy chariots of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra have been parked near the Gundicha Temple to be rolled out on the Grand Road of Puri as the Bahuda Yatra rituals begin. Pahandi rituals of all three deities were underway.Like last year, the festival is being held without devotees due to Covid-19 pandemic. Only servitors, police personnel and concerned officials have been allowed on the Grand Road during the festival.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-bodybuilder-at-lord-jagannath-yatra-read-to-know-why-bahubali-sevayat-is-trending-285826
20-07-2021||New Delhi||SC majority verdict quashes part of 97th Constitutional amendment on cooperatives||The Supreme Court on Tuesday in a 2:1 majority verdict upheld the validity of the 97th Constitutional amendment that deals with issues related to effective management of cooperative societies but struck down a part related to their setting up and functioning.A bench of Justices RF Nariman, KM Joseph and BR Gavai said, “We have struck down Part IX B of the Constitution related to cooperative societies but we have saved the amendment.”Justice Nariman said, “Justice Joseph has given a partly dissenting verdict and has struck down the entire 97th constitutional amendment.”The 97th constitutional amendment, which dealt with issues related to effective management of cooperative societies in the country was passed by Parliament in December 2011 and had come into effect from February 15, 2012.The change in the Constitution has amended Article 19(1)(c) to give protection to the cooperatives and inserted Article 43-B and Part IX-B, relating to them.While Article 19(1)(c) guarantees freedom to form associations or unions or cooperative societies subject to certain restrictions, Article 43-B says that states shall endeavour to promote voluntary formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control and professional management of cooperative societies.The Part IX-B of the Constitution inserted by 97th amendment deals with incorporation, terms of members of board and its office-bearers and effective management of cooperative societies.The Centre has contended that the provision does not denude states of their power to enact laws with regard to cooperatives.The apex court's verdict came on the Centre's plea challenging the Gujarat High Court's 2013 decision striking down certain provisions of the 97th constitutional amendment while holding that Parliament cannot enact laws with regard to cooperative societies as it is a state subject.The top court also examined a question whether the provision denuded states of their exclusive power to enact laws to deal with management of cooperative societies.Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, said the 97th Constitution amendment is not direct or substantial attack on states' powers to enact laws with regard to cooperatives.Several intervenors have contended that the amendment made a direct inroad into the exclusive domain of states to enact laws with regard to cooperatives.The Centre has stated that the amendment was enacted to bring in uniformity in the management of cooperative societies and it did not take away the powers of states.The top court had said if the Centre wanted to achieve uniformity then the only way available was to take the recourse under Article 252 of the Constitution which deals with the power of Parliament to legislate for two or more states by consent.It said that in effect what the government had done was that the power of states to enact laws with respect to cooperative society had been made no longer exclusive.On April 22, 2013, the High Court, while striking down certain provisions of the 97th constitutional amendment, held that Parliament cannot enact laws or issue notification with regard to cooperative societies as it is a state subject.The High Court verdict came on a PIL challenging the legality of the 97th constitutional amendment on the grounds that the Centre had no legislative competence to enact law for cooperative societies which is exclusively a state subject under the scheme of the Constitution.The High Court had held that certain provisions of the amendment pertaining to cooperative societies violated the basic structure of federalism.The PIL petitioner contended that as per the provisions of Article 368 of the Constitution, if Parliament intends to amend or delete any of the lists in the seventh schedule, such Amendment shall require to be ratified by the legislature of not less than one half of the states by resolution to the effect passed by those legislatures before the bill making provisions for such amendment is presented to the President for assent.

The manner in which the male child in the video appears to be sexualised, it needs to be investigated whether he is/has been subjected to other forms of sexual abuse," it said.The DCW, through its notice, has asked the Delhi Police to register an FIR in the matter and arranged for counselling and rehabilitation of the child.DCW chief Swati Maliwal stated, “While social media acts as an amazing platform to showcase talent, people sometimes cross all limits of shamelessness in a pursuit of gaining popularity... We have also asked the police to get these posts deleted from all platforms."

New Covid cases daily peaked at more than 4,00,000 in early May, then fell to a little over 40,000 in early July."Early indicators show economic activity resuming quickly after containment measures eased. The growth projection for FY2021 (ending March 2022), downgraded from 11 per cent in ADO 2021 to 10 per cent, reflects large base effects," it said.The ADO was released in April.The projection for FY2022 (ending in March 2023), by which time much of India's population is expected to be vaccinated, is upgraded from 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent as economic activity normalises, said the Manila-headquartered funding agency.With regard to China, the ADB supplement said the expansion in the People's Republic of China is still projected at 8.1 per cent in 2021, and 5.5 per cent in 2022, as favorable domestic and external trends align with April forecasts.

20-07-2021||Washington||Biden administration proposes US court to extradite Tahawwur Rana to India||The Biden administration has urged a federal court in Los Angeles to extradite Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana to India where he is sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack.Rana, 59, has been declared a fugitive by India, where he is facing multiple criminal charges for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He was rearrested on June 10, 2020, in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India           In a submission before the US District Court, Central District of California in Los Angeles, the US government argues that India's extradition request contains sufficient evidence of probable cause on each of the criminal charges for which India seeks Rana's extradition.“Having found that all of the requirements for certification of extradition have been satisfied, the Court certifies the extradition of Tahawwur Hussain Rana to the Secretary of State and commits him to custody pursuant,” according to a draft order proposed by the US attorney in his submission before the court last week. “Based on the evidence submitted by India, RANA allowed fraud against the Indian government to occur through the creation and submission of forged documents. The purpose behind such fraud is irrelevant under the Indian criminal provisions,” said the document titled proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law.Rana is wanted by the Indian authorities for his alleged involvement in the deadly attacks that are sometimes referred to as India's 9/11. An Indian warrant for his arrest was issued in August 2018. Indian authorities allege that Rana conspired with his childhood friend David Coleman Headley to assist the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or Army of the Good, in the orchestration of the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai. “In any event, RANA knowingly allowed Headley to obtain the business visa and the cover that he needed to conduct terrorism-related surveillance operations in India, ultimately leading to the three-day terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Accordingly, the Court finds there is probable cause that RANA conspired to forge a document for the purpose of cheating and use a forged document as genuine, in violation of IPC 120B, 468, and 471,” it said.According to the court document, the evidence establishes that the Mumbai attacks were committed by LeT, a terrorist organisation targeting India. Thus, an attack on Indian soil, especially one that would result in mass casualties, injuries, and damage to property, would strike terror in the Indian people.“Rana was aware that Headley was involved with LeT, and that by assisting Headley and affording him a cover for his activities, he was supporting the terrorist organisation and its associates. Rana knew of Headley's meetings, what was discussed, and the planning of the attacks, including some of the targets. Further, it was foreseeable that these attacks would lead to death, injury, and destruction of property,” it said.“Accordingly, this Court finds that there is probable cause that Rana committed the crimes of conspiracy with the object of committing a terrorist act, in violation of IPC 120B and UAPA 16, and conspiracy to commit a terrorist act, in violation of UAPA 18. The court further finds that under an agency theory or an abetting theory (as contemplated by UAPA  16), there is probable cause that Rana committed the substantive crime of commission of a terrorist act in violation of UAPA  16,” said the document submitted by the US attorney.India has charged forgery for purposes of cheating, in violation of IPC 468, as an object of the alleged criminal conspiracy. India also charged the crime of using as genuine a forged document or electronic record, in violation of IPC 471, as an object of the alleged criminal conspiracy.The document said that the evidence establishes that Rana conspired with Headley to provide false information on multiple documents submitted to the Indian government. “In 2006 and 2007, Rana conspired with Headley to include false information on Indian government documents, so that Headley could obtain business visas (a one-year and a five-year multiple entry) as an alleged employee of Rana's business. On both occasions, Rana reviewed Headley's applications and failed to correct information Rana knew to be false,” it said.“Rana also had the Immigrant Law Center, through his unsuspecting business partner, submit the applications to the Indian Consulate. RANA also allowed his business to apply to the Reserve Bank of India, while falsely claiming it wanted to open an office in Mumbai with Headley serving as the business's ‘Office Head'” it said.On the other hand, Rana's attorney in their proposed draft order is opposed to the extradition. “The Court finds that the government has not satisfied the requirement of Article 9(3)(c) of the Treaty that a request for extradition be supported by such information as would justify the committal for trial of the person if the offense had been committed in the Requested State," it said.Extradition is therefore denied,” says “Rana's proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law.” Both the documents were submitted before the court on July 15.

We shared views on further strengthening bilateral ties. PM Modi assured early supply of Covid Vaccines to Nepal. I thanked him for his warm words of congratulations,” Deuba tweeted.A day before the Nepal Supreme Court judgment, Oli had made a last-ditch attempt to curry India’s favour by rejecting bids of Chinese companies and awarding the $1.3 billion Lower Arun hydel project to the Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN). Oli had conceded the Indian argument that the SJVN should get the contract since it is at the tail race of the Arun-3 hydel project being built by the same company.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prime-minister-dials-nepal-pm-sher-bahadur-deuba-bats-for-better-ties-285649
20-07-2021||New Delhi||Cornered, Modi govt trashes Pegasus report||The report of the alleged use of spyware Pegasus to snoop on journalists, politicians and other personalities generated much political heat on Monday with the government dismissing the issue as “sensationalism” and the Opposition seeking the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah and an inquiry against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The issue resonated inside and outside Parliament. Opposition parties, including the Congress, disrupted both Houses and demanded a probe.ON SNOOP LISTIn a statement in the Lok Sabha, Union Information and Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw questioned the timing of the report and said illegal surveillance was impossible with checks and balances in place.He flagged some chinks in the Pegasus story, while reiterating his predecessor Ravi Shankar Prasad’s statement when the issue first surfaced in Parliament last year.The IT Minister told the Lok Sabha that the report’s timing — a day before the session — could not be a coincidence. “There is no substance behind this sensationalism,” Vaishnaw informed Parliament, arguing three points: “The publisher of the report states that it can’t say if the phone numbers on the published list were under surveillance; the company whose technology was allegedly used has denied these claims; the time tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur”.After the Congress demanded Shah’s resignation, with Rahul Gandhi alleging breach of privacy, the Home Minister dismissed the Pegasus report as a “conspiracy”.Shah said, “Aap chronology samajhiye. This is a report by the disrupters, for the obstructers. Disrupters are global organisations that do not like India to progress. Obstructers are political players in India, who do not want India to progress.”The Opposition vowed to again raise the issue in Parliament, with Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Randeep Surjewala in a joint statement asking the government, “Is spying on security forces, judiciary, ministers, Opposition leaders, journalists and other activists through a foreign spyware not treason and inexcusable breach of national security?”Amid the political storm, another report today alleged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, election strategist Prashant Kishor, former Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa and head of Association of Democratic Reforms Jagdeep Chokkar were among the targets of spying.Earlier at a press conference, former IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad claimed the worldwide expose by 16 media houses had been done “deliberately to disrupt the session and create a baseless agenda”.Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Kharge said accountability was a must. “Before a probe, Shah should resign and an inquiry be conducted against the PM,” he demanded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cornered-modi-govt-trashes-pegasus-report-285621
20-07-2021||New Delhi||‘Negative’ mindset, PM Modi slams Opposition||As expected, the monsoon session got off to a stormy start with the Opposition in both Houses creating a ruckus and preventing Prime Minister Narendra Modi from introducing the new ministers in his Council and forcing him to table the list.Upset over the disruptions, Modi lashed out at the Opposition, saying that such a “negative mindset” had never been witnessed in Parliament. “It seems some people cannot digest that more women, SC, ST and OBC community members are becoming ministers,” the Prime Minister said.“It is a matter of pride that people from rural India, who come from ordinary families, have taken oath as ministers. But some people don’t want ministers to be introduced. They also have an anti-woman mindset since they do not want women ministers to be introduced to the House,” PM Modi said.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in the Lok Sabha and newly appointed Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal also slammed opposition MPs, accusing them of breaking long-held traditions of Parliament for the first time, assertions which Congress declared “untrue”.“This is untrue. The BJP never allowed Dr Manmohan Singh to introduce his ministers time and again,” Congress’ Lok Sabha MP Manish Tiwari said, taking to social media.“You reap what you sow,” Tiwari said, attaching a statement by Manmohan Singh, apparently in the Rajya Sabha, saying that “have you heard of a situation in Parliament where the PM is not allowed to introduce his Council of Ministers”.Setting the mood for the rest of the session, combative Congress MPs raised banners and shouted slogans in protest against the increasing prices of fuel as soon as the PM got up to speak. The Akali Dal and other parties held banners opposing the farm laws. Speaker Om Birla tried to reason out, asking them to maintain peace and allow the PM to introduce the new ministers.Later, Rajnath Singh told the Lok Sabha that he had never seen such behaviour in his parliamentary life. “Healthy traditions have been set by following conventions in Parliament. In my last 24 years of parliamentary life, I have not seen a single instance where the PM could not introduce his Council of Ministers,” Singh said, terming the behaviour of the Congress “sad, unfortunate and unhealthy”.Amid repeated disruptions, both Houses were adjourned in the afternoon without conducting any business.Earlier, PM Modi had again appealed to lawmakers to participate in Parliament proceedings and work with the government to make the monsoon session a productive and constructive one.“People of the country are waiting for answers from the government. The government is ready with the answers. Please ask us tough questions, ask them again and again, but also give us time to respond in a peaceful manner,” the PM said, addressing the media ahead of the sessionThe PM said he had told floor leaders of parties that he would like to give them detailed information on Covid management.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/negative-mindset-pm-modi-slams-opposition-285624

LPG prices in Delhi were raised five times and not cut even once. Petrol and diesel prices in Delhi were cut four times each this year.“The prices of petroleum products are linked to the price of respective products in the international market.

It said excise duty on petrol was raised from Rs 19.98 per litre to Rs 32.9 last year and the corresponding raise on diesel was to Rs 31.8 from Rs 15.83 a litre.Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Rameswar Teli also said the excise duty hikes led to excise collections on petrol and diesel going up from Rs 3.35 lakh crore in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021). This was Rs 1.78 lakh crore the previous year. Excise collections on petrol and diesel were Rs 2.13 lakh crore in 2018-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petrol-price-in-delhi-rose-63-times-diesel-61-this-year-govt-285642

We've arrested Mr Raj Kundra in this case on 19/7/21 as he appears to be the key conspirator of this. We have sufficient evidences regarding this," Mumbai police commissioner said in a statement. The case was registered on February 4 at the Malwani police station in suburban Mumbai. An FIR was registered against Kundra after a woman approached the police and made certain allegations in her complaint, another official said. "On that basis, the FIR was registered and the case transferred to the Crime Branch. Earlier also, we had registered cases related to pornography in which an actress and some other persons were made accused," he said. "We will conduct a probe into the case against Raj Kundra and find out if there is any link between this and pornography cases which we had registered earlier," the official said.  Kundra was booked under IPC Sections 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention), 292 and 293 (related to obscene and indecent advertisements and displays), and relevant sections of the IT Act and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, he said. Further investigation was underway, the official added.

20-07-2021||New Delhi||Row in Rajya Sabha over nationality of newly-inducted minister||Opposition members in Rajya Sabha on Monday sought to raise the issue of the nationality of a newly-inducted Minister of State for Home, alleging he was a Bangladeshi national, but the government dismissed the charge as "baseless" and slammed them for casting such aspersions on a leader from a tribal community.Opposition members led by TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar and Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge asked the government to clear its stand over the nationality of the minister.Without naming the minister, Sekhar said: “The prime minister has been allowed to lay a list of the ministers after the reshuffle. Go through Wikipedia, then you will find that the name of the gentleman… A Minister of State for Home Affairs is a reportedly a Bangladeshi.”Sekhar was also supported by Kharge and other opposition members.“He has raised a relevant point. It's a point of order,” said Kharge adding, “I have every right to know whether he is a Bangladeshi or not."Last week, Rajya Sabha member and Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President Ripun Bora had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to conduct an inquiry into allegations that newly appointed minister Nisith Pramanik is a Bangladeshi national.Objecting to the remarks of opposition members, Union Minister and Leader of the House Piyush Goyal termed the allegation as “baseless”, asserting there is no truth in it. “This should be expunged. It's an insult of a big leader and a large society to which he belongs,” he said, adding such remarks against a leader from the tribal community were condemnable.As the issue sparked an uproar, Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman  Harivansh Narayan Singh tried to pacify the members but failed.Amid the commotion, Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal introduced The Marine Aids to Navigation Bill, 2021.Lok Sabha has already passed the bills that will replace an over nine-decade-old law governing lighthouses and seeks to provide for a fresh framework to establish and manage vessel traffic services, besides changing the use of the term marine aids to navigation.The Deputy Chairman asked the agitating member to discuss only the bills listed in the business of the house. However, the members did not relent, after which the Singh adjourned the house till 3 PM.Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prevented from introducing his newly-inducted union ministers to Rajya Sabha as several slogan-shouting opposition members trooped into the Well of the House to protest over various issues, including farm laws and fuel price hike.The House proceedings were adjourned till 2 pm as the protesting opposition members did not relent to Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu''s repeated appeal for order in the House.When the House assembled on day one of the Monsoon Session, the proceedings were adjourned for an hour as a mark of respect to departed sitting MPs Raghunath Mohapatra and Rajeev Satav.No sooner did the House meet again at around 12.25 pm, opposition members started raising slogans as the Chairman was making his opening remarks about the expectations from the current session amid the Covid-19 pandemic.When the prime minister rose to introduce the newly inducted members in his Council of Ministers, opposition members created an uproar by raising slogans.Questioning the opposition's conduct, Modi wondered "what kind of mindset is this" that prevents them from giving respect to the new ministers who are women, Dalits and come from Scheduled Tribes and OBC communities.

20-07-2021||Mumbai||Have ‘great respect’ for Stan Swamy’s work: Bombay High Court||The Bombay High Court on Monday highlighted the issue of undertrials in several cases languishing in prisons waiting for the trial to begin as it appreciated the work done by tribal rights activist Stan Swamy, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case who died in judicial custody waiting for bail on medical grounds.For how many years can people be asked to languish in jail without a trial? the HC said while hearing posthumously the appeals filed by the late Jesuit priest, whom the HC described as a wonderful person and expressed “great respect” for his work.The observations were made by a Bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar that had also presided over Swamy’s medical bail plea on July 5, when the HC was informed about the 84-year-old priest’s death at the Holy Family Hospital here that day following a cardiac arrest.“We don’t have time normally, but I saw the funeral service (of Swamy). It was very gracious,” Justice Shinde said. “Such a wonderful person. The kind of service he has rendered to the society. We have great respect for his work. Legally, whatever is there against him is a different matter,” he said.The Bench also referred to the criticism that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the judiciary had received following Swamy’s death.It expressed regret over how, in several cases, undertrials languished in prisons waiting for the trial to begin.The Bench, however, also said it had ensured to remain fair while passing orders on Swamy’s medical bail plea, as well as on the pleas filed by his co-accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case.“You came to us with his medical bail plea on May 28 and we acceded to every prayer, every time,” the court said to Swamy’s advocate, senior counsel Mihir Desai.“Outside, we are speechless. Only you (Desai) can clarify this. You have said it on record that you have no grievance with this court in the matter,” the HC said.The HC further said nobody mentions that this is the court which granted bail to (co-accused) Varavara Rao, despite vehement opposition.“We allowed (Rao’s) family to meet as we thought human angle has to be seen. In another case (Hany Babu), we sent to hospital of his choice (Breach Candy Hospital-a private medical facility),” the HC said.“We never anticipated this will happen (Swamy’s death in custody). What was on our minds, we can’t say now as we couldn’t pronounce our order,” the HC said referring to the pending medical bail plea of the late Jesuit priest.Swamy was arrested by the NIA in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case from Ranchi in October 2020. The tribal rights activist, who was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and several other ailments, spent most of his time in custody in the Taloja prison’s hospital in neighbouring Navi Mumbai.He was admitted to the state-run J J Hospital in Mumbai on two occasions and was shifted to the Holy Family Hospital, a private medical facility, on May 28, following the intervention of the bench led by Justice Shinde.On July 5, the bench was informed by the hospital authorities that Swamy had suffered from a cardiac arrest two days prior and was put on ventilator support.He never regained consciousness and was declared dead by the hospital authorities about an hour before Swamy’s medical bail plea was taken up for hearing by the HC, it was informed at that time.On Monday, following the HC’s observations on it having passed fair orders, Desai said, “Let me say on record that I am extremely happy with various benches of the HC that heard this matter.” Desai, however, urged the HC to let Swamy’s aide and another priest, father Frazer Mascarenhas, to participate in the magisterial inquiry that was initiated under Section 176 of the CrPC following the undertrial’s death.He also urged the high court to direct the magistrate conducting the inquiry to adhere to the UNHRC guidelines on such inquiries, and to ask for a report of the probe to be submitted in the HC.Desai was Swamy’s counsel in the appeals challenging a special court order denying him bail on both medical grounds and merits.Swamy had also filed a plea in the HC just weeks before his death, challenging section 45-D of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), that barred grant of bail to any person accused under the Act.Advocate Sandesh Patil, who appeared for the NIA, on Monday said the central agency was objecting to Desai’s request since the HC was hearing appeals challenging a bail order and issues related to the inquiry could not be raised on the same pleas.“Time and again it is projected that the NIA is responsible for whatever has happened, and that jail authorities are responsible too,” Patil told the HC.The Bench, however, told him there could be “no control on who says what outside on the matter”.“You take instructions on how many witnesses, how long will the trial take. We have to look at it practically,” the HC said to the NIA counsel.“The concern is that for how many years can people be asked to languish in jail without a trial. Not only in this case, but the question will arise on other cases also,” it said.The HC will continue hearing the pleas on July 23.The Elgar Parishad case is related to inflammatory speeches made at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city.The police had claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.The NIA later took over the probe into the case.

20-07-2021||New Delhi||Rahul Gandhi, Prashant Kishore, 2 Union Ministers, ex-EC Lavasa among Pegasus ‘targets’||Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, BJP ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Singh Patel, as also former Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa and poll strategist Prashant Kishor were among those whose phone numbers were listed as potential “targets” for hacking through an Israeli spyware sold only to the government agencies, an international media consortium reported on Monday.Also read: Probe: Journalists, activists among firm’s spyware targetsOver 300 phone numbers of ministers, journos, activists, bizmen in India 'hacked': ReportPegasus report: Attempt to malign Indian democracy, says IT Minister Vaishnaw in Lok SabhaNot a shred of evidence linking Modi govt or BJP to Pegasus story, says Prasad; Cong demands sacking of Amit ShahThe Wire news portal, in the second part of its revelations from the international collaborative investigation called the Pegasus Project, reported that the phone number of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee and 11 phone numbers belonging to the Supreme Court staffer and her close relatives, who accused former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment in April 2019, were selected as targets for surveillance.The government dismissed the media reports on the use of Pegasus software to snoop on Indians, saying the allegations levelled just ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament are aimed at “maligning Indian democracy”.In a suo motu statement in Lok Sabha, IT and Communications Minister Vaishnaw said that with several checks and balances being in place, “any sort of illegal surveillance” by unauthorised persons is not possible in India.The number of Vaishnav, who recently became a minister, was among the 300 verified Indian numbers listed as potential targets for surveillance during 2017-2019 by a client of the Israel-based NSO group, The Wire said.While the Congress demanded the sacking of Home Minister Amit Shah and a probe into the “role” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the matter, the BJP hit out at the Opposition party over its attack and claimed that there is not a “shred of evidence” to link either the ruling party or the Modi dispensation with the matter.Reacting sharply to the report, Shah said, “disruptors and obstructers will not be able to derail India’s development trajectory through their conspiracies” and asserted that it the report has been “amplified by few with only one aim - to humiliate India at world stage.”                Releasing the fresh tranche of investigation, The Wire said at least two mobile phone accounts used by former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi were listed as potential targets by “an official Indian client of the Israeli surveillance technology vendor, NSO Group”.The forensic inspection of a cross-section of phones drawn from this list by Amnesty International’s technical lab has confirmed the presence of Pegasus spyware in as many as 37 instruments, 10 of which are in India.Such was the apparent interest in Gandhi that the numbers of five of his social friends and acquaintances were also placed on the list of potential targets, the report said.Gandhi’s phones are not among those examined as he no longer has the handsets he used at the time that his numbers appear to have been selected for targeting -- from mid-2018 to mid-2019, the report said. In the absence of forensics, it is not possible to conclusively establish whether Pegasus was deployed against Gandhi, it said.In his remarks, Vaishnaw said, “A highly sensational story was published by a web portal yesterday night.... The press report appeared a day before the monsoon session of the Parliament.“This cannot be a coincidence. In the past similar claims were made regarding the use of Pegasus on WhatsApp. Those reports have no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties.... The press report of July 18, 2021 also appeared to be an attempt to malign the Indian democracy and a well-established institution,” the minister said.The report has been published by The Wire news portal from India as also 16 other international publications, including Washington Post, The Guardian and Le Monde, as media partners to an investigation conducted by Paris-based media non-profit organisation Forbidden Stories and rights group Amnesty International into a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers from across the world that are believed to have been the target of surveillance through Pegasus software of Israeli surveillance company NSO Group.Besides the numbers of Gandhi and Union Ministers—Vaishnaw and Prahlad Singh Patel, other names whose number were listed as potential targets, includes founder of key election watchdog Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) Jagdeep Chhokhar and top virologist Gagandeep Kang, The Wire said.Also on the list was the personal secretary to Vasundhara Raje Scindia, when she was the BJP’s chief minister in Rajasthan, and Sanjay Kachroo, who worked as an officer on special duty (OSD) for Smriti Irani in her first years as a Union Minister in the Modi government from 2014-2015, it said.Other junior politicians linked to the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s leader Pravin Togadia are other individuals whose numbers figure in the database.The news portal said the list reveals that several people associated with the functioning of elections were also selected for potential surveillance, including Lavasa, the only member of the three-member Election Commission to rule that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had violated the Model Code of Conduct while campaigning for the 2019 General Election.The leaked data also includes Hari Menon, the India head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and at least one other foundation employee, who were selected in mid-2019.Gandhi told The Wire that he had received suspicious WhatsApp messages in the past – one of the known vectors for a spyware hack – and frequently changed numbers and instruments so as to make it “a little harder for them” to target him.Asked for his reaction to the news that he had been placed on a list of potential targets for hacking, Gandhi told The Wire, “Targeted surveillance of the type you describe whether in regard to me, other leaders of the Opposition or indeed any law-abiding citizen of India is illegal and deplorable.”      “If your information is correct, the scale and nature of surveillance you describe goes beyond an attack on the privacy of individuals. It is an attack on the democratic foundations of our country. It must be thoroughly investigated and those responsible be identified and punished,” the former Congress chief said.Such was the apparent interest in Gandhi that the numbers of five of his social friends and acquaintances were also placed on the list of potential targets, the report said.

You are aware of the drama unfolding in Punjab and Rajasthan,” he said.  Accusing those behind the story of trying to create disharmony, Prasad claimed that even those who broke the story say the presence of a phone number in the database does not mean the said phone number was infected. “Have some (political)parties and their leaders become ‘supari’ agents of such conspiracy,” he questioned, adding that the only reason behind the “conspiracy” is that there are some people who are upset with the development and progress being made by a confident India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “People who upset with India’s progress are trying to block the story of an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, he said, also wondering why such situations are created whenever something important is happening in the country”. “It is all very suspicious,” he added  Cong demands sacking of Home Minister Amit ShahMeanwhile, accusing the government of “treason” and compromising on national security over the Pegasus spyware issue, the Congress on Monday demanded the sacking of Home Minister Amit Shah and a probe into the “role of Prime Minister” Narendra Modi in the matter.Addressing a press conference here, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala held Shah responsible for the Pegasus spying issue and said his party’s first demand is his dismissal from the post he occupies.He said the Congress will take all Opposition parties on board over the issue and decide whether to ask for a judicial or parliamentary probes in the matter.“Our first demand is the immediate sacking of Minister of Home and Internal security Amit Shah and a probe into the role of the Prime Minister in the matter,” he told reporters.Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said Shah should immediately resign as he “does not deserve” to occupy the position he is holding.Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said “Modiji promotes digital India, but what we are seeing is Surveillance India”.Accusing the Modi government of murdering the Constitution, law and dismantling national security, Surjewala said it is guilty of “treason”.“The Modi government is the deployer and executor of this illegal and unconstitutional snooping and spying racket through Israeli surveillance software Pegasus,” he said.The government has denied any role in it. —with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-a-shred-of-evidence-linking-modi-govt-or-bjp-to-pegasus-story-says-prasad-cong-demands-sacking-of-amit-shah-285423

20-07-2021||---||Harsimrat Badal, Manish Tewari, Bhagwant Mann move adjournment motions in Lok Sabha on farmers' agitation||New Delhi, July 19The issue of farmers’ agitation against three agricultural reform legislations resonated in the Lok Sabha on Monday with the Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal, CPM, RLP, DMK and BSP members moving adjournment motions to discuss the matter.Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal moved the motion on the behalf of the Akali Dal. The motion was signed by leaders of the DMK (TR Baalu), BSP, CPM and RLP (Hanuman Beniwal).Congress MP from Anandpur Sahib Manish Tewari moved the motion too, demanding discussion on the concerns of farmers.The Shiromani Akali Dal sought an adjournment to the listed business of the Lok Sabha to discuss the serious situation arising out of the “nationwide crisis which has been raging over the enactment of the three farm laws by the House”.Seeking the adjournment through a motion, in a letter to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Harsimrat said these Bills had been “pushed through the House in utter disregard of opposition by the farmers, khet mazdoors and farm traders”.She demanded that the House include the names of the “martyrs of the farmers’ movement” and pay them tributes during the obituaries.“They have laid down their lives in a peaceful, democratic movement fighting for the just cause of the farmers and farm labourers,” she said, adding, “This House must acknowledge their martyrdom.”Harsimrat said the three Farm Acts were “in brazen violation of the spirit of federalism as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Constitution, as agriculture is a state subject”.In her letter, she pointed to the “massive national outrage against these Bills which have since been signed into laws despite opposition by farmers."Hundreds of farmers and farm labourers have lost their lives in this struggle against the Centre. But the Central government has refused to show the sensitivity expected of a responsible and democratically elected government. Never in the history of free India has the country witnessed such outrage against a legislation passed by this august House,” she lamented.Congress MP Tewari while seeking a discussion on farmers’ agitation said, “In large numbers, farmers have come out against the three acts passed by the Central government which threaten their livelihood.  The acts have been opposed on the grounds that they will make the farmers vulnerable to exploitation by the corporate sector. The government has failed to assuage the concerns of the farmers or present any viable alternative to these acts.”He said there is a palpable fear among the farmers that the Minimum Support Price will be dismantled and role of state governments in Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees will be affected. “About 300 farmers have died while protesting against the laws,” he said.AAP MP Bhagwant Mann also moved the adjournment motion demanding suspension of business to discuss farmers' issue.Congress MP from Rajya Sabha Partap Bajwa also submitted an adjournment motion to chairman of the House to suspend business for discussions on farmers issue on Tuesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/harsimrat-badal-manish-tewari-bhagwant-mann-move-adjournment-motions-in-lok-sabha-on-farmers-agitation-285369
