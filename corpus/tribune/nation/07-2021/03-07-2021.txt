03-07-2021||New Delhi||Mortality ‘significantly’ increased in 2nd Covid wave in India: Study||The second Covid wave in India was slightly different than the first one, with higher mortality being reported in all age groups except those below 20 years, and more people developing acute shortness of breath and requiring supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, a new study said on Saturday.The study -- Clinical profile of hospitalized Covid-19 patients in first and second wave of the pandemic: Insights from an Indian registry based observational study - was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research and has been done by experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), All India Institute of Medical Sciences and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).India witnessed a massive second surge of Covid-19 cases since March after a period of decline from September last year.Data collected under the National Clinical Registry for Covid-19 (NCRC) were analysed to describe the differences in demographic and clinical features of Covid-19 patients recruited during these two successive waves, the study stated.The NCRC, launched in September last year, is an ongoing multi-centre observational initiative, which provided the platform for the current investigation.Demographic, clinical, treatment and outcome data of hospitalized and confirmed Covid-19 patients were captured in an electronic data portal from 41 hospitals across India, it said.Patients enrolled between September 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021 and February 1 to May 11, 2021 constituted the participants of the two successive waves respectively, it said.As on May 11 this year, 18,961 individuals were recruited in the registry, 12,059 and 6,903 reflecting in-patients from the first and second waves respectively, it said.The mean age of the patients was significantly lower in the second wave with higher proportion of patients in the younger age group intervals of less than 20 years, and 20-39 years, the study said.It said approximately 70 per cent of the admitted patients were above 40 years in both the waves of the pandemic and the proportion of males were slightly lower in second wave as compared to the first.The most common symptom was fever in both the waves, it said.“In the second wave, a significantly higher proportion complained of shortness of breath, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), required supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation.“Mortality also was significantly increased in the second wave in all age groups except in below 20 years,” it said.“The second wave of Covid-19 in India was slightly different in presentation than the first wave, with a younger demography, lesser comorbidities, and presentation with breathlessness in greater frequency,” the study stated.Noting that there were some limitations of the present investigation, it said the registry did not capture the initial phase of the first wave as data collection commenced from September 1, 2020.There has been a considerable lag in obtaining a complete dataset due to time required for data verification and the unprecedented workload of the healthcare team involved in Covid-19 care. Hence, the outcome data were not available for many cases from the second wave, the study said.Though the data was submitted from more than 40 hospitals across the country to the NCRC, data from some states like Maharashtra and Kerala were missing due to logistical reasons, thus constraining the national representation, it said.Rapid and explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second wave of the pandemic in India resulting in huge caseload on the entire healthcare system of the country including the participating institutes, did not allow enrolling all in-patients in our registry.

03-07-2021||Kolkata||BJP demands immediate civic polls in Bengal||A day after the West Bengal government wrote to the EC urging it to conduct pending by-elections to seven assembly constituencies in the state, the BJP on Saturday demanded that the polls to over 100 civic bodies, due for over a year-and-a-half, should be held at the earliest.A total of 107 civic bodies, including Kolkata and Asansol municipal corporations, are currently being run by administrators appointed by the state government.‘Didimoni’ (Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) is in undue haste to hold the assembly by-polls as she is yet to be elected from any seat after losing in Nandigram. She is feeling impatient as she is still the CM and has to be elected from a constituency within six months, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said.“The terms of most of the municipalities and municipal corporations have expired more than a year back and the TMC is trying to retain control over these boards through the backdoor. That should also be kept in mind.“In such situations, we wonder if the State Election Commission, which conducts the civic and panchayat polls, is in deep slumber. If they don’t have any responsibility in holding the civic polls, the people will continue to suffer and remain deprived,” Ghosh told reporters.BJP sources said that the party hopes to fare well in the civic elections in Kolkata and other urban areas after the fake vaccine racket and the alleged proximity between the kingpin and some influential TMC leaders.On the issue of by-elections to the seven assembly constituencies, Ghosh said, “The Election Commission of India will take an appropriate decision at the appropriate time. We are ready for the polls.”The West Bengal government has urged the EC to conduct the pending by-polls, while promising strict adherence to COVID protocols.Of the seven assembly seats, Bhowanipore in Kolkata is the most high-profile as the TMC chief is speculated to contest from the constituency, which happens to be her home turf, after her defeat in Nandigram to the leader of opposition, Suvendu Adhikari.State minister and senior TMC leader Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay has recently vacated Bhowanipore and is scheduled to contest from Khardah, where winning party candidate Kajal Sinha died of COVID-19 after voting was over.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-demands-immediate-civic-polls-in-bengal-277768
03-07-2021||New Delhi||Covid jabs to key workers, then elderly followed by comorbid people of 24-60 years hikes impact||In high-transmission settings, vaccinating key workers, including healthcare professionals, first, followed by those above 60 years and then comorbid individuals aged 24-60 years will have a greater impact in reducing Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, according to a mathematical model-based analysis.Highlighting the findings of the study, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in low-intensity transmission areas such as sparsely populated areas, vaccinating individuals with comorbidity after key workers and then reaching out to those above 60 years appears to be an elegant public health approach.The study—‘India’s pragmatic vaccination strategy against Covid-19: A mathematical modelling-based analysis’—authored by Sandip Mandal, Balram Bhargava and Samiran Panda from the ICMR and Nimalan Arinaminpathy, from the Imperial College, London, has been published at peer-reviewed open access journal BMJ Open on July 2.In this study, researchers used a simple mathematical model of transmission dynamics, to show how vaccination efforts in the country might best be focused in order to reduce mortality most effectively with a finite vaccine supply.As part of the analysis, a comparison of different vaccine strategies was done by targeting priority groups such as key workers, including healthcare professionals, individuals aged between 24 and 60 years with comorbidities and those above 60 years.“Our results suggest that vaccinating all defined priority groups would have a substantial reduction in overall health burden compared with a scenario of no vaccination and complete lifting of restrictions,” the study said.According to the study, the priority groups together account for about 18 per cent of India’s population.An infection-preventing vaccine with 60 per cent efficacy covering all these groups would reduce peak symptomatic incidence by 20.6 per cent and cumulative mortality by 29.7 per cent, the results of the study showed.A similar vaccine with the ability to prevent symptoms but not infection will reduce peak incidence of symptomatic cases by 10.4 per cent and cumulative mortality by 32.9 per cent, it said.“In the event of insufficient vaccine supply to cover all priority groups, model projections suggest that after key workers, vaccine strategy should prioritise all who are above 60 and subsequently individuals with comorbidities,” the study stated.In settings with the weakest transmission, such as sparsely populated rural areas, those with comorbidities should be prioritised after keyworkers. An appropriately targeted vaccination strategy would witness substantial mitigation of the impact of Covid-19 in a country like India with wide heterogeneity, it said.“Smart vaccination, based on public health considerations, rather than mass vaccination, appears prudent,” it concluded. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-jabs-to-key-workers-then-elderly-followed-by-comorbid-people-of-24-60-years-hikes-impact-277766
03-07-2021|| New Delhi||Covid 3rd wave may see half the cases recorded during second surge, says government panel scientist||The third wave of coronavirus could hit the peak between October-November if Covid appropriate behaviour is not followed, but may see half the daily cases recorded during the second surge, according to a scientist of a government panel tasked with modelling of Covid-19 cases.He, however, said the third wave could spread faster if any new virulent variant emerges.Manindra Agarwal, involved in the ‘Sutra Model' or the mathematical projection of trajectory of Covid-19, also said the model has three scenarios—optimistic, intermediate and pessimistic—for the prediction of the third wave.The Department of Science and Technology had last year formed the panel to forecast the surge of coronavirus cases using mathematical models.The panel had also received flak for not predicting the exact nature of the second wave of Covid.Agarwal, who is part of the three-member panel, said the loss of immunity, effects of vaccination and possibility of a more virulent variant, have been factored while predicting the third wave, something which was not done during modelling the second wave.“We have created three scenarios. One is ‘optimistic' one. In this, we assume that life goes back to normal by August, and there is no new mutant. The second is ‘intermediate' one. In this, we assume that vaccination is 20 per cent less effective in addition to optimistic scenario assumptions.“Third is ‘pessimistic' one. This has one assumption different from intermediate one: a new, 25 per cent more infectious mutant spreads in August (it is not delta+, which is not more infectious than delta),” he said in a series of tweets.According to the graph shared by Agarwal, the second wave is likely to plateau by mid-August, and the third wave could reach its peak between October and November.In case of the ‘pessimistic' scenario, the third wave could see cases rise up between 1,50,000 to 2,00,000 in the country, the scientist noted.The figure is less than half of what was recorded when the deadly second wave had hit its peak in the first half of May, flooding hospitals with patients and claiming thousands of lives daily.On May 7, India had recorded 4,14,188 Covid-19 cases.“If a new mutant comes, the third wave could spread rapidly, but it will be half of what the second wave was. Delta variant is infecting people who were infected with a different variant. So this has been taken into consideration,” Agarwal said.He said as vaccination progresses, the possibility of a third or fourth wave will be less.“In case of an ‘optimistic' scenario, the daily cases could be in the range of 50,000 to 1,00,000. In case of the intermediate scenario (if it is assumed that vaccination is 20 per cent less effective, in addition to optimistic scenario assumptions), the cases could be in the range of 50,000 to 1,00,000, but more than the optimistic scenario,” the panel member noted.M Vidyasagar, a scientist at IIT-Hyderabad, who is also involved in modelling of Covid cases, said hospitalisation could be less during the third wave.He cited the example of the UK where in January more than 60,000 cases were reported with daily deaths touching 1,200. However, during the fourth wave, the number dropped to 21,000 cases and just 14 deaths.“Vaccination played a major role in bringing down the cases that needed hospitalisation in the UK. This has been factored while coming out with the three scenarios,” Vidyasagar told PTI.The government has been emphasising over vaccinations as the fear of the third wave looms.Agarwal also explained the reasons behind the delay in coming out with an analysis for the third wave.“It took us a while to do the analysis for three reasons. First, loss of immunity in the recovered population. Second, vaccination-induced immunity. Each of these two (factors) need to be estimated for future.“And third, how to incorporate these two factors in the Sutra model. Fortunately, it turned out that both can be incorporated by suitably changing contact rate and reach parameters. So that takes care of the third factor. The first two factors required detailed analysis,” he tweeted.‘Contact rate' is how fast the infection spreads and ‘reach parameter' is the percentage of population the pandemic is active in.Agarwal added that his team went through studies done in the past on loss of immunity while making the Sutra Model.“Similarly, we also looked at the projected vaccination rate over the next few months, including the effects of vaccine-hesitancy, and arrived at month-wise estimates for vaccination,” he said.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-3rd-wave-may-see-half-the-cases-recorded-during-second-surge-says-government-panel-scientist-277765
03-07-2021||Mumbai||MVA will pass resolution in monsoon session against three central farm laws: Minister||NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Saturday said the state government will pass a resolution during the monsoon session of the state legislature next week against the three central farm laws even as he denied certain remarks attributed to the party chief Sharad Pawar about them.The monsoon session of the state legislature is scheduled to be held on July 5 and 6.“All the three parties (Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are opposed to the three laws passed by the Central government. Our opposition to these laws remains. The state government will pass a resolution in the monsoon session of the state legislature to oppose these laws,” Malik said in a statement.He said a committee set up to study the three laws will speak to farmers’ leaders to prepare a draft law to be enacted by the state government.“Until farmers accept the draft law, the state government will not go ahead,” Malik added.He said the NCP was of the view that the three central laws should be repealed.“Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar made a remark about Sharad Pawar’s views on the three farm laws which the NCP chief never said. Pawar did not speak on the three central laws. Pawar was only giving information about what steps the state government was planning against the central acts,” Malik stated.Talking to reporters on Thursday, Pawar said the Centre should hold talks with farmers from North India who are protesting against the new agriculture laws for the last seven months.“The Centre should step up dialogue with them. Bringing political differences in the issue was wrong,” he added.The NCP chief had also said the Maharashtra government favours amendments in the three new farm laws enacted by the Centre last year before their implementation in the state.Farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November 2020 with their demands that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mva-will-pass-resolution-in-monsoon-session-against-three-central-farm-laws-minister-277764
03-07-2021||Bengaluru||Karnataka further eases Covid-19 curbs with effect from July 5||The Karnataka government further relaxed the Covid-19-related restrictions allowing certain activities, including re-opening of religious places and conducting weddings.The relaxations would be in place for the next 15 days from July 6, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa said after chairing a meeting with his Cabinet colleagues and senior officials on Saturday.Theatres, cinemas, and pubs would remain closed while swimming pools would be opened only for competitive training purposes.Further, sports complexes and stadia shall be opened only for the purpose of practice whereas social, political, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious functions and other gatherings and large congregations have been prohibited.Weddings and family functions are permitted with the presence of not more than 100 people. Places of worship are allowed to open only for ‘darshan’ not for ‘sevas’. The order said cremation and funerals would be allowed with a maximum of 20 people while public transport is allowed to operate up to its seating capacity.“Shops, restaurants, malls, and private offices have to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour failing which action will be initiated under the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” Yediyurappa said.Educational institutions, tutorials and colleges would remain shut until further orders, he said.Night curfew would continue to be in force from 9 pm to 5 am the next day, he said.Deputy Commissioners of the districts, based on the assessment of the Covid situation and after consultation with the district-in-charge Minister, may impose additional containment measures, he added.The Covid-19-related restrictions came into effect from April 27 and were made stringent from May 10 to June 14 in view of the alarming rise in the virus cases in April, which had gone beyond 50,000 cases a day while the daily fatalities exceeded 600 cases.The active cases too went beyond six lakh.The subsequent weeks saw a big medical emergency unfolding in the city with most of the hospitals running short of beds, oxygen, and life-saving drugs.As an effect of the lockdown, the daily cases came down significantly.Today, 2,082 fresh cases, 86 fatalities and 48,116 active cases were reported.The government started easing restrictions on June 14.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-further-eases-covid-19-curbs-with-effect-from-july-5-277759

03-07-2021||Kolkata||‘Blot on democracy’: TMC on BJP ruckus in assembly during Governor’s address||The Trinamool Congress hit out at the BJP on Saturday for creating ruckus during Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s inaugural address to the newly constituted assembly.Addressing a press conference, TMC’s Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said the opposition party’s actions in the House on Friday were a “blot on democracy”.“Listening to the governor’s address does not tantamount to one blindly supporting everything in it. It is courtesy. One can certainly vent his objection to the address in the reply speech,” he said.The opening session of the newly-constituted West Bengal assembly got off to a stormy start as the governor was forced to cut short his speech amid ruckus by the opposition BJP MLAs who took offence after finding “no mention” of post-poll violence in the address.Roy alleged that the BJP was conspiring to divide Bengal, urging people to thwart any such attempt.He also reiterated the demand for by-elections to the seven assembly seats in the state at the earliest.“The Election Commission went ahead with polling despite the spike in COVID-19 cases in April, and now that the positivity rate has gone down so much, why can’t the by-elections be held?” he asked.Roy said the Trinamool Congress would soon reach out to President Ramnath Kovind, demanding the dismissal of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta over his alleged meeting with the state’s Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blot-on-democracy-tmc-on-bjp-ruckus-in-assembly-during-governors-address-277745

03-07-2021||New Delhi||Covid will be reduced to an endemic in future, zero figure in Delhi unlikely: Experts||Cases of Covid-19 might be declining steadily but as the virus is mutating, attaining that magical zero figure in Delhi is unlikely, experts have said, and predicted that coronavirus will be reduced to an endemic in the future.The Centre, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Cabinet colleague Satyendar Jain had said last year that one will have to learn with coronavirus and make its prevention norms a part of our lives.Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital said there will always be a few cases of the virus.“Zero is an unlikely figure. The virus is mutating and it is difficult to predict its future behaviour,” he said.Explaining why the virus has posed such a challenge, Dr Sanjeev K. Singh, Resident Medical Director, Amrita Hospitals in Faridabad said it is an mRNA virus which keeps changing its structure.“These virus is smart and just for the sake of living, it will keep mutating. Covid will be there and may not be affecting all 193 countries but it will be there.“Coming down to zero won’t be achievable. In hospitals for getting surgeries, one has to get tested for Hepatitis and HIV. Eventually, you will be tested for Covid too,” he said.Dr Gauri Agarwal, IVF expert and founder of Seeds of Innocence said keeping the 1918 pandemic as a yardstick, we know that eradicating the virus is an unrealistic possibility.“As COVID-19 gradually becomes an endemic, likely in 12-24 months, it will probably stop being a statistic that is being watched on a daily basis. Hence, while we may see zero reportable cases, there may never be a time with actual zero cases ever.”Amid concerns over the possibility of a third wave and emergence of the Delta Plus variant, experts assuaged fears of that possible wave being more lethal since a majority of the population has been infected.“In my view, if a new strain doesn’t come up against which the vaccines are not effective, I don’t think the third wave will be as lethal as the second wave,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, Senior Pulmonologist, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi.He highlighted that coronavirus will become an endemic in days to come.Agreeing with Chawla, Dr. Rommel Tickoo, Director, Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare, said we are still in the second Covid wave.“Seventy per cent of the cases are limited to Maharashtra, and southern states. In north Indian states, there was a sudden exponential increase and the virus infected a large number of people together which is why the steady decline.“The effect of the virus will be blunted because of the majority of people being exposed to the virus and vaccination,” he added.Tickoo said there might be a spike but if the virus doesn’t become multi-resistant and undergoes mutations, the third wave won’t be as deadly as the second wave and might be lesser in severity than even the first wave.Delhi had reeled under a brutal second wave with oxygen shortage and unavailability of beds adding to woes of patients. However, in the last few days cases have shown a steady decline with the positivity rate coming down below one per cent.On Monday, the city had recorded 59 cases, the lowest single-day rise this year, and two deaths. After that, the cases have hovered around the 90 mark.Talking about the fluctuations in cases, Dr Gurpreet Sandhu, President, Council for Healthcare and Pharma, said, “On the fluctuation module, we are aware that the testing protocols in India are very abysmal, we do not follow standard protocol of testing. “Secondly, some people in rural community in India are still not aware about the what vaccine is for, how it will affect them or how it will protect them from the virus.”Experts unanimously vouched for vaccination as the answer to blunt the effect of the virus.“The effect will be blunted because of the majority of people being exposed to the virus and the vaccination. As the vaccination numbers go up we will be able to blunt the virus impact. More than 50 lakh people have at least received the first while more than 18 lakh have been fully vaccinated,” Tickoo said.However, he said, vaccine hesitancy is becoming problematic.“People still give preference to false news. It has the potential to derail our ambitious vaccination programme. Roping in celebrities, credible voices will help it while doctors have a big role to play. In the UK and the US, majority of the population has received their first doses. In the US they have taken off the masks. We should see these examples,” he added.

03-07-2021||Bengaluru||Special court rejects closure of investigation by Lokayukta police against Karnataka CM Yediyurappa||In a setback to Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, a special court for public representatives on Saturday dismissed the ‘B-Report’ by the Lokayukta police seeking the closure of investigation against him in a 15-year-old case relating to denotification of prime land in Bengaluru.The court also directed the Lokayukta police to expedite the investigation and furnish the final or additional final report.Judge Sridhar Gopalakrishna Bhat said in his order, “The B Report submitted by the investigation officer under section 173(2) of CrPC is hereby rejected.”   “Consequently, acting under section 156(3) of CrPC, the Deputy Superintendent of Police attached to the police wing of Karnataka Lokayuktha, Bengaluru is hereby directed to investigate the matter further in the light of the observation made in this order and to file final report/additional final report expeditiously as per law.” The court also reminded the investigation officer to keep in mind the observations made by the Karnataka High Court with regard to delay in conducting investigation.The case pertains to the denotification of prime land in Bellandur and Devarabeesanahalli, which was related to Varthur-Whitefield IT Corridor.The land was acquired in 2000-2001 for an IT park.However, in 2006-07, as the Deputy Chief Minister in the JD(S)-BJP coalition government headed by H D Kumaraswamy, Yediyurappa denotified the land according to the private complaint lodged by Vasudeva Reddy  with the Lokayukta court alleging irregularities in the denotification.The court directed the Lokayukta police to register a case, based on which a case was registered on February 21, 2015 under the Prevention of Corruption Act.In December 2020, Yediyurappa had filed a petition in the High Court seeking quashing of the case.Yediyurappa had contended that the High Court had quashed the same FIR against the then Industries minister and Congress leader R V Deshpande on October 9, 2015.Hence, the investigation against him based on the same FIR was illegal but the court rejected his argument.Dismissing the petition, Justice John Michael Cunha directed the police to intensify the investigation.The Lokayukta police had filed a ‘B Report’ seeking closure of the investigation which Reddy had challenged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/special-court-rejects-closure-of-investigation-by-lokayukta-police-against-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-277741
03-07-2021||---||Freelance journalist, accused of sharing info with Chinese Intel agencies, arrested under PMLA: ED||New Delhi, July 3The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday said it has arrested freelance journalist Rajeev Sharama under the criminal provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with a case relating to his alleged involvement in leakage and supply of sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers.Officials in the ED said, after the arrest, which took place on July 1, Sharma was produced before a special local court here, which granted the agency seven-day custody of the accused.Later, the ED in an official statement said, its probe found that 62-year-old Sharma “had supplied confidential and sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers, in exchange for remuneration thereby compromising the security and national interests of India”.“It was further revealed that cash for remuneration of Sharma and other unknown persons was being generated through a “hawala” by Mahipalpur-based (an area in Delhi) shell companies that were run by Chinese nationals, namely Zhang Cheng alias Suraj, Zhang Lixia alias Usha and Quing Shi, along with a Nepalese national, Sher Singh alias Raj Bohara,” the ED alleged.It further said that over and above the cash transaction, a huge number of transactions were made with various Chinese companies and some other trading companies in India, which are currently being examined by the agency.“These Chinese companies were acting as a conduit for the Chinese intelligence agencies to provide remuneration for persons like Sharma, who indulged in criminal activities,” the ED said, while claiming that Sharma also received money through “benami bank accounts” with a purpose of concealing his involvement in criminal activities.The ED case is based on a Delhi Police FIR filed under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) and various sections of the IPC against Sharma last year, after which he was arrested by the special cell on September 14, 2020. The Police in their FIR charged Sharma of passing on information about the Indian Army’s deployment and the country’s border strategy to Chinese intelligence.However, later in December 2020 Sharma was granted bail by the Delhi High Court following his prayer that the charge sheet was not filed within 60 days of his arrest.Sharma used to run a YouTube channel called “Rajeev Kishkindha”, which has thousands of followers. On the day of his arrest, he uploaded two videos, as in one of them he had claimed China would still do “mischief” despite talks with India amid border tensions. The other video deplored the state of journalism in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/freelance-journalist-accused-of-sharing-info-with-chinese-intel-agencies-arrested-under-pmla-ed-277737

The NDA got the majority inexplicably”.RJD supremo Lalu Prasad address on July 5 on the party’s 25th foundation day is expected to further charge up party leaders and workers.Prasad will be delivering his speech virtually from the national capital.Yadav also charged the chief minister with having promoted “corruption in transfers and postings by giving a free hand to his chosen bureaucrats” and referred to the recent episode of social welfare minister Madan Sahani threatening to resign miffed over officials obstructing transfers and postings approved by the cabinet member.“Nothing in Bihar moves without paying the ‘RCP tax’,” remarked Yadav, making an oblique reference to the chief ministers close aide and JD(U) national president RCP Singh.When asked about the controversy over alleged attempts of land grabbing and extortion by a brother of Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Renu Devi, Yadav remarked sarcastically “all your sins get washed away if you join that party. No action can be taken against you thereafter”.The RJD leader was also asked about his recent offer of support to LJPs Chrag Paswan, who has been cornered in the party founded by his father and headed by him following a rebellion led by his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras.“Our sympathies are with Chirag. He has been wronged. The split in LJP has been obviously engineered by the JD(U).“But he has to take a call whether he wants to remain with those believing in the Constitution or those swearing by Bunch of Thoughts”, said Yadav, referring to a famous work of M S Golwalkar, one of the prime ideologues of BJPs parent body, the RSS.When asked what would be his partys strategy in the upcoming monsoon session of the state assembly, the leader of the opposition said “we will have to discuss that. The last session saw unprecedented things happening, when honourable members were dragged out of the premises by the police and physically harmed and female legislators were treated in the most disgraceful manner”.The state cabinet has approved a proposal to call the monsoon session of the two houses of the Bihar legislature from July 26 to July 30.During the budget session, members of the Grand Alliance which is helmed by RJD, had held the Speaker hostage in his chamber in a bid to prevent passing of a bill that aimed to give the police force more teeth.The Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021 was later on passed by voice vote with the opposition staging a walkout.“It is the same House on the floor of which Karpoori Thakur had staged a demonstration that continued late in the night. Never before, though, was police called inside”, lamented Yadav.Thakur, a former Chief Minister and one of the tallest OBC leaders of his generation, had been a mentor to both Lalu Prasad  who is Tejashwis father  and Nitish Kumar.

The countrymen are compulsorily paying the price of so called ‘acche din’ by buying expensive items. The countrymen want freedom from such so-called ‘acche din’,” a statement quoting the youth Congress leader said.He added that the people of the country were facing “extreme unemployment, economic helplessness and high inflation”.“In such a situation, instead of giving relief to the people, the government is grinding the people by trapping them in the wheel of inflation,” he said.On Thursday, the price of domestic cooking gas (LPG) was hiked by Rs 25.50 per 14.2 kg cylinder. A subsidised and non-subsidised cylinder now costs Rs 834.50 in Delhi.“During the Modi government, the prices of domestic gas cylinders have increased by up to Rs 140 in the last six months.

03-07-2021||New Delhi||First compliance report by Google, FB under new IT rules big step towards transparency: Prasad||IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday lauded major social media platforms such as Google, Facebook and Instagram for publishing their first compliance report on voluntary removal of offensive posts as per new IT rules, terming it a big step towards transparency.Under the new IT rules, large digital platforms that have over 5 million users are required to publish periodic compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken thereon.“Nice to see significant social media platforms like Google, Facebook and Instagram following the new IT Rules. First compliance report on voluntary removal of offensive posts published by them as per IT Rules is a big step towards transparency,” Prasad tweeted.The publishing of compliance reports by Google, Facebook and Instagram is bound to turn up the heat on Twitter, which has been engaged in a tussle with the Indian government over the new social media rules.The government has confronted Twitter for deliberate defiance and failure to comply with the country’s new IT rules, and not appointing the requisite officers, leading to it losing the ‘safe harbour’ immunity.Facebook on Friday said it “actioned” over 30 million content pieces across 10 violation categories during May 15-June 15 in the country, as the social media giant brought out its maiden monthly compliance report as mandated by the IT rules.It actioned content related to spam (25 million), violent and graphic content (2.5 million), adult nudity and sexual activity (1.8 million), and hate speech (311,000).Other categories under which content was actioned include bullying and harassment (118,000), suicide and self-injury (589,000), dangerous organisations and individuals: terrorist propaganda (106,000) and dangerous organisations and individuals: organised hate (75,000).Instagram took action against about two million pieces across nine categories during the same period.‘Actioned’ content refers to the number of pieces of content (such as posts, photos, videos or comments) where action has been taken for violation of standards. Taking action could include removing a piece of content from Facebook or Instagram or covering photos or videos that may be disturbing to some audiences with a warning.Google had stated that 27,762 complaints were received by Google and YouTube in April this year from individual users in India over alleged violation of local laws or personal rights, which resulted in removal of 59,350 pieces of content.Koo, in its report, said it has proactively moderated 54,235 content pieces, while 5,502 posts were reported by its users during June.Apart from publishing periodic compliance reports every month, the rules also require disclosure on the number of specific communication links or parts of information that the intermediary has removed or disabled access to in pursuance of any proactive monitoring conducted by using automated tools.According to the IT rules that aim to curb blatant abuse and misuse of platforms, the significant social media intermediaries are required to appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal officer and a grievance officer and these officials have to be resident in India.Non-compliance with the IT rules would result in these platforms losing their intermediary status that provides them immunity from liabilities over any third-party data hosted by them.Facebook recently named Spoorthi Priya as its grievance officer in India.India is a major market for global digital platforms. As per data cited by the government earlier this year, India has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 41 crore Facebook subscribers, 21 crore Instagram clients, while 1.75 crore account holders are on microblogging platform Twitter.Twitter’s “heavyhandednes”s has come under government scrutiny—the microblogging platform has not complied with the new rules—called the intermediary guidelines—that mandate setting up a robust grievance redressal mechanism and appointing officers to coordinate with law enforcement.Twitter recently named California-based Jeremy Kessel as India’s grievance redressal officer on the platform’s website—although the appointment does not meet the requirements of new IT rules that clearly mandate key officers including the grievance officer, to be resident in India.Notably, Twitter has lost its legal shield as an intermediary in India, becoming liable for users posting any unlawful content.Amid the standoff with the government over compliance with new IT rules, the Twitter website on Monday had displayed a wrong map of India that showed Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh as separate country.Twitter had removed the wrong map later that day, after facing heavy backlash from netizens.Even in the backdrop of heightened strained relations with the Indian government, Twitter recently briefly blocked IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from accessing his own account over alleged violation of US copyright law—a move that was immediately slammed by the minister as being arbitrary and in gross violation of IT rules.Twitter and the government have been on a collision course on multiple issues in the past months as well, including during the farmers’ protest and later when the microblogging platform tagged political posts of several leaders of the ruling party BJP as “manipulated media”, drawing a sharp rebuke from the Centre. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-compliance-report-by-google-fb-under-new-it-rules-big-step-towards-transparency-prasad-277722
03-07-2021||New Delhi||France begins judicial probe into Rafale deal with India: French media||A French judge has been appointed to lead a "highly sensitive" judicial investigation into alleged "corruption and favouritism" in the Rs 59,000 crore Rafale fighter jet deal with India, French investigative website Mediapart reported.Following the development, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come forward and order a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the Rafale deal."Corruption in the Rafale deal has come out clearly now. The stand of the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi has been vindicated today after the French government has ordered a probe," he told reporters at a press conference.However, there was no immediate reaction from the Indian government or the BJP. The Mediapart said the probe into the inter-governmental deal signed in 2016 was formally opened on June 14."A judicial probe into suspected corruption has been opened in France over the 7.8-billion-euro sale to India in 2016 of 36 Dassault-built Rafale fighter aircraft," the Mediapart reported on the latest development on the controversial deal.It said the investigation has been initiated by the national financial prosecutors' office (PNF).The judicial investigation has been ordered by France's national financial prosecutors' office, following Mediapart's fresh reports in April of alleged wrongdoings in the deal as well as a complaint filed by French NGO Sherpa that specialises in financial crime."The highly sensitive probe into the inter-governmental deal signed off in 2016 was formally opened on June 14th," the media report said.Mediapart journalist Yann Philippin, who filed a series of reports on the deal, said a first complaint was "buried" in 2019 by a former PNF chief."The judicial investigation was finally opened following the revelations of the investigation #RafalePapers of @mediapart and a new complaint from @Asso_Sherpa. A 1st complaint was buried in 2019 by the former PNF boss, Eliane Houlette," he tweeted.In April, Mediapart, citing an investigation by the country's anti-corruption agency, reported that Dassault Aviation had paid about one million Euros to an Indian middleman.Dassault Aviation has rejected the allegations of corruption, saying no violations were reported in the frame of the contract.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had inked a Rs 59,000-crore deal on September 23, 2016, to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation after a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime.The Congress accused the government of massive irregularities in the deal, alleging that it was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government during the negotiations for the MMRCA.Prior to the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the Congress raised several questions about the deal and alleged corruption but the government rejected all the charges.

03-07-2021||Mumbai||Homeless, beggars should work; everything can't be provided to them by state: Bombay High Court||The Bombay High Court on Saturday said homeless persons and beggars should also work for the country as everything cannot be provided to them by the state.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni said this while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Brijesh Aarya, seeking directions to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to provide nutritious meals thrice a day, potable water, shelter and clean public toilets for homeless persons, beggars and poor people in the city.The BMC informed the court that food packets were being distributed to such people all over Mumbai with the help of NGOs, and sanitary napkins were being provided to the women from this section of society.The court accepted this submission and said no further direction is required to augment the distribution."They (homeless persons) should also work for the country. Everyone is working. Everything cannot be provided by the state. You (petitioner) are just increasing the population of this section of society,” the high court said.The court also raised questions on the petitioner, saying that granting all the prayers sought in the petition would be like an "invitation to people not to work".The court, in its order, noted that public toilets in the city and across the state at present charge a minimum amount for usage, and directed the Maharashtra government to consider allowing homeless persons to use such facility free of charge.“We direct the state government to look if the homeless persons can use these toilets free of charge,” the bench said.The bench also noted that the petition lacks details of who a homeless is, population of homeless persons in the city and so on.

03-07-2021||New Delhi||Court extends interim protection given to Lakha Sidhana in R-Day violence case||Saying it would “not intervene in things where fundamental rights are involved”, a Delhi court on Saturday extended the interim protection given to alleged gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana in connection with the violence in Red Fort on Republic Day.Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau directed Delhi Police not to arrest Sidhana till July 20. The court said it did not want a ‘Jail Bharo Andolan’ to start.Sidhana, who was earlier granted protection till July 3, has been directed to join the probe.“We do not want Jail Bharo Andolan to start. These are political issues. If they (protesters) wanted to highlight the issue, are they wrong? I will not intervene in things where fundamental rights are involved,” the judge said while granting him relief.On January 26, protesting farmers had clashed with police during the tractor rally against three farm laws and stormed into the Red Fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes and injuring scores of policemen.Fearing arrest, Sidhana, through his advocates Jaspreet Singh Rai and Jasdeep Dhillon, moved Delhi's Tis Hazari court seeking anticipatory bail. His counsel asserted that he had no role to play in the incident.Public Prosecutor Pankaj Bhatia, representing the police, told the court that Sidhana had invited the protesters to the Red Fort and is one of the main conspirators in the case.The prosecutor said he stayed outside the fort area when the violence took place, to which the judge said, “If his presence is not there, then we cannot do anything about it. Interim protection extended till July 20.”Sidhana had earlier denied involvement in the Republic Day violence. According to the police, he has almost 20 cases registered against him, including that of robbery, murder, and assault on police.

Deshmukh has been asked to record his statement at the central agency's office in south Mumbai on Monday.Deshmukh (72) had skipped the two earlier summons citing his "vulnerability" to Covid as the reason for non-compliance in his last communication to the agency.He instead offered the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to record his statement through video-conferencing.The summons are in connection with the criminal case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) related to an alleged bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to Deshmukh's resignation in April this year.The first summons followed raids conducted by the ED at his premises in Mumbai and Nagpur apart from that of his aides and some others last month.The agency subsequently arrested two of his aides in this case, personal secretary Sanjeev Palande (51) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde (45).They are in ED custody till July 6.The agency, sources said, apart from the present case wanted to question Deshmukh about his and his family members' alleged links with certain shell companies that were being used to launder funds much before the present allegations of bribery in the Mumbai Police setup came to light.

03-07-2021||United Nations/Geneva||Delta variant is dangerous and is continuing to evolve and mutate: WHO chief||The world is in a very "dangerous period" of the Covid pandemic compounded by more transmissible variants like Delta, which is continuing to evolve and mutate, World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned.He said in countries with low vaccination coverage, terrible scenes of hospitals overflowing are again becoming the norm. “Compounded by more transmissible variants, like Delta, which is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many countries, we are in a very dangerous period of this pandemic,” Ghebreyesus said at a press briefing on Friday.“But no country is out of the woods yet. The Delta variant is dangerous and is continuing to evolve and mutate, which requires constant evaluation and careful adjustment of the public health response,” he said.Noting that the Delta variant has been detected in at least 98 countries and is spreading quickly in countries with low and high vaccination coverage, he said there are essentially two ways for countries to push back against new surges.“Public health and social measures like strong surveillance, strategic testing, early case detection, isolation and clinical care remain critical,” he said, adding that masking, physical distance, avoiding crowded places and keeping indoor areas well ventilated are the basis for the response.Ghebreyesus underscored that the world must equitably share protective gear, oxygen, tests, treatments and vaccines and stressed that he has urged leaders across the world to work together to ensure that by this time next year, 70 per cent of all people in every country are vaccinated."This is the best way to slow the pandemic, save lives, drive a truly global economic recovery and along the way prevent further dangerous variants from getting the upper hand. By the end of this September, we're calling on leaders to vaccinate at least 10 per cent of people in all countries,” he said.As new manufacturing hubs – including for mRNA vaccines – are being developed, the WHO chief said this could be accelerated by companies openly sharing technology and know-how. “In particular, I urge those companies – BioNTech, Pfizer and Moderna – to share their know-how so that we can speed up the development of new production. The sooner we start building more vaccine hubs and upping global vaccine capacity, the sooner we can diminish deadly surges,” he said. The Delta variant, first detected in India, is now being reported in nearly 100 countries, which is “likely an underestimate” and the highly transmissible strain is expected to rapidly outcompete other variants and become dominant globally over the coming months, WHO had said this week.

03-07-2021||New Delhi||ED attaches assets of Ahmed Patel's son-in-law, Dino Morea, DJ Aqeel in bank fraud case||The Enforcement Directorate on Friday said it has attached assets of late Congress leader Ahmed Patel's son-in-law, actors Dino Morea and Sanjay Khan and DJ Aqeel in a criminal investigation into a money laundering case linked to an alleged bank fraud.The case involves a Gujarat-based pharmaceutical company called Sterling Biotech group and its absconding main promoter brothers, Nitin Sandesara and Chetan Sandesara.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has alleged that this is a bigger bank scam in volume than that of the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud by fugitive diamantaires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, as it involves fraud to the tune of about Rs 16,000 crore.A consortium of banks led by Andhra Bank were alleged to have been duped, it said. The amount involved in the PNB case is pegged at about Rs 13,400 crore.The federal probe agency said four separate provisional orders were issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to attach the assets of the four people which are worth a total Rs 8.79 crore.Out of this, the value of attachment of assets for Khan is Rs 3 crore, for Dino Morea it is Rs 1.4 crore, for Aqeel Abdulkhalil Bachooali, popularly known as DJ Aqeel, it is Rs 1.98 crore and for Irfan Ahmed Siddiqui, who is Patel's son-in-law, it is Rs 2.41 crore, the central probe agency said in a statement.It added that the attached properties include three vehicles, several bank accounts, shares and mutual fund.Siddiqui, Morea (45) and Aqeel (44) have been questioned by the agency in the past in this case.The ED had recorded the statement of Sunil Yadav, an employee of the Sandesara family, where he told the agency that Siddiqui "occupied" a house in Delhi's Vasant Vihar, which reportedly belonged to Chetan Sandesara.The agency had then said that it has evidence to say that Morea and Aqeel were paid some money in an alleged unauthorised manner by the Gujarat-based pharmaceutical group between 2011-12 when they reportedly attended some family events organised by the Sandesara brothers.While Morea, also a model, has worked in a number of Hindi films, Aqeel is a popular DJ. Aqeel is married to the eldest daughter of veteran actor and director Sanjay Khan (80).Late Ahmed Patel and his son Faisal were also questioned and their statement was recorded by the ED last year in July in this case.Patel, after the fourth round of questioning, had told reporters that the ED action was "political vendetta and harassment against me and my family and I do not know under whose pressure they (investigators) are working."           He died on November 25 last year at the age of 71 resulting from complications linked to Covid.

These were optimistic estimates. We had used the term optimistic while making that projection which we collated based on the roadmap of our producers. But let me assure, the vaccine situation is satisfactory even if we depend on two main suppliers Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech,” Paul said, adding that the number of 216 crore doses by December was “aspirational”.Meanwhile, amid state governments continuing to flag vaccine shortages, the government said 12-crore doses would be available to states in July. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/optimistic-about-216-cr-jab-availability-by-dec-says-niti-277584

The three armed forces services don’t even have a common form needed for paperwork to initiate pension for a retiring personnel. There is manual intervention in processing the pension and the lacks centralised information for addressing queries of the pensioners.SPARSH intends to include all processes and functionalities needed for processing the pension. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-pension-plan-for-30-lakh-ex-servicemen-277579
03-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat resigns to avoid ‘constitutional crisis’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 2Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat submitted his resignation to Governor Baby Rani Maurya tonight, a little over three months after taking the charge from Trivendra Rawat.Tirath said he had resigned to avoid a constitutional crisis. He had taken oath as the CM on March 10 and had to be elected as MLA within six months to continue on the post. According to Section 151-A of the Representation of the People Act, a bypoll is not held in a state if less than a year is left for the Assembly term to end, which in the case of Uttarakhand is March 23, 2022. Rawat handed over the resignation letter to the Governor past 11 pm, hours after returning from Delhi where he was summoned by the top BJP leadership on Wednesday.The Uttarakhand BJP legislature party will meet Saturday to elect its new leader, who will be later sworn in as the next CM of the state where Assembly elections are due early next year. The meeting will be held under the chairmanship of BJP state president Madan Kaushik while Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar will be the central observer.To avoid another such situation, the BJP is expected to go with sitting MLAs as the next CM. The names of several legislators and ministers, including Satpal Maharaj, Banshidar Bhagat, Harak Singh Rawat, Dhan Singh Rawat, Pushkar Singh Dhami and Ritu Khanduri, are doing the rounds to replace Tirath Singh.Before leaving for Dehradun from Delhi (where he was summoned on Wednesday), Rawat met BJP chief JP Nadda to discuss the political situation and the need for his election to the state Assembly before September 10 to remain in office.Tirath’s resignation, meanwhile, comes amid reports of alleged deep divisions in various factions and the “three-CM jinx” the BJP faced in its earlier tenure in the state.Tirath joins the long list of Uttarakhand CMs with short tenures. The BJP will have three CMs during this regime as well. Not just the BJP, no Congress CM barring ND Tiwari has been able to complete his term in Uttarakhand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-cm-tirath-singh-rawat-resigns-to-avoid-constitutional-crisis-277578
03-07-2021||Vijay C Roy||Amid Covid, surge in pawned jewellery sale||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 2Like a few of his counterparts, Mohinder Sharma (name changed) took loan against gold jewellery, typically considered to be a last resort by most households, from a non-banking financial company (NBFC). Having lost his job amid Covid-induced economic crisis, he was unable to repay the interest. This resulted in the NBFC auctioning his gold.Sharma is not the lone example, the advertisements in newspapers announcing the auction of gold jewellery by NBFCs in the last few months indicate the severe distress faced by households. The NBFCs have a lion’s share in the gold loan segment.Ideally, in case of a default in repayment, customers are given notice to repay. In case, they fail to repay the loan, the gold is auctioned.Sample this, Manappuram Finance, a non-banking finance company in the gold loan segment, auctioned gold worth Rs 404 crore in the January-March 2021 period as against a total auction of only Rs 8 crore in the April-December 2020 period.“We had an auction of around one tonne this year, which is pretty high,” VP Nandakumar, managing director and chief executive officer of Manappuram Finance, said after the declaration of the company’s full-year results in May.Manappuram offers gold loans only for a three-month tenure while other NBFCs like Muthoot Finance gives loans for 9-12 months. Banks invariably make one-year offers.According to NBFCs and banks, the crisis is apparent not only in urban areas but also in semi-urban and rural areas across the country. People are unable to pay the EMI of gold loan due to job losses amid pandemic and fall in gold prices. Gold prices had peaked to Rs 57,000 per 10 gram in August last year. After falling in March, gold prices have now recovered and are trading around Rs 49,000 per 10 gram.“As people lost their jobs and their earnings were affected, they were not able to pay interest in time last year. We give one additional month to clear the dues. If that is not honoured, we are left with no option but to auction the pawned gold,” said Manish Sharma, branch manager, Manappuram Finance, Burail (Chandigarh).Experts are of the view that the auctions would likely to be more in the coming months when gold loans with one-year tenure mature.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-covid-surge-in-pawned-jewellery-sale-277572

They should also appoint a senior officer from the state headquarters as the nodal officer for these districts,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said. Member, NITI Aayog, VK Paul warned that the “second wave is not over”. “We are not safe till the entire nation is safe. Lowering the guard is not an option. The situation in Europe is again getting worrisome. From 50 per million cases, the count has now doubled. The UK has gone from 100 per million cases to 370 per million cases now. Israel and Russia are also witnessing a rise in cases. The fight against the virus is not over,” Paul said, adding that the country must buy time until a vast proportion of the population was inoculated.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) did not touch on the issue during its media briefing on Friday, but said the government did not send any greeting on the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China because the event was not a government matter.Editorial: Chinese belligerenceAsked whether US Secretary of State Tony Blinken had paid attention to Jinping’s address with aggressive language towards the West like “heads bashed against the bloody great wall of steel”, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US had taken note of the remarks, “but, we’re not going to comment on the specifics”.Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reacted by stating that Xi was serious about “bashing heads bloody” and called on Biden to strengthen policies.Addressing over seven lakh people on Thursday at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to mark the Chinese Communist Party’s 100th birthday, Xi made several exhortations to rouse patriotic passions but the line about foreign forces trying to bully China “crashing into a great wall of steel” was the biggest takeaway for international observers.The debate in the global community was over the translation of the message that was delivered in unmistakably militaristic tones using a very strong choice of words. Taiwan, which was at the receiving end of one of the remarks, chose to react instantaneously by pointing out that its core principles were “democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law” which is a “major institutional difference from the other side of the strait”.

Offensive air support for these would be provided by the IAF. On the Northern Command of the Army, he said: “The Northern Command looks after both the fronts — the China front in Ladakh and the northern front in the Kargil sector.

Since I was already in a pre-scheduled meeting in my chamber, my staff requested him to sit in the waiting room. When my meeting was over and thereafter my parliamentary private secretary (PPS) informed me about his arrival, I requested my PPS to convey to Adhikari my inability to meet him and apologise as he had to wait,” he said.“Adhikari thanked my PPS and left without insisting to meet me. The question of my meeting with Adhikari therefore did not arise,” Mehta said in a statement.Earlier, three TMC MPs wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Mehta’s removal from the post of Solicitor General for meeting Adhkiari — an accused in the Narada scam case being probed by the CBI, saying it amounted to conflict of interest.The letter was signed by TMC Rajya Sabha MPs Derek O’ Brien and Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra.They alleged that Adhikari faced criminal cases of cheating, illegal gratification and bribery and was caught on camera taking bribes in a sting operation.The TMC alleged that Adhikari, an accused in the Narada case and Saradha chit fund scam, went to meet the SG to influence the outcome of the cases.Pointing out that the Solicitor General is the second highest law officer who advises government and its agencies on crucial legal matters, the MPs demanded that necessary steps should be taken for Mehta’s removal to avoid any doubt in the minds of the public regarding the integrity and neutrality of the office of the Solicitor General.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didnt-meet-suvendu-adhikari-says-solicitor-general-tushar-mehta-as-trinamool-seeks-his-removal-277414

Ramaswamy, an activist, had sought directions to declare that Singh breached of his oath for his recent statements on the Line of Actual Control in which the former Army Chief allegedly claimed that India transgressed the LAC many times, as per its perception, and the Chinese had taken advantage of the statement made and used it to blame India for encroaching upon its perceived territory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remark-on-lac-sc-rejects-plea-for-action-against-gen-vk-singh-277416

It also called on Pakistan to bring to justice perpetrators of terrorist attacks in Mumbai and Pathankot.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drone-spotted-over-indian-mission-in-islamabad-india-lodges-protest-277210
