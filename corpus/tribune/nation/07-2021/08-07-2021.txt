Keeping that in mind, the Cabinet today decided to allow APMC to utilise the Rs 1 lakh crore financing facility under Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF).”Stating that there was apprehension that APMCs will be abolished, the minister reiterated that these regulated mandis will not end. “After implementation of the three farm laws, APMC will get funds from this agri-infra fund.”   For APMCs, interest subvention for a loan up to Rs 2 crore will be provided for each project of different infrastructure types like cold storage, sorting, grading and assaying units and silos within the same market yard, he added.APMC markets are set up to provide market linkages and create an ecosystem of post-harvest public infrastructure open to all farmers. Not only APMCs, Tomar said the financial facility under this fund has been extended to state agencies, national and state federations, farmer producer organisations (FPOs) as well as federation of self-help groups (SHGs).So far, individuals, organisations, cooperatives, FPOs and agri-startups and farmers organisations were eligible to avail subvention of 3 per cent per annum for loans up to Rs 2 crore, he added.Under the AIF, a medium to long-term debt financing facility is provided for investment in viable projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets through interest subvention and financial support.Among other changes in the scheme, the minister said that currently interest subvention for a loan up to Rs 2 crore in one location is eligible under the scheme.“In case one eligible entity puts up projects in different locations, then all such projects will be now be eligible for interest subvention for loan up to Rs 2 crore,” he said.However, for a private sector entity, there will be a limit of a maximum of 25 such projects. However, this limitation will not be applicable to state agencies, national and state federations of cooperatives, federations of FPOs and federation of SHGs, he said.Location will mean physical boundary of a village or town having a distinct LGD (Local Government Directory) code. Each of such projects should be in a location having a separate LGD code.The minister further said the period of financial facility has been extended from 4 to 6 years up to 2025-26. The overall period of the scheme has been extended from 10 to 13 years up to 2032-33.In a separate statement, the government said the power has been delegated to the Union Agriculture Minister to make necessary changes with regard to addition or deletion of beneficiaries in such a manner so that basic spirit of the scheme is not altered.The modifications in the scheme will help to achieve a multiplier effect in generating investments while ensuring that the benefits reach small and marginal farmers, it said.

08-07-2021||Satya Prakash||‘Can a person be forced to cohabit with estranged spouse?’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 8Can a person be forced to cohabit with the estranged spouse against his/her will?Faced with this peculiar legal question bordering on fundamental right to privacy and sexual autonomy, the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre to spell out in 10 days its stand on a petition challenging the law on restitution of conjugal rights under the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act.Petitioners Ojaswa Pathak and Mayank Gupta—students of Gujarat National Law University, Gujarat—have challenged the validity of Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA), Section 22 of the Special Marriage Act (SMA) and certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) that empower courts to pass a decree of restitution of conjugal rights at the instance of an aggrieved spouse.Under these provisions, courts can ask estranged spouses to “cohabit” and “take part in sexual intercourse” to restore conjugal rights of the aggrieved spouse.The petitioners contended that after the 2017 verdict of a nine-judge Constitution Bench declaring right to privacy as fundamental right provisions on restitution of conjugal rights have become unconstitutional as they force unwilling spouses, mostly women, to cohabit with their estranged life partners.Terming the questions raised in the petition challenging the constitutional validity of the law on restitution of conjugal rights as “important”, the Bench posted the matter for further hearing on July 22 after Attorney General KK Venugopal said he needed time to file written submissions.On behalf of petitioners, senior advocate Indira Jaising submitted the matter related to a pure question of law regarding the validity of Section 9 of HMA and other similar provisions and that the court should give a shorter date.The top court had in March 2019 referred to a three-judge bench a petition challenging the validity of provisions in the matrimonial laws empowering courts to ask estranged spouses to “cohabit”.“Courts in India have understood ‘Conjugal rights’ to have two key ingredients: cohabitation and sexual intercourse. Under the legal scheme in India, a spouse is entitled to a decree directing his other spouse to cohabit and take part in sexual intercourse. He or she is also entitled to coercive measures in the form of attachment of property in case the spouses wilfully disobey the decree of restitution,” the petitioners said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/can-a-person-be-forced-to-cohabit-with-estranged-spouse-280121

They should adopt the path of dialogue. And the government is ready for discussion,” he said while replying to a query during a Cabinet briefing.“There was apprehension that MSP will be scrapped. However since farmers’ protest began, the procurement of foodgrans as well as pulses and oilseeds has risen,” Tomar said.The agriculture minister said the government’s constant efforts are aimed at making farmers prosperous by increasing their income.“Farm laws were a major step in this direction. I believe farmer unions should understand their benefits well in time. The entire country is understanding the benefits of these laws,” Tomar said.The minister said he has told protesting farmer unions many times that the government is ready to discuss on proposal other than repeal of the laws.“We have always dealt with sensitivity as far as farmers’ protest is concerned. The Modi government always has respect for farmers,” Tomar said.After today’s Cabinet decision on APMC, the unions should believe that APMC will not end, he said. “There is no such provision (to end APMC) in the laws. APMCs are set under the state laws.”Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for more than seven months in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP.The government and unions have held 11 rounds of talks, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers” protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January26.The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions.Three union ministers, including Tomar and Food Minister Piyush Goyal, have held 11 rounds of talks with the protesting farmer unions.In the last meeting on January 22, the government’s negotiations with 41 farmer groups hit a roadblock as the unions squarely rejected the Centre’s proposal of putting the laws on suspension.During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi’s borders.The three laws—The Farmers” Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by the Parliament in September last year.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.On January 11, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse. Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee.Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati are the other members on the panel. The panel has submitted the report to the Supreme Court. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/procurement-system-on-msp-apmc-market-will-be-strengthened-agri-minister-280114

She had posted Gorakh Pandey’s poem ‘Unko phaansi de do’ on her Twitter profile.Hegde had re-tweeted and shared Krishnan’s post with the caption ‘Hang Him’, an English translation of the poem’s title, the petition said.The second post was a picture of August Landmesser which Hegde was using as his profile header/ cover photo for over a year, it said.The government, in its response filed through central government standing counsel Kirtiman Singh, said the issue of suspension of account was prima facie between Hegde and Twitter and it has not directed that the account be suspended.The plea contended that suspension of the senior lawyer’s Twitter account “is illegal, arbitrary and contrary to the Respondent No.2’s (Twitter) own terms of use and rules” and also violates his right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution.It also submitted that the government was not a necessary party to these proceedings and claimed that the petition was not maintainable and it should be dismissed.

Persistence of breathlessness was also reported significantly more often in those who had severe disease at the onset.The patients also reported neuro-psychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, "brain fog" and sleep disorders.These post-Covid symptoms also had significant correlations to age, Budhiraja said.Fatigue was less pronounced among those less than 30 years (2.3 per cent), but was more in the elderly 60 years and above (21.5 per cent).On the other hand, "neuro-psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, 'brain-fog', and sleep disorder, were reported by 9.0 per cent cases.

Delhi Police PRO, Chinmoy Biswal, said, "Acting on a complaint received on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal regarding 'Sulli Deals' mobile application, a case under section 354-A of the Indian Penal Code has been registered on Wednesday and investigation taken up."

08-07-2021||Satya Prakash||SC upholds Delhi Assembly’s powers to set up panel to examine 2020 Delhi riots||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 8The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi Legislative Assembly’s powers to constitute a committee to examine last year’s communal riots in the national capital.A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, however, said such a committee can’t act like a prosecuting agency.Facebook India Vice President Ajit Mohan had moved the top court challenging the summons issues to him by a committee of the Delhi Legislative Assembly asking him to appear before it.The top court said Mohan’s petition challenging the summons issued to him by the Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee seeking his presence was premature.The verdict means that Mohan will have to appear before the committee to depose even though he may not face any coercive action.“The Assembly admittedly does not have the power to legislate under the issues which fall under the domain of union govt. However, objective of peace and harmony go beyond law and order and police,” the Court said, adding, the Delhi Assembly can look into the riots even though law and order wasn’t in the domain of NCT government.“Investigation of a socially complicated problem too is under its domain,” the Bench said, adding the Delhi Assembly wasn’t different from any other state assembly except with respect to certain subjects in List 2 of Seventh schedule.In September last year, the Supreme Court had asked Delhi Legislative Assembly’s peace and harmony committee not to take any coercive action against Mohan in connection with a summons issued to him to depose before it with regard to 2020 Delhi riots.The Delhi Legislative Assembly’s peace and harmony committee – which is probing Facebook’s alleged role in spreading hate speech – had on September 10 last year issued notice to Mohan seeking his presence before it. Mohan and Facebook had challenged the notice before the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-upholds-delhi-assemblys-powers-to-set-up-panel-to-examine-2020-delhi-riots-280077
08-07-2021||New Delhi||HC questions activist Gokhale for tweeting against Lakshmi Puri without verifying facts||The Delhi High Court on Thursday questioned activist Saket Gokhale for putting out alleged defamatory tweets against former Assistant Secretary-General at the United Nations Lakshmi Puri, without verifying the facts from her or approaching any government authority.Gokhale, in his tweets on June 13 and 26 made reference to certain property purchased by Puri in Switzerland and also referred to her husband Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.          Observing that right to reputation is recognised as a fundamental right, the high court asked Gokhale, also a freelance journalist, as to how he can vilify people, particularly when the tweets put out by him were prima facie incorrect.The court was hearing a defamation suit filed by Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri seeking Rs five crore damages from Gokhale and also a direction against him to take down or delete the tweets, wherein false and factually incorrect, per-se defamatory, slanderous and libellous statements/imputations have been made by him against her and her family.“Show me before you put out tweets, you sought to clarify these facts from the plaintiff,” Justice C Hari Shankar asked Gokhale’s counsel who responded in negative while adding that there was no such requirement under the law and that he had tagged the finance minister in one of the tweets itself.“So according to your understanding of the law, any Tom, Dick and Harry can write anything against anyone on Internet irrespective of the fact that it destroys and damages the reputation of a person,” the judge said and reserved its order on the suit for July 13.“You tell me what exercise you have carried out with public authorities before putting out the tweets on social media,” the judge asked.The court said before putting out anything in public, one has to exercise due diligence and asked whether Gokhale was ready to take down the tweets?To this, his counsel Sarim Naved responded in negative.During the arguments, senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing Puri, contended that the tweets were defamatory, malicious and based on false information and that Gokhale was nobody to put questions to her.“It is a case of ex-facie per se defamation. If I may use a Hindi phrase, ‘Ulta chor kotwal ko dante’. When I sent him a legal notice, he said he was being harassed,” the counsel argued.He said Puri does not hold any public office for these details to be put in public domain and if he was putting her name in public, he should have the minimum civility to ask her before he publishes this which was deliberately ignored.“I have made out a prima facie case and the balance of convenience is in my favour. There is conclusive evidence of defamation and harassment having taken place. People who have served the country with utmost integrity are being accused by people who are nothing. These materials which destroy the honour and integrity of a person shall not be allowed to stay,” Singh argued.Naved said as a citizen, Gokhale has the right to go into the assets of public functionaries.He also said Puri’s husband is a union minister and that assets of such persons along with spouse should be in public domain but in this case, the money received from their daughter is not in public domain.

The then SP govt had fired bullets at the unarmed Lord Ram devotees. Many had died. Today, I announce that roads would be constructed in UP in the name of all such karsevaks." Sixteen karsevaks had died in police firing in Ayodhya in November 1990. The BJP claims that the numbers were much higher.Maurya further said Jai Hind Veer Path would be built to honour the soldiers and police officers who laid down their lives fighting external and internal enemies.

08-07-2021||New Delhi||Halted by Covid, 24 Myanmarese in grave health condition flown to Delhi for treatment||A group of 24 patients with serious ailments and awaiting organ transplant and specialised medical treatment for over six months due to the coronavirus pandemic have been brought from Myanmar to Delhi for treatment at a leading private facility here, hospital authorities said on Thursday.Their grave health condition ranges from chronic liver or kidney disease to hepatitis B virus infection, doctors said."They were flown to Delhi on July 2 in a special chartered flight after the COVID-19-induced lockdown restrictions were eased for international travel," a spokesperson of Apollo hospital here said.Many patients from abroad visit the city from time to time for medical advice and treatment, but the second wave of the Covid had put a halt on their travel, prolonging their suffering.The spokesperson said the 24 patients from Myanmar are currently kept in a 12-day quarantine, after which their condition will be assessed for transplant procedures, some may not need it and would require just specialised medical care."The patients were suffering from chronic liver, kidney and cardio-vascular diseases and had been waiting for organ transplant and specialised medical treatment for over six months."Fortunately with ease in international travel and immense support by embassies of the countries we have been able to get them to India to our centre for medical assistance," said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.Doctors at the hospital in south Delhi said these patients have been in "grave health condition" and any further delay in medical intervention "could have been fatal".“One of the patients is a 48-year-old man who had been suffering from chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), this is progressive and irreversible condition that causes the tissues to scar. The man had been waiting for treatment for over six months and hence his condition had progressed into induced liver cancer," said Dr Neerav Goyal, senior consultant, liver transplant, at the hospital.His condition was initially managed in Myanmar with chemo embolisation and last week he was brought to Delhi in a specialised charter flight, along with 23 other such patients for organ transplant, he added.Delhi had been hit hard with the second wave of the pandemic and the oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals here added to the woes of the people.The coronavirus pandemic situation has improved a bit in the last few weeks.Non-Covid patients, especially those suffering from cancer or chronic ailments, and pregnant women had to go through a great deal of hardship in the April-June period. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/halted-by-covid-24-myanmarese-in-grave-health-condition-flown-to-delhi-for-treatment-280052
08-07-2021||Nainital||Uttarakhand HC rejects govt contention that live streaming of rituals not allowed by scriptures||The Uttarakhand High Court has refused to accept the state government's contention that live streaming of the rituals at Char Dham is not permitted by the scriptures.Refusing to buy the argument, the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said if the Devasthanam Board decides not to permit live streaming of the rituals on this ground, it will have to quote a line from the scripture in support of the argument.The government made the submission in an affidavit filed by Advocate General S N Babulkar on Wednesday.The chief justice said he has also read the shastras and nowhere does a line like this appear.However, the high court refused to pass any order regarding the Char Dham Yatra as the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.The court's observation came on the advocate general's submission that the earlier order of the court has been complied with and the Char Dham Yatra has been stayed.He also submitted that a proposal has been sent to the Char Dham Board for the live telecast of the puja but due to the change of chief minister of the state a meeting of the board, which is headed by him, could not take place.The government also reiterated that people are opposed to live streaming as it is not allowed by the scriptures."On the one hand, you are saying that it will be decided while on the other you say that it is not acceptable as per scripture. I have also read the scriptures, tell me in which verse is this ban imposed?" the chief justice asked.Citing an example from the epic Mahabharata, the chief justice said if Sanjay could give an account of the war to Dhritarashtra through live broadcast, why can't the state government live stream rituals at Char Dham.

08-07-2021||Bengaluru||Hours before swearing in, Karandlaje deletes her Twitter timeline||Newly sworn-in union minister of state for agriculture, Shobha Karandlaje, Karnataka's one of the outspoken politicians who does not mince words on issues - cow terrorism and love jihad - has reportedly deleted her Twitter time-line just hours before she took charge as minister. This has raised many eyebrows in the state.The two-time Lok Sabha member from Udupi-Chikmagalur, which is a hotbed of Sangh Parivar activities in the state, has grown through the party ranks. Apart from being close to Sangh Parivar, Karandlaje is also considered to be a very close confidante of the chief minister, B.S. Yediyurappa.Her Twitter timeline had always been flooded with issues that are considered to be close to RSS, such as Cow Terrorism, Love Jihad and several other topics which are considered to be very close to right-wing ideologues.She has been quite vocal on contemporary issues such as religious extremism, 'love jihad' and the alleged killing of Hindu activists.Karnadlaje had never deleted a single tweet even when she had come under flak from Left-wing critics for posting fake videos and messages. "This time it is quite surprising to see her Twitter timeline being wiped off completely except that she re-tweeted her swearing-in ceremony pictures from the BJP handle," a senior leader in the BJP told IANS on condition of anonymity.Karandlaje not only hails from the coastal region of the state, but she also belongs to the politically influential Vokkaliga community, to which BJP veteran Sadananda Gowda belongs. Gowda resigned from the union cabinet on Wednesday just hours before cabinet expansion took place. Between 2008-12, she was considered as someone who had wielded an enormous amount of influence during the previous BJP rule under Yediyurappa 2008-12 but after rejoining the BJP along with Yediyurappa, Karandlaje has by and large remained in her constituency.Interestingly, unlike last time, Karandlaje is not 'visible among the inner circles of Yediyurappa' in the present government amid the chief minister's younger son B.Y. Vijayendra's growing influence.Born on October 23, 1966, at Puttur in Dakshina Kannada district, her educational qualification includes M.A. (Sociology) and Master of Social Work.Karandlaje was MLC from 2004-2008, MLA from 2008-2013, and served as Minister for Rural Development & Panchayati Raj, Power, and Food and Civil Supplies during the previous BJP government headed by Yediyurappa.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hours-before-swearing-in-karandlaje-deletes-her-twitter-timeline-280039
08-07-2021||New Delhi||Britain's Cairn gets French court order to seize 20 Indian properties in Paris||In a setback to India, Britain’s Cairn Energy Plc has secured a French court order to seize some 20 government properties in Paris to recover a part of the USD 1.7 billion due from New Delhi following an arbitration panel overturning levy of retrospective taxes.The centrally located properties mostly comprise flats, valued at more than EUR 20 million, used by the Indian government establishment in France, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The French court, Tribunal judiciaire de Paris, on June 11 agreed to Cairn's application to freeze (through judicial mortgages) the residential real estate owned by the Government of India in central Paris, they said, adding that the legal formalities for this were completed on Wednesday evening.While Cairn is unlikely to evict the Indian officials residing in those properties, the government cannot sell them after the court order.Also read:A three-member international arbitration tribunal that consisted of one judge appointed by India, had in December last year unanimously overturned levy of taxes on Cairn retrospectively and ordered refund of shares sold, dividend confiscated, and tax refunds withheld to recover such demand.With the Indian government refusing to honour the award, Cairn has moved in multiple overseas jurisdictions to enforce the award by seizing Indian assets.Last month, Cairn brought a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York pleading that Air India is controlled by the Indian government so much that they are 'alter egos' and the airline should be held liable for the arbitration award.Similar lawsuits are likely to be brought in other countries, primarily with high-value assets. The arbitration award has been registered in countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, Singapore, the Mauritius, France and the Netherlands.Cairn has identified USD 70 billion of Indian assets overseas for the potential seizure to collect award, which now totals to USD 1.72 billion after including interest and penalty.While the finance ministry did not immediately offer comments on the matter, a Cairn spokesperson said: "Our strong preference remains an agreed, amicable settlement with the Government of India to draw this matter to a close, and to that end we have submitted a detailed series of proposals to them since February this year.""However, in the absence of such a settlement, Cairn must take all necessary legal actions to protect the interests of its international shareholders," the spokesperson said without elaborating.Sources said the French court order affects some 20 centrally located properties, belonging to the Indian government, as part of a guaranttee of the debt owed to Cairn."This is the necessary preparatory step to taking ownership of the properties and ensures that the proceeds of any sales would be due to Cairn," one of the persons said.Last month, Cairn filed a petition with the courts in the Southern District of New York, seeking judicial confirmation that Air India, the national carrier, can be classed as the alter ego of the Indian state and thereby jointly liable for the arbitral award.Air India has time till mid-July to file a plea contesting the Cairn lawsuit, sources said.The Government of India, which participated in the arbitration proceeding over four years, has not accepted the award and has filed a 'setting aside' petition in a court in the Netherlands - the seat of the arbitration.In May, the finance ministry said that the tribunal "improperly exercised jurisdiction over a national tax dispute that the Republic of India never offered and/or agreed to arbitrate".The ministry called the 2006 reorganisation of Cairn's India business for listing on the local bourses as "an abusive tax avoidance scheme that was a gross violation of Indian tax laws, thereby depriving Cairn's alleged investments of any protection under the India-UK bilateral investment treaty".

This is a politically motivated case and entire Maharashtra and the country is seeing this.""Inquiry has been done five times in this case.

08-07-2021||New Delhi||Indraprastha Apollo records 6 cases of cytomegalovirus infection in a month||Six persons have been diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals in Delhi within 20 to 30 days of testing positive for coronavirus, officials said on Thursday.All these patients admitted at Apollo had severe COVID 19 pneumonia in the preceding month, received high doses of steroids and had turned Covid negative at the time of detection of CMV disease, they said.Cytomegalovirus infection is a common herpes virus infection with a wide range of symptoms: from no symptoms to fever and fatigue (resembling infectious mononucleosis) to severe symptoms involving the eyes, brain, or other internal organs.The cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is usually found in patients with immunocompromised status like those who suffer from HIV, low CD4 counts, or are cancer post-transplant patients on immunosuppressive medicines etc.Suppression of immunity due to COVID-19 and steroids gives CMV a chance to attack patients. The virus otherwise exists in 80-90 per cent of the Indian population in asymptomatic form due to inherent immunity.Dr Athar Ansari, Consultant (Department of Respiratory, Critical Care and Sleep medicine), Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said, “In the past month, we have detected CMV disease in six patients with post COVID-19 syndrome that came with varied manifestations. Symptoms of CMV depend on which part of the body it is affecting. If it has direct involvement of lungs, the patient will have a fever, difficulty in breathing, chest pain or cough.”  The patients that were admitted to Apollo after 20-30 days of testing COVID-19 positive were detected with conditions like hypoxia, inflammation in the lungs and liver, and one of them was a known case of acute myeloid leukaemia, he said.CMV colitis is a known entity. Although more common in immunocompromised, it has been reported in immunocompetent patients earlier as well. CMV is an opportunistic infection that preys on low immunity, and COVID-19 is capable of severe immune suppression, the doctor added.The reason for the activation of the CMV virus in these patients could be the COVID 19-induced immunosuppression and high dose steroid therapy, said Dr Avdhesh Bansal, Senior Consultant, Department of Respiratory, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.CMV disease can have varied presentations and a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis among COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms not responding to treatment, he said.

08-07-2021||Washington||USCIRF condemns death of Stan Swamy||A federal American body has condemned the “deliberate neglect" by the government of India that it said led to the death of Jesuit priest Stan Swamy.Swamy, 84, who was arrested last year under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, died at a Mumbai hospital on Monday. “Father Stan Swamy's death is a stark reminder of the egregious and ongoing persecution of India's religious minority communities,” Nadine Maenza, chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said in a statement on Wednesday.The USCIRF condemns "in strongest terms the deliberate neglect and targeting by the government of India that led to the death of Father Stan Swamy," it said.Maenza urged the United States to “hold the Indian government accountable and to raise religious freedom concerns in the US-India bilateral relationship.” Rejecting mounting international criticism over the handling of the case of Swamy, India on Tuesday said the concerned authorities act against violations of law and do not restrain the legitimate exercise of rights. The Ministry of External Affairs said India remains committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all its citizens and that the country's democratic polity is complemented by an independent judiciary and a range of national and state-level human rights commissions."Swamy was arrested and detained by the National Investigation Agency following due process under the law. Because of the specific nature of charges against him, his bail applications were rejected by the courts. Authorities in India act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights. All such actions are strictly in accordance with the law,” the MEA said in a statement in New Delhi.It said Swamy was receiving all possible medical attention at a private hospital where he was admitted since May 28. His health and medical treatment were being closely monitored by the courts. He passed away on July 5 following medical complications."India remains committed to promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens,” the ministry said in response to media queries. India had earlier rejected its criticism by the USCIRF, terming its observations on the condition of minorities and religious freedom in the country as “biased and tendentious”.The MEA had termed the USCIRF as an "organisation of particular concern" in 2020 and said it will treat it accordingly.USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava said that the commission is deeply saddened and appalled by the death of Swamy. “For years, he fought for the rights and dignity of low-caste and poor people across India,” she said.“Father Swamy died in the custody of Indian authorities who targeted him for giving voice to the human rights concerns of Adivasis and other low-caste, religious and poor communities," she said."The Indian government held him for these past months, without any trial or conviction, despite lack of credible evidence on the charges filed against him, his deteriorating health, and global calls for his release,” Bhargava added.

Deeply value his strong commitment to strengthen our bilateral ties and expand cooperation on regional and global issues,” he said after the meeting.At the Iranian Foreign Office, Jaishankar met Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and discussed bilateral relations and regional developments, according to the Iranian Embassy here.Jaishankar stopped in Tehran en route to Moscow for a meeting with his counterpart Sergei Lavrov that would also be devoted to discussing the developments in Afghanistan, where the Taliban has been making military gains against the US-backed government in Kabul.Significantly, Tehran had just hosted Afghan officials and the Taliban, while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) chief had visited Kabul.Last time, Iran, Russia and India had jointly backed the Northern Alliance against the Taliban regime after the US intervention in 2001.Both Iran and Russia had opened channels well before India, but the expectation in South Block is that the three countries would make common cause against Taliban. Being Sunni-led, Taliban has been at odds with the Shia population spread across the borders of Iran and Afghanistan.In the case of Russia, the reading is that it will be wary of its brand of radicalism permeating its underbelly of secular Central Asian countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-meets-irans-prez-elect-in-tehran-279884

It directed the Centre to file a counter affidavit.As several petitions challenging the IT Rules, 2021, remain pending in various high courts, including the Delhi High Court, the Centre on Tuesday requested the Supreme Court to transfer to itself all such petitions to itself for an authoritative pronouncement on the issue.Aimed at regulating social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and OTT players, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, require them to put in place a complaint redressal mechanism with an officer based in India to deal with online contents flagged by the government authorities and courts. They are also required to assist police in investigations.On behalf of the portals, senior advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan urged the court to grant them interim protection as the Centre had not even filed its reply.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma said “1,700 digital media platforms have already submitted information” as per the IT rules.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-rules-delhi-hc-refuses-to-give-protection-to-digital-platforms-279885
08-07-2021||Nonika Singh||Dilip Kumar: The original Badshah of Bollywood||Much before superstars like Rajesh Khanna and Big B rode to success, lived this super-duper star. The original Badshah of Bollywood, he lorded over the silver screen and people’s hearts like few can. Dilip Kumar, aka Mohammed Yusuf Khan, might have fallen silent but his dialogues live forever. Heralded as the ultimate method actor by Satyajit Ray, here was an actor whose acting prowess was sworn by millions, and generations of actors have tried to emulate his inimitable style. Dilip learnt the first lesson in acting from none other than Ashok Kumar, who told him, “Acting is about not acting.” Early on he realised that if he had to stand out, he had to imbibe a bit of his personality in his acting. So he gave exhibitionism a miss and learnt to deliver dialogues softly with an even cadence and sought inspiration from real-life experiences.Edit: Goodbye, Dilip KumarSome of his dialogues like “Kaun kambakth hai jo bardasht karne ke liye peeta hai. Main toh peeta hoon ke bas saans le sakoon” in Devdas are etched in the memory of cinephiles. His portrayal of the doomed lover became a reference point for actors for all times to come. The scene in Mughal-e-Azam in which he caresses Madhubala with a feather is deemed to be the most sensuous in cinematic history. He was not merely an undisputed role model in acting but also in the department of adulation. Shah Rukh Khan is believed to have said, “I want more fans than Dilip Sahib for he was my parents’ favourite actor.” Not just his but yours, mine and everyone’s parents or grandparents, remotely connected to Hindi cinema, have grown up idolising the great actor. Never mind that his last film Qila came in 1998, his hold over people’s imagination did not lessen even by an iota. Laurels came easily. If the Government of India honoured him with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1994, he received the highest civilian honor Nishan-e-Imtiaz in 1998 from Pakistan, where he was revered like a god.If his stellar performances in movies such as Andaz, Aan, Devdas, Azaad and the historical Mughal-e-Azam and the social Ganga Jumna earned him a name in the hall of fame, his refusal to act in several famed movies such as Pyaasa and Sangam stirred people’s curiosity as much. He didn’t want to be a part of Mother India for he didn’t like the thought of playing the son of Nargis, who played his romantic interest in movies such as Mela and Babul. Of course, he rubbished rumours of his supposed rivalry between another great, the showman Raj Kapoor. Raj’s chance remark, “You are so handsome, you should be an actor” might have subconsciously set him on the path of acting.But his first acting assignment in Jwar Bhata and his screen name came from Devika Rani. His debut performance may not have set the cash registers ringing but he discovered his Midas touch with Jugnu and delivered one hit after another. With a career spanning six decades, he ruled the box office and the hearts of his leading ladies. His love affairs with Kamini Kaushal and Madhubala set the grapevine abuzz. But it was for the real love of his life, his wife Saira Banu, that he said, “Who can be luckier than me?”In his autobiography Dilip Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow, his romance with Saira unfurls like a fairytale, his picture with her that went viral a couple of years ago captured tenderness and love at its best. But then the man who was an epitome of dignity and quietude could only bring out the best in others, including his co-actors, about whom he spoke rather fondly.For times to come, he will be remembered as just that — an actor extraordinaire. Sue Mengers said: “Stars are rare creatures, not everyone can be one.” He was the brightest of them all, and will be a beacon for all times to come.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dilip-kumar-the-original-badshah-of-bollywood-279887

While many, including the Opposition, may call these resignations a “proof of their failure as ministers”, BJP sources say the PM has been dropping hints that “non-performers will be eased out” all along.He has been underlining the importance of performance and attendance at many of BJP’s internal meetings, including the Parliamentary party meetings. With the mega midterm changeover, the PM today created a whole new set of leaders and a bench strength for his party, sending the message that it takes performance and hard work to remain in his council.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-rejig-ahead-of-elections-non-performers-out-279890

Those inducted today included Maharashtra strongman Narayan Rane, the first among the 43 new ministers to be administered the oath of office by President Ram Nath Kovind at a ceremony in the iconic Darbar Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhawan.Rane was followed by Assam ex-CM Sarbananda Sonowal, seven-time Tikamgarh (Madhya Pradesh) MP Virendra Singh, and RS MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, who jumped ship from the Congress last year, taking down the Kamal Nath government in MP. The names of Rane, Sonowal and Scindia had been doing the rounds for long as the topmost ‘probables’ in the reshuffle.Ministers of state, including Kiren Rijiju, a prominent face from the Northeast, bureaucrats RK Singh and Hardeep Puri, Gujarat MPs Mansukh Mandaviya and Purushottam Rupala, Secunderabad representative G Kishan Reddy, who is considered close to Home Minister Amit Shah, and Hamirpur MP Anurag Thakur were rewarded for their performance and promoted to the Cabinet rank.The other new faces in the Cabinet included former bureaucrat and Rajya Sabha MP Ashwani Vaishnav and his colleague in the Upper House, Bhupendra Yadav. Also seen as Home Minister Shah’s right-hand man, Yadav is a lawyer by profession and at the top in the BJP’s scheme of things. The 15 new Cabinet ministers included two from the alliance partners — national president of the JD-U Ram Chandra Prasad Singh and leader of the breakaway group of the LJP Pashupati Kumar Paras. Apna Dal MP Anupriya Patel, a prominent Kurmi face from UP, was inducted as Minister of State.Those inducted also include New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi and Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar MP Ajay Bhatt, both ministers of stateMeanwhile, those who resigned to make way for them are Cabinet ministers Thawar Chand Gehlot (now the Karnataka Governor), Ravi Shankar Prasad, Prakash Javadekar, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Harsh Vardhan, DV Sadananda Gowda and ministers of state Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Babul Supriyo, Dhotre Sanjay Shamrao, Rattan Lal Kataria, Pratap Chandra Sarangi and Debasree Chaudhuri.With an eye on the upcoming Assembly elections and 2024 General Election, the new ministers include seven from poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, four from Karnataka, and four from West Bengal. The mid-term course correction saw several surprise entries. It is a young Council with 14 ministers below the age of 50.With Gujarat Assembly elections less than a year away, the renewed Cabinet now has seven ministers from the state. They include Home Minister Amit Shah and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who represents Gujarat in the Rajya Sabha.The average age of the Council of Ministers with six doctors, 13 lawyers, seven former bureaucrats, and five engineers is said to be 58 years.With as many as 27, 12 and 8 ministers from the OBC, SC and ST categories, respectively, the Prime Minister today tried to give a new dimension to the BJP which is known for its upper-caste credentials while balancing experience with freshness and talent.Those in the know of developments say “talent and administrative experience have been rewarded”. The Modi-Shah stamp is visible and a whole lot of planning and arithmetic has gone into the exercise, taking into consideration a host of issues ranging from the challenges amid the Covid pandemic, perceptions, and state elections.Sources say the PM today asked the new ministers to work with better coordination with the BJP and “let their work speak for them”.Lekhi is MoS (MEA)Portfolios of newly inducted Ministers of State 2 MoS (Ind charge)Rao Inderjit Singh gets Statistics and Programme Implementation, Planning; Jitendra Singh given Science and Technology, Earth Sciences.

Some recent unfavourable court verdicts also hurt Prasad’s image.Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar’s undoing was his inability to stem the rising unemployment, satisfactorily address the migrant crisis during Covid and going all out recently to flay the Yogi government for its alleged pandemic mishandling.The selection of newcomers and elevation of ministers Anurag Thakur, Kiren Rijiju, G Kishan Reddy, Mansukh Mandaviya and RK Singh, further reflect BJP’s urge to create second-rung leadership.Sources said the rejig was also necessitated to strike a regional, caste, community and social balance ahead of Assembly elections next year with the new council consisting of 27 OBCs (highest-ever representation), 12 Scheduled Castes, eight Scheduled Tribes and five minority community ministers.Gender index of the Cabinet also stands improved with 11 women in the council now, including Cabinet ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Smriti Irani.The new council is also dominated by professionals—13 lawyers, six doctors, five engineers and seven civil servants.The PM’s new team has leaders with vast administrative experience—four former CMs, including Maharashtra’s Narayan Rane and Assam’s Sarbanand Sonowal; 23 MPs, eight former state government ministers and 39 former MLAs.Uttar Pradesh now has seven ministers, representing all regions, namely Purvanchal, Awadh, Braj, Bundelkhand, Rohilakhand, Paschi Pradesh and Harit Pradesh.Regional balance has been struck when picking ministers from Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and the North-East.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/midterm-reset-to-correct-govts-image-gear-up-for-elections-279724

The court, though, imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on Banerjee as fine.Justice Chanda said when the case had first come up before him on June 18, no request was made for his recusal. The petitioner had already written to the Acting Chief Justice of the HC on June 16 requesting him to reassign the case to another court but no clue was given to the Bench regarding the letter, Justice Chanda said in his 13-page order.However, immediately after the hearing, Trinamool Congress leaders were found ready with Justice Chanda’s photos and details of his association with the BJP and put out a number of tweets to that effect, Justice Chanda observed.“The chronology of events clearly suggests a deliberate and conscious attempt was made to influence my decision before the recusal application was placed before the court. The calculated psychological offensive and vilification for recusal need to be firmly repulsed and a cost of Rs 5 lakh is imposed upon the petitioner,” the court ordered.The cost has to be deposited with the Bar Council of West Bengal within two weeks and the same shall be used for families of lawyers who have succumbed to Covid, the court said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judge-recuses-from-nandigram-case-hearing-slaps-rs-5-lakh-fine-on-mamata-banerjee-279726

He said the Chinese were highly methodical and had spent 30 to 40 years building up a strong economy.On ongoing debate on integrated theatre commands, the former J&K Governor said, “There is a long way to go.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/be-prepared-china-means-business-warns-nn-vohra-279728

His attendant Dolly Bairahi said he passed away early today due to age-related ailments after being unwell for some time.Born in Lahore in 1925, Datt was also part of the team that won gold at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. Datt, who had to leave the city of his birth after the country was partitioned in 1947, settled down in Kolkata in 1950. He missed the opportunity to claim a hat-trick of Olympics gold medals when his employer, Brooke Bond, did not allow him leave for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.Datt came to prominence as a player when he was attending Lahore’s Government College. His talent was noticed when he was representing the pre-partitioned Punjab in the National Championship. Mentored by Dhyan Chand, he progressed rapidly as he went on to play with some of the greatest players in Indian hockey. Datt toured East Africa under Dhyan Chand in 1947.“It’s a very sad time for our family. Normally I visit him three-four times a year but because of the pandemic, I’ve not been able to see him since 2019,” his daughter Anjali Keshav Poulsen said from Copenhagen.

Raj Kapoor was not only Dilip Kumar’s contemporary. Their association goes back to living in neigbouring “havelis”, being schoolmates and studying in the same college (Khalsa College). And, evidently, it was Raj Kapoor who first told Dilip that he could be a star.Read also: The original Badshah of BollywoodWhen Dilip’s father, Lala Ghulam Sarwar Khan, came to know of his career switch from fruit trader to film actor, Raj, as a true friend, came to his rescue and made his father, Prithviraj Kapoor, reason with him.The only Indian actor to receive Pakistan’s highest civilian award, Nishan-e-Imtiaz in 1998, Dilip Kumar was later pressurised to return the honour during the 1999 Kargil war by then coalition government of Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.He had thought that the protests outside his house would die down soon, but when they didn’t, he met then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who intervened.“There’s no doubt about Dilip’s patriotism and commitment to the nation. He has proved that time and again during his film career. He has received the award at an individual level. It’s his will to keep it or return it. No one can pressurise him,” Vajpayee had said.It was revealed later that in a letter that Dilip Kumar wrote to arrange a meeting with Vajpayee, he mentioned that if returning the award was in the best interests of the nation, he would gladly do so.Former Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri described Dilip as the “one who could bring India and Pakistan together” in his book titled “Neither a Hawk nor a Dove”.Dilip’s picture greeting Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the independence activist, advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity, who was against partition, on his visit to India at Meenambakkam Airport, Chennai, bears witness of him being the figure of peace throughout his life.The First Khan||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dilip-kumar-only-indian-actor-to-receive-highest-pak-honour-279775

08-07-2021||New Delhi||Humour, anger, shock: Netizens react to petrol price crossing Rs 100/litre||As the price of petrol crossed an all-time high of Rs 100 per litre in Delhi and several other cities on Wednesday, netizens flooded the microblogging site Twitter with varied reactions -- some coping with the unfortunate news with humour and others just expressing plain, simple shock.Hashtags like #petroldieselpricehike and #petrol100notout are being used in large numbers since the fuel prices were increased in line with firming international oil trends.Humour seems to be the key to coping with the news as memes and jokes started doing the rounds soon after the price hike.Sharing a picture of a bicycle that has been made to look like a motorcycle using cardboards, a Twitter user said this was the kind of bike that Indians would be able to ride following the fuel price hike."Desi bike...after petrol, diesel price hike," the user tweeted.Taking a dig at Narendra Modi's 2014 poll pitch of “acchhe din aayenge” (good days would come), a Twitter user shared a caricature depicting a man saying, “Kaash woh bure din he wapas atay” (I wish the bad days could return).A photograph of a petrol bill from 1963 when petrol cost 72 paisa per litre has emerged as a favourite among the Twitterati.Reposting the image of the cash memo, a social media user wrote, "Petrol cash bill on 02/02/1963.... 1 litre = 0.72. If I had #Timemachine i'll go back and fill my vehicles." According to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers, petrol price was increased by 35 paise per litre and diesel by 23 paise a litre.In Delhi, petrol now costs Rs 100.21 a litre and diesel is priced at Rs 89.53 per litre.Delhi is the last of the metro cities to see petrol rising above the Rs 100-a-litre mark. Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune already have prices above that mark.Kolkata also saw petrol prices climbing over Rs 100 per litre on Wednesday.According to a social media user, the fuel prices were being jacked up so frequently that waking up to a price hike had become a way of life.“No stoppage to hike in price for diesel and petrol. Every morning wake up with this news. Feels like it is no more a news now. Now only elections can relieve us middle class people(sic)," the user wrote.For others, the unprecedented hike in fuel prices simply reinforced their disappointment and anger at the current dispensation."Masterstroke by Modi government. Petrol in Delhi crossed ?100 and Modi is celebrating the occasion by expanding his cabinet...," a Twitter user posted."Situation of inflation in Delhi and other parts of India is really worrisome. These are times when the government should be with people of India , helping them...but instead they are asking people to pay Rs 100 a litre,” another user wrote.Reactions on the social media are a reflection of the frustration that is boiling up beyond the internet.The fuel price hike has added significantly to Delhi-based Sayan Kundu's expenses."I purchased my only car in August 2017. Due to this reckless rise in fuel prices, according to my calculations, my last round trip to Lucknow from Delhi cost me nearly Rs 3,000 more than what it would have in 2017. A nearly 30 per cent increase!" the 32-year-old said.Now, 28-year-old Ankit Gautam has to think twice before deciding to take out his car. Unless it is for an essential purpose, a car is a big no."I used to get the tank full as soon as my salary arrived every month. Now, I take my car out only when it is absolutely necessary. Need the same frequency of hikes in my salary too," he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/humour-anger-shock-netizens-react-to-petrol-price-crossing-rs-100-litre-279552
08-07-2021||---||Mismanaging Covid: Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, deputy Choubey dropped from Cabinet||New Delhi, July 7Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and his deputy Ashwani Choubey were on Wednesday dropped from the Council of Ministers on account of mismanagement of the second wave of Covid pandemic.Vardhan has been dropped as health minister for the second time since the NDA government took charge in 2014.It’s unclear whether Vardhan has also been asked to resign from his other ministries, which include earth sciences and science and technology.Top government sources said Vardhan was not seen as proactive on predicting and managing the ferocious second wave of the pandemic.Much of pandemic management was left to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who took severe flak as people died for want of medical oxygen at the height of the second wave in May.The scale of the pandemic was not assessed even to marginal extents and the government was slammed for presiding over a massive human tragedy as people died due to lack of beds in hospitals, lack of oxygen with bodies being disposed of in the Ganga.The ferocity of the second wave of the pandemic had the world questioning India’s ability to handle the infection, it having done well during the first wave that had peaked in September last year.Overwhelmed burial and cremation grounds, insufficient planning and infrastructure, and bodies in the Ganga dented India’s global image with the PMO left to salvage the situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mismanaging-covid-union-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-deputy-choubey-dropped-from-cabinet-279540

The names of Rane, Sonowal and Scindia had been doing the rounds for long as the topmost ‘probables’ in the reshuffle.Ministers of state, including Kiran Rijiju, a prominent face from the Northeast, bureaucrats RK Singh and Hardeep Puri, Gujarat MPs Mansukh Mandaviya and Purushottam Rupala, Secunderabad representative G Kishan Reddy who is considered close to Home Minister Amit Shah, and Hamirpur MP Anurag Thakur were rewarded for their performance and promoted to the Cabinet rank.Apart from Rane, Scindia and Sonowal, the other new faces in the Cabinet included former bureaucrat and Rajya Sabha MP Ashwani Vaishnav and his colleague in the upper house, Bhupendra Yadav. Also seen as Home Minister Shah’s right-hand man, Yadav is a lawyer by profession and at the top in the BJP’s scheme of things. The 15 new Cabinet ministers included two allies, Ram Chandra Prasad Singh, the national president of the JD-U, and Pashupati Kumar Paras, a leader of the breakaway group of LJP. Apna Dal MP Anupriya Patel, a prominent Kurmi face from UP, was included as a minister of state. Those inducted also include New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi and MP from Uttarakhand Ajay Bhatt, both ministers of state.Meanwhile, those who resigned to make way for them are Cabinet ministers Thawar Chand Gehlot (now the Karnataka Governor), Ravi Shankar Prasad, Prakash Javadekar, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Harsh Vardhan, DV Sadananda Gowda and ministers of state Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Babul Supriyo, Dhotre Sanjay Shamrao, Rattan Lal Kataria, Pratap Chandra Sarangi and Debasree Chaudhuri.With an eye on upcoming assembly elections and 2024 general elections, the new ministers include seven from poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, four from Karnataka and four from West Bengal. Meanwhile, with Gujarat Assembly elections less than a year away, the renewed Cabinet now has seven ministers from the state. They include Home Minister Amit Shah and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who represents Gujarat in the Rajya Sabha.The mid-term course correction saw several surprise entries spanning the caste, region, and gender. It is a young council with 14 ministers below the age of 50.The average age of the council with six doctors, 13 lawyers, seven former bureaucrats, and five engineers is said to be 58 years.   With as many as 27 OBC, 12 SCs, eight ST ministers, the Prime Minister today also tried to give a new dimension to the BJP known for its upper-caste credentials, while balancing experience with freshness and talent.Those in the know of developments say, “Talent and administrative experience have been rewarded.” A Modi-Shah stamp visible, a whole lot of planning and arithmetic has gone into the exercise, taking into consideration a host of issues ranging from upcoming challenges amid the Covid pandemic, perceptions, and state elections, including Uttar Pradesh. Sources say the PM today asked the new ministers to work with better coordination with the BJP and “let their work speak for them”.Also read: Likely candidates meet Modi ahead of Union Cabinet reshuffle this eveningVasundhara meets SanthoshSources say BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh and Nadda also met former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje.
