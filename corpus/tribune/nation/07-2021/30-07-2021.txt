It was 205.34 metres at 11 am and 205.10 meters at 6 am, an official said, adding it is likely to rise further.All the departments concerned have been alerted. The irrigation and flood control department has deployed 13 boats in different areas and put 21 others on standby, the official from the irrigation and flood control department said.With Haryana discharging more water into the river from the Hathnikund Barrage, the Delhi Police and the East Delhi district administration have started evacuating people living on the floodplains of the Yamuna in the capital.These people are being shifted to shelter homes of the city government in the Yamuna Pushta area, the official said.“In the East District, 15 vulnerable points have been identified. We are erecting tents and evacuating people from these vulnerable points,” another official said, adding all standard operating procedures are being followed and the situation is being monitored round-the-clock.A flood alert is declared when the Yamuna crosses the “warning mark” of 204.50 metres. The situation is being monitored round-the-clock, a district administration official said.The river is in spate because of rains in Delhi and the upper catchment areas, a MeT department official said, adding it may swell further as more rains are predicted in northwest India.According to the Delhi flood control room, the discharge rate at the Hathnikund Barrage peaked to 1.60 lakh cusecs on Tuesday afternoon, the highest this year so far.The water discharged from the barrage normally takes two-three days to reach the capital.Haryana had been releasing water from the Yumananagar-located barrage at the rate of 37,109 cusecs at 8 pm. It was 19,056 cusecs at 8 am.Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusec, but the discharge is increased after heavy rainfall in catchment areas.One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second.In 2019, the flow rate had peaked to 8.28 lakh cusec on August 18-19, and the water level of the Yamuna had hit the 206.60 meter-mark, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 meters.The Delhi government had to launch evacuation and relief operations after the overflowing river submerged many low-lying areas.In 1978, the river had swelled to the all-time record water level of 207.49 meters.In 2013, it had risen to 207.32 meters.

30-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly passes resolution to repeal three farm laws||The Delhi Assembly on its last day of the monsoon session on Friday passed a resolution to repeal the three farm laws and suggested the Central Government to talk to farmers and resolve their grievances.Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain alleged that farm laws are aimed at benefiting big companies not farmers.“The doubling of farmers’ income is a jumla (false promise). These farm laws are passed to benefit some big companies and the farmers will turn from owners to labourers. The Centre should withdraw these farm laws immediately without any condition,” Jain said.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at Delhi’s borders since November last year against the three agri laws, which were enacted in September that year.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Jarnail Singh initiated the discussion on the contentious farm laws and said farmers have been sitting on protest at the three border points of Delhi against these laws.He alleged that nearly 600 farmers have died so far but Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not speak a single word on it, even though he speaks on small matters.“Farmers consider land their mother and they can go to any extent to protect it. We want to appeal to Centre through the Assembly that the central government should talk to the farmers and repeal these three farm laws,” Singh said.Farmer groups have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.They are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Responding to the debate, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the farm laws will increase crop production and double the income of farmers.“Through these reforms mandis will be expanded. After Narendra Modi became the prime minister, the income of farmers has doubled and production has been increased. I request the CM to give subsidy on purchase of tractors to farmers in Delhi,” Bidhuri said.

India says the State of Arunachal Pradesh is its integral and inalienable part.The maps wrapped in about 300 export consignments marked as “bedclothes” were seized by the customs at Shanghai Pudong airport, Chinese daily thepaper.cn reported.China passed a new regulation in 2019, making it mandatory for all maps being printed and sold in the country including those meant for exports to carry the official version of Chinese maps incorporating China's claims including, Arunachal Pradesh, Taiwan and the South China Sea.Maps are the main form of representing national territory, which is serious for its political, scientific and legal significance, the notice announcing the new regulation said."Problematic maps will confuse the international community about China's territory or even be hyped by those with ulterior motives," it said.The same year the rule was promulgated, Chinese customs destroyed over three lakh maps meant for export on the ground that they are not compatible with official maps of the country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-customs-officials-seize-maps-for-showing-arunachal-pradesh-as-part-of-india-290598

30-07-2021||New Delhi||CBSE class 12 results: College admissions might become 'uphill task' due to high scores, say experts||CBSE's feat of achieving the highest-ever pass percentage in class 12 has grabbed eyeballs of education experts who say college admissions might become an "uphill task" due to the high scores despite moderation.Some experts have pointed out that the allegedly "inflated" marks may be detrimental for state board students, who will miss out further on chances of college admissions.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) recorded the highest ever pass percentage of 99.37 in this year's class 12 results, declared on Friday, with girls outshining boys by a slender margin of 0.54 per cent.The pass percentage increased by over 10 percentage points against last year's 88.78 per cent."The guidelines given to the schools states that they can increase the marks by about 2 per cent compared to the previous years. If that's the case, how did over 70,000 students score more than 95 per cent this year? A school's average cannot be more than 80 pc. This discrepancy is indeed a mystery that does not meet the eye, which the concerned authorities need to investigate," said Sunita Gandhi, a noted educationist."The schools that have been honest and sticking to the clear-cut guidelines are getting poorer results this year. Many, I know, who followed the guidelines haven't got more than 2 per cent, which is required of the previous last three results. Given the CBSE procedure, how did many schools get away with it? This has led to a lot of disappointed children as well. This will impact the college admissions massively," Gandhi added.The results announced by the board showed that the number of candidates scoring above 95 per cent has increased from 38,686 last year to 70,004 this time.However, the number of students scoring between 90-95 per cent has gone down from 1,57,934 last year to 1,50,152 this time.According to Milind Padalkar, Pro Chancellor, The NorthCap University, the huge number of students scoring above 95 pc, is going to increase the pressure of getting admission to highly sought-after colleges and students may be left without getting into colleges of their choice."The colleges that see rush will have to evolve a different mechanism for acceptance. This also means the spike of students scoring high marks will have to be absorbed by various colleges who earlier were not on the consideration list of the students. Such colleges will have to gear up likewise for coming up with acceptance strategies. This might mean rising demands for colleges in general compared to last year," he told PTI.Shishir Jaipuria, Chairman, Seth Anandram Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions, believes the excellent results indicate that college admissions will be an "uphill" task."The results have understandably elated many students. About 99.37 pc students have passed the exam and over 70,000 of them have scored more than 95 percentile this year. This is a record high pass percentage and could be a result of the new 30-30-40 formula for academic evaluation of students,” he said."The excellent results indicate that college admissions will be an uphill task. The college admission process will be tough as the cut-offs may increase," he added.According to Sangeeta Hajela, Principal, DPS Indirapuram, to see nearly double the number of students in 95 percent and above bracket is surely noticeable phenomenon and "colleges need to rethink on their seats distribution" Narendra Shyamsukha, Chairman ICA Edu SKills, said while it is a matter of rejoice for CBSE students, such inflation in marks has become a concern for students from the state boards."The college cut-offs are going to be higher than last year as a large number of students have scored above 95 per cent in CBSE class 12 exams this year. So, if the results of the state boards don't match up with the other boards, then students will miss out on seats in colleges and courses of our choice. Such inflation in marks will only cause unnecessary stress and disparity in the society, he said."For the last few years, it has been seen that the first two merit lists of colleges are mostly dominated by CBSE students. Also, this will impact the admission criteria in the deemed universities, while earlier grades, extracurricular activities, and sports would have made a student get into a good college, this time colleges might look at extra skills, reasoning and creative thinking, communication skills and other qualities that makes them eligible for admissions," he added.Dheeraj Sanghi, Vice Chancellor-Designate, JK Lakshmipat University, Jaipur, said the marks allotted by the CBSE are "pretty random" and do not reflect the hard work that students put into getting the grades in class 12 like it used to happen usually."This time college admission interviews should focus more on creative, cognitive thinking and overall aptitude and portfolio of the students," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-class-12-results-college-admissions-might-become-uphill-task-due-to-high-scores-say-experts-290589

30-07-2021||New Delhi||Over 2.27 lakh pregnant women given their first dose of Covid vaccine: Govt||Over 2.27 lakh pregnant women have received their first dose of anti-coronavirus vaccine under the ongoing national Covid-19 inoculation drive, the Union health ministry said on Friday.This can be seen as a result of regular counselling of pregnant women by health workers and medical officers about risks of the infection and benefits of vaccination, it said.This sustained campaign has empowered pregnant women to make an informed choice on Covid vaccination, the ministry said.Tamil Nadu is leading the way by vaccinating over 78,838 pregnant women, it said.The ministry also said that 34,228 pregnant women have been vaccinated in Andhra Pradesh, 29,821 in Odisha, 21,842 in Madhya Pradesh, 18,423 in Kerala and 16,673 in Karnataka.As part of the campaign to dispel fears, apprehensions, misinformation and some social taboos and issues, a guidance note to assist states and union territories (UTs) in operationalising the Covid vaccination programme for pregnant women was shared by the Union health ministry on July 2.This was followed up by training of programme managers, service providers and frontline health workers to equip them to counsel pregnant women and their families during antenatal care about the importance of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy, the ministry said in a statement.States and UTs sensitised their vaccination teams at government and private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) regarding inoculation of pregnant women, it said.Several initiatives have been taken by states to encourage pregnant women to take the vaccine. These include special vaccination sessions for pregnant women, the statement said.Counselling of eligible beneficiaries by frontline workers and counsellors at antenatal clinics and mobilisation by ASHAs for vaccination have resulted in building confidence and acceptance in the community, it said.Innovative practices like issuing certificate by a deputy commissioner to pregnant and lactating women who were first to get themselves vaccinated was also among the initiatives to build acceptance in the community.Studies have shown that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy may result in rapid deterioration of health of pregnant women and escalating the increased risk of severe disease, and might affect the foetus too.Pregnant women with Covid-19 infection are at an increased risk for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, including higher chances of neonatal morbidity, the ministry said.Experts have also highlighted pre-existing co-morbidities, advanced maternal age, and high body mass index as factors for severe Covid-19 in pregnancy.The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) had recommended vaccination for pregnant women. The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) had also unanimously recommended it earlier.A national level consultation on Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant women was also convened by the ministry to build consensus, the statement said Professional bodies like FOGSI, representatives of state governments, CSOs, NGOs, development partner agencies, technical experts., participated in this consultation, it said.The recommendation of NTAGI to vaccinate pregnant women was unanimously welcomed, the statement said.The combined effort of the Centre, states and UTs and other stakeholders is helping in building confidence among pregnant women and their families with increased uptake of Covid-19 vaccination thus, helping in protecting two lives from the risk of infection. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-2-27-lakh-pregnant-women-given-their-first-dose-of-covid-vaccine-govt-290575

30-07-2021||New Delhi||Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Bill introduced in LS||Farmers may have to pay environmental compensation in the future for causing air pollution by stubble burning, according to a new Bill introduced in Parliament on Friday to set up a commission for tackling the menace of toxic air in the National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas.The Bill, which seeks to set up a statutory authority with appropriate powers to tackle air pollution in the NCR and adjoining areas, was introduced in the Lok Sabha amid din created by opposition members over the Pegasus spying row and farmers’ issue.Once passed, ‘The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill, 2021’ will replace an ordinance issued in the recent past.According to the new Bill, “the commission may impose and collect environmental compensation from farmers causing air pollution by stubble burning, at such rate and in such manner, as may be prescribed”.The central government’s Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and its Adjoining Areas, established in October 2020, was shut down within five months of its constitution. It was shut in March 2021 due to lapsing of the Ordinance under which it was set up.The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill, piloted by Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, states that it was noticed there is a lack of a permanent, dedicated and participative mechanism adopting a collaborative and participatory approach involving relevant central ministries, state governments, local bodies and other stakeholders to tackle air pollution, in the NCR and adjoining areas.“It is observed that sources of air pollution, particularly in the National Capital Region, consist of a variety of factors which are beyond the local limits of the National Capital Region.“Special focus is required on all sources of air pollution which are associated with different economic sectors, including power, agriculture, transport, industry, residential and construction,” it read.Since air pollution is not a localised phenomenon, the effect is felt in areas even far away from the source, creating the need for regional-level initiatives through inter-state and inter-city coordination in addition to multi-sectoral synchronisation, the statement of objects said.For a permanent solution and to establish a self-regulated, democratically-monitored mechanism for tackling air pollution in NCR, it was deemed necessary to take up immediate legislative measures to set up a Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, that would replace old panels to streamline public participation, inter-state cooperation, expert involvement and persistent research and innovation, it noted.The commission shall consist of a full-time chairperson having experience of not less than 15 years in the field of environment protection and pollution control or having administrative experience of not less than 25 years.It shall have a representative of the secretary, Ministry of Environment, who shall be an officer not below the rank of joint secretary, ex officio and five ex officio members who are either chief secretaries or secretaries in charge of the department dealing with environmental protection in the NCT of Delhi and the states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.The Bill proposed that the commission will have one full-time member who is or has been a joint secretary to the government of India, three full-time independent technical members to be appointed from amongst persons having specific knowledge and experience in matters relating to air pollution, one technical member from the Central Pollution Control Board, ex officio, one technical member to be nominated by the Indian Space Research Organisation, ex officio.It shall also have three members from non-governmental organisations having experience in matters concerning combating air pollution, one representative of the National Institution for Transforming India, not below the rank of Joint Secretary or Adviser, ex officio; one officer in the rank of Joint Secretary to the government of India to be appointed by the central government as a full-time Member-Secretary of the Commission; three members, being stakeholders from such sectors as agriculture, industry, transport or construction.“The chairperson or a member, other than an ex officio member, shall hold office for a term of three years from the date on which he enters upon his office or until he attains the age of 70 years, whichever is earlier, and shall be eligible for re-appointment,” it said.The commission proposes up to five years of jail term or Rs one crore fine or both for violators, excluding farmers, with immediate effect.“Provided that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any farmer for causing air pollution by stubble burning or mismanagement of agricultural residue,” it said.As Parliament was not in session and there was an immediate need for legislation in this regard, the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020, was promulgated on October 28, 2020.However, a bill to replace the ordinance could not be introduced in Parliament. Consequently, the Ordinance lapsed on March 12, 2021, and was promulgated on April 13, 2021. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/commission-for-air-quality-management-in-ncr-and-adjoining-areas-bill-introduced-in-ls-290570

30-07-2021||New Delhi||Opposition can seek clarification from IT Minister on Pegasus issue: Pralhad Joshi||With the Opposition determined to stall Parliament until the government agrees to a debate on the Pegasus issue, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said on Friday Opposition parties can still seek clarification from IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on his statement over the matter.Interacting with reporters after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day due to the Opposition’s protests, he said the government had agreed to them seeking clarification from Vaishnaw after he made statements in both the House and these parties can still do so.The Opposition has insisted that it will not call off its protests inside Parliament without the government allowing a full-fledged debate on the alleged snooping on a group of people, ranging from politicians to businessmen and journalists, with the use of the Pegasus spyware.The Opposition had created a ruckus in the Lok Sabha when Vaishnaw made his statement on the issue. In the Rajya Sabha, a Trinamool Congress member had torn the paper containing the minister’s statement, forcing him to lay his comments on the floor of the House.Joshi said in the Lok Sabha on Friday that the controversy was a “non-issue” and that the government was ready for discussions on people-related issues.Echoing the view, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur accused parties like the Congress and the TMC of “wasting” Parliament’s time merely for politics.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government is ready to discuss different issues. We want the Opposition to raise people-related matters and the government will reply. It is unfortunate that some members of the opposition have been creating a ruckus, tearing papers and throwing them at the Chair and ministers,” he told reporters.Parliament’s monsoon session has been marred by continuous disruptions by opposition parties. Though the government has got a few bills passed amid the din, both the Houses have seen little debate, except for a brief discussion on COVID-19 in the Rajya Sabha.Vaishnaw had dismissed the reports of the use of Pegasus software to snoop on Indians, saying the allegations levelled just ahead of the session were aimed at maligning Indian democracy.In a suo motu statement, he had said with several checks and balances being in place, “any sort of illegal surveillance” by unauthorised persons is not possible in India.

30-07-2021||Jaipur||Some ministers willing to step down in Rajasthan, Maken says ahead of reshuffle||In a clear indication that some members of the Rajasthan Cabinet may be dropped, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken on Friday said a few ministers have expressed willingness to quit the government to work for the organisation.The remark by Maken, who is the Rajasthan in-charge at the All India Congress Committee (AICC), follows his one-on-one meetings here with party MLAs and other leaders in the Congress-ruled state ahead of a likely Cabinet reshuffle.Maken said everyone told him that they will accept whatever the party high command decides for them.A Cabinet expansion and appointments to district Congress posts is expected soon, following demands by supporters of former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot for a bigger share of power in the state led by Ashok Gehlot."There are people who are eager to leave government positions and work for the organisation. We are proud of such people,” Maken said, his remarks indicating that some ministers in the Gehlot Cabinet may now make way for fresh faces.“The Congress will form the government again in 2023 with our members, who are ready to leave everything and work together with the organisation," he told reporters.The leader said the ministers cited his own example when he quit a ministerial post in 2013 to work for the organisation.After the one-on-one meetings on Wednesday and Thursday with 115 MLAs – from the ruling party and those supporting it – Maken held discussions Friday with the state executive at the Congress headquarters here.He is now expected to submit his report to the party's central leadership in New Delhi.“We mainly discussed how we can bring back a Congress government in 2023. In the state executive meeting also, we discussed that there should be better coordination between the government and the organisation so that together we can bring the Congress back to power," he said.Maken appreciated the performance of the Gehlot government."I was told by every MLA how amazing development work has been carried out in their constituency—be it education, health, roads, hospitals. All MLAs are satisfied and all are moving ahead on the path of development,” he said.Apart from the MLAs, Maken spoke separately with Gehlot, Pilot, state unit president Govind Singh Dotasra and Speaker C P Joshi.Asked about the possible role for Pilot, who was sacked as deputy CM and the state unit president after he rebelled last year against Gehlot, he said, "Everyone has faith in the high command. Everyone has said that whatever role the high command decides will be acceptable to all.” On Thursday night, Gehlot also held an informal meeting of party MLAs at his home. “Forget, forgive and unite,” he was quoted later as telling them.“There is no dearth of development work in the state. The work will continue like this... have faith. All of you will win and the Congress will form the government in 2023," the chief minister said.Including Gehlot, there are 21 members now in the Rajasthan ministry and up to nine more can be accommodated. Similarly, there are vacancies in party units at the district level.The Congress high command had brought about a truce in the Rajasthan unit after rebel MLAs led by Pilot appeared to bring the Gehlot government on the verge of collapse last year.A three-member AICC committee was formed to look into the grievances of Pilot supporters. But they claim that this has not happened even months later. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/some-ministers-willing-to-step-down-in-rajasthan-maken-says-ahead-of-reshuffle-290561

The progress of the region has long been fought for... and it would be a matter of great regret to let that wither away”. He said the recent clashes along the Assam-Mizoram border, which claimed six lives, have once again highlighted the vulnerability of peace and stability of the region.The Meghalaya MP noted that barring Tripura and Manipur, all other states in northeast have a long boundary dispute with Assam.It has also given rise to wrangle over land, forest resources and ethnic clashes over the years, he added.Meanwhile, the North East MPs Forum, of which Pala is the general secretary, has asked both Assam and Mizoram governments to adopt conciliatory steps to ensure peace and tranquility along the border.The forum appealed to both the states to come together with the honest aim of resolving the long-pending dispute.The recent developments on the Assam-Mizoram borders have been a cause of great anguish and regret to the people of northeast, it said.“On behalf of the Members of Parliament from the northeast, we appeal to both the parties and governments to adopt conciliatory steps to ensure peace and tranquility along the border,” a statement issued by forum chairman Kiren Rijiju and its general secretary said.“The loss of life and injury on both sides is shocking... and we wish to extend our condolences to the affected families,” the forum added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/meghalaya-mp-writes-to-pm-says-interstate-border-row-taken-aggressive-turn-under-bjp-government-in-assam-290548

I have asked the Commissioner of Police to conduct an inquiry and submit a report. After that, the government will take appropriate action," he told reporters.In the audio clip, the officer, reportedly of the Deputy Commissioner-rank, was purportedly heard asking a subordinate which eatery in the Vishrambaug police station's jurisdiction sells good biryani. The latter recommended one prepared in "desi ghee" at a famous restaurant.Vishrambaug police station falls under Zone I of Pune police.She then asked him to order biryani from the restaurant and speak to the local "PI" (police inspector) if the issue of paying arose."Do we need to pay in our own jurisdiction," the woman officer was heard saying.When the subordinate told her that they always paid for food ordered from outside, the woman officer said, "What is the problem, he (the inspector) will do it since the hotel comes under his jurisdiction."Later, speaking to a Marathi news channel, the officer claimed that the audio-clip had been doctored, and it surfaced when the process of transfer of senior police officials was underway."This is a conspiracy against me....there were some police personnel who have been posted in the same zone for several years. Their financial interests are involved here in the zone. Some senior officials who used to work here too are involved in this," she alleged."There are some people in the department who want me out as after I took charge here, their activities were stopped," she said.She was going to lodge a complaint with the cyber crime cell as the clip was partly doctored, the officer added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-police-officer-seeks-biryani-asks-what-is-the-need-to-pay-290544

They raised non-stop chants and slogans during the entire course of the legislative proceeding.The Members, however, did not budge after which the Bill was put to voice vote, and its subsequent sailing through.The Bill proposes an amendment to the Coconut Development Board Act, 1979.The proposals are to make the post of Chairman non-executive in nature and status, and to provide for a full-fledged post of Chief Executive Officer of the Coconut Development Board.Earlier, an officer of the rank of Joint Secretary was made the Chairman, and the executive functions were also vested in the post.The Bill's statement of Objects and Reasons says the amendments to the Act were aimed to share the workload of administration between the Chairman and the CEO, to boost production and marketing of coconut and its products, and to propel such activities into the international market, and to provide help to coconut growers effectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-passes-bill-in-rajya-sabha-despite-last-ditch-effort-by-opposition-to-stall-it-290538
30-07-2021||New Delhi||IndiGo signs pact to explore potential of using sustainable aviation fuel in aircraft||IndiGo is exploring the potential of using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in aircraft and the airline has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with an international SAF provider, a statement said on Friday.However, the carrier did not reveal the name of the SAF provider.Commercial aviation is responsible for about 2-3 per cent of the global carbon emissions. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has given up flying to reduce her personal carbon footprint, boosting the "flight shame" movement in Europe and other parts of the world.In a report titled 'IndiGo Green' released on Friday, India's largest airline stated that it knows that the SAF is not in mass production currently.However, knowing the importance of SAF, IndiGo is exploring the potential of using it and is in talks with its manufacturers globally, it said."The utilisation of SAF commercially is still a few years away but as a leader in Indian aviation, we have already embarked on this journey by signing our first MoU with an international SAF provider," it added.IndiGo said it is currently taking up the following steps to reduce its aviation turbine fuel (ATF) consumption to decreased its carbon footprint — fleet modernisation; implementing weight reduction measures on board; optimising flight routes; improving flight operations; and following fuel-efficient best practices."At IndiGo, we also believe that the use of all the above practices combined together cannot match the impact which can be created by sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). However, we also understand that SAF is not in mass production," it said.The airline said it saved 4.67 lakh tonnes of aviation turbine fuel between 2014-15 to 2020-21.The carrier said it aims to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 18 per cent per available seat kilometer (ASK) in 2022-23, as compared to 2015-16.ASK measures passenger carrying capacity of the airline, and it is calculated by multiplying the total number of seats in flights to total number of kilometres flown by them.The airline measures CO2 efficiency using ASK intensity ratio, which is metric tonnes CO2/1,000 ASKs. One MT CO2 is equal to 316 kg of fuel.As per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), it is defined as 'any fuel that has the potential to generate lower carbon emissions than conventional kerosene on a life cycle basis'.The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations specialised agency, in some cases uses 'alternative fuels' as its terminology, and it is defined as 'any fuel that has the potential to generate lower carbon emissions than conventional kerosene on a life cycle basis'. ICAO also uses the term 'sustainable aviation fuel'. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indigo-signs-pact-to-explore-potential-of-using-sustainable-aviation-fuel-in-aircraft-290536

The three-minute cinematic video is fused together by madcap action, curly wigs, inflated sumo costumes, and disorienting close-ups.All of this is captured by Vadbibes director Jas Tan with a carefree sense of the surreal and produced by Flightsch and RIIDEM.Comical antics are set in formidable locations looking straight out of Christopher Nolan films, but Yung Raja takes centre stage by invoking the brash spirit of Rajinikanth's characters.Yung started his career in 2018 with his single "Poori Gang" and went on to become Southeast Asia's rising hip-hop artist with "Mustafa", "Mad Blessings", "The Dance Song".His recent track "Mami" recently got featured on the American late-night talk show "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon".His latest single "Spice Boy" tries to break free from homogenous expectations of popular culture.Continuing his crusade of making room for multi-dimensional cultural identities Yung Raja said: "Since I was a child, I've always been proud of my culture, my roots, my mother tongue, everything that makes me 'me'. Learning to embrace that from a very young age is one of the reasons behind the bilingualism in my art."This is who I am, a bilingual boy born and raised in Singapore to traditional parents who migrated from South India. I remember first discovering hip-hop music when I was 10 years of age and how it made one of the first and strongest impressions on me creatively. That was the real beginning of my rooted identity and voice amalgamating with hip-hop culture. I believe my persona is all about staying authentic to the duality of my cultural make-up."The first-generation Singaporean-Indian was recently signed to US label Alamo Records, marking his entry into the US market.The young rapper is also signed to Def Jam Southeast Asia, which is under Universal Music Group."Spice Boy" was released on Thursday night on all audio streaming platforms, and the official music video will premiere on Yung Raja's Vevo channel. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/singaporean-rapper-yung-raja-pays-ode-to-rajinikanth-in-spice-boy-290531

After a clash on Monday between Assam and Mizoram police forces on a disputed border forest tract, various group's in the Barak Valley had announced a blockade of Mizoram, drawing sharp protests from the neighbouring state.However, “palpable fear of entering an area which was like a war zone is holding back trucks … Most truckers have stopped their vehicles in Dholai village near the border with Mizoram,” said officials.A long line of trucks parked on the highway now marks the entry point to Dholai's bazaar. Land-locked Mizoram has been getting its supplies via Tripura during this week as tension and unrest held up its normal supply route through Assam.Assam government had on Thursday issued an unprecedented travel advisory asking people not to travel to Mizoram and advised people from the state working or staying there to “exercise utmost caution.” Despite an agreement Wednesday hammered by the Union home ministry to maintain calm on the border and to allow a neutral central police force to act as peace-keepers, the two states had traded charges about reinforcing police pickets and not pulling back from the border on Thursday.Tension along the border with Mizoram in Cachar and Hailakandi districts of Assam have been escalating since October 2020 with frequent incidents of burning of houses and encroachment of land.The two states share a 164.6-km border between Assam's Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts, and Mizoram's Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl.Both states have differing interpretations of their territorial border. While Mizoram believes that its border lies along an ‘inner line' drawn up in 1875 to protect tribals from outside influence, Assam goes by a district demarcation done in the 1930s.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-mizoram-border-organised-blockade-on-border-ends-but-truckers-refuse-to-move-290524

30-07-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks Ramdev's stand on plea against him by doctors' associations for remarks against allopathy||The Delhi High Court Friday sought Yoga guru Ramdev's stand on a lawsuit against him by several doctors' associations for allegedly spreading misinformation by his statements against allopathy amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which purportedly amounts to public nuisance.Justice Hari Shankar granted a week's time to Ramdev to file his response and said that he would not grant leave for institution of the proceedings in the absence of a reply.“Public nuisance has some consequences on the defendant. It is open to the defendant (Ramdev) to say that there is no case. Can't say that I won't give him an opportunity,” the judge said.Senior advocate Akhil Sibal, appearing for the associations, argued that to grant permission to institute the suit, the court has to only look at the plea before it and need not seek the other party's response.“It is between me and the court unless it (the plea) is evidently vexatious.. merits will come after I'm permitted,” Sibal stated.Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Ramdev, said that the plea was “a second bite at the cherry” and opposed the grant of leave.The court granted time to Nayar to file his response and said “They (Ramdev) will file a counter for revoking the leave (if) granted. We will put it next Friday. Let them file a reply.” The matter would be heard next on August 10.The associations before court are three Resident Doctors' Association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Rishikesh, Patna and Bhubaneshwar, Association of Resident Doctors, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, Union of Resident Doctors of Punjab (URDP); Resident Doctors' Association, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut and Telangana Junior Doctors' Association, Hyderabad.They alleged that Ramdev was misleading and misrepresenting to the public at large that allopathy was responsible for the deaths of several people infected by Covid-19, and insinuating that allopathic doctors were causing deaths of the patients.In their plea filed through advocate Harshavardhan Kotla, the associations have submitted that the yoga guru was sowing doubts in the minds of general public with respect to the safety and efficacy of not only allopathic treatments but also Covid-19 vaccines.Being a highly influential person, it is apprehended that Ramdev's statements can influence lakhs of people and divert them from allopathic treatment which are prescribed as the standard form of care even by the government, the plea submitted.The associations alleged in the plea that the misinformation campaign was nothing but an advertisement and marketing strategy to further the sales of the product sold by Ramdev, including Coronil which claims to be an alternative treatment for Covid-19.With the third wave of Covid-19 likely to set in August, it is imperative that Ramdev's sustained misinformation campaign be brought to a halt, the association has pleaded.The other defendants in the plea include Acharya Balkrishna and Patanjali Ayurveda.The court had on June 3 issued summons to Ramdev on a plea by the Delhi Medical Association in connection with his alleged statements against allopathic medicines and claims regarding Patanjali's Coronil kit.The court had refused to restrain Ramdev at that stage, saying the allopathic profession was not so fragile.It had, however, orally asked Ramdev's counsel to tell him not to make any provocative statements. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-seeks-ramdevs-stand-on-plea-against-him-by-doctors-associations-for-remarks-against-allopathy-290520
30-07-2021||New Delhi||HC to hear in August appeals of Facebook, WhatsApp pleas in privacy policy matter||The Delhi High Court Friday said it will hear on August 27 the appeals of Facebook and WhatsApp against its single-judge order dismissing their pleas against the probe Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered into the instant messaging app's new privacy policy.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh listed the matter in August after Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh, representing CCI, sought some time to respond to the pleas.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing WhatsApp, said if the CCI does not insist on filing a reply by August 5 to the June 4 notice asking it to furnish certain information in relation to the probe, they do not have a problem.WhatsApp and Facebook, represented through senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, have also challenged the CCI's June 4 and 8 notices respectively, asking them to furnish certain information for the purpose of inquiry conducted by it.The high court listed the pleas for hearing on August 27, while extending the time to file replies to the June 4 and 8 notices issued by CCI to WhatsApp and Facebook, till then.The case relates to the appeals of Facebook and WhatsApp against a single judge order dismissing their pleas against the probe CCI ordered into the instant messaging app's new privacy policy.The division bench of the high court had on May 6 issued notices on the appeals and asked the Centre to respond to it.The single judge on April 22 had said though it would have been "prudent" for the CCI to await the outcome of petitions in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court against WhatsApp's new privacy policy, not doing so would not make the regulator's order "perverse" or "wanting of jurisdiction".The court had said it saw no merit in the petitions of Facebook and WhatsApp to interdict the investigation directed by the CCI.The CCI had contended before the single judge that it was not examining the alleged violation of individuals' privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court.It had argued before the court that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and "stalking" of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is therefore an alleged abuse of dominant position.WhatsApp and Facebook had challenged the CCI's March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy.In January, the CCI on its own decided to look into WhatsApp's new privacy policy on the basis of news reports regarding the same. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-to-hear-in-august-appeals-of-facebook-whatsapp-pleas-in-privacy-policy-matter-290519

30-07-2021||---||Akali Dal, 7 other parties demand JPC into farmers’ deaths||New Delhi, July 30Eight parties, including the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Left, BSP, RLP, NCP, Shiv Sena and NC on Friday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into the number of deaths during the farmers’ agitation and also sought Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar’s apology for saying the “government had no knowledge of farmers’ deaths” during the nine-month-long Kisan Andolan.“We urge you to form a Joint Parliamentary Committee led by an Opposition member to probe the entire issue and ascertain details of the total number of lives lost in the ongoing Kisan Andolan and suggest ways and means to rehabilitate the victim families. The JPC could also take feedback directly from farmers and their representatives about their reservations vis-a-vis the three agriculture laws and submit the same to the government for necessary action. We are confident that as custodian of the august house you will ensure that the insult meted out to farmers and their democratic protest is addressed. This will also send out a clear signal that the temple of democracy stands with the ‘annadaata’ and will not stomach the insult heaped on him,” says the letter to the Speaker written on Friday and signed, among others, by Akali Dal MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, NCP’s Supriya Sule, BSP’s Danish Ali and NC’s Hasnain Masoodi.The leaders in the letter also described as galling the agriculture minister going on record to say that neither a study had been conducted to verify the numbers of the farmers’ deaths nor a study to understand the apprehensions in the minds of farmers regarding the three farm laws. “You will agree that this is a very serious lapse on the part of the agriculture minister. He has, in fact, misled the nation. So we urge you to ask the minister to apologise to the farming community for his intemperate remarks which have hurt their self-respect,” the leaders said.The letter states that farmers across the nation have been protesting for almost a year against the three farm bills - namely the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm  Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020. “It is very well known that the NDA government did not go through a due consultative process before bringing in the Bills in Parliament even with the farmers, for whose welfare the Bills were supposedly framed. We would like to bring to your notice a most recent painful episode which has hurt the sentiments of the farming community across the country.  Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar has stated in Parliament that the Union Government did not have any record of the farmers who have died in the course of the ongoing Kisan Andolan on the borders of Delhi. It is shocking that the ‘annadaata’ was subjected to this insult despite clear-cut recorded proof of hundreds of farmers being martyred during the Kisan Andolan,” the letter says demanding the minister’s apology.These parties will meet the President on Saturday on farmers' and Pegasus issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/akali-dal-7-other-parties-demand-jpc-into-farmers-deaths-290505

A purported CCTV footage of the incident suggested Anand was deliberately hit from behind.The Bench said it has come across several instances of attack on judicial officers and lawyers inside and outside the court premises and wanted to address the larger issue of safety and security of judicial officers.The top court said it's the duty of states to protect judicial officers and lawyers to make them function independently and fearlessly while endeavouring to dispense justice.The CJI said on the next date of hearing it would consider issuing notices to all states and union territories in the matter.On Thursday, senior advocate and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Vikas Singh had brought it to the notice of the Bench that a judicial officer has been allegedly killed in Dhanbad, Jharkhand -- after he refused to grant bail to a gangster.Terming it a “brazen attack” on the independence of the judiciary, Singh had said an investigation into it must be entrusted to the CBI as the killing of a judicial officer – allegedly for declining bail to a gangster -- was an assault on the judicial system.“We are aware of the incident and we appreciate the efforts of the SCBA. I have spoken to the Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court. He has taken up the case and has asked the officers to be present there. The matter is going on there. Leave it there,” CJI Ramana had told Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-takes-suo-motu-note-of-alleged-killing-of-jharkhand-judge-290498
30-07-2021||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha adjourned till Monday amid protests by Opposition on Pegasus, farm laws||The Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned till Monday amid continuous protests by opposition parties over the Pegasus snooping controversy, farm laws and price rise.After the House resumed post-lunch at 2.30 pm, Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh, who was in the chair, called for private member business.The government introduced two Bills—the Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021.Subsequently, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar moved a motion for consideration of the Coconut Development Board (Amendment) Bill, 2021.The Bill was passed by a voice vote amidst the protest and sloganeering by the Opposition after a short reply from the minister.The deputy chairman then adjourned the House till Monday 11 am.Earlier, the Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned twice—first till noon and then till 2.30 pm.When the House re-assembled at noon after the first adjournment for the Question Hour, several Opposition members trooped into the Well, some of them carrying placards, and started raising slogans against the government.The House took up a few of the listed questions and the ministers concerned replied to the members’ queries.However, as the sloganeering by the Opposition members continued, the deputy chairman adjourned the proceedings till 2.30 pm.Earlier, Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu had adjourned the proceedings till 12.00 hours just as the members of the Congress, TMC and other opposition parties stood up to raise the issues they have been pressing for since the start of the Monsoon Session of Parliament on July 19.Before adjourning the House, Naidu expressed concern over parliamentary dignity and prestige being compromised by MPs by conducts such as whistling and placing placards in front of the ministers speaking during their protests in the last few days. He appealed to the members to see that the decency and dignity of the House are maintained.Thereafter, the listed official papers were laid on the table of the House. Naidu then called for the Zero Hour, where MPs raise issues of public importance. But just like the previous days, the Opposition MPs were up on their feet raising the snooping controversy, farm laws, fuel prices and other issues.

30-07-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court to hear plea on Pegasus issue next week||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 30The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear next week a PIL filed by noted journalists N Ram, Sashi Kumar, and others for a court-monitored SIT probe into the Pegasus scandal.A Bench led by CJI NV Ramana said the petition would be heard next week after senior Congress leaders and senior advocates Kapil Sibal and AM Singhvi mentioned it before it.Sibal said it's urgent due to its ramifications on national security. He said Pegasus had huge ramifications for civil liberties. Opposition leaders, journalists and members of judiciary are being snooped on; it is hitting headlines not just in India but internationally as well, he said.Singhvi complained that the top court's Registry was not listing it for urgent mentioning."We will hear it next week," CJI Ramana responded.Ram and others had moved the Supreme Court on Tuesday seeking a judge-led independent investigation into alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians and journalists by using Israeli spyware Pegasus.Terming the allegations as an attempt by government agencies to muzzle free speech and dissent in India, the petitioners sought a direction to the Centre to disclose if the government or any of its agencies obtained licence for Pegasus spyware and used it, either directly or indirectly, to conduct surveillance in any manner.The petition – expected to be taken up later this week – demanded an independent probe by a sitting or retired judge of the Supreme Court into the alleged hacking of phones.“The targeted surveillance using military-grade spyware is an unacceptable violation of the right to privacy which has been held to be a fundamental right under Articles 14 (equality before the law), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) by the Supreme Court,” it submitted.The hacking of phones belonging to journalists, doctors, lawyers, activists, ministers and opposition politicians “seriously compromises” the effective exercise of the fundamental right to free speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the petitioners said, adding that it had an obvious “chilling effect” on expression by threatening invasion into the most core and private aspects of a person's life.“The attack prima facie constitutes an act of cyber-terrorism that has several grave political and security ramifications, especially considering that the devices of government ministers, senior political figures and constitutional functionaries which may contain sensitive information have been targeted,” they said.Investigations involving several leading publications around the world revealed that more than 142 Indians, including journalists, lawyers, ministers, opposition politicians, and activists, have been identified as potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus software, the petitioners alleged.Forensic analysis by the Security Lab of Amnesty International of several mobile phones, belonging to people targeted for surveillance, has confirmed Pegasus-induced security breaches, the petitioners submitted.They said the hacking of phones using the Pegasus spyware constituted a criminal offence punishable under Sections 66 (computer related offences), 66B (punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource or communication device), 66E (punishment for violation of privacy) and 66F (punishment for cyber terrorism) of the IT Act, punishable with imprisonment and/or fine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-on-pegasus-issue-next-week-290494

30-07-2021||United Nations||Conscious of the need to prioritise institution building: India tells UNGA||India as a democracy is conscious of the need to prioritise institution building, in particular, governance structures to strengthen institutional capacity and rule of law and these need to be building blocks on which peace-building should rest, a top diplomat has told the UN General Assembly.India has always been known for its unflinching commitment to peace-keeping, Counsellor in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Pratik Mathur said on Thursday."We are convinced that nation-building activities will be strengthened even more if the road ahead includes strong support for peacebuilding as well,” Mathur said.Addressing the UN General Assembly debate on peacebuilding and sustaining peace, Mathur said “as a democracy, we are conscious of the need to prioritize institution building, in particular, governance structures to strengthen institutional capacity and the rule of law, taking into account the views of the host government. Consequently, these need to be the building blocks on which peace-building should rest.”Mathur highlighted that India, through its extensive development partnership with developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, has always played a constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding.“In our neighbourhood, for instance in Afghanistan, India is also contributing to peace-building efforts,” he said, adding that India's development partnership, including more than 550 Community Development Projects covering all 34 provinces of the country, is aimed at strengthening Afghanistan.Mathur also pointed out that the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, which was established in 2017, has developed a portfolio of 64 development projects in partnership with 48 developing countries, including 17 countries in Africa, focusing on South-led, demand-driven development and transformational projects.“Through these funds, it has been our endeavour to focus on, inter alia, climate resilience, environmental sustainability, gender equality, renewable energy, improving maternal health, water and sanitation, education, employment and livelihoods, disaster recovery and risk management, agricultural development and infrastructure,” he said.Mathur told the General Assembly that India has and continues to assist countries bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans.Citing the example of training for countries emerging out of conflict situations in Africa, he said India's focused training in areas of electoral administration and good governance has been deeply valued by these countries.India voiced appreciation that as part of its 2020-24 strategy, the Peacebuilding Fund has put forth a comprehensive scenario, covering a horizon of five years.Mathur however noted that in the middle of the pandemic, as funds are increasingly being programmed away to humanitarian assistance other than peace-building activities, it is necessary to reaffirm commitment and efforts to realise Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development Goals, so as to not falter in the context of COVID-19.“We need to consequently prioritize our focus on specific aspects of peacebuilding which will have the highest impact in post-conflict situations so that the funds are utilised to the optimum,” he said.He added that as a token of its engagement, India in January at the High-Level Replenishment Conference called by the Secretary-General, announced a fresh pledge of 150,000 dollars to the Fund's activities and programme this year.Further, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 on women and peace and security, the Commission also increased its efforts in support of women and peace and security in line with the commitments set out in its new gender strategy.“Peace Building rests on the foundation of a gender strategy, especially in post-conflict situations,” he said.Mathur noted that over the course of 2020, the Peace Building Commission did not let the pandemic to slow it down and was able to nimbly adjust its programme of work to serve as a demand-driven platform to discuss ways in which to help to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on development and peacebuilding in countries under its consideration.During the 2020 review of the peacebuilding architecture, the Commission convened a series of thematic consultations focused on a range of issues relating to peacebuilding.“We appreciate that in a situation when the world was reeling due to the pandemic, many of these discussions placed particular emphasis on the need to tailor socioeconomic responses to COVID-19 to nationally defined peacebuilding priorities, with special consideration given to community resilience, social innovation and protecting and empowering people in vulnerable situations,” Mathur said.

When he failed to do so, Sunanda Shetty approached the local court seeking its intervention for registration of a case, they said.The incident has come at a time when Shilpa Shetty is in limelight following the arrest of her husband, businessman Raj Kundra, in connection with alleged production of pornographic films.   PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/actress-shilpa-shettys-mother-sunanda-files-cheating-complaint-against-property-agent-290479

30-07-2021||Washington||US Congressman congratulates India ahead of 75th Independence Day||An influential US Congressman has congratulated India ahead of the country's 75th Independence Day, observing that its struggle for freedom greatly influenced America's civil rights movement.Congressman Sanford Bishop, in his remarks in the US House of Representatives on Thursday, said that India and the United States share many deep and historic ties.“I want to congratulate India and its people on the 75th Anniversary of its independence. I wish it many more years of peace and prosperity. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate India on its 75th Independence Day, which will be celebrated this year on August 15,” he said.“On that date, its first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru proclaimed that his country, in casting off its British rule, had ‘made a tryst with destiny'.“He said that ‘[at] the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance . . .',” Bishop said.India's history stretches back thousands and thousands of years, he said.Its civilisation and contributions to the world are countless—from literature to philosophy to mathematics, Bishop said.“India today is continuing in that tradition by extending a hand to other nations in their fight against the pandemic as the country itself manages its own severe COVID-19 outbreak,” he said.In addition, Indian-Americans are making countless contributions here in the US as doctors, lawyers, scientists, business owners, artists and even in the White House in the person of Vice President Kamala Harris whose mother was an Indian, said Bishop, a lawmaker from Georgia.“Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that India's own struggle for independence greatly influenced the United States' own civil rights movement.“America's civil rights leaders, from Reverend Dr Martin Luther King to my late colleague and friend Congressman John Lewis, were inspired by the revered leader of Indian independence Mahatma Gandhi. They followed in his footsteps by embracing Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent approach to achieving social and political justice,” he said.In fact, when Dr King left for India in February 1959, he was just beginning to make his mark as a leader of the national movement for civil rights, Bishop said.He had organised the successful boycott of Montgomery, Alabama's public transportation system in 1955, and founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference two years later.His burgeoning success had provided his non-violent movement with the momentum and potential to become a truly powerful force in the pursuit of equal rights for all Americans.This momentum became entrenched during Dr King's trip to India, where his immersion in the world of Mahatma Gandhi's own non-violent success led King to commit himself in his philosophical entirety to the principle of meeting hate and injustice with persistent non-violence, Bishop said.Though Gandhi had passed away 11 years prior to Dr King's journey, King was no less attentive to the followers of the great shanti sena—the “non-violent army” that Gandhi led in his successful effort to free his country from the grasp of colonialism, he said.He encountered those who had stood with Gandhi through the long, arduous struggle for India's sovereignty, and came to deeply understand the necessary commitment and purpose of which believers in non-violence must never lose sight, Bishop said.“Dr King came to believe that if India can assert its independence from the bonds of the British Empire without violence, then the United States of America can achieve racial equality with the same approach.“He took the lessons of a people half a world away and applied them to the struggle of his own nation, illustrating that a righteous cause pursued by means which justify its ends holds universal promise,” he said.Bishop said perhaps it is best articulated by Dr King himself: “As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my scepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform”.

Leader of the Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi met Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge in his chamber twice today to attempt resolution of the impasse, but the Opposition was steadfast on its demand to discuss Pegasus in the presence of PM Narendra Modi or Home Minister Amit Shah.Opposition leaders assembled in Kharge’s room this morning and gave similarly worded notices of adjournment of House proceedings to debate the Pegasus issue. The notices were later disallowed in both Houses.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said, “The Modi government is not allowing the Opposition to discharge its responsibility of raising people’s issues in Parliament. It should not waste Parliament’s time.

China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-rejects-k-reference-in-china-pak-statement-290213

30-07-2021||New Delhi/Washington||Taliban killed Indian photojournalist Danish Siddiqui, claims report||Pulitzer Prize-winning Indian photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was murdered by the Taliban, according to a write-up by Michael Rubin in the Washington Examiner.The report, quoting the local Afghan authorities, says Siddiqui travelled with an Afghan National Army team to Spin Boldak region to cover the clash between Afghan forces and the Taliban to control the border crossing with Pakistan. When they were within one-third of a mile of the Customs post, a Taliban attack split the team, with the commander and a few men separated from Siddiqui, who remained with three other Afghan troops.During this assault, a shrapnel hit Siddiqui, after which he and his team went to a local mosque where he received first-aid. As the word spread that a journalist was inside the mosque, the Taliban launched an attack, the report says, adding that a local probe suggested the Taliban attacked the mosque only because of Siddiqui. “It verified Siddiqui’s identity and executed him,” Rubin wrote. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taliban-killed-indian-photojournalist-danish-siddiqui-claims-report-290228

30-07-2021||---||Can’t prosecute good Samaritan who came forward when Centre, states failed: Delhi HC||New Delhi, July 29Taking exception to the Delhi Drug Controller prosecuting AAP leaders who arranged oxygen for Covid-19 patients when the Centre and Delhi government failed to arrange sufficient medical oxygen in the capital during the second wave of the pandemic, the Delhi High Court on Thursday said good Samaritans can’t be prosecuted.“Go and book very gurudwara, every temple or church...prosecute every good Samaritan giving Oxygen,” a Bench led by Justice Vipin Sanghi told the Delhi Drug Controller which has launched a prosecution against MLAs who sourced oxygen cylinders during the second wave of Covid-19.Don’t get into hyper technical interpretation of law to book people who helped patients with oxygen, it said expressing its displeasure with the drug controller for prosecuting MLAs for sourcing/supplying oxygen. “You can always withdraw the prosecution,” it told the Drug Controller which has prosecuted AAP MLA Praveen Kumar for procuring and distributing oxygen cylinders during the second wave of Covid-19.However, the high court sought to distinguish it from the case of BJP MP Gautam Gambhir’s foundation which had procured, stocked and distributed huge quantity of fabiflu medicine to Covid-19 patients.“The reason for picking Gambhir’s case was that he was very irresponsibly holding the Covid-19 medicines in huge quantities. He may have had the best of intentions but this is not allowed,” the Bench noted.Asking the Drug Controller to clarify if he wanted to prosecute all those who procured or distributed medical oxygen for free to the needy COVID-19 patients, the court posted it for hearing on August 5.The court’s comments came after it was informed that prosecution had been launched against Gautam Gambhir Foundation, and AAP MLA Imran Hussain Kumar for alleged violations under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and a trial court had on July 28 taken cognisance of the issue and issued summonses to them for August 26.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-prosecute-good-samaritan-who-came-forward-when-centre-states-failed-delhi-hc-290103
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Raj Kundra arrested as he was not cooperating with probe: Police to HC||Mumbai Police on Thursday told the Bombay High Court that businessman Raj Kundra was arrested in an alleged case of production and streaming of pornographic films as he was not cooperating with the investigation.In an affidavit filed in response to Kundra’s petition challenging the arrest, the police also argued that section 67(A) of the Information Technology Act, which is about “publishing/creating pornographic content”, was rightly invoked in the case.Read alsoKundra was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch on July 19, and is presently in judicial custody. His bail application was rejected by a lower court on Wednesday.In his petition, he claimed that the material which he allegedly disseminated through apps was not pornographic, and at the most it could be described as “lascivious”.Kundra (45), who is married to actor Shilpa Shetty, also alleged that the police had not issued any notice under section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before arrest, which is mandatory.As per section 41A, the police may, in cases where arrest is not warranted, issue summons to the accused and record his or her statement.The police said in their reply that a notice was issued prior to the arrest, but Kundra refused to accept it.“The fact that the petitioner refused to accept the notice implies that the petitioner refused to cooperate with the investigation,” said the affidavit filed by inspector Kiran Bidve.During the hearing before Justice A S Gadkari on Thursday, Kundra’s lawyer Aabad Ponda argued that when such a notice is issued, a period of two weeks is given to the person to appear for questioning.“Kundra was not even given two days or two hours. His office premises were searched by the police on the afternoon of July 19. This went on for about three to four hours during which Kundra was present and cooperating. Later in the evening he was asked to accompany the police to the police station where he was arrested,” Ponda said.The police in their affidavit, however, alleged that when the search was underway, Kundra and his “IT technician” Ryan Thorpe started deleting messages from a WhatsApp group, thus destroying evidence.To prevent them from further tampering with evidence, Kundra was taken to police station and arrested, the police claimed.Justice Gadkari will continue the hearing on July 31.

30-07-2021||New Delhi||Covid R-value climbing steadily in country; Kerala, northeastern states top list||The R-factor, which indicates the speed at which Covid-19 infection is spreading in the country, is climbing steadily with Kerala and the northeastern states occupying the top spots, fuelling worries about the pandemic rearing its head again.Among the metro cities, the R-values of Pune and Delhi are close to one, suggests an analysis by researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai.Read alsoCentre to send high-level team to Kerala to contain Covid surgeWhen the second wave of the Covid-19 infection was at its peak, the overall R-value in the country was estimated to be 1.37 between March 9 to April 21. It declined to 1.18 between April 24 and May 1 and then to 1.1 between April 29 and May 7, according to the analysis.Between May 9 and 11, the R-value was estimated to be around 0.98. It dropped to 0.82 between May 14 and May 30 and further to 0.78 from May 15 to June 26. The R-value however rose to 0.88 from June 20 to July 7 and then to 0.95 from July 3-22."India's overall active cases are fluctuating too much to get a reliable estimate, but data is pointing at a value close to 1. It may tip over either way in the coming few days," said Sitabhra Sinha of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, who is leading the team.An R-value of 0.95 means, every 100 infected people on an average pass on the infection to 95 other individuals. If the R-value is lesser than 1, it means the number of newly infected people are lower than the number of infected people in the preceding period, which means the disease incidence is going down.The smaller the value of R is, the faster the disease is on the decline. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round—technically, this is what is called the epidemic phase.The bigger the number is than one, the faster the rate of spreading of the disease in the population.Kerala has the highest number of active cases and continues to have an R-value around 1.11."So looks like it will remain in the top spot for the next couple of weeks. The Northeast continues to have a very bad situation, with most states having R-value more than 1," Sinha said.The Union Health Ministry on Thursday said it will depute a six-member team to Kerala for effective Covid-19 management as the state reports a spike in daily cases.The team headed by National Centre for Disease Control Director S K Singh will reach Kerala on Friday and visit some districts reporting a high case positivity rate.The high case positivity has remained a cause of concern at a time when the overall coronavirus numbers are on a decline in the country.Kerala on Wednesday recorded 22,056 fresh Covid-19 cases pushing the infection caseload to 33,27,301, with the number of people who succumbed to the virus rising to 16,457 with 131 more deaths.In the northeast, only Tripura has an R-value substantially lower than one, while Manipur has gone only marginally below one. Among other states in India, Uttarakhand has an R-value very close to one at the moment.Among the major cities, Pune appears to have an R-value greater than one, while Delhi has a value close to one.The R-value of Pune was 0.85 between July 11-13 and 0.89 between July 15-20. For the national capital, the R-value between June 21- 26 was 0.80. It dropped to 0.66 from June 28-July 6, but it rose to 0.84 between July 4-20.For Bengaluru, the R-value from July 7-13 was 0.92. It increased marginally to 0.95 from July 13-17. It dropped to 0.72 from July 17-23.In the case of Mumbai, the R-value was 0.96 between July 2-4. It dropped to 0.89 between July 6-9. It further dropped to 0.74 between July 22-24.For Chennai, the R-value between June 29 to July 7 was 0.63. It shot up to 1.05 between July 16-19. It was 0.94 between 21-24, showing signs of decline. In the case of Kolkata, the R-value was 0.80 between July 1-13, followed by 0.91 between July 12-17. It dropped to 0.86 between July 17-24. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-r-value-climbing-steadily-in-country-kerala-northeastern-states-top-list-290072

30-07-2021||Panaji||Goa CM faces flak for asking parents of rape victims why their daughters were out so late||Under pressure from the opposition over the gang rape of two minor girls on a beach, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant is facing flak for remarking in the state Assembly that parents need to introspect on why their children were on the beach late at night.“When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don't listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police,” Sawant had said on Wednesday, during a debate on a calling attention notice in the House.Sawant, who also holds the home portfolio, had said parents have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their children and hinted that they should not let their children, particularly minors, out at night.Goa Congress spokesperson Altone D'Costa on Thursday said the law and order situation in the coastal state has deteriorated. “Why should we fear while moving around at night? Criminals should be in jail and law-abiding citizens should be out freely moving around,” he said.Goa Forward Party MLA Vijai Sardesai said it is disgusting that the chief minister is making such statements. “The safety of citizens is the responsibility of police and state government. If they can't provide it to us, the CM has no right to sit in the post,” he added.“It is shocking that @goacm is blaming parents for allowing their children to venture out in the night claiming that it is not safe. if State govt can't assure us our security, who can give it? Goa has a history of being safe state for women, that tag is being lost in @BJP4Goa rule,” tweeted Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte.“We directly blame police, but I want to point out that of the 10 youth who went to the beach for a party, four stayed on the beach the whole night and the remaining six went home,” Sawant had said in the House.“They were on the beach the whole night, two boys and two girls,” said Sawant. Teens, particularly minors, should not be spending the nights on beaches," he added.Four men, one of them a government employee (a driver with the agriculture department), posed as policemen and raped the two girls after beating up the boys who were with the girls on Benaulim beach, around 30 km south of Goa's capital, on Sunday.All the four accused have been arrested, Sawant told the Assembly.During the discussion in the House yesterday, an MLA had claimed that an “influential person” was trying to protect the accused, while another opposition member had alleged that a minister was calling the police and trying to influence the investigation. Speaker Rajesh Patnekar had expunged the remarks from the proceedings.The Goa government has suspended a 33-year-old driver employed with the state Agriculture Ministry, Sawant told the Goa legislative assembly on Thursday."The government staff involved in the case has been suspended. He has been suspended first and termination will follow," Sawant told the ongoing monsoon session.One of the accused Rajesh Mane is a driver attached to the state Agriculture Ministry.--IANS/PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goa-cm-faces-flak-for-asking-parents-of-rape-victims-why-their-daughters-were-out-so-late-289994

Women voted for them but they have failed to fulfil any of their promises including Rs 15 lakh in every bank account. The promise of two crore jobs has also remained unfulfilled while the price of LPG, pulses and mustard oil have increased massively."The SBSP president was a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government but was dismissed in the midst of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.He has been actively campaigning against the BJP since then and has set up the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, comprising a number of smaller parties, including the AIMIM.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/om-prakash-rajbhar-asks-women-to-thrash-bjp-leaders-in-up-289984
