01-07-2021||New Delhi||I-T dept notice to Atishi, 18 others after mis-match in income, assets detected: Sources||AAP MLA Atishi has been issued a tax notice as there is allegedly a mismatch between the assets and liabilities furnished by her in the 2020 election affidavit and what was declared in her I-T returns filed over the last few years, official sources said on Thursday.Rejecting the charge that she has been singled out, the sources said that a total of 19 candidates, including Atishi and three other women, have been sent these verification notices. Those who have been sent these notices also include people from the BJP, they said.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Atishi had told the media on Wednesday that she was issued an Income Tax (I-T) notice and claimed that the action was taken to “scare and intimidate” her.The official sources said the issuance of notices action is part of a procedure followed by the tax department for the verification of election affidavits filed by candidates before the Election Commission (EC).Out of a total 666 affidavits, 19 were selected for verification and the entire process has been undertaken by adhering to a standard operating procedure’ (SOP) that was finalised in consultation with the EC, they said.The sources said the assets and liabilities disclosed by the AAP MLA in her 2020 election affidavit allegedly do not match with the “income profile” furnished by her in the income tax returns (ITRs) filed over the last about 10-year time period.They said the details given in her ITRs are reportedly lesser than what has been furnished in the poll affidavit.The verification process is being conducted on the basis of facts and official figures. Hence, additional information and clarifications have been sought from the 19 candidates and those of their family members who are categorised as politically exposed persons, the sources said.The ruling AAP in Delhi had called the tax notice “ridiculous” saying it exposes the “sexist and chauvinist” face of the BJP.“I want to tell the Modi government—we are not afraid of your threats! The Modi government has used every agency to harass AAP leaders but could not sustain a single case against the AAP. The income tax notice was sent to scare, intimidate us,” Atishi had told a press conference.“I don’t have anything to hide. Wherever the Income Tax Department calls me, I will go with all the details of my bank accounts. I want to challenge the BJP if they are ready to make their bank accounts and property details public,” she had said.A party leader had said that the notice is based on the 2020 election affidavit of Atishi in which she had declared Rs 59 lakh worth movable assets in the form of FD and mutual funds, which she had said were earned before 2012.

01-07-2021||Lucknow||Journalist not expected to dramatise incident and create news: Allahabad HC||The Allahabad High Court has rejected the bail plea of a reporter accused of abetting a suicide, saying a journalist is not expected to dramatise sensational incidents and create news by putting a person’s life in danger.A Lucknow bench of Justice Vikas Kunvar Srivastav made the observation while rejecting the plea of journalist Shamim Ahmad, co-accused of abetting a mentally and financially distressed man to commit suicide, and filming it outside the Uttar Pradesh Assembly complex on October 20 last year.In an order, the judge said, “A journalist is not expected to dramatise a sensational and horrifying incident and make news by putting his actor in pitiable condition and in danger of death.”The journalist keeps an eye on anticipated or sudden events happening in society and brings them to the information of all people through various news media without any tampering. This is his business, the judge observed on June 21.Rejecting the bail plea, the bench observed, “The case of the prosecution against the accused /Shamim is prima- facie established that he told the deceased, living in mental and financial distress, to the temptation and plan to get rid of them. He was present with the deceased at the scene of the incident and filming it.”The order in the case was uploaded on the court’s website on Thursday.According to additional government advocate Prem Prakash, the man, Surendra Chakraborty, of the old city area had a tenancy dispute with his landlord Zaved Khan for which he had filed a civil suit. On October 19 last year, Khan scoldingly asked the man to set himself ablaze and die, if he was not able to vacate the accommodation.“Subsequently, journalists Shamim Ahmad and Naushad Ahmad contacted the man and induced him to set himself ablaze in front of the assembly building so that they may film the incident and telecast the same on television. If it happens, the matter will get highlighted and no one will evict him from his house,” Chakraborty’s wife had said in her police complaint on the basis of which the FIR in the case was registered.She lodged the complaint with the Hussainganj police on October 20 last year.The bench has directed the trial court to expedite trial proceedings to possibly conclude it within a year.It, however, told the trial court that it need not be swayed with any observation made by this court in the instant bail rejection order.Opposing the bail plea, Prakash, on the basis of material collected during investigation, pleaded that according to the plan, the the victim reached in front of the Legislative Assembly building at Gate no.3 on October 20 last year, stood in the middle of the road, put oil on himself and set himself on fire.Meanwhile, a man identified as journalist Shamim Ahmad was seen recording, from prior to the incident. Instead of saving the man, the journalist or accused kept on filming it till he was badly scorched, he said.Policemen were also seen trying to rescue Chakraborty from burning in the confiscated film, added Prakash.He died at a hospital on October 24.

01-07-2021||New Delhi||Doctors, messengers of God, saved countless lives during Covid-19: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday described doctors as the messengers of God hailing their role as life savers during India’s one-and-a-half-year long and ongoing fight with Covid-19.Addressing an event organised by the Indian Medical Association on Thursday to mark the National Doctors Day, the PM expressed gratitude to doctors for working through days and nights to finetune India’s Covid response and treat people.Crediting the doctors for India’s low Covid mortality rate of 1.3 per cent, among the lowest worldwide, the PM said, “This day is a marker of the finest values of medicine. The way doctors have served the country for one and a half years is in itself a trend setter. I thank all doctors and express gratitude to them. Doctors are messengers of God.”The Doctors Day is observed to mark both the birth and death anniversary of the legendary physician BC Roy.The PM, while lauding the role of doctors in formulating clinical protocols to deal with a new and dynamic Covid-19 disease, also urged them today to document their experiences with Covid patients and their treatment for the future generations to take appropriate lessons from such documentation.Appealing to doctors to promote yoga awareness in mission mode, the PM asked them to undertake evidence-based research on the role of yoga in well-being.“So many times, we have been terrified to lose our loved ones or have experienced acute illnesses but doctors like messengers of God have changed the course of lives. Doctors have worked day and night to save countless lives during Covid and several of them have died at the altar of duty. We pay condolences to their families,” the PM said, adding that doctors and scientists found effective solutions in the fight against Covid even though the virus continued to mutate.The PM said the government was committed to the protection of doctors and had brought in relevant laws to ensure that.Noting that medical infrastructure remained neglected over the past decade, the PM said population was exacerbating the challenge.“It is our government that gave maximum emphasis to medical infrastructure. Last year, Rs 15,000 crores was allocated for health infrastructure. This yearRs 2 lakh crore plus was allocated for health sector. Rs 50,000 crore credit guarantee scheme has just been announced for under-served areas. Whereas six AIIMS had been built until 2014, we have started work on seven new AIIMS besides augmenting MBBS seats 1.5 fold and PG seats by 80 per cent,” said the PM adding that youngsters will now have greater opportunities to become doctors than ever before.The PM spoke of the influence doctors exert on the mind of the people and urged them to play a part in science-based evidence of yoga benefits especially in managing post Covid complications.“When you took vaccine, people were inspired to come and accept vaccines. When you ask people to keep Covid protocols, they follow you. Please expand this role of yours. Medical fraternity is now spreading awareness about yoga. The work that should have been done in the last century post-Independence, but it is being done now. Evidence-based studies are under way on how yoga helps in post Covid management. Can IMA take this forward in mission mode and commission science-based studies on yoga, publish them in in international journals so that the world takes note?” asked the PM.He appealed to doctors to record their practical Covid experiences by addressing questions like howvaccines are helping, how early diagnosis is helping and how certain protocols are helping better than the others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctors-messengers-of-god-saved-countless-lives-during-covid-19-pm-modi-276751
01-07-2021||London||UK opens new post-study work visa route for international students||The UK Home Office on Thursday formally opened its new post-study work visa for international students, which would offer overseas graduates from India and other destinations the option to apply for the right to stay on for job experience at the end of their university courses.The Graduate route visa, announced last year by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, is now open for applications from this week and is expected to particularly benefit Indian students, who are known to choose their degree courses based on the prospect of work experience.The Graduate route is designed for international graduates who have been awarded their degree from a recognised UK university to stay on and look for work for at least two years.“To put it into some context, last year more than 56,000 Indian nationals were granted a student visa, that’s a 13 per cent increase on the previous year, and that is almost now a quarter of all student visas issued by the UK,” Patel told PTI.“When you think about those numbers, think about the totality in terms of how this route will benefit India, it’s a very, very big move. And, we will continue to work with the various academic institutions on making this route viable,” she said.For the new route, international graduates must have completed an eligible course at a UK higher education provider with a track record of compliance with the government’s immigration requirements.It is unsponsored, meaning applicants do not need a job offer to apply and crucially they can use a two-year period to stay on and look for a job. There are no minimum salary requirements or caps on numbers, allowing graduates on the route to work flexibly, switch jobs and develop their career as required.“As we build back better, it is vital that the UK continues to be a beacon for talented young people across the globe who want to make a difference. The new Graduate route does just that, giving the best and brightest graduates the opportunity to continue contributing to the UK’s prosperity and the freedom to kickstart their careers in the UK,” said Patel.A coronavirus concession on the date by which students must enter the UK to qualify for the route, if they started courses in 2020 and are unable to travel due to the pandemic, was recently extended.Applicants who began their studies in autumn 2020 or in spring 2021 will need to be in the UK on a student visa by September 27 this year. Students beginning their course later this year or early next year will need to be in the UK by April 6, 2022.This has been welcomed by Indian student groups in the UK, concerned about India’s categorisation under the red list of countries from where travel currently remains banned, making it compulsory for Indian students to quarantine at considerably additional expense.“Many other countries do not offer that microcosm, foundation of diaspora community, natural heritage, all the cultural links, all the values that we share between our two countries. That puts us in a very strong position, both for Indian students coming here and securing their future opportunities in the workplace,” Patel said.The new route, part of the post-Brexit points-based immigration system, is pegged as part of the UK’s Global Britain message of attracting the best talent from around the world and covers all parts of the United Kingdom.“International students are a vital part of our society, and those who graduate from our world-leading universities should have the opportunity to stay and build meaningful careers here in the UK,” said Universities Minister Michelle Donelan.“That is why we are introducing this new route for international graduates, enabling British businesses to attract and retain some of the brightest, most talented graduates across the globe, and helping this nation build back better from the pandemic,” she said.Anne Marie Graham, Chief Executive of UK Council for International Student Affairs, said: “We know that employability is a priority for international students coming to study in the UK.“International students who are able to access this route will have the flexibility to apply for work in any sector or role that fits their skills profile, including self-employment without the need for employer sponsorship.”               To apply under the new Graduate route, international students must have completed an eligible course at a recognised UK higher education provider at undergraduate or higher level. Students on the route will be able to work or look for work after their studies for a maximum period of two years, or three years for Doctoral PhD students.The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU) was among the groups that actively lobbied the UK government for such a post-study visa route.“Genuine Indian applicants with demonstrable skills should considerably benefit,” it added.

He had a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head and was absconding for over five months.Delhi Police told Metropolitan Magistrate Shivli Talwar that the accused would be taken to Tarn Taran, about 500 km from Delhi, for investigation during the remand period.The police said it would also ascertain the source of funding of the alleged conspiracy, money flow to his bank accounts, probe social media accounts, recover mobile, and seize clothes he was wearing at the time of the incident.Besides, it said it would confront him with video clips and CCTV footage in order to identify co-accused who accompanied him from Singhu Border to the Red Fort to create mayhem and ransack the monument.“Considering the ground and fact that the accused has to be taken to Tarn Taran for investigation, the accused be remanded to PC for five days,” the judge said in an order passed on June 30.Investigating officer Inspector Pankaj Arora informed the court that Singh was part of the riotous mob which “attacked the police personnel, ransacked, sabotaged and robbed the government and public property and also the Red Fort”.He stated that in one of the videos, the accused was seen with co-accused - Gurjot Singh and Gurjant Singh - in which the duo was giving interview to the media after they hoisted a religious flag at the Flag Guard area.“During further investigation, it has also come on record that he, along with his other associate, was in touch with co-accused Iqbal Singh who is stated to be one of the main conspirators and instigators,” Inspector Arora submitted.Advocates Jasdeep S Dhillon and Gurumukh Singh, representing the accused, said that their client is being falsely implicated in the case and that there are no specific allegations against him.It was further submitted that the mere presence of Singh in the interview given to a media channel by the co-accused “does not reflect his complicity in the offence”.On January 26, protesting farmers had clashed with police during the tractor rally against three farm laws and stormed into the Red Fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes and injuring scores of policemen.An FIR was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, Epidemic Act, and Disaster Management Act.Actor-activist Deep Sidhu is accused of being the key conspirator of the violence and is currently out on bail.The court had recently taken cognizance of the charge sheet in the case and summoned all the accused on July 12.

01-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||AI for quality testing of grains in Punjab, Haryana mandis||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 1Aiming to bring transparency in the time-consuming and subjective method of quality assessment of grains brought to the mandis by farmers across the country, the Centre is testing technology to ensure that the process is carried out in a quick and transparent manner without any scope for subjectivity or human intervention.FCI officials say pilot projects were initiated this wheat procurement season in some ‘mandis’ in Punjab and Haryana by a start-up working in developing simple and handy solutions for mandi-level quality checks.“It is a work in progress, they are trying to get all quality refractions measured through machines instead of human analysis. The AI-based software is able to identify the refractions but has not reached acceptable levels of accuracy so far. Based on the experience, they are working on improvements in the equipment for further testing during coming paddy procurement season,” they explain. The current quality-testing is a time-consuming process and also has certain levels of subjectivity. “In order to achieve transparency through technology in all governance systems, the FCI is working with Indian Agri-Start Ups for developing a simple and handy testing equipment which can be deployed in the thousands of mandis operated by the government agencies for foodgrain procurement.“This will ensure that the quality assessment of food grains brought to the procurement centers by farmers are done in a quick and transparent manner without any scope for subjectivity or human intervention,” officials say.So far, two Agri-tech start-ups have come forward to develop/offer solutions, the pilots of which were run in four ‘mandis’ in Punjab and Haryana during wheat procurement season.Notably in the current system, during the process of procurement the quality is tested against the standards fixed by the Government of India (Uniform specifications) following the method prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). However, except testing of moisture contents in the grain, all other parameters are tested through manual analysis.“This is a time-consuming process and has certain levels of subjectivity. Going by the motto of transparency through technology adopted and implemented by the Centre in all governance systems, efforts are on to bring in technology-based quality assessment,” officials explain.As on June 25 in KMS 2020-21, 853.34 LMT (equivalent to 573.23 LMT Rice) paddy was procured at 73870 paddy purchase centres.In RMS 2021-22, 432.69 LMT wheat was procured at 19030 wheat purchase centres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ai-for-quality-testing-of-grains-in-punjab-haryana-mandis-276695
