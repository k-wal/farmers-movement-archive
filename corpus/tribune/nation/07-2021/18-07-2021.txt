18-07-2021||New Delhi||Opposition parties object to PM Modi’s joint address on Covid to MPs at Parliament annexe||Opposition parties on Sunday objected to the government’s offer for a joint address to all MPs by the prime minister on Covid at the Parliament annexe, saying this will be “highly irregular” at a time when Parliament will be in session and it aims to “bypass” norms.Leaders, including from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the CPI(M), also said that when the Covid pandemic and issues related to it can be discussed on the floor of the House, what was the need to go “outside”.The annexe is a separate building within the premises of the Parliament complex.In an all-party meeting on Sunday, a day before the Monsoon Session of Parliament begins, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address MPs of both the Houses—Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha—on July 20 and speak on the pandemic.“What is the need to go outside Parliament? Any address should be on the floor of the House. This is another idea to bypass Parliament. Stop making a mockery of the Parliament. How far will Modi and (Union Home Minister Amit) Shah go? Just when we thought that they cannot go lower, they want to make a presentation in the annexe and not on the floor of the House,” TMC Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien, who was at the meeting, said.The meeting was attended by 33 parties ahead of the Monsoon Session which will conclude on August 13.          “MPs do not want fancy power point presentations on Covid-19 from the PM or this government in some conference room. Parliament will be in session. Come to the floor of the House,” O’Brien said.Sources in other opposition parties confirmed that Parliamentary Affairs Minister Joshi’s offer has been refused and that some have even suggested a joint sitting of the Houses at the Central Hall.CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the party’s position has always been that when Parliament is in session, whatever the government has to say, it can do so on the floor of the House.“It is highly irregular for the government to do this. When the Parliament is in session, any address or presentation the government wants to make, it has to be done from inside Parliament. Our stand on this has been very clear,” he said.O’Brien claimed that all opposition leaders present in the meeting, including Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party’s Satish Mishra refused to be addressed “outside” Parliament.Some opposition party MPs, on the condition of anonymity, said some parties have already planned to give notices on the Covid situation issue in Parliament and no one wanted to listen to the government anywhere other than the floor of the Parliament.The sources also said that NCP leader Sharad Pawar was the lone opposition leader who did not outright reject the proposal of the prime minister’s address at the Parliament annexe.During the meeting, almost all parties raised issues related to fuel prices, farm laws, Covid and the state of the economy, they said.Kharge hit out at the prime minister over his short presence at meeting and said that it was an “insult” to all political parties present. He also raised the issue of appointment of a deputy speaker, and said this should be done.O’Brien also tweeted about the short presence of the prime minister.                  While the DMK raised the issue of GST devolution, the TRS urged the government to make public sector units profitable and not go for disinvestment. The Samajwadi Party accused the government of passing Bills in a hurry and its leader Ramgopal Yadav alleged that the Maharashtra and West Bengal governors had belittled chief ministers of the states.The BJD demanded that the Centre procure surplus rice from Odisha, release pending food subsidy and provide a share of the additional cess from fuel and cooking gas to states to help them fight Covid.Several parties said that their concerns were not being heard by the government and being “bulldozed”.         The TMC, during the all-party meet, alleged ruining of the federal structure, “motivated” functioning of the central agencies and lack of Covid vaccines. The return of MPLAD funds and Women’s Reservation Bill issues were also raised by the party.Four political parties, including TMC, TRS, YSRCP and BSP, demanded that there should be a discussion on Schedule 10 of the Constitution which deals with disqualification of lawmakers.Multiple petitions by the TMC and the YSRCP are with the Lok Sabha speaker and they seek disqualification of MPs. They had earlier demanded a time-bound process for this.  The government is slated to bring in 29 Bills and two financial Bills during the Monsoon Session.Opposition parties have made it clear that the government must allow proper discussion and review of the Bills before they are passed.     On day one of the session, the prime minister will introduce the newly inducted ministers to both the Houses.It is the convention that after the formation of a new government or an expansion or reshuffle in the Union Council of Ministers.There was a major rejig in the Union Council of Ministers recently. While several new faces were inducted, some ministers were elevated to the Cabinet rank and portfolios of some others were changed.Some new members who recently entered Lok Sabha following bypolls would also take oath as members of the lower house on Monday.

He also went to the exclusive Satellite and Radar Sections and discussed the process of procurement of data on a real-time basis.  IMD Director General Mrutyunja Mohapatra informed the Minister that this year the monsoon rainfall was 10 per cent above normal in June but 26 per cent deficient till date in July.The IMD has predicted “normal” rains for 2021.   Officials told the minister that besides other state-of-art equipment, the IMD at present has 27 radars across the country, the number which will go up to 50 in coming years. India is one of the five countries in the world to have the most modern lightning forecast system in place and the IMD is sending more than 42 million SMS twice a week to farmers across the country, Mohapatra said.Facing severe criticism over repeated wrong forecasts on the arrival of monsoon over Delhi and also Haryana, and Punjab, the weather department recently called such failure by numerical models in predicting “rare and uncommon”. “Such type of failure by numerical models in prediction of monsoon advance over Delhi is rare and uncommon,” it said in a detailed clarification as it explained how rains progressed till June 13 in association with favourable atmospheric circulation and a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal since onset over Kerala on June 3.On June 14, weather analysis based on satellite and NWP model consensus indicated the approach of a trough in mid-latitude westerly winds, leading to weakening of easterly winds over northwest India. “However, this development of interaction with westerlies could not be anticipated by the weather prediction models,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-26-pc-deficient%C2%A0till-date-in-july-285063

His journey from bank to bank in Mahabubabad started, but to no avail.Finally, upon hearing the man’s plight, Telangana Minister for Tribal, Women and Child welfare Satyavathi Rathod has come forward with help. She assured Naik that she would arrange for his surgery in any hospital that he desired and would also provide financial assistance.The Mandal Revenue Officer has meanwhile been sent to Naik to assure him that he should be helped.

It is necessary that pressure is put on the Centre in Parliament,” she said.Mayawati alleged that there is rising unemployment and inflation, which is posing hardships to the people, due to the wrong economic policies of the Central government.She said the BSP MPs will raise issues such as the rise in fuel and cooking gas prices and matters related to Covid-19 vaccination during the Monsoon Session of Parliament which begins on Monday.“There are many issues on which the public wants accountability of the government,” she said.Meanwhile, reacting to Mayawati’s statement, UP minister for Divyaangjan Welfare and BJP leader Anil Rajbhar claimed the BSP chief is fighting for her political existence, and the campaign to reach out to the Brahmin community is an “example of opportunistic politics”.Rajbhar also claimed that the Brahmin community will give a befitting reply to the BSP in the 2022 UP Assembly polls.“BSP is remembering the Brahmins because of the election. BSP chief Mayawati does not have information about what is happening on the ground,” he told reporters.“She will never struggle for the problems being faced by the public, nor will she speak about the farmers. She never moves out (of her house) to know the condition of the Dalits. She does politics from her air-conditioned room via Twitter and social media,” he said.

From the (party) organisational point of view, we though any person clicking a selfie (with her) should deposit Rs 100 in the treasury of the BJP’s local mandal unit,” she said.“As far as welcoming people with flowers is concerned, we all know Goddess Laxmi resides in them. So none other than Lord Vishnu, who is unblemished, can accept flowers. So, I don’t accept flowers. Moreover, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said one should offer books instead of flower bouquets,” the minister further said.Incidentally, in 2015, Thakur’s cabinet colleague Kunwar Vijay Shah had also proposed that those seeking selfies with him must donate Rs 10 for a cause.

However, no one was convicted in any of the three states between 2014 and 2019.As many as 22 sedition cases were filed in Karnataka in which charge sheets were filed in 17 cases, but the trial could be completed in just one case. However, no one was convicted in any case in the period.A total of 17 sedition cases were filed in Uttar Pradesh and eight in West Bengal between 2014 and 2019.While charge sheets were filed in eight cases in UP and five cases in West Bengal, no one was convicted in the two states.In Delhi, four sedition cases were registered between 2014 and 2019 but no charge sheet has been filed in any case.No sedition case was filed in states and UTs of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Chandigarh, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli in the six years.One each sedition case was filed in three states—Maharashtra (in 2015), Punjab (2015) and Uttarakhand (2017).According to the home ministry data, 2019 saw the highest number of 93 sedition cases registered in the country, followed by 70 in 2018, 51 in 2017, 47 in 2014, 35 in 2016 and 30 in 2015.While 40 charge sheets were filed in the country in 2019 under the sedition law, 38 were filed in 2018, 27 in 2017, 16 in 2016, 14 in 2014 and six in 2015.Among the six convicted, two were sentenced in 2018 and one each in 2019, 2017, 2016 and 2014. No one was convicted in 2015.On July 15, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana agreed to examine the pleas filed by the Editors Guild of India and a former major general challenging the Constitutionality of Section 124A (sedition) in the IPC.The court said its main concern was the “misuse of law” leading to the rise in the number of cases.The non-bailable provision makes any speech or expression that brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the government established by law in India a criminal offence punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.“Mr Attorney (General), we want to ask some questions. This is the colonial-era law and the same law was used by the British to suppress the freedom movement. It was used by the British to silence Mahatma Gandhi, Gokhale and others.“Is it still necessary to keep this in statute even after 75 years of independence?” asked the bench which also comprised justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy.

18-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||Not just Karnataka, BJP leadership appears to be considering major changes in other states as well||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 18Not just Karnataka, the BJP leadership appears to be working on effecting significant leadership changes in other states ruled by it. After the recent change of the Chief Minister in Uttarakhand and the mega shake-up of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Council of Ministers, sources claim the central leadership is also considering a re-boot in states where it is in opposition.Interestingly, while the recent Delhi visit by Karnataka CM BS Yeddiyurappa and his meetings with the central leadership grabbed all the attention, those with chief ministers from other states, including Madhya Pradesh and Tripura, went under the radar.While party leaders call them “normal, routine meetings”, sources, however, claim these to be “indicative of major changes in important BJP-ruled states”. Apparently, the party and its ideological fountainhead, the RSS, are also planning an overhaul in states where the BJP is in the opposition, the first indication of which came from Rajasthan when the state BJP yesterday expelled former state minister Rohitashav Sharma for six years on charges of breach of discipline.Sharma is considered close to former CM Vasundhara Raje.According to the sources, the party is trying to project new leaders in states like Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. “The Sangh also believes that the BJP should promote young leaders so that the party has a fresh line of leadership in the next few years,” they say. Notably, the meetings come in the wake of the results of the assembly elections earlier this year and feedback of the second wave of Coronavirus from across the country.So far as Karnataka is concerned speculation is rife on an alternative for Yediyurappa. “Given his stature and importance, the 78-year-old Lingayat leader will receive the exit he deserves,” is also the buzz doing rounds.Yediyurappa has announced the convening of the BJP legislature party meeting on July 26. It remains to be seen whether he will make some announcement on the day to pave way for the change the BJP and the RSS are looking for in the Southern state.    Meanwhile, several names are doing the rounds as a replacement, including Union Minister Prahlad Joshi, General Secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, deputy chief ministers C N Ashwath Narayan and Laxman Savadi, former union minister Sadananda Gowda, and state ministers Murugesh Rudrappa Nirani, Basavaraj Bommai, and R Ashok.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-just-karnataka-bjp-leadership-appears-to-be-considering-major-changes-in-other-states-as-well-285044

During the ceremony, he described being a photojournalist as both an honour and responsibility to bear witness for those who could not speak for themselves, in the hope that he could make a change for the better, the JTA said in a statement.JTA president Professor Majid Jamil described his death as a big loss to journalism and the Jamia community.Siddiqui, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018, worked for Reuters news agency and was killed on Friday in the town of Spin Boldak, near the border with Pakistan.

Also, they should add to their domain knowledge about their respective Ministries and Departments which accrue from discussions and debates, and queries of the Members.They should be geared up to give extempore replies to questions and on points raised by Opposition benches.This was to avert misunderstanding between the Treasury Benches and the Opposition through timely interventions in the House.Misunderstanding and lack of communication between the two sides lead to flashpoints, their subsequent festering ending up in a miasma of the whole shebang of political negativism including logjams and disruptions of the House.The BJP-NDA does not have a majority in the Upper House. In the past, the government was able to successfully pilot legislations through staccato grace and goodwill of some opposition parties like the BJD.This lifeline could not be taken by the ruling NDA for granted, and forever, given the factious party-politics, and electoral upmanship between the assertive BJP and competing for regional outfits in the country's political system.Due to the superiority of numbers, the opposition benches have been aggressive against the government in the past. For example with regard passage of the three Central farm laws.The negative developments in the House have an impact on politics and act as a cue and emboldening for opponents of the BJP.The feeling in government circles is that the Opposition will be adopting aggressive postures against the government and try to put it on the mat on a range of issues, including the second surge of Covid, farmers' agitation, international relations, etc.Because of the upcoming Assembly elections in States, including in the crucial Uttar Pradesh.Elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur will be due in February-March 2022. Political parties and vested interests have already started posturing with regard to them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-ministers-of-state-asked-to-concentrate-on-proceedings-in-rajya-sabha-govt-braces-for-oppositions-onslaught-285018

18-07-2021||Lucknow||Kanwar Yatra cancelled in Uttar Pradesh||The annual Kanwar Yatra in Uttar Pradesh has been cancelled this year, a senior government official said here on Saturday night.  The development came a day after the Supreme Court said it cannot allow the Uttar Pradesh government "to hold 100 percent physical Kanwar Yatra in view of COVID", stressing that sentiments, including religious, are subservient to the Right to Life."The Kanwar Yatra has been cancelled by the Kanwar Sanghs on the appeal of the Uttar Pradesh government," Additional Chief Secretary Information Navneet Sehgal said on Sunday.The yatra was scheduled to start on July 25.The Uttarakhand government has already called off the Kanwar Yatra citing fears expressed by experts of a possible third wave of the pandemic and the risk posed by such gatherings.The yatra goes on till the first week of August and sees thousands of Shiva devotees called ‘kanwariyas' travelling mostly on foot from neighbouring states, including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi to collect water from the Ganges in Haridwar.The Centre had told the top court that the state governments must not permit any kind of Kanwar yatra because of the pandemic and arrangements should be made for water from the Ganges to be available through tankers at designated places.Uttar Pradesh had said it was going ahead with a pared-down “symbolic” version.Earlier on Friday, the Supreme Court which had taken suo motu cognisance of the matter had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to inform by July 19 whether it would reconsider its decision to hold a "symbolic" Kanwar Yatra.

18-07-2021||New Delhi||Majoritarian tendencies must be questioned: Justice Chandrachud||Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud said on Saturday that irrespective of the electoral legitimacy of the government, the Constitution is the North Star against which conformity of every State action or inaction would have to be judged.He also asserted that majoritarian tendencies must be questioned against the background of “our constitutive promise”.“Any semblance of authoritarianism, clampdown on civil liberties, sexism, casteism, otherisation on account of religion or region is upsetting a sacred promise that was made to our ancestors who accepted India as their constitutional republic,” Justice Chandrachud said.He was speaking on the topic “Students as the Constitution’s Vanguards” at a programme organised by Shikshan Prasarak Mandali (SPM), a Maharashtra-based organisation that works in the field of education, on the 101st birth anniversary of his father Justice Y V Chandrachud, who was the longest-serving Chief Justice of India.India would be well into the 71st year of the constitutional republic and it is understandable that many may, on occasion, feel that country’s democracy is no longer new and the need to study constitutional history and engage with its framework isn’t as worthwhile, he said.“However, it is important to recognise that in times of peace or crisis, irrespective of the electoral legitimacy of the government, the Constitution is the North Star against which the conformity of every state action or inaction would have to be judged,” he said.He said India as a nation was united with a promise of certain commitments and entitlements to each and every citizen like religious freedom, equality between persons irrespective of sex, caste or religion, the fundamental freedom of speech and movement- without undue state interference - and an enduring right to life and personal liberty.“Majoritarian tendencies, whenever and however they arise, must be questioned against the background of our constitutive promise,” he said.Justice Chandrachud remembered Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar and said that before mounting a ferocious battle against casteism, patriarchy and oppressive Hindu practices, his first struggle was gaining access to education.“As a person hailing from the Mahar caste, an untouchable dalit caste, Babasaheb significantly struggled in gaining access to even primary education.“His foremost memories of his schooling are of humiliation and segregation where he had to attend his classes while sitting outside the classroom, and ensuring that he does not touch the water or the notebooks that belonged to the upper caste students,” he said while addressing the students of education institutes run by SPM.Justice Chandrachud said that Ambedkar eventually went on to hold 26 degrees and titles, becoming one of the most highly educated Indians of his generation and his education wasn’t just a vehicle for his self-advancement but left its imprints in the prescience, nuance and transformative potential of the Indian Constitution.He added that just like Ambedkar, several revolutionaries in India and the world like Savitribai Phule, Jyotiba Phule, Nelson Mandela and even Malala Yousafzai heralded their emancipatory movements through an initial and, in that time and circumstance, a radical quest for education.“These stories are useful reminders that the privilege of education we have today, are fruits of the boldest struggles and represent the dreams of our ancestors. The mantle is only passed forward, as every generation is entrusted with the task of bettering our society,” he said.Justice Chandrachud said that he firmly believes that students can play an instrumental role in heralding progressive politics and cultures by using their formative years to question existing systems and hierarchies.While remembering the roots of students movements in India and their contribution to India’s freedom struggle since the formation of the Academic Association in 1828, Justice Chandrachud said, “this brave pursuit of justice by students was not just against the colonial rule, but against future injustice as well, including the Emergency in 1975 when a democratically elected government had curtailed several civil liberties and muzzled free speech, offering a justification of a supposed internal disturbance”.He said that the Constitution, besides other rights, ensures civil and political liberties such as the right to vote, right to substantive equality, right to life, liberty and fundamental freedoms of speech and expression were explicitly guaranteed as “Fundamental Rights? that were available to all citizens, and some to even non-citizens.He said that any violation of these fundamental rights could be argued before a high court or the Supreme Court, and a meaningful remedy could be secured.Supreme Court judge Justice U U Lalit, whose father senior advocate Umesh Lalit had worked with Justice YV Chandrachud, also highlighted the contribution of former chief justice of India and said his over dozen constitution bench judgements are the lighthouse that shows the path to future generations.Hailing Justice YV Chandrachud as his hero, Justice Lalit said the he did not just have legal training but also had enormous knowledge for dealing with the social problems of the country and his landmark judgements are reflective of that vision.Justice YV Chandrachud was appointed Chief Justice of India on February 22, 1978 and superannuated on July 11, 1985.

18-07-2021||Paris||France allows visitors with Covishield vaccine||France will allow international travellers who have had AstraZeneca’s Indian-manufactured vaccine into the country starting Sunday.At the same time, France is tightening border checks to control the spread of the delta variant and protect hospitals, according to a statement from the prime minister on Saturday.The move to accept visitors vaccinated with Covishield, AstraZeneca’s vaccine made by India’s Serum Institute, came after a global outcry over the fact that the European Union’s Covid-19 certificate only recognises AstraZeneca vaccines manufactured in Europe.Several other EU countries already accept the Indian version, which is notably used in the UK and around Africa. The varied rules from each country have further complicated this summer’s travel season.France still doesn’t recognise vaccinations by Chinese or Russian vaccines, only those authorised by the EU drug regulator: those made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca.Starting Sunday, France will also start requiring anyone who isn’t vaccinated arriving from Britain, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Greece or Cyprus to present a negative test less than 24 hours old to cross French borders.Tunisia, Indonesia, Cuba and Mozambique have now been added to France’s “red list” of countries with high virus risk, according to Saturday’s statement. However, France will now accept travellers from any red list countries if they are fully vaccinated.France also shortened the time frame for when a person is considered fully vaccinated after the second dose, to one week instead of two.As infections climb anew, French President Emmanuel Macron this week ordered all health workers to get vaccinated by September 15 and announced that special Covid-19 passes will be required in all restaurants, bars, hospitals, shopping malls, trains, and planes.To get a pass, people must be fully vaccinated, have recently recovered from the virus, or have a fresh negative virus test.The measures have prompted record numbers of people to sign up for vaccinations — but have also prompted anger among some groups, and protests are planned in various French cities on Saturday against them.

Sharing the offer on social media, he said he wanted to help these students with whatever he could offer in his capacity, reports TNIE.The students can come and stay with their parents in the properties run by Sudheesh, who owns The Hammock Homestays and other properties in the hills. Students can stay for two days and need to provide their SSLC certificate that shows that they have failed in the secondary school examination.Sudheesh, a native of Vadakara in Kozhikode who has been living in Kodaikanal since 2006 with his family, reiterated that parents often compare their kids with others doing well in examinations, making it more difficult for the children to cope up with their failures. However, amid the silence of the hills, these children might find solace and a break from their stressful lives and help deal better with these situations.Following his viral post on Facebook, Sudheesh’s phone has not stopped ringing and he even received a call from a youngster, who wanted to book the homestay for his father, who failed the SSLC exam years ago.Speaking to The Hindu, Sudheesh said, “He was under the impression that the offer was open to anyone who had ever failed the exam. I had to convince him that doing that would put me out of business."On July 14, Kerala State Education Minister V Sivankutty declared the DHSE Kerala SSLC or class 10 result. Over 4.2 lakh students got their results today and as many as 99.47% of students who appeared for the exam cleared it. To the few students who could not clear the exams, the state education minister gave a motivating statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-class-x-fail-students-kodaikanal-homestay-offers-a-free-two-night-stay-284537
