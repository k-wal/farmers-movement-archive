Police teams have been formed to trace the men involved in the episode and they would be arrested soon,” Sharma added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-dalit-student-forced-to-shave-off-moustache-by-upper-caste-men-287225

Delays are liable to cause grave misgivings on reasons for delay. We direct Director CBI to take necessary administrative steps to monitor filing of appeals on an ICT platform so that delays don’t take place,” the top court said.A Special CBI judge at Raipur had in November 2018 convicted the accused in a corruption case and sentenced him to three-year imprisonment. However, in June 2019, the high court set aside the judgment and acquitted the accused and the CBI filed its appeal after 647 days.The top court wasn’t convinced by the CBI’s contention that delay was on account of Covid-19.“There is a delay of 647 days. In an application for condonation of delay, an explanation given is on grounds of Covid, which doesn’t explain the entire duration of the delay. Explanation of delay on account of Covid is not acceptable since the judgment was much before the onset of the pandemic in March 2020,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-pulls-up-cbi-for-647-day-delay-in-filing-appeal-asks-its-director-to-ensure-timely-filing-287222

However, with directional air flow, the possibility of virus riding on aerosols to long distance cannot be denied,” Singh said.As a precautionary measure, wearing mask can help in significantly reducing the risk of catching the infection through air, he cautioned.Replying to another question on Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) -- a consortium of 28 genome sequencing laboratories of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHF&W), CSIR, Ministry of Education, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and State Governments—he said the overall aim of the consortium is to monitor the genomic variations in coronavirus in India.He said according to the ICMR database, there are 1,88,26,913 individuals registered as COVID-19 positive between December 20 to July 19 2021.“Since the inception of INSACOG till now the INSACOG has sequenced 57,476 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Our chairperson is a seven-time Member of Parliament. She has the vision to guide the parliamentary party. She has the experience and insight. She was anyway guiding us,” he said.After her TMC’s victory in the assembly poll in West Bengal this year, Banerjee has been trying to establish herself as a leader who spearheads the Opposition narrative, something that the Congress was doing so far.With the Congress’ numbers dipping in Parliament and the TMC’s emphatic victory in the assembly polls and its performance in the general elections, the Bengal party is looking to displace the Congress as the voice of the Opposition. What has played to the TMC’s advantage is that it does not find itself at odds with other regional opposition parties in other states, something that the Congress has to contend with, a senior TMC leader said.The announcement of Banerjee being chosen chairperson comes days after top leaders from opposition parties joined the TMC in their Martyrs Day function and ahead of her visit to Delhi on July 26.“The decision has been taken both at a conceptual and tactical level. She has been a call away always. We feel more empowered,” O’Brien said.He also said that all TMC MPs unanimously chose Banerjee as their leader.Banerjee is not a member of parliament. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-mps-unanimously-choose-mamata-banerjee-as-its-parliamentary-partys-chairperson-287216

He said that focus on containment and clinical management aided in higher recovery and lower total active number of cases. He highlighted nine states that still have more than 10,000 active cases.During his address, he underlined the need to remind citizens through evidence-based reporting that it is critical to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour as the second wave is still not over and that the virus can strike back as soon as society ignores adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour.He also emphasised on the issue of mental health during Covid and requested media persons to address it through their messaging by engaging with subject experts from state and at national-level.Agarwal urged to highlight community-led positive initiatives and role models so that positive messages linked to vaccines and vaccination can reach a larger population and contribute to addressing issues of vaccine hesitancy.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nine-states-still-have-over-10-000-active-covid-cases-centre-287212

He and Kishorechandra were detained on May 17.Kishorechandra’s wife Ranjita wrote a letter to the High Court’s Chief Justice P V Sanjay Kumar and other judges stating that her husband was still languishing in jail while Leichombam was released though both were detained under similar charges.In an urgent hearing of the letter-petition, a bench comprising the chief justice and Justice Kh. Nobin Singh ordered the release of activist-journalist by 5 pm.Chongtham Victor, counsel for Kishorechandra, said that the issue of compensation for the unlawful detention will be adjudicated by the high court on August 24. The bench noted that there is no difference between the cases of Kishorechandra and Leichombam as both of them uploaded similar Facebook posts.They made the statement in the context of the death of the Manipur BJP president due to COVID-19.Borrowing observations from the Supreme Court’s judgment in Erendro’s release, it said, “As they stand identically situated, we are of the opinion that the continued incarceration of the petitioner’s husband would be as much a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution as it was in the case of Erendro Leichombam.”   The court suspended the order passed by the Manipur government against the petitioner’s husband under the NSA.For the initial case against Kishorechandra under provisions of the Indian Penal Code, he was granted bail by the chief judicial magistrate, Imphal.Soon after he secured bail, Kishorechandra was booked under the NSA along with Leichombam.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manipur-scribe-held-under-nsa-released-on-court-orders-287208

23-07-2021||Mumbai||Raj Kundra tells Bombay HC: Films don't contain explicit sexual acts||Businessman Raj Kundra on Friday challenged before the Bombay High Court his arrest in a case of alleged production and distribution of pornographic films through apps, saying these videos might be described as "lascivious" but do not show "explicit sexual acts".Kundra (45), the husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, was arrested on July 19 by Mumbai Police. A magistrate's court remanded him in police custody till July 27. Pornography: Crime Branch at Raj Kundra's, Shilpa Shetty's Juhu house after court extends his police custodyThe petition sought quashing of the lower court's order. The magistrate's order sending him in police custody violated the law as serving a notice under section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (before arrest) is mandatory, especially in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it said.As per section 41A, the police may, in cases where the arrest is not warranted, issue summons to the accused person and record his or her statement. The material which the police claim to be pornographic did not “depict direct explicit sexual acts and sexual intercourse but shows material in the form of short movies which are lascivious or appeal to the prurient interest of persons at best”, Kundra's plea contended.Hence section 67A of the Information Technology Act (publishing sexually explicit content) cannot be invoked, and at the most, it would attract section 67 (publishing lascivious content), it said.On July 19, 2021, the police carried out a search at his office and requested him to go to the police station to record a statement, Kundra said."The respondent (police) arrested the petitioner in the police station where he was called under the garb of recording his statement,” the plea alleged.After his arrest Kundra was asked to sign a notice issued under section 41A of CrPC which he refused to do, it claimed.Further, the sections under which he is booked do not prescribe a sentence of more than seven years in jail, so his arrest, without prior notice under section 41 A, "is completely illegal", the petition said. When the First Information Report (FIR) was registered in February 2021, he was not even named as accused, Kundra said, adding that a charge sheet was filed in the case in April and several other accused are now out on bail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raj-kundra-tells-bombay-hc-films-dont-contain-explicit-sexual-acts-287181

During the test, the missile demonstrated high manoeuvrability required for neutralising fast and agile aerial threats, sources said.  The launch was witnessed by the representatives of the Indian Air Force. Once deployed, the Akash-NG weapon system will prove to be a force multiplier for the air defence capability of the Indian Air Force.  Production agencies Bharat Electronics Limited and Bharat Dynamics Limited also participated in the trials.  Secretary, Department of Defence R$@$#D and DRDO Chairman, Dr G Satheesh Reddy, also congratulated the teams for the successful trial of Akash NG which is capable of intercepting high speed and agile aerial threats.

Out of 157, 47 medical colleges are functional. Responding to a question on details of medical colleges, universities, institutes and hospitals, which have been de-recognised, Pawar said during the last academic session 2020-21, no medical college was de-recognised. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doc-population-ratio-1854-assuming-80-availability-of-allopathic-docs-5-65-lakh-ayush-docs-govt-287176

23-07-2021||Mumbai||One more extortion case filed against Param Bir Singh, this time in Thane||One more case has been registered against former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh for allegedly extorting money from the relative of a builder and kidnapping him for ransom, police said on Friday.A DCP-rank official and three others have also been named in the First Information Report (FIR) that was registered in Thane on Friday, they said.The complainant in the case, Sharad Agrawal, approached the Kopri police station in Thane in the early hours of Friday and filed the complaint against Param Bir Singh, who had served as the Thane police chief earlier.The other accused were identified as Parag Manere, a DCP-rank officer of Mumbai Police, Sanjay Punamia, Sunil Jain and Manoj Ghotkar, the official added.As per the complaint lodged by Agrawal, the accused allegedly demanded Rs 2 crore extortion from him and forcibly acquired his land, he said.On Wednesday, Mumbai police had registered an FIR of extortion, cheating and forgery against Param Bir Singh, five other police officials and two others for allegedly demanding Rs 15 crore from builder Shyamsundar Agrawal for withdrawing cases against him.Sharad Agrawal is the nephew of Shyamsundar Agrawal, he said.Based on his complaint, an FIR has been registered under IPC sections 384 and 385 (extortion), 388 (extortion by threat), 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offence in order to commit extortion), 420 (cheating), 364 A (kidnapping for ransom), 34 (common intention), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), he said adding probe in the case is on.Two accused in this fresh case - Punamia and Jain - have already been arrested by Mumbai police in the earlier offence registered at Marine Drive in South Mumbai, he said.Param Bir Singh was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner in March this year after the arrest of dismissed police officer Sachin Waze in the case of an explosives-laden vehicle found near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai. Singh later accused then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-more-extortion-case-filed-against-param-bir-singh-this-time-in-thane-287164

23-07-2021||Washington||US welcomes PM Modi's continued focus on driving clean energy transformation in India: Official||The United States welcomes the continued focus of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on driving a clean energy transformation in his country despite the challenges posed by the Covid pandemic, a senior official has said.Testifying before a Congressional committee on Thursday, Jonathan Pershing, a senior advisor to the Special Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry, said the US and India are committed partners on climate."We welcome Prime Minister Modi's continued focus on driving a clean energy transformation in India, notwithstanding the extreme challenges posed by the Covid crisis there," Pershing told lawmakers.In April, the two governments signed the "US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership". Under the partnership, the two sides identified a 2030 agenda for clean technologies and climate action, Pershing said."A key focus will be cooperation to create regulatory and market conditions to spur the required investment to achieve India's goal to deploy 450 GW of renewable energy. If achieved, India would realise transformative changes in both its energy security and GHG emissions trajectory," he said.Sherri Goodman, secretary general of the International Military Council on Climate and Security, told lawmakers that climate factors are also consequential in the tense relations between nuclear-armed neighbours India, Pakistan and China.A joint study published earlier this year by the Council on Strategic Risks and the Woodwell Climate Research Centre projects a strong warming trend near the disputed border between India and China, where approximately 1,00,000 Indian and Chinese troops are deployed at altitudes reaching up to 15,000 feet, she said.Military patrols, which are not viable today, may become more frequent, setting the conditions for potential violent clashes, she added."Meanwhile, China, partly due to its transition to renewable energy, is planning the world's largest hydroelectric facility just north of where the Brahmaputra river crosses into India. Three times the size of Three Gorges Dam, this new dam project is also located in a seismically sensitive zone," Goodman noted."This has caused major concerns for downstream India, which is also worried that the new Chinese dam could be used to either withhold water from or flood parts of India. In truth, it will be difficult to tell if a future flood is the result of Chinese manipulation of the dam, or climate-related factors. China's lack of transparency on dam projects affecting its neighbours only increases India's distrust," she said.China is also constructing a series of dams in Pakistan-held Kashmir, to which India objects, due to its territorial claims there. These dams, when built, will be viable until the end of the century, due to projected glacial melt patterns, Goodman said.

But Xi, who also heads the ruling Communist Party of China and the powerful Central Military Commission - the overall high command of the Chinese military - is perhaps the first top leader in recent years to visit Tibet's border town. Nyingchi was in news in June when China fully operationalised its first bullet train in Tibet.The train connects Tibet's provincial capital Lhasa with Nyingchi. It has a designed speed of 160 km per hour and operates on a single-line electrified railway covering 435.5-km.

23-07-2021||New Delhi||Ruckus in Parliament, Opposition rallies behind farmers as protesters hold ‘Kisan Sansad’||Even as a group of 200 farmers protesting the Centre’s three agricultural laws started a ‘Kisan Sansad’ at Jantar Mantar today, Opposition MPs, including those of the Congress, SAD and AAP, staged a protest inside Parliament complex demanding repeal of the legislations.The issues concerning the farmers resonated inside the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha as well and were one of the reasons for adjournment of the Houses for the day. The Opposition members raised slogans and waved placards, demanding a rollback of the laws. In the morning, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi led a protest by party MPs at Parliament complex, expressing solidarity with the agitators at Jantar Mantar. All Punjab Congress MPs were present with several carrying posters reading “justice for farmers”.In Rajya Sabha, breach of privilege noticeCongress MPs Deepender Singh Hooda and Partap Singh Bajwa submitted breach of privilege notice against the Delhi Police to the RS Secretary-General, flagging ‘attempts by cops to obstruct them from briefing the media at Vijay Chowk.’SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and his wife and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal too protested outside Parliament and flashed pro-farmer placards at Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar when he arrived for the proceedings. “Akali Dal will not give up till the Centre repeals three farm laws,” said Sukhbir. AAP MP Bhagwant Mann supported the protesters and said they deserved justice.Earlier, Mann, Harsimrat and Congress MPs, including Manish Tewari (Lok Sabha), Deepender Singh Hooda and Partap Singh Bajwa (Rajya Sabha) again moved notices for adjournment of proceedings of the two houses to discuss farmers’ issues. The notices were rejected by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu.Even as Tomar reiterated the government commitment to engage the farmers should they flag specific objections to the laws, BJP leader and Minister of State for External Affairs Meenakshi Lekhi at an official party press conference called the protesters at Jantar Mantar “mawaalis”.“Stop calling them farmers. They are not farmers (but)... a handful of people playing into the hands of conspirators and doing all in the name of farmers,” said Lekhi.Asked again about the protesters, she added, “Again you are calling them farmers. They are ‘mawaalis’. Whatever happened on January 26 in the capital was a criminal act and the Opposition promoted these things.” She retracted after Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh demanded her resignation for using "disparaging references for the agitating farmers”.Meanwhile, the protesters organised a ‘Kisan Sansad’ and debated the changes in the APMC Act in two sessions, punctuated by a ‘langar’ (community kitchen) on the first day.Rejecting Tomar’s claim on the farm laws as “hollow”, the farmers said “he should visit ‘Kisan Sansad’ to understand their concerns. Farmer leaders also said they suspected they were being snooped on.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, denying political ambitions, said farmers would hold a ‘mahapanchayat’ in September to devise a strategy for the upcoming Assembly elections. “We will not contest, nor support any party. But the medicine we gave in Bengal, we will give it in UP and other states too. Till the time the government does not recover completely, we will continue with our ‘ilaaj’ (treatment),” Tikait said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ruckus-in-parliament-opposition-rallies-behind-farmers-as-protesters-hold-kisan-sansad-286807

The development led to a war of words between the government and Opposition, with the non-NDA parties terming it an attempt to muzzle dissent. Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said, “The agencies are doing their own work and there is no interference.”Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Writing the truth on paper with ink is enough to intimidate a weak government.” Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi asked whether the raids were pre-planned or a coincidence after the group put out some stories critical of the government.SAD chief Sukbhir Singh Badal tweeted, “The government needs to understand that such vindictive actions to gag the media have no place in a democracy.”— TNSAgencies doing their job.

The statement had to be laid on the table with the presiding officer adjourning the House for the day as Congress and TMC MPs continued to storm the well and raise slogans demanding a judicial or JPC probe into the accusations of spying.The minister’s statement, same as the one made in the Lok Sabha on Monday, rejected all allegations and termed the Pegasus media reports as “sensationalism and without substance”.PIL in Supreme Court for probeAlleging that Pegasus snooping row was the biggest crime for political vested interests, advocate ML Sharma has filed a PIL in the Supreme Court demanding an SIT probe.After Sen snatched the papers from Vaishnaw, heated exchanges ensued between him and Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri until the situation was eased.Government sources were said to be mulling a possible motion against the erring MPs but there was no official word on it.In the Lok Sabha too serial adjournments happened through the day on farmers’ issues, IT raids on media groups and the Pegasus issue, mainly.“This is not right, this is a wrong practice. This Parliament is yours. The onus of retaining its glory is on you. If you don’t do that, democracy will not be strengthened. I am ready to get discussion done on the issue that is agitating you,” said Speaker Om Birla to the protesting MPs, who forced three adjournments and a final one for the day at 4 pm.Meanwhile, TMC MP Santanu Sen later in the day alleged threat from a minister. “Indians are not at all safe. Might die due to scarcity of oxygen. Might die of Covid due to shortage of vaccine…. No democratic discussion in Parliament.

The duty also falls on the state machinery to be committed to the rule of law,” it said. “The colonial mindset meted out to the district judiciary must change, it is only then that civil liberties for every citizen, be it accused victim or civil society, will be meaningfully preserved in our trial courts which are first line of defence for those who are being wronged,” the top court noted.It reversed the MP High Court order refusing to cancel the bail granted to murder accused Govind Singh, husband of BSP MLA Rambai Singh.

I will know the next step only after July 25. I will abide by the BJP high command’s decision and work to strengthen the party and bring it back to power,” he said.Transition may not be smoothThe 78-year-old Lingayat strongman said he had offered to resign two months ago with an intention to make way for others and asserted that he won’t name a possible successor even if asked to.Central BJP leaders did not talk about his replacement during his recent Delhi visit, he said.Yediyurappa said: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and JP Nadda have special love and faith towards me...You know that no position is given to those above 75, but appreciating my work, I have been given the opportunity to serve the state.”There are speculations that Yediyurappa was specifically “asked to clear the air by the central leadership” and ensure a “smooth transition”.For the past two days, seers have been visiting his residence in what has been perceived as a show of solidarity and a bid to pressure the BJP. Yediyurappa has also received the support of senior Congress leaders from the Lingayat community.Observers believe that while the exit is imminent, it may not be a smooth one. Though much of the anger among adversaries stems from the alleged interference in the administration by his son BY Vijayendra, BJP leaders admit that a leader of the stature of Yeddiyurappa needs be handled with care.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-hints-at-exit-says-will-abide-by-bjp-high-commands-directions-286873

The bill also seeks to ensure transparency of administration of inland water among other things.56 Air India staffers died due to CovidPresiding officer of the LS at the time Bhartruhari Mahtab called out the names of Opposition MPs, who had objected to the introduction of the bill, but some were absent and others not in their seats to flag concerns as they were protesting in the well. These Congress MPs were K Suresh, Manish Tewari, Heibi Eden, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and MK Raghavan.RSP’s NK Premchandran opposed the introduction of the Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021, saying it seeks to prohibit the workers’ legitimate right to strike guaranteed under the Indian industrial laws and the ILO conventions.“This bill seeks to cut down democratic rights of workers. Why introduce it when the house is not in order?” Premchandran asked.

23-07-2021||New Delhi||India still a tough place to do biz: US State Dept||Despite major gains in the World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings, India remains a difficult place to do business and additional economic reforms are necessary to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth, says the US State Department’s latest report on investment climate in the country.It noted that India’s economic growth has been strong in recent years, driven by private consumption and buoyed by reduced external vulnerabilities and key structural reforms. Similarly, rising government investment has played an important role in keeping the economy growing.However, India’s private sector investment has not increased, despite having the fastest growing major economy tag in the world. While foreign direct investment (FDI) into India increased significantly during the first two years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s term, the rate of growth has slowed over the past year.Non-performing assets continue to hold back banks’ profits and restrict their lending, and the sudden collapse of the non-bank financial company Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) in 2018 led to a credit crunch. Nonetheless, relatively low inflation, weak credit demand and strong intervention from the Central bank, the RBI, helped stabilise credit markets and mitigate fallout.The Modi government introduced two rounds of tariff increases in 2018, ostensibly in response to India’s large trade deficit with China, and related balance of payment concerns. “Whatever the actual intent, these tariff increases disrupted the supply chains of both domestic industry and foreign investors and led to the cancellation of both new investments and expansions of existing investments in India,” said the report.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-still-a-tough-place-to-do-biz-us-state-dept-286909

I will work to strengthen the party and bring the party back to power in Karnataka”.He also added: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and our national president JP Nadda have special love and faith towards me..... You know that no position is given to those who have crossed 75 years of age in the party, but appreciating my work, I have been given me the opportunity despite that I am 78 years old”.Speculation is that the Lingayat strongman was “asked to clear the air on instructions of the central leadership”.For the past two days now, seers have been visiting his residence, in what was seen as a show of solidarity and bit to pressurise the BJP. Notably, a delegation of pontiffs under the leadership of Siddalinga Swamiji of Siddaganga Mutt, an influential Lingayat seminary in the state, also urged the saffron leadership to allow Yediyurappa to complete his term. Some are also believed to have also warned of “adverse consequences” in case he is replaced.On Wednesday, Yeddiyurappa tweeted, saying: “I am privileged to be a loyal worker of BJP. It is my utmost honour to serve the party with highest standards of ethics and behaviour. I urge everyone to act in accordance with party ethics and not indulge in protests/indiscipline that is disrespectful and embarrassing for the party”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-hints-at-stepping-down-says-will-abide-by-bjp-high-command-decision-286736
23-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||Protesting farmer leaders say they suspect govt snooping on them||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 22A group of 200 farmers on Thursday held ‘Kisan Sansad’, a parallel ‘Monsoon Session’ at the Jantar Mantar barely a couple of kilometres away from the Parliament where protests by opposition MPs on the three contentious farm laws reverberated.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar again reached out to protesting unions, assuring that the government was always ready to talk with them provided they tell which specific provisions they are objecting to.“Even today if they tell us to which specific provision of the laws they have objections, we are ready to talk to them. The country is a witness to the laws being pro-farmers and beneficial to them,” Tomar said.Meenakshi Lekhi“These are not farmers, these are 'mawalis'" “Stop calling them as farmers, they are not farmers. They are ‘shadyantrakaris’ (conspirators) who are using the name of farmers. Farmers do not have time to come and sit on Jantar Mantar, these are men of ‘arthiyas’, those who don’t want any benefit to pass on to farmers,” union minister Meenakshi Lekhi said, addressing a press conference.When she was again asked a question regarding the farmers’ protest, she said: “You are calling them farmers again…they are ‘maawalis’. Whatever happened on January 26 was shameful”.Lekhi, however, later retracted her statement.Recently, the minister told the Parliament in a written reply that instead of insisting on the demand for a repeal, unions should discuss their concerns on clauses in the legislation “so that their concerns can be resolved”.Farmers, who refuted the “hollow claim” of central ministers that they have not really explained their concerns regarding the laws were only harping on their repeal demand, asked the ministers to visit 'Kisan Sansad' to understand their concerns.Referring to the “unconstitutional nature of the laws and the undemocratic processes by which the Government brought the laws”, in their discussions on the “APMC Bypass Act”, farmers again insisted on a “complete repeal and nothing less”. Through the 'Kisan Sansad', we are showing the government how to conduct Parliament with knowledgeable discussions, they said."The government says farmers are uneducated, that we need to be educated regarding the impact of the farm laws. They should come and listen to debates here,” All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah said. The ‘Kisan Sansad’ is being organised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of the protesting farmer's unions, amid a ring of security around central Delhi and a tight vigil on the movement of vehicles.Farmer leaders also said they suspected that they were being snooped on by the government using Israeli software 'Pegasus'. Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav said phone numbers of farmer leaders will figure in the data of the year 2020-21. “It is an unethical government. We suspect that we are among those being snooped on,” farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said.Many MPs also visited the protest site at the Jantar Mantar.Speakers thanked the MPs for their support but did not give them any space on the stage. “We requested them to be our voice inside the Parliament. We also warned them that if they do not work towards securing our demands inside the Parliament, farmers of the country will have to boycott them. If they fail to take up the issue in Parliament, they will face the same farmers’ boycott as BJP MPs,” Yadav said.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who has denied having any political ambitions, said farmers will hold a ‘maha panchayat' in September to devise a strategy for upcoming Assembly elections, including in Uttar Pradesh. “We will not contest, nor support any party. But the medicine we gave in Bengal, we will also give in Uttar Pradesh and other elections. Till the time the government does not recover completely, we will continue with our ‘ilaaj’ (treatment). ‘Inhe aaram milega, hum inka pucca ilaaj karenga. (They will recover. We will do their complete treatment),” Tikait said.A protestor, Jasbir Kaur, said laws will deprive farmers, agricultural labourers, and mandi workers of their jobs. “When private mandis come, the infrastructure will only benefit Ambani and Adani, not farmers,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protesting-farmer-leaders-say-they-suspect-govt-snooping-on-them-286728
23-07-2021||Mumbai||FIR against IPS officer Param Bir Singh, 5 other cops on charges of extortion||The Mumbai police have registered an FIR against senior IPS officer Param Bir Singh, five other police personnel and two more persons for allegedly demanding Rs 15 crore from a builder to withdraw cases against him, an official said on Thursday.Based on the builder's complaint, the case was registered at the Marine Drive police station in south Mumbai, he said, without giving more details.Two of the builder's partners, Sunil Jain and Sanjay Punamia, had been arrested, he said.According to the complaint, Jain and Punamia had conspired with police officials and demanded Rs 15 crore from the builder to withdraw some cases against him, he said.The builder had named former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh along with others in his complaint, the official said.Singh was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner and transferred as the DG-Home Guard in March this year after the arrest of dismissed police officer Sachin Waze in the case of an explosives-laden vehicle found near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani.

23-07-2021||New Delhi||India can’t have parallel legal systems for rich and poor: Supreme Court||India cannot have two parallel legal systems, one for the rich and resourceful and those who wield political power and the other for “small men” without resources and capabilities to access justice, the Supreme Court said on Thursday.The apex court said the "colonial mindset meted out to the district judiciary" must change to preserve the faith of citizens and stated that judges are "made targets when they stand up for what is right".The top court made these crucial observations while cancelling the bail granted to Madhya Pradesh BSP MLA's husband, who was arrested in over two-year-old murder case of Congress leader Devendra Chourasia.An independent and impartial judiciary is the cornerstone of democracy and it should be immune from political pressures and considerations, the top court said.“India cannot have two parallel legal systems, one for the rich and resourceful and those who wield political power and the other for small men without resources and without capabilities to gain justice.“The existence of dual system will only chip away the legitimacy of the law. The duty also falls on the state machinery to be committed to the rule of law,” the top court said.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said district judiciary is the first point of interface with the citizens.“If the faith of citizens in the judiciary is to be preserved, it is the district judiciary on which attention must be focused,” the bench said.The top court said trial court judges work amidst appalling conditions, lack of infrastructure, inadequate protection and there are examples of judges being made targets when they stand up for what is right.Also, there is sadly subservience to the administration of the high courts for transfers and postings which renders them vulnerable, the bench said.“The colonial mindset meted out to the district judiciary must change, it is only then that civil liberties for every citizen, be it accused victim or civil society, will be meaningfully preserved in our trial courts which are first line of defence for those who are being wronged,” the bench said.The apex court said function of the judiciary as an independent institution is rooted in concept of separation of powers.Individual judges must be able to adjudicate disputes in accordance with law unhindered by any other factors and for that reason independence of judiciary and of each judge is a must, the bench said.Independence of individual judges also encompasses that they are independent of their superiors and colleagues, it said, adding that our constitution specially envisages independence of district judiciary which is mentioned in Article 50.“If district judiciary operates under the supervision of the high court then it must secure its independence from external influence and control.“This compartmentalisation of judiciary and executive should not be breached by personal decision-making of the judges and the conduct of court proceedings under the relevant acts,” the bench said.The top court said there is no gainsaying that judiciary should be immune to political pressures and considerations.A judiciary susceptible to such pressures allows politicians to operate with impunity and criminality to flourish in the political apparatus of the state.

23-07-2021||Aditi Tandon||Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha adjourned following furore on Pegasus and farmer issues||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 22Parliament remained disrupted on Pegasus snooping row and farmers’ issues for the third day on Thursday with the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha adjourned twice first till noon and then till 2 pm.Opposition MPs stormed the Well, flashing placards in front of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, who repeatedly asked the members to return to the seats saying the government was willing to discuss anything as per rules.“This is not right, this is a wrong practice. This Parliament is yours. The onus of retaining its glory is on you. If you don’t do that democracy will not be strengthened. I am ready to get discussion done on the issue that’s agitating you,” said the Speaker, but to no avail.Congress, TMC and Left parties were seen storming the Well agitating on issues of farmers and against the alleged snooping of Indian individuals using a foreign spyware.In Rajya Sabha too, the opposition MPs forced two adjournments and the House was adjourned within a minute of assembling at 11 am.Later, when the RS reassembled, the Opposition MPs continued to raise slogans against the alleged snooping controversy.In the ruckus, the deputy chairman sought laying of the parliamentary committee reports that could not be laid at the scheduled hour in the morning due to opposition protests.Soon after, he adjourned the proceedings for the day.When the Lok Sabha reassembled at noon after the first adjournment the government said it was ready for any discussion.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said, “Rajya Sabha has already discussed Covid. Despite our assurances the opposition here is disrupting the question hour which is a right of the members. Disrupting the proceedings when government is ready for discussion is not right. Tell us on what issue you want a discussion. We will discuss.”Presiding officer LS Bhartruhari Mahtab urged MPs to go to their seats and allow the House to function but had to again adjourn the proceedings till 2 pm amid pandemonium.Later, the Lok Sabha was adjourned till tomorrow amid continued protests by Opposition members against the "three black farm laws".Earlier on Thursday, senior adviser to Information and Broadcasting Ministry Kanchan Gupta cited media reports quoting Amnesty International as saying that the list of potential spyware targets was indicative of the interests of Israel Dir NSO, Pegasus’s clients.Amnesty has never presented this list as NSO’s Pegasus spyware list although some of the world’s media may have done so, an investigation by cyber journalist Kim Zetter, which Gupta quoted, said.Gupta tweeted Zetter’s reports saying, “Laughable 'snooping' story was spun around an 'indicative' list manufactured by Amnesty Int. Amnesty has never presented this list as NSO's Pegasus Spyware List...Amnesty makes clear this is a list *indicative* of the interests of (Pegasus) clients."The Left is seeking a JPC in the snooping row while the Congress and TMC have demanded a Supreme Court-led investigation.The government has denied the charges as sensational calling the reports by an international media consortium a “global conspiracy”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-rajya-sabha-adjourned-following-furore-on-pegasus-and-farmer-issues-286684
