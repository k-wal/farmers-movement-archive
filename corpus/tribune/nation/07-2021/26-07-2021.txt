26-07-2021||New Delhi||Ocular evidence best evidence unless there are reasons to doubt it: SC||Ocular evidence is considered the best evidence unless there are reasons to doubt it, the Supreme Court said on Monday while restoring the life imprisonment awarded to four persons convicted for murder.A Bench of Justices Navin Sinha and R Subhash Reddy said it is only in a case where there is a gross contradiction between medical evidence and oral evidence, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved.“Ocular evidence is considered the best evidence unless there are reasons to doubt it. It is only in a case where there is a gross contradiction between medical evidence and oral evidence, and the medical evidence makes the ocular testimony improbable and rules out all possibility of ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved,” the Bench said.    The observations came while delivering a judgment on an appeal against a Gujarat High Court order of acquittal, reversing the conviction of four persons under Sections 302 (murder), 34 (common intention), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sentencing them to life imprisonment and fifteen days imprisonment under Section 135(1) of the Bombay Police Act.The deceased was assaulted in October 2003 while he was returning on a motorcycle along with a prosecution witness who was the pillion rider.    The convict assaulted the victim with an iron pipe, steel rod, and stick, causing three stab wounds and nine incised wounds. The acquittal was based on the reasoning that the evidence of the eye­witnesses of second prosecution witness and tenth prosecution witness, is inconsistent with the medical evidence, regarding the nature of injuries vis­à­vis the weapons of offense.The apex court said there was no time for the witness to consider and ponder for naming the accused except to state the truth.The criminal jurisprudence developed in this country recognises that the eye sight capacity of those who live in rural areas is far better than compared to the town folks, the apex court said.“Identification at night between known persons is acknowledged to be possible by voice, silhouette, shadow, and gait also. Therefore, we do not find much substance in the submission of the respondents that identification was not possible in the night to give them the benefit of doubt.

26-07-2021||New Delhi||‘Several ex-security officials on Pegasus list’||The latest ‘revelation’ about the Pegasus project claims that many contrarians as well as establishment men in the national security apparatus may have been targeted for surveillance. They include two Army officers who had filed cases in courts against the government.A RAW officer marked for probable surveillance, along with his wife, was Jitendra Kumar Ojha who took premature retirement under controversial circumstances following run-ins with present RAW chief Samant Goel and has filed a case in the court.He has been quoted as saying the attempted hacking was “brazenly criminal”, particularly his wife’s phone, to “bring psychological pressure on me, while I fight my case”.The two Indian Army officers may have been of interest after they took on the government on service-related matters.Col. Mukul Dev filed a case against the order to scrap free rations for officers who are posted in peace areas. “They perhaps did not like the fact that I consistently raised my voice for the welfare of the Indian Army,” he has been quoted as saying.Colonel Amit Kumar had filed a petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of 356 Army personnel against dilution of the Armed Forces (Special Forces) Act (AFSPA). Kumar was quoted as saying, “What will they get from my phone? My phone is filled with patriotism. There is nothing else of interest.”Another case involves former Border Security Force (BSF) chief KK Sharma. The media consortium claims that his telephone number was among the list containing several hundred numbers from India marked as probable targets for surveillance.Sharma attended a conference by a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) affiliate in uniform as BSF chief. It was around that time that Sharma’s three phone numbers were of interest. After retirement, he was named special central police observer for Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal and Jharkhand.However, he was removed after two days as West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee protested his appointment.Another BSF officer who was a person of interest was IG Jagdish Maithani, entrusted with the work of smart fencing on the Indo-Bangla border.Rajeshwar Singh, a senior Enforcement Directorate officer who led several high-profile investigations, too was a probable target for surveillance as was VK Jain, a former IAS officer who worked as a personal assistant to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.There was also one official each from the PMO and NITI Aayog, but their names have not been disclosed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/several-ex-security-officials-on-pegasus-list-288590

This needs to be stopped right now.”Dear Himantaji, after cordial meeting of CMs by Hon’ble Shri @amitshah ji, surprisingly 2 companies of Assam Police with civilians lathicharged & tear gassed civilians at Vairengte Auto Rickshaw stand inside Mizoram today. They even overrun CRPF personnel /Mizoram Police. https://t.co/SrAdH7f7rv  Hon'ble @himantabiswa ji, as discussed I kindly urge that Assam Police @assampolice be instructed to withdraw from Vairengte for the safety of civilians. @narendramodi @AmitShah @PMOIndia @HMOIndia https://t.co/wHtMPhFRpP  Responding to this first, the Assam Police tweeted saying that it was unfortunate that miscreants from Mizoram are indulging in stone-pelting and attacked Assam government officials, stationed at Lailapur to protect Assam’s land from encroachment.Honble ⁦@ZoramthangaCM⁩ ji , Kolasib ( Mizoram) SP is asking us to withdraw from our post until then their civilians won't listen nor stop violence. How can we run government in such circumstances? Hope you will intervene at earliest ⁦@AmitShah⁩ ⁦@PMOIndia⁩ pic.twitter.com/72CWWiJGf3  I have just spoken to Hon’ble Chief Minister @ZoramthangaCM ji.I have reiterated that Assam will maintain status quo and peace between the borders of our state. I have expressed my willingness to visit Aizawl and disscuss these issues if need be @AmitShah @PMOIndia  I am deeply pained to inform that six brave jawans of @assampolice have sacrificed their lives while defending constitutional boundary of our state at the Assam-Mizoram border. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families.  This was followed by a tweet by Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who also sought immediate intervention of Shah and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and said, “How can we run a government in such circumstances?” He said a superintendent of police from Mizoram was asking Assam’s officials to withdraw from their post, failing which civilians from the neighbouring state would not stop the violence.After this, Zoramthanga wrote to Sarma, “Dear Himantji, after a cordial meeting of CMs (chaired) by Shah, two companies of Assam Police lathicharged and tear gassed civilians at Vairengte Auto Rickshaw stand inside Mizoram today.They even overrun CRPF personnel/Mizoram Police.” He went on to add: “How are you going to justify these violent acts? Shri Amit Shah ji... kindly look into the matter. This needs to be stopped right now.”Taking note of this tweet, Assam chief minister responded by alleging that civilians from Mizoram are trying to incite violence in the state.“Hon’ble Zoramthanga ji, could you please investigate why are civilians from Mizoram holding sticks and trying to incite violence? We urge civilians to not take up law and order on their own hands and permit peaceful dialogue to take place between governments @AmitShah @PMOIndia,” Sarma tweeted.Later in another tweet Sarma said, “I’ve just spoken to Mizoram CM Zoramthanga ji. I have reiterated that Assam will maintain status quo and peace between the borders of our state. I have expressed my willingness to visit Aizawl and discuss these issues if need be.”Meanwhile, sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the HM today spoke to the chief ministers of both states asking them to resolve the crisis and the two of them have agreed to abide by Shah’s request, as the police forces of both states have now retreated from the disputed site.At the chief ministers’ meeting, chaired by the Union home minister last Saturday in Shillong, Zoramthanga was learnt to have said the area claimed by Assam has been used by people from Mizoram for over 100 years.“The border disputes are a legacy of the colonial era that the present government inherited from its predecessor which has been left unresolved at the time of the formation of states like Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram,” he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-border-tension-escalates-assam-mizoram-cms-trade-charges-on-twitter-seek-help-from-shah-288582

Over 60 per cent population, including children, had acquired immunity against the virus through vaccination or contracting the virus. This has been claimed in a sero-surveillance study, whose report was released here today.A combination of Covid vaccines and natural immunity acquired by 60 per cent against the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 would be enough for Telangana to sail through a possible third Covid wave smoothly, the study by Hyderabad-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has stated.Dr A Laxmaiah, Head, Public Health, NIN has said the third wave may not happen due to overall immunity, but Telangana will sail through quickly even if it does. “The impact will not be as intense as the second wave,” the report suggests.“Natural immunity and vaccination can act as community barriers and won’t allow the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread. There were reports that the third wave could impact children in large numbers. There is no such evidence, and our sero-surveillance has indicated that a considerable younger population has also acquired immunity,” says Dr Laxmaiah said.The NIN study, which included children for the first time in Telangana, has indicated that about 55 per cent of kids between 6 years and 9 years had developed antibodies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-has-herd-immunity-against-covid-19-study-288577

They had linked several bank accounts of various banks to these Amazon accounts which were used by them to order electronic products. It would either be prepaid or cash on delivery (COD) orders," the statement read."However, after receiving the goods, they would sell them off at cheap prices in Delhi's Gaffar Market and then contact Amazon, saying they wanted to return the products as they were 'defective'," it added.According to its policy, the company would send their delivery partner to pick up the defective product and refund the money, the police said. "But the duo would collude with the delivery agents who fraudulently marked these orders as 'picked up' on the database and get them a refund in the bank accounts linked with their Amazon accounts," the police said.After the arrest, the UP police has frozen the multiple bank accounts linked to the 99 Amazon accounts of the duo, according to the statement.These frozen bank accounts had Rs 26 lakh in them, the police said, adding further investigation in the case in which the FIR is lodged at Noida's Sector 36 Cyber police station is underway.

The Chief Minister on Monday said the panel would confine the probe to West Bengal.This is the first formal inquiry into allegations that an Indian client of Israel's NSO Group used Pegasus to hack hundreds of phones of opposition leaders, journalists, government officials and even a constitutional authority.“We thought the Centre would form an inquiry commission, or a Supreme Court-monitored probe would be ordered to look into the phone-hacking incident. But the centre is sitting idle... so we decided to form a commission on inquiry' to look into the matter, Banerjee announced at a press conference held in the secretariat (“Nabanna”) in Kolkata.“I hope this small step will wake up others. We want it to start as soon as possible. Many people from Bengal have been tapped”, she said.Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya is a retired Calcutta High Court Chief Justice and Justice Madan Bhimrao Lokur is a former Supreme Court judge.Incidentally, Banerjee, who is leaving Kolkata this afternoon for a four-day trip to Delhi, will also meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi besides meeting various leaders from the anti-BJP camp including NCP leader Sharad Pawar.Banerjee is slated to meet Modi at four in the afternoon tomorrow.

We do not want to say anything but we also have our ears to the ground,” the Bench observed while refusing to entertain the plea.The apex court asked the petitioner to approach the Delhi High Court and seek appropriate remedy.Senior advocate Kailash Vasdev, appearing for the foundation, sought a stay on the prosecution under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.On sensing disinclination of the Bench, the counsel for the Gambhir’s foundation withdrew the petition.The Delhi government’s drug controller had earlier informed the Delhi High Court that Gautam Gambhir Foundation has been found guilty of unauthorisedly stocking, procuring and distributing the Fabiflu medicine to Covid-19 patients.The High Court had deprecated the manner in which a huge quantity of the drug was procured and said genuine patients who needed the medicine at that particular time could not get it as the bulk stock was taken away by cricketer-turned-politician Gambhir.AAP MLA Praveen Kumar has also been found guilty of similar offences under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and action will also be taken against him, the court was informed.The High Court was hearing a PIL seeking lodging of an FIR on the allegations that politicians are able to procure and distribute in huge quantities the Covid-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them.

26-07-2021||New Delhi||By 2025, Covid will have cost world between $16 tn and $35 tn||By 2025, Covid-19 will have cost the world between $16 trillion and $35 trillion, as per McKinsey.The world is unlikely to ever reach global herd immunity, but it can contain the virus with a combination of vaccines, improved testing, and smarter quarantining, based on known outbreaks, rather than large, blunt lockdowns, McKinsey said in a report.Obstacles to worldwide vaccination remain huge: while 49.6 per cent of inhabitants of high-income countries had received at least one dose of the vaccine as of July 14, only 1 per cent of those in low-income countries had.In the next two decades, competition for global influence is likely to reach its highest level since the Cold War. Current tensions are most apparent in the unfolding competition between China and the United States, the homes of 76 of the world's 100 most valuable companies.To manage geopolitical risk, boards should devote time to big-picture questions. Companies also need to think critically about their corporate narratives and decide whether they are global entities or whether ties to a specific country or region are more important, the report said.The report said car sales and production have come roaring back, but today's consumers, suppliers, and dealers demand more digital, connected, and electric vehicles. Automakers will have to hire more software engineers and reskill up to one-quarter of their current workforces.Climate change poses specific risks for urban areas, 90 per cent of which are coastal. By 2050, more than 800 million urban residents could be affected by sea-level rise and coastal flooding. A report cowritten by McKinsey and C40 Cities Climate Leadership, a network of large cities committed to addressing climate change, identifies 15 high-potential actions that can work for many types of cities.Case numbers are resurging in parts of the world where the Covid-19 pandemic was waning, falling in places that saw huge surges recently, and just beginning to rise in previously little-impacted parts of the globe.

26-07-2021||New Delhi||Govt has no plan to print currency notes to tide over economic crisis: Sitharaman||The government has no plan to print currency notes to tide over the current economic crisis triggered by the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament on Monday.To a question on whether there is any plan to print currency to tide over the crisis, the Finance Minister said, “No Sir”.Many economists and experts have suggested the government to resort to printing more currency notes to support the economy ravaged by the spread of Covid-19, and protect jobs.India’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have contracted by 7.3 per cent during 2020-21, Sitharaman said in a written reply to Lok Sabha.This contraction reflects the unparalleled effect of the pandemic and the containment measures that were taken to control the pandemic, she said.“The fundamentals of the economy remain strong as gradual scaling back of lockdowns, along with the astute support of Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission has placed the economy firmly on the path of recovery from the second half of FY 2020-21,” she said.The government had announced a special economic and comprehensive package of Rs 29.87 lakh crore under AtmaNirbhar Bharat (ANB) to combat the impact of the pandemic, to revive economic growth and to bolster employment during 2020-21, she said.The Union Budget 2021-22 announced a number of measures to support broad-based and inclusive economic development including a 34.5 per cent increase in capital expenditure and 137 per cent increase in health expenditure, she said, adding, the government announced a relief package of Rs 6.29 lakh crore in June 2021, to strengthen public health and provide impetus for growth and employment measures.Replying to another question, Sitharaman said, the impact of the second Covid-19 wave is expected to be muted given localised containment measures and rapid upscaling of the vaccination drive.The Union Budget 2021-22, estimates India’s nominal GDP growth at 14.4 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2022.The Reserve Bank of India, in its latest Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) resolution of June 4, 2021, has projected India’s real GDP to grow at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22, after accounting for the impact of the second wave as compared to its earlier projection of 10.5 per cent, she said.In reply to another question, the Finance Minister said the RBI has announced Special three-year Long-Term Repo Operations (SLTRO) of Rs 10,000 crore at repo rate for the Small Finance Banks (SFBs), to be deployed for fresh lending of up to Rs 10 lakh per borrower to provide further support to small business units, micro and small industries, and other unorganised sector entities adversely affected during the current wave of the pandemic.The first auction under the SLTRO was conducted on May 17, 2021, she said, adding, the unutilised portion of notified Rs 10,000 crore is being carried forward in each subsequent auction, until fully utilised or till the last auction to be conducted in October 2021, whichever is earlier.Three auctions under this scheme have been conducted so far, and SFBs have availed a total amount of Rs 1,640 crore under the scheme, she added.

26-07-2021||New Delhi||Top ED officer, Kejriwal's aide, PMO, NITI Aayog officials in Pegasus list||Rajeshwar Singh, a senior Enforcement Directorate officer who led several high-profile investigations conducted by his agency, was selected as a probable target for surveillance by an Indian client of the Israeli spyware firm NSO Group, an investigation of leaked data by The Wire and its media partners on the Pegasus Project has revealed.The database accessed by French non-profit Forbidden Stories and shared with the project's media consortium, included not only two of Singh's numbers but four numbers belonging to three women from his family, implying they too were likely targets.V.K. Jain, a former Indian Administrative Service officer who worked as a personal assistant to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, also appears to have marked as a person of interest. In addition, the leaked records contain details of the numbers of at least one official each from the PMO and NITI Aayog, The Wire said.Singh, a provincial police service officer (PPS) from Uttar Pradesh, has been with the ED since 2009, during which he had served on the investigation of several sensitive cases such as the 2G spectrum scam and the Aircel-Maxis matter. He has also been involved in the probes into the Sahara group and the disproportionate assets case of Andhra chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy.His run in the database stretches from late 2017 to mid-2019, which is around the time when the leaked data itself tapers off. His second number appears to have been of interest from the spring of 2018 onward. This is also when two numbers registered to his wife are added, as are the numbers of his two sisters, one of whom, Abha Singh, is an Indian Administrative Service officer-turned-lawyer based in Mumbai.The Pegasus Project list also includes the phone number used by V.K. Jain, who was appointed as chief consultant at Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's office.Jain's phone number appears in the leaked records in 2018, when, according to sources in the Delhi government, he handled the most significant files of the state government. As Kejriwal's primary aide during his first full term, Jain is closely tied to implementation of the chief minister's most prized welfare programmes like improving school education and health infrastructure in the city-state.Significantly, his phone number appears in the records soon after he was questioned by the Delhi Police in connection with the alleged assault on Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash by two Aam Aadmi Party legislators in February 2018. The incident occurred during a meeting between AAP leaders and Prakash over the issue of 'Door Step Delivery of Ration' and the slow processing of files. While Prakash registered an FIR over the alleged assault, the AAP legislators denied the charge, The Wire said.The leaked records indicate that the telephone number of a senior employee of the NITI Aayog - the Union government's policy think-tank - was also included as a probable target for surveillance. The Wire verified the number and spoke to the person involved but is withholding their identity at their request as they are no longer working at the government body.An officer who is currently an under secretary in the Prime Minister's Office was also selected for potential surveillance in 2017, the leaked records show. He was in charge of Prime Minister Modi's tours in 2017 when the Indian client of the NSO Group showed interest in him, The Wire said.

They have to investigate, collect material and then proceed as per law. Ultimately, it is the investigation which will be done. Report cannot be the basis of your prosecution,” a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna said.The bench said this during the hearing after an advocate, appearing for one of the accused, requested that the committee's report be shared with them as the CBI had relied heavily on it.“Nothing will turn on the report. The report is only initial information. Ultimately, the CBI will conduct investigation which will have the consequences,” the bench said.The espionage case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India's space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.The CBI, in its probe, had said that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan's illegal arrest.The case also had its political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then chief minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation.Over a period of almost two-and-a-half years, the panel headed by Justice Jain examined the circumstances leading to the arrest.

For this, a website, rashtragan.in, too has been created.The PM urged the people to keep encouraging and supporting Indian athletes participating in the Tokyo Olympics.The PM also spoke of a number of individuals and local developments brought about by groups of people that have made positive contributions to society.He lauded Sanjay Rana, who runs a food stall in Sector 29 of Chandigarh, for serving “Chole Bhature” free of cost to those who took Covid-19 vaccine. He referred to Sanjay’s gesture in the context of how an individual could contribute to national building even by small acts.Besides, a Tirupati youth was praised by the PM for his efforts to help farmers by providing weather-related information in the local language.A software engineer, B Sai Praneeth (24), who calls himself the ‘AP weatherman’, observed that due to inclement weather, farmers of his area had to suffer huge losses. He had keen interest in meteorology for the past many years and hence he decided to use his passion and his talent for the welfare of farmers, Modi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-talks-about-amrit-mahotsav-288362

26-07-2021||Ajay Banerjee||No consensus on LAC pullback sequence||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 25More than 15 months into the military stand-off in eastern Ladakh, the deadlock persists as India and China are not agreeable on the sequence of pulling back troops.Sticking pointKargil Vijay Diwas todayHUMBLED BY SACRIFICESI pay tribute to the bravehearts who fought for and defended the sovereignty and integrity of our great nation. I am humbled by the sacrifices of our families that unflinchingly sent their loved ones into battle. On this day, let us rededicate ourselves to be resilient and fearless in the face of adversity. - Gen MM Naravane, Chief of Army StaffSalute to braveheartsThe Kargil war is a symbol of the valour and discipline of our armed forces, which the entire world has witnessed. This time, this glorious day will be celebrated in the middle of ‘Amrit Mahotsav’. That’s why it becomes even more special... Let us all salute the bravehearts of Kargil. - Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterBoth sides have around 75,000 troops lined up on either side of the 832-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. India wants a three-step process to be followed. The first step being disengagement from areas where troops are within close proximity. The next two steps — de-escalation and de-induction —would entail pulling back troops and equipment to the pre-April 2020 home bases.Commanders of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) want that “de-escalation and de-induction” should take place first. The troops in close proximity can “disengage” thereafter, sources say.Indian side sees a red flag in the sequence suggested by China. The terrain of Tibetan plateau is flat on the Chinese side, which means the PLA can induct troops quite rapidly. In some cases, it may take less than 8-10 hours by road or rail.In case of India, the two roads leading to Ladakh (one via Srinagar-Zojila and the other via Manali) remain closed due to snow for around seven months in a year. For India, the terrain does not allow rapid induction as several high passes, which get snowbound from October, can hold back even the infantry. Senior military commanders (Lt Gen-level) of either side last met on April 9. Since then, the dates and agenda for the next round of talks are being firmed up. PLA’s insistence on its own sequence of pullback is the stumbling block. Negotiations will take some time, sources say. On February 10, troops of either side started “disengagement” along the banks of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake. Following disengagement from that area, the process remains stalled.The present position of troops from both sides is not face-to-face, but they are within the striking range from where rapid redeployment is possible. There have been no face-offs and no escalation since February. Both sides remain in touch. “We continue to hold dialogue,” sources maintain.There have 1,450 contacts made through either the phone or physical meetings at designated meeting points at Daulat Baig Oldie and Chusul, sources say. A hotline exists between these points, they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-consensus-on-lac-pullback-sequence-288346

Who paid for it? Does our country have the capacity to spend so much on spying?It’s the death of freedom. - Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena MPDespite the serious nature of allegations, the Union Government had not cared to probe into it but “made only a hopeful hope that the time tested processes in our country were well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance did not occur,” Brittas said in a statement on Sunday. “Therefore, the queries were raised in the Indian Parliament with respect to this leakage. But the government has neither denied nor admitted the snooping by the spyware,” Brittas said, adding the allegations led to two inferences—either snooping was done by the government or by a foreign agency.Maintaining that the snooping allegations had caused concern among a large section of people, he said the scandal would have a chilling effect on free speech and expression.The government maintained that illegal surveillance was not possible with checks and balances in the country’s laws. Attempts were being made to malign the Indian democracy, it alleged.IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told the Lok Sabha on July 19 that reports on alleged snooping published on the eve of the monsoon session of Parliament “cannot be a coincidence”. There was “no substance” behind the sensationalism, he said.This is the second petition filed in the top court on the issue. Alleging that Pegasus snooping controversy was the biggest crime committed by the ruling party for political vested interests, Delhi-based advocate ML Sharma had on July 22 filed a PIL in the top court demanding a court-monitored SIT probe into it.Sharma, who has filed dozens of PILs on controversial issues, claimed the snooping controversy was an attack on Indian democracy and involved issues concerning national security and judicial independence.Made by the Israeli software firm NSO Group, Pegasus is said to be capable of infecting smartphones without users’ knowledge and accessing all their data.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-mp-john-brittas-moves-sc-demands-judicial-probe-288353

But they left no doubt that if the US raised issues relating to human rights, it would get a response. Talking diplomatically, sources here said, “issues such as human rights and democracy are universal and extend beyond a particular national or cultural perspective”. “India is proud of its achievements in both domains and is always glad to share experiences,” they added.In a pointed reference to the past of some western democracies that are now using human rights as a tool in diplomacy, the sources said, “As a long-standing pluralistic society, India is open to engaging those who now recognise the value of diversity.”But for these brief sparks, Blinken’s visit marks an increased tempo of high-level interactions. Discussions on deepening the Quad engagement will be a key focus area of his talks and he could announce another meeting of Quad Foreign Ministers later this year.This will be Blinken’s first visit after assuming office and reciprocates the visit by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to the US in May. The two leaders had also met on the sidelines of the G7 and G20 meetings.With thousands of students waiting to rejoin courses in the US, the sources said India would press for gradual resumption of international travel, while maintaining health protocols. While tourists can wait, the MEA would especially press for easing mobility curbs for five broad categories — students, professionals, business travellers, family reunions and humanitarian cases.Binken in his talks will cover sale of defence equipment and transfer of defence technologies but these will be covered in greater detail during the fourth 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in the US later this year.Talks on the security situation will cover the all important Af-Pak region. The implications of withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, and the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan on terror financing and terror havens, will be part of the agenda. The sides will exchange their assessments about the Indo-Pacific region, economic slowdown and the latest developments in West Asia and Central Asia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/human-rights-blip-on-deepening-indo-us-ties-during-blinken-visit-288360

The announcement cements her role as a national opposition leader with potential for non-BJP forces to rally behind the TMC in the wake of the party’s decisive victory against the saffron family in West Bengal elections this May.Apart from her official meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and likely with President Ram Nath Kovind, Mamata is also expected to engage opposition stalwarts Congress president Sonia Gandhi and NCP chief Sharad Pawar with a proposal to work together against BJP policies in “national interest”.Sources say the background for Mamata’s Delhi visit has been prepared in advance and the objective is to create an understanding between non-NDA forces on common issues of concern, including Pegasus snooping row, farm legislations, inflation and economic crisis. A precursor to that was seen earlier this week when several opposition stalwarts, including Pawar and Congress’ P Chidambaram, attended a TMC convention she virtually addressed in Delhi.Mamata’s former election adviser Prashant Kishor earlier met Sharad Pawar to strike a basic understanding on the emergence of an alternative opposition pole under Mamata Banerjee, with Pawar in a larger role.There is, however, an understanding within the TMC and the NCP that no purposeful opposition unity can be achieved without a meaningful truck with the Congress, which, despite all its electoral setbacks, remains the principal opposition party with the highest number of Lok Sabha MPs and a presence in every state.The first point of contention going forward would be the issue of UPA presidency, which has been debated for a while with a section of the opposition, especially the Shiv Sena, openly batting for Pawar as chairperson.“It remains to be seen how Sonia Gandhi responds to any proposition of opposition solidarity where her son Rahul Gandhi does not command a dominant position. The stance Congress president takes would be key to determining the design of any future anti-BJP group notwithstanding what Mamata and Pawar combine have in mind about the possible reconfiguration of non-NDA forces. What is, however, clear is — Mamata is arriving on the national stage, and soon,” said a senior opposition leader.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eyeing-bigger-role-mamatas-5-day-delhi-visit-from-today-288361

The World Heritage Committee has announced the inclusion of the 13th century Ramappa Temple at Palampet to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has congratulated the people of Telangana for this great honour, which has been backed by 17 countries supporting the claim to ensure the Ramappa Temple get a distinctive spot in world heritage. Excellent! Congratulations to everyone, specially the people of Telangana. The iconic Ramappa Temple showcases the outstanding craftsmanship of great Kakatiya dynasty. I would urge you all to visit this majestic Temple complex and get a first-hand experience of it’s grandness. https://t.co/muNhX49l9J pic.twitter.com/XMrAWJJao2  Norway is believed to have opposed the inscription, while Russia led an effort to get the issue through, and it succeeded. India sought the support of 24 countries whose representatives were to vote on the proposal to inscribe Ramappa Temple on the World Heritage Committee. The countries that backed India’s claim included Ethiopia, Oman, Brazil, Egypt, Spain, Thailand, Hungary, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Earlier, the ‘Glorious Kakatiya Temples and Gateways – Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple, Palampet’ examination as a World Heritage Site nomination was deferred in the agenda papers.  According to information available here, The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) cited nine shortcomings at the site after the initial visit in 2019, but on Sunday, a majority veered round to India’s view about the site’s outstanding universal value.  As per the claim staked by India, “The temple is a savvy blend of technological know-how and materials. The foundation is built on sandbox technology; the flooring is granite, the pillars basalt, the lower part of the temple red sandstone, and the white gopuram is built with light bricks that reportedly float in water. An inscription dates the temple to 1135 Samvat-Saka on the eighth day of Magha (January 12, 1214).”  The priests serving at the temple say, “Some of the iconographies on the temple were damaged during the invasion of Malik Kafur in 1310. Treasure hunters vandalised the rest. But the biggest test for the temple was an earthquake in the 17th century (one of the biggest quakes was the 7.7-8.2-magnitude on June 16, 1819). The flooring was rocked by the waves, while the pillars and the vertical structure stayed intact due to sandbox technology.”The Archaeological Survey of India team that visited the site a few years ago had reported that the pillars had sunk between 1 ft and 1.5 feet over the years. Built by Racherla Senapati Rudrayya, a general of Kakatiya king Ganapatideva, in the 13th century, the main temple is flanked by the collapsed structures of Kateshwarayya and Kameshwarayya temples in Palampet, 220 km from Hyderabad. Telangana IT Minister KT Rama Rao (KTR) tweeted to say, “Happy to share the good news that the 800-year-old Kakatiya Rudreshwara #RamappaTemple in #Telangana has been inscribed as a UNESCO #WorldHeritage Site My compliments to everyone who was involved in the effort.”Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao has hailed the decision of UNESCO to recognise the historical Ramappa Temple of Palampeta in Mulugu District as the World Heritage Site.The spiritual and cultural property developed by the Kakatiya Kings with a tremendous creativity, sculptural value has a very special place in the country’s cultural heritage.He said under self-governance the state government is making all efforts to revive and restore the historical, spiritual and proud cultural heritage of Telangana.The CM thanked UNESCO member nations, Central Government for its support. He congratulated Telangana public representatives and officials for working to get world Heritage status to the Ramappa Temple built by Kakatiya Recherla Rudrudu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramappa-temple-in-telangana-gets-unesco-heritage-tag-288141

Hence, to tap 300 phones, six to seven licenses are required, the Rajya Sabha member said."Was so much money spent? Who paid for it? The NSO says it sells its software only to governments. If it is so, which government in India purchased the software? Rs 300 crore were spent for spying on 300 people in India. Does our country have the capacity to spend so much money on spying?" Raut asked.He also said BJP leader (and former Union IT minister) Ravishankar Prasad had justified spying by saying 45 countries in the world used Pegasus.Raut, whose party shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra, claimed that journalists who criticised the Modi government were snooping targets.An international media consortium had recently reported that several verified mobile phone numbers, including of some ministers, journalists, opposition leaders, and scores of business persons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking using Pegasus software/spyware.The government has, however, dismissed allegations of any kind of surveillance on its part on specific people, saying it "has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever" PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-funded-pegasus-snooping-asks-raut-compares-it-with-hiroshima-bombing-288092

Satara, Sangli, Pune, Kolhapur, Thane and Sindhudurg, also affected by rains, were provided with a financial aid of Rs 50 lakh each, the statement said.Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray visited Chiplun, the site of severe flooding, and interacted with residents, businessmen and shopkeepers. He promised them all help from the state government to restore normalcy in the area.Thackeray said they will require “central assistance for long-term mitigation measures”, and added that he will tour western Maharashtra on Monday and comprehensive data of the extent of damages will be prepared.Heavy rains earlier this week triggered landslides in some areas of Maharashtra including the deadliest one at Taliye village in the Raigad district.

Questioned about a Dalit Chief Minister replacing him, Yediyurappa said, "I'm not the one to decide about it, it is for the high command to decide.Let's first see what decision they will take today..." Asked whether he was satisfied with his work for two years, he said, "if you are satisfied that's enough for me."Indicating that Monday might be his last day in office, Yediyurappa had recently said that based on the instructions that the central leaders will give him on July 25, he will get on with "his work" from July 26.His government will complete two years in office on July 26.Meanwhile, scores of pontiffs are expected to participate in a "mega conclave" to be held here on Sunday, coinciding with the possible decision by the BJP central leadership on his exit.Dingaleshwar Swamiji of Balehosur mutt, who had held a press meet here on July 23 to inform about the conclave with other Swamijis, had refused to connect the event directly with the possible leadership change, but it is being widely seen as an attempt to muster support to Yediyurappa and send out a message.Yediyurappa is in flood and rain ravaged Belagavi district to review the relief and rescue operation there.Noting that he will be visiting people affected by rains and floods, the Chief Minister said after visiting some affected villages and analysing the situation there, he will be heading back to Bengaluru."By the god's grace, rains have receded both yesterday and today and if the situation continues in the same way for the next couple of days, I'm confident that things will come under control," he said, adding that rains receding in Maharashtra are a good sign.
