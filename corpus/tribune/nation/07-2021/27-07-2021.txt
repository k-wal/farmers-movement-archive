27-07-2021||New Delhi||Tourism economy fell by 42.8 pc, estimated 14.5 million jobs were lost in Q1 of 2020-21: Govt||Tourism economy fell by nearly 43 per cent and an estimated 14.5 million jobs were lost in the first quarter of 2020-21 as the Covid-19 pandemic and resultant lockdown decimated the sector which directly employed 34.8 million people in the country the year before, according to details provided by the government in Parliament.The situation improved slightly in the second and third quarters of 2020-21.In a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, Tourism Minister G Kishan Reddy said, “As per the results of the study conducted by National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), due to the overall economic slowdown during 2020-21, tourism economy or tourism direct gross value added (TDGVA) saw a fall of 42.8 % in Q1; 15.5 % in Q2 and fall of 1.1 % in Q3.”He also said due to a significant drop in tourist arrivals and hence tourism expenditure during the pandemic, it is estimated that TDGVA plummeted by as much as 93.3 per cent in Q1 of 2020-21 over its level in the same quarter of previous year.“It picked up slightly to post a fall of 79.5 per cent in Q2 and that of 64.3 per cent in Q3. A significant number of jobs were lost in the tourism sector once the lockdown was implemented. 14.5 million Jobs during Q1, 5.2 million during Q2 and 1.8 million jobs during Q3 are expected to have been lost as compared to estimated 34.8 million jobs in the pre-pandemic period of 2019-20 (direct jobs),” Reddy informed the House.

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Expert panel recommends nod to SII for phase 2/3 trials of Covovax on children aged 2-17||An expert panel of India’s Central Drug Authority on Tuesday recommended granting permission to Serum Institute of India (SII) for conducting phase 2/3 trials of Covovax on children aged 2 to 17 years with certain conditions, official sources said.The trials would cover 920 children, 460 each in the age-group of 12-17 and 2-11 across 10 sites.“The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) deliberated on the revised study protocol application given by SII on Tuesday and recommended granting permission to the firm for conducting phase 2/3 trial of Covovax on children aged 2 to 17 years,” a source said.The Pune-based pharmaceutical company had submitted a revised protocol for inclusion of paediatric cohort in the ongoing Covovax phase 2 and 3 observer-blind, randomised, controlled study in Indian adults aged 18 years and above to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the jab.In the revised application submitted last week, SII director (government and regulatory affairs) Prakash Kumar Singh and director Dr Prasad Kulkarni stated that globally, all adults aged 18 and above are being vaccinated and after this population is protected against Covid-l9, children will remain the most susceptible group.“There have been reports of severe disease, including deaths in vulnerable children. It has also been predicted that the third wave of the pandemic may affect children in the country.“Moreover, until all age groups, including children are covered under vaccination, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may remain in circulation, thus keeping everyone at risk of severe disease,” they said in the letter.Considering all these factors, several companies have already started evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of Covid-19 vaccines in the paediatric population, the SII has stated.The SII is learnt to have informed that their collaborator, Novavax, Inc., US has already generated a large amount of data in adults in different countries and that the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity data on the Novavax Covid-I9 vaccine are very robust which includes a safety database of more than 50,000 adults with data from Australia, South Africa, UK and USA and preliminary safety data in 2,248 children.“Further in the ongoing Phase 2/3 study in India, more than 1400 participants have received at least first dose of the vaccine with no safety concerns reported so far,” the application stated.“This will ensure that a life-saving vaccine can be brought at the earliest for our paediatric population also in addition to the adult population immediately after grant of Emergency Use Authorisation.“This approval will ensure an early availability of Covid-19 vaccine for children of our country in line with our prime minister’s clarion call of Atmanirbhar Bharat and will help in faster elimination of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Singh mentioned in the application.   The SEC on June 30 had recommended against granting permission to SII for conducting phase 2 and 3 trial of Covovax on children aged 2 to 17 years following which the company had submitted a revised study protocol last week.In August 2020, US-based vaccine maker Novavax, Inc had announced a licence agreement with SII for the development and commercialisation of NVX-CoV2373, its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, in low and middle-income countries and India.

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus scandal: Questions over Mamata’s Commission of Inquiry||As the West Bengal government sets up a commission of inquiry led by former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur to look into alleged snooping on politicians, journalists and activists, legal experts are divided over the necessary legal backing of the decision.The West Bengal government notification on Monday said the snooping on eminent personalities involved “a potential threat to breach of state secrets, jeopardising law and order situation in the state and breach of privacy of the above class of citizens”.The notification attempts to bring it within the ambit of public order under Entry 1 of List II in the Seventh Schedule.However, Entry 31 of List I of the Seventh Schedule lists “Posts and telegraphs; telephones, wireless, broadcasting and other like forms of communication” as subjects meant for the Union.Senior advocate Vikas Singh said Pegasus snooping was very much covered under “public order” as the term has wider connotation.“In fact the Supreme Court should take suo motu cognisance of the matter and order a probe as right to privacy was declared a fundamental right by the court itself. Now that a petition has been filed, the court must look into the matter,” Singh said.However, Supreme Court advocate and cyber law expert Virag Gupta said digital surveillance has two aspects – Information Technology Act which falls within the Union’s domain and “public order” which is covered in Entry 1 in List II of the Seventh Schedule. There appears to be a conflict which needs to be resolved.”Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 simply says, “The appropriate government may, if it is of opinion that it is necessary so to do…”It means both the Centre and states can institute an inquiry under the Act.However, Section 2(a) says “appropriate government” means— (i) the Central Government, in relation to a Commission appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List I or List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution; and (ii) the State Government, in relation to a Commission appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.A reading of Section 2(a) of the Act gives an impression that a state government can’t set up a commission of inquiry to look into a subject enumerated in the Union List.Since the entire controversy surrounds possible tapping/monitoring of phones of politicians, journalists and activists, a state government’s claim to have jurisdiction over the issue entirely depends upon its ability to prove that the subject is covered under the expression “public order”.According to the Act, if the Central government has ordered such an inquiry, “no state government shall, except with the approval of the Central government, appoint another commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the commission appointed by the Central government is functioning.”Similarly, if a state government has ordered an inquiry, “the Central government shall not appoint another commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the commission appointed by the state government is functioning, unless the Central government is of opinion that the scope of the inquiry should be extended to two or more states”.However, this is aimed at avoiding any possible conflict with regard to subjects listed in the Concurrent List on which both are entitled to set up commissions of inquiry.Section 3(1)(b) says if the Central government is of opinion that the scope of the inquiry should be extended to two or more states, it can set up a Commission of Inquiry overriding the one appointed by a state government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-scandal-questions-over-mamatas-commission-of-inquiry-289060
27-07-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus Scandal: Noted journalist N Ram moves SC for judge-led probe||Noted journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court seeking a judge-led independent investigation into alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians and journalists by using Israeli spyware Pegasus.Terming the allegations as an attempt by government agencies to muzzle free speech dissent in India, the petitioners sought a direction to the Centre to disclose if the government or any of its agencies obtained licence for Pegasus spyware and used it, either directly or indirectly, to conduct surveillance in any manner.The petition—expected to be taken up later this week—demanded an independent probe by a sitting or retired judge of the Supreme Court into the alleged hacking of phones using the Pegasus spyware.“The targeted surveillance using military-grade spyware is an unacceptable violation of the right to privacy which has been held to be a fundamental right under Articles 14 (equality before the law), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) by the Supreme Court,” it submitted.The hacking of phones belonging to journalists, doctors, lawyers, activists, ministers and opposition politicians “seriously compromises” the effective exercise of the fundamental right to free speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the petitioners said, adding it had an obvious “chilling effect” on expression by threatening invasion into the most core and private aspects of a person’s life.“The attack prima facie constitutes an act of cyber-terrorism that has several grave political and security ramifications, especially considering that the devices of government ministers, senior political figures and constitutional functionaries which may contain sensitive information have been targeted,” they said.Investigations involving several leading publications around the world revealed that more than 142 Indians, including journalists, lawyers, ministers, opposition politicians, and activists, have been identified as potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus software, the petitioners alleged.Forensic analysis by the Security Lab of Amnesty International of several mobile phones, belonging to people targeted for surveillance, has confirmed Pegasus-induced security breaches, the petitioners submitted.They said the hacking of phones using the Pegasus spyware constituted a criminal offence punishable under Sections 66 (computer related offences), 66B (punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource or communication device), 66E (punishment for violation of privacy) and 66F (punishment for cyberterrorism) of the IT Act, punishable with imprisonment and/or fine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-scandal-noted-journalist-n-ram-moves-sc-for-judge-led-probe-289058
27-07-2021||New Delhi||Won’t take elitist view of banning beggars from streets, says SC on plea for their rehab amid Covid-19||The Supreme Court on Tuesday made clear it will not take an “elitist view” that no beggars be allowed on the streets and asked the Centre and Delhi government to respond to a plea seeking vaccination and rehabilitation of beggars and vagabonds in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The apex court, which observed that a large number of people including children are compelled to be on the streets to beg due to absence of education and employment, said this is a “socio-economic issue”.A Bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah told the counsel appearing for the petitioner that it would not consider one part of the prayer which sought a direction to the authorities to restrain beggars and vagabonds from begging on traffic junctions, markets and public places to avoid spread of Covid-19 pandemic in all the states and Union Territories (UTs) across India.The Bench said it would issue notices to the Centre and Delhi government seeking their responses on the plea for direction to the authorities for rehabilitation of beggars and to ensure that food, shelter and basic medical amenities including Covid-19 vaccination are provided to them amid the pandemic.“As the Supreme Court, we would not want to take an elitist view that no beggars should be there on the streets,” the Bench said during the hearing.While referring to a part of the prayer made in the plea, the Bench said it is seeking to restrain people from begging on the streets.“This is a socio-economic problem of poverty. The idea is to rehabilitate them, give them and their children education,” it said, adding that such people have no choice and nobody wants to beg.The Bench said it is a “wider issue” of social welfare policy of the government and the apex court cannot say that such persons should be kept away from our eyes.“This is a socio-economic issue and cannot be remedied by a direction of the nature that is sought in prayer (a). This is a human problem which has to be redressed by the welfare State in a manner which accords with Part III and IV of the Constitution,” the Bench said in its order.The counsel appearing for the petitioner said the object and purport of the prayer is to seek a direction to the authorities for rehabilitation of those who are compelled to be on the streets to eke out their livelihood by pursuing avocations such as begging.The counsel, while referring to the pandemic, said there is an urgent need to ensure that vaccination programme includes them like all other citizens.“Since the first part of prayer (a) is not pressed before this court, we are inclined to issue notice,” the Bench said, adding that petitioner shall amend the prayer accordingly.The Bench asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to assist it in the matter and posted it for hearing on August 10.“Since the immediate issue which needs to be attended is that of vaccinating the persons to whom the petition relates and to ensure the due provision of medical facilities in the Covid-19 pandemic, we would expect a response from the Union of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi on what steps are being taken to deal with this human concern,” it said.At the outset, the petitioner’s counsel told the Bench that issue raised in the plea is regarding rehabilitation of beggars as the impending third wave of Covid-19 pandemic poses a serious threat.The Bench noted that it has indicated to the petitioner’s counsel that it is not inclined to countenance a prayer seeking directions to restrain beggars and vagabonds from the streets.

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Raj Kundra earned Rs 1.17 crore from 'porn' app in five months, cops tell court||Raj Kundra earned at least Rs 1.17 crore between August and December last year from his business of production and online distribution of porn films, Mumbai Police told a court on Tuesday, seeking another extension of his custody.The magistrate's court, however, remanded Kundra (45), who is married to Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty, in judicial custody for 14 days. The Bombay High Court, meanwhile, refused to give him any urgent temporary relief."Interrogation of Ryan Thorpe, another accused in the case, revealed that revenue from Hotshots (an online app or platform through which alleged porn content was made available) was Rs 1, 17, 64,886 (USD 1,58,057) between August and December 2020," the remand plea of the police said.This revenue was earned from the app on Apple Store and the police have sought information from Google too, it said. The app had more users on Google Play than the Apple Store before it was removed, so he must have earned much more revenue, the police claimed.The investigators also wanted to scrutinize the documents recovered from nine files seized from Kundra's office during a search on July 24, the remand application said.While the statement of a woman (who alleged that she was tricked into acting in a porn film) was recorded on July 26, more victims were likely to come forward, the police told the court.But the court, which had granted one extension of the custody earlier, rejected the police's plea and sent Kundra in judicial custody for 14 days.His lawyers Abad Ponda and Subhash Jadhav then filed a bail application, contending that he should be released as investigation was over. The application will be heard in due course.Kundra was arrested on July 19 by the Mumbai police's crime branch. He had plans to sell 119 adult films to a person for USD 1.2 million, the police had claimed during an earlier remand hearing.The Bombay High Court on Tuesday refused to give urgent relief to Kundra.Justice A S Gadkari directed the police to file their reply by July 29 in response to a petition filed by Kundra challenging his arrest.His lawyers argued that the police failed to follow the procedure. They should have first issued a notice to him, asking him to be present to record a statement, instead of arresting him directly, advocates Ponda and Jadhav said.Prosecutor Aruna Kamat Pai said a notice was issued to him. The HC asked Pai to file an affidavit but refused to give an interim relief to Kundra before hearing the police.Kundra has also contended that the films made by him which the police claimed to be pornographic did not depict direct or explicit sexual acts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raj-kundra-earned-rs-1-17-crore-from-porn-app-in-five-months-cops-tell-court-289046

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Naresh Goyal, Ajay Singh, Prashant Ruia among potential Pegasus spyware targets: Report||The potential targets of Israeli spyware Pegasus included former chairman of Jet Airways Naresh Goyal, SpiceJet managing director Ajay Singh and the Essar Group's Prashant Ruia, according to the latest list of names released by The Wire.The leaked list that has been analysed by media partners of the Pegasus Project consortium reporting on the issue also includes numbers belonging to Rajeshwar Singh, a senior Enforcement Directorate officer, and V K Jain, a former Indian Administrative Service officer who worked as a personal assistant to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.In addition, the leaked records contain details of the numbers of at least one official each from the PMO and NITI Aayog, The Wire said.Last week, an international media consortium reported that over 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including those of two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders besides scores of business persons and activists in India, could have been targeted for hacking through the Pegasus spyware of the NSO Group.The government has been denying all Opposition allegations in the matter.Apart from Goyal, Ajay Singh and Ruia, ex-chief at GAIL India B C Tripathi was also on the list of potential surveillance targets, The Wire reported.The list also includes Vikram Kothari of Rotomac Pens, his son Rahul, and C Sivasankaran, former Aircel promoter, the report said.There are at least three business executives, working in big corporate houses, who are also on the list, it said.The potential surveillance targets include a mid-level official at the Adani Group, one individual who used to work with the Essar Group and another formerly with SpiceJet, The Wire said.V Balasubramanian, long-time associated with Reliance Industries, and A N Sethuraman of Reliance ADA Group, are on the list of potential spying targets, it said.Two numbers, one for a former boss of Life Insurance Corporation of India and the other for a former executive director of the Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertiliser Corporation also appear on the list, The Wire said.The leaked list also contains at least five corporate executives associated with India's mutual fund industry, including professionals from companies such as Franklin Templeton, DSP BlackRock and Motilal Oswal.The report said that the leaked database analysed by the Pegasus Project contains several hundred numbers from India – believed to be persons of interest to an unknown government client of the NSO Group that is focused on India – and includes some whose associated smartphones were found to have had traces of the Israeli spyware as per a forensic analysis conducted by Amnesty International's Security Lab.NSO Group, which sells Pegasus to select governments, says the company and its clients are not connected to the database in any way. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naresh-goyal-ajay-singh-prashant-ruia-among-potential-pegasus-spyware-targets-report-289039
27-07-2021||Singapore||Two Indians in Singapore jailed for submitting wrong educational qualification for obtaining work passes||Two Indian nationals were on Tuesday jailed for declaring false educational qualification from an Indian university in their applications for obtaining work passes in Singapore.Bailwal Sunil Dutt was sentenced to one week in jail, while Sutradhar Bijoy got four weeks, The Straits Times reported.The Ministry Of Manpower (MOM), which received their work pass applications, said their work passes have been revoked and they have been permanently barred from working in Singapore.Another Indian work pass holder, Bhandare Raghavendra, has also been charged for the same offence and is required to appear in court on August 5.According to the MOM, the three men had declared qualification from Indian Manav Bharti University (MBU) in their applications submitted in February this year.They were among 23 foreigners investigated for the offence. Of the remaining 20 individuals, 19 have also been permanently barred from future employment in Singapore, while further investigation is underway for one person.While MOM conducts checks on qualifications, "it is difficult to detect institutions such as MBU, which are approved by the foreign government's authorities and issuing genuine degrees while selling fakes," a ministry spokesperson said."Nevertheless, MOM regularly reviews and strengthens measures to maintain the integrity of the work pass framework," the spokesman said, adding that firm action would be taken against the offenders.Individuals, who provide false declarations, face a fine of up to SGD 20,000 (USD 14,714) and up to two years in jail.In the past five years, the ministry has detected and permanently barred an average of 660 foreigners for a year from working in Singapore for submitting fake educational qualifications in work pass applications, the MOM said in its statement.In the same period, an average of eight foreigners a year were prosecuted for such offences.Employers have the primary responsibility to ensure that qualifications provided by potential employees are genuine, it said."Before hiring, the employer should have already evaluated the candidates... to ensure that they have the right skills and qualification for the position they applied for," the Singapore daily quoted the MOM as saying. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-indians-in-singapore-jailed-for-submitting-wrong-educational-qualification-for-obtaining-work-passes-289035

27-07-2021||---||Ready to cede land if law demands, otherwise not allow even an inch to be encroached: Assam CM Hemant Biswa Sarma||Silchar, July 27Assam will abide by any law enacted by Parliament that makes it even cede its land to another state but till then it will not allow even an "inch to be encroached upon", Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma asserted on Tuesday amid border tensions with Mizoram.Sarma's comments came a day after six Assamese people, including five police personnel and a civilian, were killed and over 50 injured in border clashes with Mizoram.He also said Assam will move the Supreme Court seeking protection of Innerline Forest Reserve from destruction and encroachment and deploy three commando battalions in Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi districts bordering Mizoram to strengthen security."It is the responsibility of the Centre to define the boundary and we will abide by it...if tomorrow the Parliament enacts a law by which our land can be given to another state, we will do so but till then we will protect our constitutional boundary," he told a press conference here after paying floral tributes to the slain personnel.He also visited the Silchar Medical College and Hospital and met police personnel injured in the attack.Assam has declared a three-day state mourning following the incident.Assam, he said, will behave responsibly under all circumstances, and even under provocation, will not fire back at civilians."We hope that the Mizos regret that they have fired at fellow countrymen but we are leaving it to their wisdom and conscience. This is a dispute between two states and not a fight between countries. But the video evidence that we have of the Mizo forces celebrating after attacking our people has saddened and hurt us," he said.The chief minister said that satellite images have shown that roads are being constructed and forests cleared for jhum cultivation which cannot be allowed."We will move the Supreme Court to ensure that the forests are protected," he said.Jhum cultivation is a farming activity where farmland is cleared of trees and other vegetation and then set on fire.The practice is followed in most states of the northeast."The dispute is not regarding land but encroachment of reserved forests is the issue. We have no settlements in the forest areas and, if Mizoram can give evidence, we will immediately carry out eviction," he said.The chief minister asserted that not an inch of Assam's land could be encroached by the neighbouring state."People have sacrificed their lives but the boundary has been protected which we will continue to do at any cost. There is a very strong deployment of police inside our border and not an inch of land will be allowed to be encroached upon," he asserted.Sarma said after he took office in May, he had spoken to Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga and suggested that both the states should maintain status quo. The Mizoram CM had agreed but insisted that chief secretary-level talks should continue, he said.On July 8, chief secretary-level talks were held in New Delhi under the aegis of the union home secretary but the Mizoram official refused to accept the satellite images for maintaining status quo and refused to sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), he alleged. The chief minister said in the last few months several attempts were made to encroach Assam's land in Hailakandi, Karimganj and Cachar districts in five sectors and the police foiled each attempt. "On July 25, Cachar DFO gave a report that a road was being constructed inside the Inner Line Forest, and when our deputy commissioner, IGP and DIG rushed to the spot, the next day they found that not only a road but a police post had also been set up in the forest," he said.The Kolasib Superintendent of Police was asked to remove the post, and while talks were going on to find a peaceful solution, Sarma alleged, "Mizoram police along with civilians began pelting stones, opened fire and later started firing from LMGs from top of a hill which continued for 30 to 35 minutes".He said as the firing was on he spoke to Zoramthanga six times, asking him to control the situation "but he just said that he was sorry"."I even told him that I was ready to go to Aizawl to ensure that the status quo is maintained but he simply kept apologising," Sarma said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to two chief ministers three times on Monday, Sarma said.The Assam chief minister said Shah called him up even on Tuesday to inquire about the situation at the inter-state border.When asked if the problem could have been resolved as constituents of NEDA, the northeastern version of the NDA, were ruling the two states, Sarma shot back, saying, "This is not a political issue but a long-standing boundary dispute.Earlier, there were Congress governments in both the states.Was the problem resolved then?"Responding to a question about whether there could be a foreign angle to the border flare-up, he said, his government had taken decisions in the last two months which might have angered "certain non-state vested actors".He claimed some people who entered India from Myanmar wanted to settle in Assam's Dima Hasao district via Mizoram but his government thwarted the attempts. "Then we hit the drug route through Mizoram and Manipur to Assam," he said."Finally, the tabling of the Assam Cattle Protection Bill in the state assembly also created apprehension though we have clarified that transporation to northeastern states will not be affected provided they have valid permit," he added, while explaining the reasons that could have upset the non-state actors.The chief minister also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 50 lakh to the families of each of those killed in the border clashes and a government job to a member. The injured will be given Rs one lakh each and injured personnel deployed at the border an additional one month's salary. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ready-to-cede-land-if-law-demands-otherwise-not-allow-even-an-inch-to-be-encroached-assam-cm-hemant-biswa-sarma-289027

It has confirmed a total of 74,386 cases and 1,324 deaths.Its vaccination rollout, which began in February, has been picking up recently, and more than 40% of the population has now had at least one shot. The Health Ministry said Tuesday it will start allowing private companies to import approved vaccines as well.Cambodia plans to vaccinate at least 12 million of its approximately 17 million people.China has also recently reported detecting the coronavirus in food imports, imposing bans ranging from one to six weeks on pork from suppliers in Britain and Denmark, beef from Argentina, fish from India and chicken from Russia.In the most recent action targeting beef, supplies from three Argentine exporters were blocked for one week starting July 10 following a positive virus test, according to the General Administration of Customs of China.Last week, the agency blocked imports carried on a Dutch ship for one week after the virus was found on a shipment of herring, the agency said.

The women, one from Asansol and the other a resident of Kolkata, said they did not want to take part in the shoot after getting to know all details, but the organisers did not listen to their pleas,” the officer stated.Both of them, in their complaint at New Town police station near here, said they were paid Rs 3,500 each and the organisers had given assurances that the videos would not be circulated on the web.The two women have shared links to the websites, where their videos have been uploaded, the officer said, adding that a probe has been initiated in the matter. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/forced-to-shoot-porn-videos-say-two-bengal-women-in-police-complaint-289012

In the past few weeks, there has been a slowdown/reduction in the rate of decline, which remains an area of concern," joint secretary in the health ministry, Lav Agarwal, said.Twenty-two districts in seven states have reported an increasing trend in daily Covid cases for the last four weeks, and this is also a cause of concern, the ministry said.There are also eight districts, which were witnessing a decline in positivity rate, but are now seeing a rise in Covid cases, it said, adding that "we cannot take the situation for granted".A study by the Armed Forces Medical College looked at 15 lakh doctors and frontline workers and found that Covishield gives 93 per cent protection while there was 98 per cent mortality reduction, the government said India recorded less than 30,000 fresh Covid-19 cases after 132 days while its active caseload fell below 4,00,000 after 124 days on Tuesday, according to health ministry data.The data updated at 8 am also showed that as many as 29,689 new coronavirus infections took the country's tally of Covid-19 cases to 3,14,40,951 while 415 fresh fatalities pushed the death toll to 4,21,382.The number of active cases dropped to 3,98,100 and comprises 1.27 per cent of the total infections.

27-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt to give details of Covid-19 vaccination drive on inmates in jail||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the Delhi government to inform about its Covid-19 vaccination drive which is going on in the jails here on the existing inmates and the new comers.The high court asked the government to file an affidavit highlighting the authorities’ plan for administering second dose on the prisoners.A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh granted time to the Delhi government to file a fresh affidavit to highlight how vaccination programme is going on in the jail on those who are already lodged in prison, be it undertrials or convicts, and those who are new comers there.It also asked the government to highlight how periodically health check-up is conducted on the inmates and listed the matter for further hearing on September 16.The high court was hearing two pleas seeking vaccination of all the prisoners who were out on bail or parole before they surrender so as to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection inside prisons.The court observed that all those lodged in jail shall get the vaccines and those who are coming to prison from outside shall also be vaccinated.During the hearing, Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi said he will file a fresh status report on the number of inmates already vaccinated in the jail.The court had in February issued notice on the petitions and asked the Delhi government to take action on the issue “immediately”.One of the two petitions has been moved by a 63-year-old woman convict serving life imprisonment in a murder case. She has sought that all prisoners, particularly those above 60 years who were out on bail, parole or furlough be vaccinated before their surrender.In her plea, filed through advocate Amit Sahni, the woman has also sought vaccination of jail staff, security persons and all prisoners in the national capital.A similar plea has also been moved by four lawyers—advocates Abhilasha Shrawat, Prabhash, Kartik Malhotra and Manav Narula—seeking directions to the Delhi government to “arrange and facilitate Covid-19 vaccination to all the prisoners who were out on bail”.The two petitions have claimed that as on January 14, there were 16,396 inmates in the three prisons in Delhi which together have a capacity of 10,026 and therefore, there was not sufficient space for maintaining social distancing.The petitioners have contended that with more prisoners scheduled to surrender in the coming days, there may not be sufficient space to keep them in quarantine for 14 days and therefore, it was necessary to vaccinate the prisoners who were out on bail, parole or furlough before lodging them back in the jail.

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Seek private involvement to beat fund crunch, make museums, ASI sites international level, says Parliament panel||A parliamentary panel has recommended that the Culture Ministry seek the participation of the private sector for the investment needed to maintain international standards in the development of museums and conservation of archaeological sites and monuments.The department-related parliamentary standing committee, 'Development and Conservation of Museums and Archaeological Sites – Challenges and Opportunities', chaired by BJP leader T G Venkatesh has said the ministry must come up with schemes to involve the private sector.The report was laid in the Rajya Sabha on Monday."In view of the fund crunch faced by the Ministry of Culture for development and conservation of museums and archaeological sites/monuments, the committee feels it is imperative for the ministry to seek the participation of the private sector in order to have the necessary investment needed to make our museums and archaeological sites/monuments on par with international standards while ensuring employment of best possible preservation practices to keep cultural heritage safe and preserved for future generations."The ministry may come up with possible schemes to partner with the private sector in development and conservation of our cultural heritage via PPP mode, test these on a pilot basis and roll out the successful ones on large scale," it said.The panel noted that the ministry has come up with an idea of identifying some start-ups who will then incubate an idea and then put it out for mainstreaming of investment in respect of iconic heritage structures identified in the country by the ministry.The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) may experiment with ticket pricing for domestic and international tourists with an aim of maximizing the revenue generated by such visits as well as allowing the maximum feasible number of people to enjoy the site. "As a part of this attempt, ASI may consider granting special discount to young international tourists as well as offering weekly passes to both foreign and domestic travellers to entice them to visit and appreciate more historical sites during their trip."The committee recommends that ASI may introduce pay-as-you-wish ticketing at all ticketed monuments across the country, while still keeping a certain minimum amount as a fee," he said.It said that informing visitors about developmental works that could be could be fuelled at the archaeological sites with their donations will certainly drive many people to contribute to the same. The panel suggested the ministry consider the introduction of special tours at archaeological sites and monuments before and after regular hours, charging a higher fee for a more isolated and sombre experience at the monuments."Further, ASI should explore forge partnerships in the form of sponsorship and CSR contributions with the private sector," it said.The parliamentary committee also expressed its dismay that almost 29 per cent of the sanctioned staff strength of ASI is lying vacant. Given the large number of monuments under the protection of ASI and the support ASI provides to archaeological departments of state governments, "even the sanctioned staff strength seems inadequate", it said."The Committee is of the view that continuing vacancies reflects the lack of intent on part of ASI to fulfil its mandate to protect and preserve the archaeological monuments across the country. "The committee recommends the Ministry to take immediate steps to ensure the recruitment of the required personnel in Archaeological Survey of India," it said.The panel also recommended that schools should be persuaded by the ministry to arrange at least one museum visit each year for students at every level providing them with a brief behind-the-curtains overview of the process of conservation of museum artefacts and curation. It suggested that the maintenance of various archaeological sites and monuments be outsourced to private agencies and in order to attract funds from individuals or agencies, and an incentive, such as display boards in the name of such individual/agency at the sites, may be provided.

The number of children produced before the child welfare committee and their particular who have been provided with benefits of the schemes by the state governments,” the Bench said.It also directed the states to provide details regarding payment of Rs 2000 monetary assistance given to needy orphans under the Integrated Child Development Services scheme.With regard to education of orphan children, the top court directed the state governments to ensure that orphans continue to study in the same school, private or government, for the current academic year and in case of any difficulty they may be accommodated in the neighbourhood school under the Right to Education Act.The apex court also directed the state governments to furnish details about children who have been accommodated in government and private schools and posted the matter for hearing on August 26.The top court’s direction came after perusing a report filed by advocate Gaurav Agrawal, who has been appointed amicus curiae, in a suo motu case seeking identification of orphaned children due to Covid-19 or otherwise and providing them immediate relief by the state governments.

27-07-2021||New Delhi||SC notice to Centre on plea seeking directions for uniform healthcare standard||The Supreme Court Tuesday sought the Centre's response on a plea seeking directions for a uniform standard of healthcare for citizens in line with the Constitution by adopting the provisions of the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010.The plea has also sought directions for operationalising all the provisions of the Act, as well as Clinical Establishment Rules, 2012 in order to ensure affordable and quality healthcare.A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Surya Kant issued notice to the government and others on the plea filed by Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Patients' Rights Campaign and K M Gopakumar.Senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the Clinical Establishment Act (CEA) came after several committees' recommendations and National Policy on Health and provided guidelines for determining charges and standard treatment.The plea has sought directions for notification and implementation of the conditions for registration of clinical establishments such as observance of minimum standards, display of rates for procedures and services, compliance with the standard treatment protocol, as provided in Sections 11 and 12 of the CEA read with Rule 9 of the Rules, 2012.The plea has also sought directions that a grievance redressal mechanism be created for the patients at the district, state and national level till the lacunae in the CEA are filled by a suitable legislation.The PIL said the duty to provide healthcare to citizens was put on the government under Article 47 of the Constitution; however, the public healthcare system did not proceed as conceived and treats only 30 per cent of the patients, while the rest are treated by the private sector.The petition contended that the public healthcare system suffers from a lack of public health infrastructure and human resources, non-availability of medicines, lack of public investment and forced dependency on the private sector.The plea submitted that there is an urgent need to develop the public healthcare system in India by providing proper infrastructure and sufficient budget to ensure that the maximum facilities exist in the public domain, not only in normal times but also at the time of emergencies such as Covid-19.Since it will take time and investment to develop the public health infrastructure, there is an urgent need to regulate the private healthcare providers to ensure access to affordable and quality healthcare to citizens, the plea said."If the provisions of the Clinical Establishments Act 2010 are implemented, which apply both to the public and private sector, it would be possible to control some of the ailments from which the private medical the sector is suffering from and also provides an enabling environment to enjoy the right to health guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and Article 12 of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights," the plea said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-seeking-directions-for-uniform-healthcare-standard-289002

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Defamation: Court gives Kangana Ranaut last chance for exemption, directs her to appear next time||A court here on Tuesday allowed as the "last chance" actor Kangana Ranaut's plea seeking exemption from personal appearance in the defamation case filed by Bollywood lyricist Javed Akhtar and directed her to remain present on the next date of hearing without fail.Metropolitan magistrate, Andheri, RR Khan, also rejected the plea of Akhtar, filed through his lawyer, seeking issuance of an arrest warrant against the actor but said the complainant can move the plea again if Ranaut fails to appear at the next hearing.The matter is posted for hearing on September 1.As the matter came up for hearing on Tuesday, the complainant filed a reply on Ranaut's plea who had sought permanent exemption from appearance before court citing professional commitments. An application was also filed requesting the court to issue an arrest warrant against her.During the proceedings, Ranaut's lawyer requested that she be exempted from personal appearance for the day, which was allowed by the magistrate."The exemption application filed by the advocate of the accused is granted for today as the last chance. The advocate for the accused is directed to keep the accused present on the next date without fail," the court said.On the plea seeking issuance of a warrant against the actor, the magistrate said, "The application filed by the advocate of the complainant for issuance of warrant against the accused is rejected. The advocate for the complainant is informed that on the failure of the accused to remain present before the court on the next date, they may file an application for a warrant against her".Akhtar (76) had filed the complaint in the magistrate's court last November claiming Ranaut had made defamatory statements against him in a television interview, which allegedly damaged his reputation.In his complaint, Akhtar claimed that Ranaut dragged his name during an interview while referring to a 'coterie' existing in Bollywood, following the alleged suicide by actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defamation-court-gives-kangana-ranaut-last-chance-for-exemption-directs-her-to-appear-next-time-289000

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus spyware: Senior journalists move SC seeking independent enquiry into govt snooping allegations||Veteran journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar have moved the Supreme Court seeking an independent probe by its sitting or retired judge into reports of government agencies using Israeli spyware Pegasus to allegedly snoop on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes.The petition, likely to come up for hearing within the next few days, seeks investigation into the hacking of phones using the Pegasus spyware saying it represented an attempt by agencies and organisations to muzzle and chill the exercise of free speech and expression of dissent in India.It also sought a direction to the Centre to disclose if the government or any of its agencies obtained a licence for Pegasus spyware and used it, either directly or indirectly, to conduct surveillance in any manner.The petitioners claimed that investigations involving several leading publications around the world have revealed that more than 142 Indians, including journalists, lawyers, ministers, opposition politicians, and activists, have been identified as potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus software.Forensic analysis by the Security Lab of Amnesty International of several mobile phones, belonging to people targeted for surveillance, has confirmed Pegasus-induced security breaches, the petition claimed.“The targeted surveillance using military-grade spyware is an unacceptable violation of the right to privacy which has been held to be a fundamental right under Articles 14 (equality before the law), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) by the Supreme Court,” it added.The hacking of phones belonging to journalists, doctors, lawyers, activists, ministers and opposition politicians “seriously compromises” the effective exercise of the fundamental right to free speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the petition said.Such an act has an obvious chilling effect on expression by threatening invasion into the most core and private aspects of a person's life, it added.The petition said the hacking of phones using the Pegasus spyware constituted a criminal offence punishable under Sections 66 (computer-related offences), 66B (punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource or communication device), 66E (punishment for violation of privacy) and 66F (punishment for cyberterrorism) of the IT Act, punishable with imprisonment and/or fine.“The attack prima facie constitutes an act of cyber-terrorism that has several grave political and security ramifications, especially considering that the devices of government ministers, senior political figures and constitutional functionaries which may contain sensitive information have been targeted,” it added.Earlier, another petition was filed by a lawyer before the apex court seeking a court-monitored probe by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into the snooping row.

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Extreme weather events in India bear climate change footprint||Floods in Maharashtra, north Bihar, rockslides and cloudburst in Himachal Pradesh, excessive rainfall in Goa and Uttarakhand's two districts -- these indicate the increasing intensity of the extreme weather events across the Indian landscape.Experts warn that we can no longer ignore the climate change footprint and it is very much going to be a part of our daily routine. They say the monsoon rains would increase further with an increase in the global temperatures."For every degree Celsius of warming, monsoon rains will likely increase by about 5 per cent. Global warming is increasing the monsoon rainfall in India even more than previously thought," according to a recent study, 'Climate change is making the Indian monsoon seasons more chaotic' by Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research."It is dominating the monsoon dynamics of the 21st century. Climate change is leading to unpredictable weather extremes and their serious consequences. What is really on the line is the socio-economic well-being of the Indian subcontinent. A more chaotic monsoon season poses a threat to the agriculture and economy in the region and should be a wake-up call for policymakers to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions worldwide," the study warned.Himachal Pradesh reported a landslide on July 25, killing 9 and leaving several injured. Uttarakhand has been reporting a series of landslides ever since the beginning of the month. Since July 22, with the record-breaking rainfall reported along with parts of the Western coast, as many as 164 deaths were reported till July 26 and 25,564 animals died with a total of 1,028 villages affected, according to the Relief and Rehabilitation Department, Maharashtra. It further said, "About 2,29,074 people were evacuated from the flood-hit areas.""Deforestation and rapid urbanisation coupled with the fragile nature of Western Ghats led to landslides and massive destruction. Warming of the atmosphere increases the capacity of air to hold moisture, which leads to the formation of intense cumulonimbus clouds or vertically developed clouds, bringing some incessant downpour over the region."Besides, when the atmosphere is unstable, these clouds keep regenerating and this turns into a series of cloud development triggering incessant rainfall," Vice President, Meteorology and Climate Change, Skymet Weather, Mahesh Palawat said.In the Himalayas, deforestation and continued construction of hydropower plants, roads, hotels or homes have led to the loosening of soil, resulting in frequent landslides even with the slightest of rains."Weather becomes more sensitive in the hilly region, as mountains respond to weather more quickly. With the development of cumulonimbus clouds in the absence of strong upper air winds, they do not tend to travel very long, or we can say they are trapped. These clouds then deplete all the water over a certain area, which is called cloud burst," Palawat explained.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR) cycle concluded that human influence on the climate system is "clear". Since AR5, there has also been an increased focus on regional impacts, with scientists improving their models and understanding of what global climate change impacts will look like on a regional scale.With various studies predicting more extremely wet years, the threat looms large over people's well-being, economy, agriculture and food system. "We are experiencing these extreme weather events not only in India but in parts of Europe and China as well. We have been seeing horrific images of devastation in China and Germany, which show that climate change is here and now."It is no longer a developing country's problem alone, but it is now hitting the industrialised nations such as Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands," Research Director and Adjunct Associate Professor, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business and lead author in the 6th Assessment report of IPCC, Dr Anjal Prakash said.IPCC scientists have been warning about these issues for the past couple of years. The latest IPCC report on Oceans and Cryosphere (SROCC) gives us a detailed account of how global warming is leading to a warming up of oceans and how the monsoon patterns are changing rapidly. The Indian subcontinent's monsoon system has drastically changed due to global warming."A long spell of drought or heavy downpour is going to be the new normal," he added.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extreme-weather-events-in-india-bear-climate-change-footprint-288988

27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Indian astronomers part of team that discovered dying star can produce short bursts||Several Indian scientists are among a group of international astronomers that have detected the shortest ever gamma-ray burst (GRB) caused by the death of a massive star. This discovery showed for the first time that a dying star can also produce short bursts and helps resolve a long-standing puzzle of the universe.A very short, powerful burst of high-energy radiation that lasted for about a second had been racing toward Earth for nearly half the present age of the universe. The burst was detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.According to the astronomers’ findings, the burst emitted 14 million times the energy released by the entire Milky Way galaxy over the same amount of time, making it one of the most energetic short-duration GRBs ever seen.GRBs are the most powerful events in the universe, detectable across billions of light-years. Astronomers classify them as long or short based on whether the event lasts for more or less than two seconds. They observe long bursts in association with the demise of massive stars, while short bursts have been linked to a different scenario.“Such a discovery has helped to resolve the long-standing issues related to gamma-ray bursts. Also, this study triggers to re-analyse all such known events to constrain number densities better,” Dr Shashi Bhushan Pandey from Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences, Nanital, said in a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today.Experts from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune, National Centre for Radio Astrophysics - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Pune, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai and the Department of Science and Technology also participated in this research besides those from USA, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Ireland, Israel, France and Sweden.Named GRB 200826A, the burst is the subject of two papers published in Nature Astronomy on July 26. The first explores the gamma-ray data while the second describes the GRB’s fading multi-wavelength afterglow and the emerging light of the supernova explosion that followed.When a star much more massive than the Sun runs out of fuel, its core suddenly collapses and forms a black hole. As matter swirls toward the black hole, some of it escapes in the form of two powerful jets that rush outward at almost the speed of light in opposite directions. Astronomers only detect a GRB when one of these jets happens to point almost directly toward Earth.Each jet drills through the star, producing a pulse of gamma rays – the highest-energy form of light – that can last up to minutes. Following the burst, the disrupted star then rapidly expands as a supernova. Short GRBs, on the other hand, form when pairs of compact objects such as neutron stars, which also form during a stellar collapse, spiral inward over billions of years and collide.GRB 200826A was a sharp blast of high-energy emission lasting just 0.65 seconds. After travelling for billions of years through the expanding universe, the signal had stretched out to about one second-long when it was detected by Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. The event also appeared in instruments aboard NASA’s Wind mission, which orbits a point between Earth and the Sun located about 1.5 million kilometres away, as well as the Mars Odyssey, which has been orbiting the Red Planet since 2001. European Space Agency’s INTEGRAL satellite observed the blast as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-astronomers-part-of-team-that-discovered-dying-star-can-produce-short-bursts-288972

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Porn films case: HC says no urgent relief to Raj Kundra till prosecution is heard||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday said it cannot pass any order granting urgent relief to businessman Raj Kundra, arrested in a case of alleged production and distribution of pornographic films through apps, without first hearing the prosecution.Justice A S Gadkari directed the police to file its affidavit by July 29 in response to a petition submitted by Kundra (45) challenging his arrest in the case.Kundra, the husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, was arrested on July 19 by the Mumbai Police's crime branch in the porn films case filed in February this year. Post-arrest, he was sent in police custody by a city court.On Tuesday, a magistrate's court remanded him in 14-day judicial custody. Kundra moved the magistrate's court for bail and his plea was kept for hearing on Wednesday.Kundra's lawyers Aabad Ponda and Subhash Jadhav argued in the HC on Tuesday that the police failed to follow the procedure laid down in law and ought to have first issued a notice under section 41A of the CrPC instead of arresting him directly.Public prosecutor Aruna Kamat Pai refuted the claim and said a notice was indeed issued to Kundra before he was placed under arrest.The HC directed Pai to file an affidavit in response to the petition. Ponda then sought some interim relief for his client.Justice Gadkari, however, refused and said it cannot grant any relief without giving a chance to the prosecution first to respond to the petition.“No ex-parte ad-interim relief,” the court said.Also read:Kundra, in his petition, has maintained his arrest and the subsequent order passed by the magistrate's court remanding him in police custody were illegal as no notice was issued to him.As per section 41A of the CrPC, the police may, in cases where arrest is not warranted, issue summons to the accused person and record his or her statement.Kundra, in his plea, has also said the material which the police claimed to be pornographic did not depict direct or explicit sexual acts but shows material in the form of short movies "which are lascivious or appeal to the prurient interest of persons at best".After Kundra's arrest, the crime branch had described him as the "key conspirator" of the case.He has been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention), 292 and 293 (related to obscene and indecent advertisements and displays), and relevant sections of the IT Act and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act.The police have claimed to have found 51 obscene videos during searches at his office. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/porn-films-case-hc-says-no-urgent-relief-to-raj-kundra-till-prosecution-is-heard-288964

I hope the injured recover soon," Gandhi tweeted, tagging a purported video of the violence."HM has failed the country yet again by sowing hatred and distrust into the lives of people. India is now reaping its dreadful consequences," the former Congress chief said.In a statement on Monday, the Assam government alleged that Mizoram Police opened fire on its officials and civilians from two dominating high features with automatic weapons, including light machine guns (LMGs).However, Mizoram Home Minister Lalchamliana claimed that the state police responded "spontaneously by firing back" at Assam Police after its 200 personnel forcibly crossed a duty post manned by CRPF personnel and indulged in arson and firing and assaulted unarmed people.Later, Shah spoke to Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga and urged them to ensure peace along the disputed border and find an amicable settlement.Assam's Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164-km border with Mizoram's three districts of Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit.Following a territorial dispute, there were clashes along the inter-state border in August 2020 and February this year.

Farmer leaders, including Rakesh Tikait and Yogendra Yadav, announced in Lucknow that the “mission” would be formally started with a mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on September 5. “The farmers’ movement will be taken to every village of the two states to strengthen it, the way it has happened in Punjab and Haryana,” they saidKisan SansadIncrease women representationA constitutional amendment should be made to give due representation to women, who constitute 50 per cent of the population.Tikait said they would turn Lucknow into Delhi, and all roads to the state capital would be closed. “Our agitation will continue until the three agricultural laws are repealed,” he said.The SKM leaders also called upon farmer unions and other “progressive forces” to join hands, and free up all toll plazas in the states as part of the “mission”.“The BJP and its allies will face protests while holding their programmes, and their leaders will face social boycott. Meetings, dialogues, yatras and rallies will be held in the two states,” they said.Meanwhile, the ‘Mahila Kisan Sansad’ at the Jantar Mantar passed two resolutions, demanding “thought-out measures” to increase the role and space for women in the ‘Kisan Andolan’ and “33 per cent representation for women in Parliament and the Assemblies onthe pattern of local bodies such as panchayats and municipal committees.”“A constitutional amendment should be made in this regard to give due representation to women, who constitute 50 per cent of the population,” resolved the ‘Mahila Kisan Sansad’.“Though the women contribute significantly to farming, they do not receive the dignity, recognition and status they deserve in the country. Their hard work and skills should be taken on board by people’s movements and the society,” it said. The ‘Mahila Kisan Sansad’ also demanded repeal of Essential Commodities Amendments Act-2020. A woman member, Ramesh, who had lost her husband during the protest, also participated in the meeting.The day marked the completion of eight months of farmers’ protests at the borders of Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samyukt-kisan-morcha-launches-mission-up-uttarakhand-288621

The issue led to repeated disruptions and adjournment of both Houses of Parliament today.Mamata’s announcement came shortly before she left for New Delhi from Kolkata to hold talks with opposition leaders to cobble up an anti-BJP front for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The commission would comprise former Calcutta High Court Chief Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya and former Supreme Court Judge MB Lokur. The panel has been given six months to submit its report.“The Cabinet today approved the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry in exercise of power conferred by Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, in the matter of widely reported illegal hacking, monitoring, putting under surveillance, tracking and recording of mobile phones of various persons in West Bengal,” she said.According to reports, Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee, a nephew of Mamata, and poll strategist Prashant Kishor were among potential targets of the spyware during the Assembly elections in West Bengal.Under the Commission of Inquiry Act, both the Centre and states can institute a probe. However, if the Centre has ordered such an inquiry, “no state government shall, except with the approval of the Union Government, appoint another commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the commission appointed by the Centre is functioning,” the Act says.Mamata’s move is being seen as an attempt by her to force the Centre’s to order a wider probe as the potential targets in the list include people from several states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-banerjee-orders-judicial-probe-into-pegasus-snooping-row-288601

We don’t want to say anything, but we also have our ears to the ground,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said, refusing to entertain the plea seeking a stay on the prosecution under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.‘Procured medicines Illegally’Gautam Gambhir Foundation is accused of illegally procuring and distributing crucial medicines during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic when acute shortage of medicines was being reported from across the country.Earlier, Delhi’s drug controller had told the HC that Gautam Gambhir Foundation has been found guilty of unauthorisedly stocking, procuring and distributing FabiFlu medicine to Covid patients. The SC noted that people were running around for medicines and suddenly a trust comes and says we will give you medicines.As the Bench asked senior advocate Kailash Vasudev, representing the foundation, to approach the Delhi High Court, he chose to withdraw the petition. The high court had deprecated the manner in which a huge quantity of the drug was procured, saying genuine patients who needed the medicine during the crisis could not get it as the bulk stock was taken away by Gambhir’s foundation.AAP MLA Praveen Kumar was also found guilty of similar offences under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and action will also be taken against him, the high court was informed during hearing of a PIL seeking registration of an FIR on the allegations that politicians were able to procure and distribute in huge quantities the Covid-19 medicines even as many patients waited for life saving drugs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-drug-hoarding-no-supreme-court-relief-for-delhi-bjp-mp-gautam-gambhirs-foundation-288605

Also there appears to be a lack of agreement among opposition parties on the issue.”The government said it had earlier too invited the opposition for discussions, but one party (Congress) said it would get back after talking to the top brass and the other (TMC) said it would not come.The Congress, TMC, DMK, RJD, SP, Left and other parties, however, insisted they were all united.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-hardens-stand-on-pegasus-parliament-session-stares-at-washout-288607

These resources include armoured formations and infantry combat vehicles, besides troops. Without getting into specifics, sources said the 1 Strike Corps had already moved its elements to eastern Ladakh.Besides the 1 Strike Corps, two other Strike Corps – headquartered at Ambala and Bhopal — face Pakistan. The strike corps are naturally trained to be first movers in case of conflict.Since May last year, a standoff continues between the armies of India and China and there is no immediate chance of the April 2020 status getting restored along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.“There is lack of trust that exists among the armies of either side,” said sources. The Tribune had reported in its edition on July 26 how there has been no consensus on troop pullback. The move of the 1 Strike Corps to eastern Ladakh adds to the existing troop numbers for India.China has been making infrastructure for accommodating troops, which is a clear indication that it is preparing itself for the long haul.The first full-sized tank regiment — 45 tanks — moved to Ladakh a decade ago. The plateaus at 14,000 feet and more are interspersed in the folds of the major mountain ranges — the Greater Himalayas, Karokaram, Ladakh and Zanskar — are ideal tank country, flat with ample places to hide in the folds of the valleys.During the 1962 India-China war, five of the US-built AMX-13 tanks were airlifted.New Delhi’s decision of adding more tanks is based on China declared decision to practice rapid movements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/focus-on-china-army-moves-key-strike-elements-to-eastern-ladakh-288611

However, the requests were turned down by the judge who concluded that there was “insufficient evidence” that the debt will be paid back to the petitioners in full within a reasonable period of time. He also put forward an application seeking permission to appeal against the bankruptcy order, which Judge Briggs refused as there was no “real prospect of success” of an appeal.The petitioners were made up of SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks, including Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd as well as an additional creditor, had been pursuing a bankruptcy order in the UK in relation to a judgment debt which stands at over GBP 1 billion.Mallya’s legal team contended that the debt remains disputed and that the ongoing proceedings in India inhibited a bankruptcy order being made in the UK.The debt in question comprises principal and interest, plus compound interest at a rate of 11.5 per cent per annum from 25 June 2013. Mallya has made applications in India to contest the compound interest charge.

My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” Sarma tweeted.The senior police officer said miscreants from across the border suddenly started firing when civil officials of both sides were holding a dialogue to sort out the differences.“I immediately cannot say how many people have been injured, but my guess is at least 50 personnel. Our SP was also injured in the firing and a bullet hit his leg,” the officer said over the phone.The IPS officer spoke to PTI while he was hiding inside a forest and firing could be heard in the background.“I along with the team are still sitting at the foothills. We were engaged in a dialogue with Mizoram’s Kolasib SP Mr Ralte and his additional SP. Assam Police IGP, DC, SP all were there and talking to find a solution to the problem.“We did not allow our public to go there, but their people were constantly throwing stones. Many were injured. They were also hitting us with marbles using catapults. As we were talking, suddenly they opened fire from the hilltop. They fired aiming at us while we were having the meeting,” he said.The officer said that the Assam Police team “somehow” managed to take position and start retaliatory firing.Silchar Medical College and Hospital (SMCH) Principal Babul Bezbarua told PTI that at least 50 police personnel were admitted with bullet injuries.“There is a constant flow of injured personnel. As we are talking, another vehicle with a few more injured persons entered the hospital. All of them have bullet and pellet injuries. We have called in all doctors and formed different teams to treat the injured,” he said.A senior doctor, who wished not to be named, said the Cachar SP’s condition was critical with one bullet hitting his thigh, besides he also got injured in the abdomen.“He lost blood and we have infused him with one unit of blood.

27-07-2021||---||No official estimate of black money in Swiss banks: Govt||New Delhi, July 26The Government has said that there is no official estimate of the black money stashed in Swiss Bank for the last 10 years. The admission was made by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary in the Lok Sabha on Monday in reply to a query by Vincent Pala (Congress) about the amount of black money stashed in Swiss Banks for the last 10 years and by when is the amount expected to reach India.The Minister said media reports have not taken account of the way the figures have to be interpreted, which has resulted in misleading headlines and analyses.Moreover, it is frequently assumed that any assets held by Indian residents in Switzerland are undeclared. Swiss authorities have conveyed that customer deposits held with Swiss banks are not necessarily located in Switzerland. Thus, the Swiss National Bank’s annual banking statistics should not be used for analysing deposits held in Switzerland by residents of India, he said.Chaudhary pointed out that India is engaging proactively with Switzerland to obtain information in relevant cases under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Switzerland.Both countries also activate the “Automatic Exchange of Information’’ every year based on the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement.Chaudhary recalled several initiatives by the Government to make the point that if caught with black money, the penal provisions are more stringent. The Government enacted ‘The Black Money Tax Act, 2015’ not only prescribes more stringent penal consequences, it includes the offence of wilful attempt to evade tax as a Scheduled Offence under the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). A Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Black Money comprising two former Supreme Court judges are proactively engaging with foreign governments to enhance the exchange of information under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements.Chaudhary also claimed that India has been a leading force in the efforts to activate Automatic Exchange of Information on a global level which has led to the Government receiving financial account information of Indian residents in other countries. Till May 31, he said assessment orders under the Black Money Act have been passed in 166 cases, and demand of Rs 8,216 crore has been raised. Undisclosed income of Rs 8,465 crore has been brought to tax and penalty of Rs 1,294 crore has been levied.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-official-estimate-of-black-money-in-swiss-banks-govt-288575
27-07-2021||New Delhi||Women farmers hold ‘Kisan Sansad’; pass resolution demanding 33 per cent representation in Parliament||Gender lines blurred and traditional roles reversed ever so often as men and women joined hands to share responsibilities in the farm, at home and at protest sites to keep up the prolonged fight against three agri laws, women farmers said here on Monday.Gathered for an all-woman Kisan Sansad (farmers' parliament), they demanded the repeal of the Essential Services Commodities Amendment Act, and stressed the seven-month agitation at multiple sites on Delhi's borders could be sustained because men and women -- whether husbands and wives or fathers and daughters -- were completely in sync.The Sansad passed the following resolutions were passed:Resolution 1:Even though women contribute quite significantly to our farming, they do not receive the dignity, recognition and status that they ought to in the country. Their labour, hard work, skills and knowledge and their vitality should be taken on board by people's movements and by our society. There should be well-thought-out measures adopted to increase the role and space for women in the Kisan Andolan.  Resolution 2:It is unanimously resolved in this Mahila Kisan Sansad that women be given 33% representation in Parliament and Assemblies on the pattern of local bodies like Panchayats and Municipal Committees. A Constitutional Amendment be made in this regard for giving due representation to women who constitute 50% of the population.Whether it was cooking at home to feed the children, ploughing the fields in the sun or relentlessly protesting for months, both men and women farmers, since November last year, have defied conventional gender roles to do it all, the women farmers, who travelled to Delhi from different states, said.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pardesh, are demanding that the legislations be repealed and have been protesting against the laws at Delhi border points of Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri."Women are doing men's work and men are doing what women used to do. So what?" Kulwinder Kaur from Punjab's Tarn Taran district said at the Kisan Sansad, which is being held at Jantar Mantar near Parliament where the Monsoon Session is underway "Women are no longer the same. Kalpana Chawla went to space, we have only come to Delhi. If women can become prime ministers, why can't we fight our own battle," said Kaur, who was among the 200 women who participated in the farmers' parliament, which began on July 22.Kaur said that she along with several other women from her area have been protesting at the Singhu border for the last seven months, while their husbands and brothers, and brothers-in-law have been taking care of the household and the fields."I have been at Singhu with several other women from Tarn Taran for all these months to show that this is not just men's protest. Farmers are not just men. Women work on fields too…we are farmers too, she said.“And, while I am here, my husband is taking care of the kitchen and cooking,” Kaur said.Every day 200 farmers are participating in the Kisan Sansad, which is a part of their strategy to draw the government's as well as the opposition's attention to the issues that have been plaguing the farming community.According to Harinder Bindu, the farmers, while embarking on this journey, knew that their struggle was going to be a long one, and had prepared themselves for whatever might come.“We knew that the protest was going to continue for a long time, and we knew we wouldn't be able to sustain it alone," she said."Towards the beginning of the protest…in December last year, when men from most households had to be at the protest sites, women back home learnt how to drive tractors so that they could plough the fields, something that men used to do,” the farmer leader from Bhatinda in Punjab said.She added that similarly, as the protest continued, there were weeks and months during which women in several households were camping at Delhi's borders, and men were helping out back home.“When women come to the protest, men help out with the household chores. It is this cooperation, and collaboration among everybody that has strengthened the movement,” Bindu said.While both men and women work the fields, the roles have traditionally been gender specific.The ploughing is largely taken care of by the men, explained farmer leader Kiran Malik, and activities like cutting and trimming grass to feed cattle, irrigating and spraying insecticides in the field, making dung cakes for manure, among others fall into the women's share of responsibilities.“It is strange that the image of a farmer is by default a man, but it is the women who end up doing most of the farm work. Men have traditionally done the heavy lifting tasks, and then they are done. But since this protest began, the way of doing things has completely changed.“Now everything is done keeping in mind that it should help the movement in some way or the other,” Malik, who hails from Hisar in Haryana, said.She added that while her husband and other men in the family have been regularly traveling to Tikri, the women in her family have taken over the responsibilities in the fields completely, thanks to all the help that they receive from their neighbours.“Every single farmer's objective today is to fuel this movement, and all our actions are directed towards that one cause, and neighbours in our area have all been cooperating and helping out each other extensively,” Malik said.Farmers have been protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They claim that the laws will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of the big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.--with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/women-farmers-hold-kisan-sansad-pass-resolution-demanding-33-per-cent-representation-in-parliament-288538

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s autocracy decides CMs, Congress reacts to Yediyurappa's resignation||The Congress on Monday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over BS Yediyurappa's resignation as Karnataka chief minister, and said he is yet another "victim" of the PM, who has a record of allegedly forcing retirements of senior BJP leaders.Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala alleged that it is Delhi's autocracy that decides chief ministers and not the will of BJP's MLAs.He alleged that the BJP government in Karnataka is an "illegitimate" one as it is born out of "defection and corruption".The Congress has been alleging that the BJP used the Pegasus spyware to oust the Congress-JDS government in the state."The ignominy, torment and insult being heaped upon Sh. B.S. Yediyurappa by Modi ji, dictating him to tender his resignation, makes him PM's latest victim and member of the 'forced retirement club'," Surjewala said on Twitter."We now know that Delhi's autocracy decides CMs and not the will of BJP's MLAs," he further said."The stark reality is that Modiji habitually insults and compulsorily throws senior BJP leaders in dustbin of history," the Congress leader alleged.Yediyurappa has, however, claimed that there was no pressure on him from the party leadership to resign and he has tendered his resignation on his own."Modiji's record is replete with painful and forcible retirements of Advaniji, M.M. Joshiji, Keshubhai Patelji, Shanta Kumarji, Yashwant Sinhaji and many others. The list of Modiji's victims in the BJP doesn't end here," Surjewala said.He also cited the names of Sumitra Mahajan, Sushma Swaraj, Uma Bharti, CP Thakur, AK Patel, Haren Pandya, Harin Pathak, Kalyan Singh as those leaders who have been retired by the top brass of the BJP.He said the latest "victims" are Harsh Vardhan, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Sushil Modi.Congress leader Mallikarujun Kharge, however, termed the resignation of Yediyurappa as an internal matter of the BJP.Taking on the BJP over the Pegasus spying issue, Surjewala said, "Malady is with BJP's corrupt Government and appalling maladministration in Karnataka, for it is an illegitimate Government born out of “defection and corruption”.""Will merely changing the face change the diabolical character of the BJP Government synonymous with mal-governance and decay," he said.Yediyurappa announced his resignation as chief minister in the Karnataka Vidhan Souda on Monday afternoon.

27-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||Yediyurappa resigns as Karnataka CM||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 26Ending days of speculation, Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday resigned from the position after making an emotional speech at a function to mark two years of his government in the Vidhana Soudha."I have decided to resign. I will meet the Governor after lunch," the 78-year-old CM said as he talked of various challenges he overcame to reach where he had and also during his tenure, which, incidentally, he was not able to complete even this time. Meanwhile, all eyes are now on the BJP's choice to replace Yediyurappa, a popular mass leader in his own right. Several prominent names are doing the rounds but it remains to be seen who will be the next CM to take over from the Lingayat strongman.Ever since his exit became imminent, Veerashaiva-Lingayat seers from different parts of Karnataka had been demanding that Yediyurappa be allowed to continue. They said solutions should be found under the leadership of Yediyurappa and that he should not be replaced. "Karnataka will face more problems if he is removed,” some said, blaming the RSS for the change in leadership.However, under pressure from detractors, Yediyurappa on Monday marked, what can be called, a graceful exit from the post.BJP president JP Nadda on Sunday had ruled out a leadership crisis in Karnataka.Later, Yediyurappa said he had resigned on his own, and there was no pressure on him. He said he would continue to work with the BJP.Yediyurappa drove to the Raj Bhawan to submit his resignation to Governor Thawarchand Gehlot. He was accompanied by several of his ministers.Speaking to the media, Yediyurappa thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda for their support. "They gave me an opportunity to continue even after crossing the age of 75. I am grateful to them, "said Yediyurappa while he expressed gratitude to the state BJP cadres and people. Interestingly, while inside the Vidhana Souda he was teary-eyed and very emotional as he talked of 'agnipariksha' he had been facing for the past two years, later, a much-in-control Yediyurappa said: "It has been an honour to have served the state for the past two years.  I am humbled and sincerely thank the people of the state for giving me the opportunity to serve them. "I gave the resignation on my own. There was no pressure on me to resign. I urge the people to support the new CM. We want the BJP to win. There is no way I will leave the side of the BJP. I will continue to campaign for the party and work for its progress," he said. Amid the suspense over the name of his replacement, Yediyurappa said he had not nominated anyone to take his place.Sources, meanwhile, said the choice of the new CM would determine whether or not the central leadership wanted the Karnataka BJP to remain Lingayat dominated as it was with Yediyurappa at the helm. Apparently, the pressure on him to resign had been building from the beginning of the year. He, however, had certain demands and "bargained hard" for the future of his family and sons BY Vijayendra and BY Raghvendra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yediyurappa-resigns-as-karnataka-cm-288496

The government says nothing bad has happened to the farmers and that the farmers sitting out on protests are terrorists. But the fact is that the laws are not for the farmers. They are for a few industrialists,” Gandhi told reporters before several Congress leaders, including Randeep Surjewala and Youth Congress president BV Srinivas, were taken into preventive custody by Delhi Police for violating Section 144 of the CrPC outside Parliament.The Congress MPs also moved adjournment notices in the Lok Sabha demanding repeal of farm laws and a discussion on farmer issues.Shiromani Akali Dal’s Harsimrat Badal and AAP MP Bhagwant Mann also moved similar notices.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-rides-tractor-to-parliament-to-protest-against-farm-laws-288490
