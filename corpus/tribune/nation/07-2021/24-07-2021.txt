24-07-2021||New Delhi||Batla House encounter: Ariz Khan moves HC challenging death penalty for killing of inspector||Ariz Khan, who was awarded the death penalty for the murder of decorated Delhi Police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma in connection with the sensational 2008 Batla House encounter case, has moved the Delhi High Court challenging his conviction and sentence.Khan has filed an appeal against the trial court verdict which said the offence fell under the “rarest of the rare category” warranting the maximum sentence and Ariz be “hanged by neck” till death.Inspector Sharma of the Delhi Police’s special cell was killed during the 2008 Batla House encounter between the police and the terrorists in Jamia Nagar in south Delhi following serial bomb blasts in the national capital in which 39 people died and 159 were injured.The appeal has been filed by Ariz through advocates M S Khan and Quasar Khan.The trial court had on March 8 convicted Ariz saying that it was duly proved that he and his associates murdered the police official and fired gunshots at him.The trial court had, on March 15, sentenced Ariz to capital punishment and also imposed a fine of Rs 11 lakh on him, making it clear that Rs 10 lakh should be immediately released to the family members of Sharma.It had termed the act of Ariz of firing on police party without any provocation as “abhorrent and brutal” and said this itself showed that he was not only a threat to the society but was also an enemy of the State.The trial court, which had said that the convict on account of his despicable act has forfeited his right to live, held that the offence proved against Ariz was not an ordinary act but a crime against the State and while committing the offence, he acted like a “dreaded and well-trained terrorist” who does not deserve any leniency.A trial court had sentenced Indian Mujahideen terrorist Shahzad Ahmed in July 2013 to life imprisonment in connection with the case. His appeal against the verdict has been pending in the high court.Ariz Khan had fled from the spot and was declared a proclaimed offender. He was arrested on February 14, 2018 and faced trial.The court had said it has been proved on record that Ariz after the shootout managed to escape and run away from the spot and eluded investigating agencies for almost 10 years despite coercive process against him.“Involvement of convict in various blast cases not only in Delhi but also in Jaipur, Ahmedabad and UP, in which hundreds of innocent people were killed and injured, further demonstrates that the convict continues to be a threat to the society and the nation,” it had added.The court had said deadly weapons like AK-47 and two pistols were retrieved from the flat where the shootout took place and considering the nature of devastation that these weapons can cause, it would be safe to conclude that these weapons were kept to indulge in terrorist and anti-social activities.“Deleterious impact of crime on social order and human psyche added to the list of aggravating circumstances. Unbearable miseries inflicted by the convict do constitute aggravating circumstance. Nature of offence and manner of committing the crime aroused extreme indignation to the society in this case,” it had said.He was further sentenced to life imprisonment for the offence of attempt to murder.The court had also sentenced him to three years imprisonment for voluntarily obstructing police from discharging their duty, 10 years rigorous imprisonment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt to police officials, rigorous imprisonment for two years for assault of public servant and three years imprisonment for the offence under section 27 (using arms) of Arms Act.

24-07-2021||New Delhi||SC agrees to hear plea raising issue of policy for premature release of convicts||The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea that has raised a legal issue as to whether the policy for premature release from jail existing at the time of conviction or the subsequent one which is in existence at the time of consideration of such relief would be applicable.The apex court sought the response of the Madhya Pradesh government and others within four weeks on the plea filed by a convict, who is serving a life term and is seeking directions to the state to release him from jail on the grounds that he has undergone a sentence of over 20 years including the period of remission.The petitioner has said that he also qualifies under the policy for premature release which was applicable at the time of his conviction in the case.The plea came up for hearing on Friday before a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Hrishikesh Roy which issued a notice seeking the response of the state government and others.“Issue notice returnable in four weeks,” the bench said.The petition, filed through advocate Rishi Malhotra, said the petitioner was convicted by a trial court in a case of 1996 along with others and was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2005.The plea said at the time of his conviction, the policy for premature release dated December 4, 1978, was applicable.“However, for the first time on January 10, 2012, there was a substantial change/departure from the said policy wherein it stipulated that such prisoners who are facing life imprisonment would have to undergo actual sentence of 20 years with a total sentence of 26 years,” it said.The plea said as per the December 1978 policy, any convict who has been sentenced to life imprisonment after December 18, 1978, and has undergone 14 years of the actual sentence and completed a total sentence of 20 years would be entitled to premature release.It said the authorities had in December last year rejected the application filed by the petitioner for premature release by relying on the subsequent policy of January 2012, instead of the December 1978 policy.“The case of premature release of the petitioner should be considered in light of the policy dated December 4, 1978, and appropriate directions be issued for his immediate release from jail,” the plea said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-agrees-to-hear-plea-raising-issue-of-policy-for-premature-release-of-convicts-287679

As a law and order situation emerged, we were compelled to use non-lethal force,” Tinsukia superintendent of police Debojit Deuri told PTI.Six protestors and a few police personnel were injured, he said. Some police vehicles were also damaged.The protestors started pelting stones at the police team, which prompted the police to use force to control the situation, the SP said.Deuri further said the local administration had been urging the people to allow OIL to clear their site when similar resistance was offered on earlier occasions also.“If there is any discontent with the amount of compensation or if someone feels that it is not being paid as specified, he can approach the appropriate authorities or courts. But preventing the OIL from clearing the site cannot be a solution,” he said.The SP added that OIL has started the process of moving out its stuff from the site.A blowout had occurred at Well No 5 in the Baghjan oil field in May last year, resulting in a leak of natural gas.

24-07-2021||New Delhi||Private hospital in Delhi records rise in neurological cases among post-Covid patients||A leading private health facility in Delhi on Saturday said it is reporting a rise in neurological issues among post-Covid patients, including emergency cases of brain haemorrhage.Also, in the out-patient department (OPD), up to 60 per cent of patients are presenting increasing mental health issues like anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, feeling of loneliness, and majority of these are post-Covid cases, the Moolchand Hospital said in a statement.Doctors at the private facility said the neurological issues among post-Covid patients have seen a “troubling rise” here.The Moolchand Hospital has been “recording increasing cases of intracerebral (brain) haemorrhage, and 50 per cent of the neuroscience department is filled with such cases,” it said.The doctors also said that people who have survived the pandemic and those who were infected with Covid-19 are increasingly coming to the hospital many weeks later with symptoms such as headache, giddiness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, memory problems, anxiety, depression, stroke, pain and sleep disorders.In the OPD, up to 60 per cent of patients are coming with mental health issues like headache, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, feeling of loneliness etc, they said.“Majority of these cases are those who have had Covid-19 infection in the past, with a gap of two to three months,” senior neurosurgeon at Moolchand Hospital, Dr Asha Bakshi, said.“Such issues are severely affecting their personal as well as professional lives. Many complained that they find it extremely tough to focus during work. People are struggling with work-life adjustment issues as well,” she said.Bakshi said that the pandemic has not only caused acute inflammatory illness involving the lungs predominantly, but has also led to some long-term neurological problems.She cited a large cohort study done by the Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in Covid-19 (GCS-NeuroCovid) and the European Academy of Neurology Neuro-Covid Registry (ENERGY) of over 3,700 patients which indicated that neurological manifestations were found in approximately 80 per cent of patients hospitalised with Covid-19, the statement said.“Thirty-seven per cent of patients reported symptoms, including headache while anosmia or ageusia was reported in 26 per cent of them. The most common neurological syndromes reported were acute encephalopathy (49 per cent), coma (17 per cent), and stroke (six per cent). Presence of clinically captured neurologic signs or syndromes was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death,” the neurosurgeon claimed.She also said that more than 42 per cent of people surveyed by the US Census Bureau in December reported symptoms of anxiety or depression.“Data from other surveys suggest that the picture is similar worldwide. In India, a study from Assam (Hazarika and colleagues) found that 46 per cent had anxiety, 22 per cent had some form of depression and five per cent had suicidal thoughts,” Bakshi added.She emphasised the need for addressing the incidence of neurological disorders and long-term mental health issues in the post-Covid population.“This needs to be addressed seriously especially when such a large populace is affected as it has a direct implication on our social fabric and more importantly on work-life and subsequent economic health of the nation,” Bakshi added.Meanwhile, city-based Akash Healthcare on Saturday said its hospital has received 15-20 cases with neurological conditions after patients recovered from Covid-19, in the past two-four weeks.“The most common condition we have seen are migrainous headaches and post-Covid encephalopathy apart from proximal myopathy. The other rarer conditions included Guillain-Barré syndrome. Typically, the headaches are migrainous in character, present in younger age group and do not respond that well to common medications used for common migraine,” said Dr Madhukar Bhardwaj, neurologist at Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital.Post-Covid encephalopathy presents with progressive decline in behaviour and alertness in the elderly. The patients usually come with various questions about post-Covid conditions and are very anxious, doctors said.“So far, we have not seen children coming up with such conditions. People are coming to us with these neurological conditions after one-two months of recovering from Covid,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-hospital-in-delhi-records-rise-in-neurological-cases-among-post-covid-patients-287672
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Parliamentary panel flags shortage of pilots in India’s civil aviation sector||The civil aviation industry in India has an annual requirement of 1,000 pilots, but only 200-300 pilots are being trained each year in the country, thereby not only leading to a shortage of type-rated commanders but also increasing dependence on foreign pilots.Revealing this in its latest reported tabled in Parliament on July 23, the Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture has asked the Ministry of Civil Aviation to give serious thought to setting up new institutes for pilot training and to revamp the existing institutes by providing modern simulators and also augmenting their capacity intake of students.Terming the shortage of pilots as a matter of grave concern, the committee observed that India has sub-optimal capacity and availability in terms of simulators, to train the required number of pilots.According to the committee’s data, 1,882 commercial pilot licenses (CPL) were issued to pilots from Indian flying training organisations (FTO) in the past five years and another 1,113 foreign CPLs were converted to Indian CPLs during this period.In 2016, the number of CPLs issued through Indian FTOs was 376. This went up to 430 in 2019 before falling to 303 in 2020, the year which was marred by lockdowns and other restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As far as foreign pilots are concerned, there were 537 conversions from foreign CPLs to Indian CPLs in 2016, which rose to 744 by 2019. In 2020, this number came down to 522.The committee has also recommended that the ministry should envisage the setting up of a pilot training Institute adjacent to at least one airport in each state besides formulating futuristic plans for devising tailor-made technical courses for skill development, training and research, in consultation with the private sector.Indian FTOs, according to the committee’s report, are facing several challenges like sub-optimal fleet size, high rent, old fleet, lack of an adequate number of trainers, sub-optimal facilities and weather issues. These are among the reasons why pilot students prefer to train outside India.Pointing out that there is huge manpower potential and a skilled workforce available in the country, the committee pointed out that India has not been able to match the vast talent pool of skilled manpower with the requirement of pilots.The committee has underlined the need for proactive action for skill development and training in the country to augment the skills of available manpower to meet the requirements of the Indian aviation industry, which has emerged as one of the fastest-growing markets in the world and has witnessed an exponential growth of airline fleet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-flags-shortage-of-pilots-in-indias-civil-aviation-sector-287671

However, one day, when the girl came to know that her virtual friend is a male, she stopped talking to him and also blocked his mobile number when he tried to contact her, police said.Garg then called her from a different mobile number and emotionally blackmailed her to continue their friendship and unblock his phone number, they said, adding the accused also convinced her to meet him at Madhuban Chowk in northwest Delhi.On May 29, the girl went to Madhuban Chowk and met Garg who abducted her and took her to Bhind, police said.The victim was physically and sexually assaulted by Garg. She told the police that Garg had sold her to a man named Ram Mohan, also a resident of Bhind, for Rs 50,000, and she was forced to marry him, the police said.Garg was in Gwalior Jail for seven months in a dowry case. Mohan was Garg's tenant and is presently at large.

Gujjar was granted bail in a jiffy. Judiciary cannot be step-motherly,” Akhtar said.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

24-07-2021||New Delhi||Reeling under Covid, world needs healing touch of compassion, kindness: President Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said the world is reeling under the impact of Covid and needs the healing touch of compassion, kindness and selflessness more than ever before.These universal values propagated by Buddhism need to be adopted by all in their thoughts and actions, he said at an event."Application of Buddhist values and principles in addressing issues of global concern will help in healing the world and making it a better place," Kovind said.He was addressing the annual Asadha Poornima – Dharma Chakra Day organised by the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC) through a video message.Kovind said Lord Buddha's well-documented life contains invaluable messages for humanity, according to a statement by the Rashtrapati Bhavan."Reeling under the impact of Covid, the world, more than ever before, needs the healing touch of compassion, kindness and selflessness," the President was quoted as saying.He expressed hope that today's world gets inspired by Lord Buddha's infinite compassion and resolves to overcome all sources of human suffering, the statement said.Kovind said it is important to stick to the essence of the teachings of Lord Buddha and not get lost in several different interpretations and variations of it. The President noted that in this context, the objectives of the International Buddhist Confederation are laudable.He also praised the IBC's effort in providing a common platform for all Buddhist traditions and organisations to serve humanity.The President said he believed that the appeal of Buddhism goes much beyond the nearly 550 million formally ordained followers of the faith."People belonging to other faiths, and even skeptics and atheists feel attracted to the teachings of the Buddha. This universal and eternal appeal of Buddhism is due to its logical, rational, and simple answers to the fundamental problems faced by human beings across time and place," Kovind said.

Meanwhile, Kundra challenged his arrest before the Bombay High Court, saying these videos might be described as “lascivious”, but do not show “explicit sexual acts”. The petition sought quashing of the lower court’s order. The magistrate’s order sending him to police custody violated the law as serving a notice under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (before arrest) is mandatory, especially in view of the Covid, it said.The material which the police claim to be pornographic did not “depict direct explicit sexual acts and sexual intercourse but shows material in the form of short movies which are lascivious or appeal to the prurient interest of persons at best”, Kundra’s plea contended Meanwhile, the police recorded Shilpa’s statement. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-extends-raj-kundras-remand-till-july-27-287253

Delays are liable to cause grave misgivings on reasons for delay. We direct Director CBI to take necessary administrative steps to monitor filing of appeals on an ICT platform so that delays don’t take place,” the top court said.A Special CBI judge at Raipur had in November 2018 convicted the accused in a corruption case and sentenced him to three-year imprisonment. However, in June 2019, the HC set aside the judgment and acquitted the accused and the CBI filed its appeal after 647 days.The top court wasn’t convinced by the CBI’s contention that delay was on account of Covid.“There is a delay of 647 days. In application for condonation of delay, explanation given is on grounds of Covid which doesn’t explain the entire duration of delay. Explanation of delay on account of Covid is not acceptable since the judgment was much before the onset of the pandemic in March 2020,” it said.The case||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-raps-cbi-for-647-day-delay-in-filing-appeal-287255

The government gives a “compulsory licence” to a third party to produce a patented product without the consent of the patent owner. This is usually done in extreme emergencies.“Generic production in large quantities without any obligation of patents will help in removal of supply constraints in availability of affordable drugs and vaccines at times of high case load and death due to Covid,” noted the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Friday.The recommendation to the government comes at a time when India’s search for a legitimate avenue is stuck at the World Trade Organisation after eight months. India and South Africa have asked the WTO to relax the patents regime for Covid vaccines and drugs as a one-time measure.“The government should delve into the prospect of temporarily wavering patent rights and issuing compulsory licensing to tackle the inadequacy in availability of Covid vaccines and drugs during an emergency-like situation,” recommended the report.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/panel-seeks-compulsory-licensing-for-vaccine-drugs-287257

Abdullah has just returned from the talks held on July 17 and 18, which only the US State Department has appreciated.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla is in the UK, ostensibly to discuss the Indo-UK roadmap till 2030, but sources said Afghanistan would occupy a major portion of the talks as India tries to get a handle on a US-UK tandem in this respect.Soon after the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers met on Afghanistan in mid-July, the US sprang a surprise by announcing a Quadrilateral comprising Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and itself to promote connectivity in the region.Around the same time, reports emerged of the US assisting the Afghan armed forces in a few bombing missions, including a couple in which its equipment that had landed in Taliban’s hands was destroyed.Sources said confabulations between Afghan leaders and India were being held with more frequency as Kabul seeks to draw New Delhi into greater assistance with its firepower abilities to subdue the Taliban, which is making a bid for areas with poor governance from Kabul or are being ruled by their inveterate opponents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-meets-top-afghan-peace-negotiator-abdullah-287259

Too many lives have been lost In a statement to mark the 30th anniversary of liberalisation in 1991, Singh said he was deeply saddened at the devastation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the loss of millions of fellow Indians.“The social sectors of health and education have lagged behind and not kept pace with our economic progress. Too many lives and livelihoods have been lost that should not have been. It is not a time to rejoice and exult, but to introspect and ponder. Our priorities as a nation need to be recalibrated to foremost ensure a healthy and dignified life for every single Indian,” the former PM said.Recalling how as finance minister in 1991, he ended his historic budget speech by quoting Victor Hugo, “No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come”, Manmohan Singh today said, “30 years later, as a nation, we must remember Robert Frost’s poem — But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep.”He said on this day 30 years ago, in 1991, the Congress ushered significant reforms of India’s economy and paved a new path for the nation’s economic policy.“Over the past three decades, successive governments have followed this path to catapult our nation to a $3 trillion economy and into the league of the world’s largest economies. More importantly, nearly 300 million fellow Indians have been lifted out of poverty in this period and hundreds of millions of new jobs have been provided for our youth,” the ex-PM noted.He said the reforms process unleashed the spirit of free enterprise which has helped produce some world-class companies and helped India emerge as a global power in many sectors.“The economic liberalisation process in 1991 was triggered by an economic crisis that confronted our nation then, but it was not limited to crisis management. The edifice of India’s economic reforms was built on the desire to prosper, the belief in our capabilities and the confidence to relinquish control of the economy by the government. I was fortunate to play a role in this reform process along with several of my colleagues in the Congress,” Singh said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/road-ahead-more-daunting-than-1991-time-to-introspect-ex-pm-manmohan-singh-287260

There is no third option of independence in the UN resolution.India has previously made it clear that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India. New Delhi has also told Islamabad that issues related to Jammu and Kashmir are its internal matter and the country is capable of solving its own problems.Friday was the last day of campaigning for elections in PoK on July 25.Responding to PML-N's allegations of election rigging, Khan questioned how his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) could rig the upcoming polls when the PML-N was still in power in PoK and even the election commission officials were appointed during the PML-N's government.Khan said his party had been asking the Opposition for a year to come to discuss electronic voting machines.“This technology helps you get the results of polls in no time and there will not be any need for manual counting of votes and moving of the polling bags from one place to another, which is a tiring exercise," he said.“But the Opposition is not willing to listen to us,” he rued.

24-07-2021||Mumbai||Porn case: Raj Kundra's custody extended, police record wife Shilpa Shetty's statement||A court in Mumbai on Friday extended till July 27 the police custody of businessman Raj Kundra and his associate Ryan Thorpe in a case related to alleged production and distribution of pornographic films through apps.The crime branch of Mumbai Police also recorded the statement of Kundra's wife and actor Shilpa Shetty in connection with the case.Seeking his further custody, the police claimed that Kundra had plans to sell 119 adult films to a person for a sum of USD 1.2 million.Separately, an investigation officer said that the police also wanted to probe alleged transfer of funds from a South Africa-based sports betting firm into Kundra's bank account.Kundra was arrested on July 19 by the police under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act.Raj Kundra tells Bombay HC: Films don't contain explicitly sexual actsHe, along with Thorpe, was produced before the magistrate after their earlier remand expired on Friday.Seeking the duo's further custody, the police told the court that the probe  found that Kundra set up Armsprime Media Pvt Ltd, which, through London-based Kenrin Pvt Ltd, bought the Hot Shots app to upload "objectionable videos" on social media.Kundra's phone contained WhasApp chats regarding Kenrin and its economic transactions. These conversations also revealed that he had discussed selling 119 adult films to a person for USD 1.2 million, police said.They wanted to probe if this deal went through and the videos were transferred, the remand plea said.Searches at the accused's office led to the seizure of 51 obscene videos, the police said.An employee who handled accounts of Hot Shots told investigators that between August 2019 and November 2020 it earned a net profit of GBP 4,000 to 10,000 per month, police said, adding that Kundra's company Viaan Industries was involved in the maintenance of the app.Viaan's employees told the police that the app was removed from Google Play in June 2020 and the Apple app store in November as it had obscene content, the remand plea said.Thorpe allegedly directed the employees to remove all data related to the Hot Shots app after a case was registered in February this year, so IPC sections related to `destruction of evidence' have been added to the case, the police said.The police also wanted to record the statements of the women who were allegedly lured and forced into acting in porn films by the accused, the application said.During the day, the police recorded Shilpa Shetty's statement in the case at her residence. They also seized a laptop from the house.As per police, Shetty was a director of Kundra's firm for some time.Kundra on Friday moved the Bombay High Court, seeking quashing of the lower court's order remanding him in police custody. He claimed that the alleged porn videos in question did not contain any sexually explicit scenes. The petition is yet to be heard. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/porn-case-raj-kundras-custody-extended-police-record-wife-shilpa-shettys-statement-287156
24-07-2021||---||Use of Pegasus spyware on Indians a treason, says Rahul Gandhi; demands Shah’s resignation||New Delhi, July 23Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday termed the alleged use of Pegasus spyware on some Indians and Indian institutions as treason and said Union Home Minister Amit Shah must resign and Prime Minister Narendra Modi must be investigated.Gandhi, while addressing reporters at Parliament House complex, claimed that his phone was not a potential target and was indeed tapped.“My phone is not a potential target, my phone is tapped. It is clearly tapped. So it is not a potential target. I am quite clear about it,” he said.Even Rahul Gandhi admits that corrupt people have fear of Modi Govt. Good to see him speak truth for a change, hope it doesn't turn out to be a one time thing. pic.twitter.com/ov2JG0ZJR4Amid continued Parliament disruptions over the snooping controversy, Gandhi said, “Pegasus is classified by the Israeli state as a weapon and that weapon is supposed to be used against terrorists. The prime minister and the home minister have used this weapon against the Indian state and against our institutions. They have used it politically, they have used it in Karnataka and they have used it to scuttle probes. They have used it against the Supreme Court and against all the institutions of this country. The only word for this is treason and there is no other word for this.”He said the matter had to be investigated and the home minister had to resign.“Our prime minister has used Pegasus, a snooping spyware, against India's institutions and Indian democracy. My phone was tapped. This is not a matter of Rahul Gandhi's privacy. I am an opposition leader and raise the voice of the people. This is an attack on the voice of people. Pegasus was used against the Supreme Court, to scuttle the Rafale investigation. Narendra Modi has used this weapon against our country and this can be described only as treason,” Gandhi reiterated, demanding that the home minister should resign and a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court conducted on Modi, as no one else could authorise the use of Pegasus.“Only the prime minister and home minister can authorise the use of this spyware,” he said.Gandhi alleged that there had been gross theft in Rafale.“This is the truth. But the truth has a way of coming out. There is an inquiry in France and you will see the prime minister himself is responsible for corruption in Rafale. You'll see it. You can't buy everybody. You might think you might buy everybody and the prime minister might think he can suppress everybody, he might buy everybody, but you can't,’ said the former Congress chief after the party joined other opposition leaders in agitating over the Pegasus row outside Parliament in the morning.Gandhi said the real question is why at the last minute when the CBI director was about to file an FIR, his phone was tapped and he was blackmailed.‘Who did it/the question is not whether Anil Ambani's phone was tapped. The entire Indian state is under attack. You don't seem to understand that you are being attacked...This is not an attack on Rahul Gandhi or an individual, this is an attack on the entire Indian state,” Gandhi said.The Congress leader said since Pegasus is only sold to governments an inquiry is needed to determine whether the Indian government bought it.“The question is whether the Government of India has bought this or not,” Gandhi said.Asked if he was afraid, Rahul said, “I am an open book, it does not matter to me. If you want to understand Indian politics, if you are corrupt then you will fear PM Modi. If you are not corrupt, you will not fear Modi, you tend to laugh.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/use-of-pegasus-spyware-on-indians-a-treason-says-rahul-gandhi-demands-shahs-resignation-287151
24-07-2021||---||TMC MP Santanu Sen suspended from Rajya Sabha for unruly conduct||New Delhi, July 13A day after he snatched and tore up an anti-Pegasus row statement IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was making in the Rajya Sabha, Trinamool Congress MP Santanu Sen was suspended from the House for the remainder of the session for unruly conduct.Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu approved the motion for Sen’s suspension moved by the government in the House minutes before the Opposition uproar over the Pegasus row led to the first disruption of the proceedings and the first adjournment until noon.Later, Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned for the day following continuous protests by Opposition parties. The Lok Sabha was also adjourned for the day amid pandemonium by Opposition MPs, who were demanding sacking of Union Home Minister Amit Shah over Pegasus snooping and a judicial probe into the developments. The Left sought a joint parliamentary committee investigation.In Rajya Sabha earlier, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs V Muraleedharan moved the motion naming Santanu Sen and his suspension for the remaining session.The motion was adopted by a voice vote and approved by chairman Naidu.Objections from TMC leader Sukhendu Roy and Congress’s Jairam Ramesh were dismissed by the chair.Roy was objecting to the motion not being listed in the Rajya Sabha schedule of business for the day.The chairman, however, said he had approved the business as it involved matters related to prestige of the House.Earlier, Naidu expressed anguish over the Houses being rendered dysfunctional by the opposition and wondered “who will benefit from a dysfunctional Indian Parliament?”“Not the people and I don’t think even the opposition will benefit,” said Naidu lamenting that leaders were not allowing the Rajya Sabha to run after having resolved in previous meetings to have smooth proceedings in public interest.In Lok Sabha too, Speaker Om Birla’s repeated pleas to opposition members to wear masks and follow Covid behaviour went in vain.The opposition was protesting in the Well of the House with many MPs without masks.“Covid is not over yet. Please follow appropriate behaviour,” said Birla.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-mp-santanu-sen-suspended-from-rajya-sabha-for-unruly-conduct-287145

Most of the deaths are from Raigad and Satara districts," the official said.Besides landslides, several people were swept away in floodwaters.The official put the death toll in various incidents in Western Maharashtra's Satara district at 27.Other fatalities included those reported from eastern districts such as Gondia and Chandrapur, he said.The landslide in Raigad district took place near Talai village in Mahad tehsil on Thursday evening. "Thirty-six bodies have been recovered from the spot so far," a senior police official had said earlier in the day, adding that NDRF teams and local officials were engaged in rescue work.Raigad District Collector Nidhi Choudhary said the landslide incident was reported late on Thursday evening. "But since the roads leading to the spot were blocked due to floods and sludge, the rescue teams found it difficult to reach the site," she said. "The operation resumed today morning and the bodies were recovered by afternoon," she added.According to officials, there are around 30 houses in the village, which were completely damaged due to the incident. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is reviewing the situation, an official said.10 feared trapped in landslide in Ratnagiri district    At least 10 persons are feared trapped in a landslide in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district, a senior official said on Friday.Parts of Ratnagiri district have been reeling under floods caused due to heavy rains over the last few days, with major rivers in the district flowing above the danger mark.“At least 10 people are feared trapped under the debris after a landslide in the district. The rescue team has reached the spot. The local residents, who rushed to safety, alerted the police about it,” the official said.However, details about the incident, including its exact location and time, are yet to be known.The official said that establishing contact has become difficult due to the poor mobile network and it is posing hurdles in reaching out to the affected people and responding to their SOS calls.Meanwhile, four people were reported killed as torrential rain pounded Maharashtra on Thursday for the second time in five days, hitting the coastal Konkan and western parts severely, officials said.Though Mumbai was largely spared, heavy rain lashed coastal districts of Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg and the western districts of Satara and Kolhapur.Raigad:The situation is extremely serious in Taliye village in Mahad taluka.
