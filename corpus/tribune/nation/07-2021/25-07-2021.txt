25-07-2021||Guwahati||PM Modi cleared roadblocks to NE peace, development: Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cleared all roadblocks and taken northeast on the path to peace and development.People of Assam have voted for the BJP for the second consecutive term as “they have realised that there is no place for ‘aatankwad’ (insurgency) and ‘andolan’ (agitation) in the state”, Shah asserted.“The irritants that had hindered peace and progress in the region have been removed. The journey of development that began more than five years ago must be accelerated,” the Union home minister said, after launching two projects here.Shah also said that the prime minister has always accorded priority to the northeast region, and has recently inducted five ministers from the area in his Cabinet, including former chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal.“It is only in the BJP that a successful and Chief Minister makes way for a new one and welcomes with a pat on his back. Assam has gained in two ways - by getting a hardworking Chief Minister and a Cabinet Minister who is always there to think for the state”, he said.Speaking of the various agitations that have riven Assam in the past, the home minister said “perhaps no other state has suffered so much bloodshed and violence but what did they achieve - nothing.” Shah also remotely laid the foundation stone of Tamulpur Medical College and Hospital, which was promised in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) Accord.“This is not any ordinary accord but we have included clauses which were not asked for by any of the stakeholders. The medical college and hospital at Tamulpur was not a demand by the Bodos but we have included it”, he said.Earlier, “we had planned to implement all the clauses of the Bodo Accord before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls but we have already initiated measures for the fulfilment of 90 per cent of the clauses and we hope to complete all by the 75th anniversary of independence”, he added.Accords earlier gathered dust with no government taking measures to fulfil it but the Prime Minister’s initiative to take forward the accords signed with different organisations in the region has paved the way for peace and development, he claimed.Shah who offered prayers at Kamakhya Temple earlier on Sunday, also launched a new radiation therapy block in the state cancer institute at Guwahati Medical College.He said another cancer hospital being set up by the central and state along with the Tata Trust was nearing completion and the “Chief Minister has assured me that it can be inaugurated by the Prime Minister by December this year.” The home minister ceremonially distributed financial assistance of Rs one lakh to 100 selected beneficiaries under ‘Prarthana Achani’ to the next of kin of those who lost their lives to COVID-19.In Assam, 5114 persons have died due to the virus since last year.Meanwhile, the Assam Rifles in a statement said that the Union Home Minister visited its headquarters in Shillong and interacted with jawans.“In his first visit to the Assam Rifles, the Hon’ble Minister was briefed on operational and administrative issues of the Force by Lt Gen P C Nair, AVSM, YSM, DG Assam Rifles,” it said.“Had lunch and spent a good time interacting with our valiant @official_dgar personnel in Laitkor, Meghalaya. Assam Rifles, the Guardians of the North East, is India’s oldest paramilitary force. The nation is proud of its bravery and courage,” Shah tweeted.

This task may be completed within the next 15 days,” he said in the letter issued on July 22.The ministry further said that a dedicated help desk has been set up for the same.Detailing the process that has to be followed, the ministry official asked the district magistrates to conduct a drive for identification of these children, with the assistance of police, DCPU, childline and civil society organisations.Children, who have lost both their parents to Covid and requiring support under the scheme, may be produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) by Childline (1098), District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) or any other agency or individual within 24 hours of noticing the child, excluding the journey time, he said.Application form for seeking support under the scheme may be filled up by the child or caregiver or any other agency producing child before the CWC.The CWC with help of DCPU shall gather the facts regarding the child who has lost both parents, including details of deceased parents, home address, school, contact details, credentials and annual income of extended family members, relatives or kith and kin.He said the CWC shall verify the cause of death of the parents by way of their death certificate or by field enquiry. The information may be uploaded by the CWC on PM CARES for children portal, while submitting it for DM’s consideration.The CWC may upload details of all children produced or reported to them by other agencies on and after ascertaining the facts of each case, CWC may make its recommendations to the DM on the portal.“In case the CWC does not recommend a particular child, reasons should be recorded in the given space, for DM to take a view.“Principle of ‘First in First out’ may be followed while processing the applications. DM may accept the recommendations of CWC or seek a review through CWC or DCPU,” he said.       The district magistrate may make an independent assessment about every child recommended or not recommended by the CWC and the DM may be assisted by the Child Protection staff, Police, Childline or any other agency deemed fit for the purpose.“After satisfying herself, DM may confirm the eligibility of the child on the portal for the scheme and the decision taken by DM regarding the eligibility of a child under the scheme shall be final,” he said.In June, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) informed the Supreme Court that as many as 30,071 children were orphaned, lost a parent or abandoned mostly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, citing data submitted by different states till June 5.The government on July 22 told Parliament that a total of 645 children lost their parents to Covid-19 from April to May 28 this year during the second wave.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 29 announced a number of welfare measures for children who lost their parents to Covid-19, including ensuring a corpus of Rs 10 lakh when they turn 23 years of age and providing for their education.This corpus will be used to give monthly financial support or stipend from 18 years of age for the next five years to take care of his or her personal requirements during the period of higher education.On reaching the age of 23 years, they will get the corpus amount as one lump sum for personal and professional use.It was also announced that those between 11-18 years of age will be given admission in any central government residential school such as Sainik School and Navodaya Vidyalaya.

But they left no doubt that if the US raised issues relating to human rights, it would get a response. Talking diplomatically, sources here said, “issues such as human rights and democracy are universal and extend beyond a particular national or cultural perspective”.“India is proud of its achievements in both domains and is always glad to share experiences,” they added.In a pointed reference to the past of some western democracies that are now using human rights as a tool in diplomacy, the sources said, “As a long-standing pluralistic society, India is open to engaging those who now recognise the value of diversity.”But for these brief sparks, Blinken’s visit marks an increased tempo of high level interactions. Discussions on deepening the Quad engagement will a key focus area of his talks and he could announce another meeting of Quad Foreign Ministers later this yearThis will be Blinken’s first visit after assuming office and reciprocates the visit by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to the US in May. The two leaders had also met on the sidelines of the G7 and G20 meetings.With thousands of students waiting to rejoin courses in the US, the sources said India will press for gradual resumption of international travel, while maintaining health protocols. While tourists can wait, the MEA will especially press for easing mobility curbs for five broad categories—students, professionals, business travellers, family reunions and humanitarian cases.Binken in his talks will cover sale of defence equipment and transfer of defence technologies but these will be covered in greater detail during the fourth 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in the US later this year.Talks on the security situation will cover the all important Af-Pak region. The implications of withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, and the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan on terror financing and terror havens, will be part of the agenda. The sides will exchange their assessments about the Indo-Pacific region, economic slowdown and the latest developments in West Asia and Central Asia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/human-rights-blip-on-deepening-indo-us-ties-during-blinken-visit-288160
25-07-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus snooping row: CPI (M) Member of Parliament John Brittas moves SC for probe||Amid a brewing controversy over alleged snooping on around 300 activists, politicians, journalists and constitutional functionaries using Israeli spyware Pegasus, Communist Party India (Marxist) Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament John Brittas has moved the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored probe into it.Despite the very serious nature of allegations, the central government has not cared to probe into it but “made only a hopeful hope that the time-tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur”, Brittas said in a statement on Sunday.“Therefore, the queries were raised in the Indian Parliament with respect to this leakage. But the government has neither denied nor admitted the snooping by the spyware,” Brittas said, adding the allegations led to two inferences—either snooping was done by the government or by a foreign agency.Maintaining that the snooping allegations have caused concern among a large section of people, he said the scandal would have a chilling effect on free speech and expression.The government maintained that illegal surveillance was not possible with checks and balances in the country’s laws. Attempts were being made to malign the Indian democracy, it alleged.IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told the Lok Sabha on July 19 that reports on alleged snooping published on the eve of the Monsoon Session of Parliament “cannot be a coincidence”. There was “no substance” behind the sensationalism, he said.This is the second petition filed in the top court on the issue. Alleging that Pegasus snooping controversy was the biggest crime committed by the ruling party for political vested interests, Delhi-based advocate ML Sharma had on July 22 filed a PIL in the top court demanding a court-monitored SIT probe into it.Sharma—who has filed dozens of PILs on controversial issues—claimed the snooping controversy was an attack on Indian democracy and involved issues concerning national security and judicial independence.Made by the Israeli software firm NSO Group, Pegasus is said to be capable of infecting smartphones without users' knowledge and accessing all their data. Reports alleged that several opposition leaders, cabinet ministers, activists, and journalists were on the list of the potential targets of Pegasus snooping. Pegasus was not just a surveillance tool but a cyberweapon unleashed on India, Sharma alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-snooping-row-cpi-m-member-of-parliament-john-brittas-moves-sc-for-probe-288155

25-07-2021||Mumbai||28 pc Indians plan to travel in Aug-Sept; risk of third Covid wave set to rise: Report||With as many as 28 per cent Indians planning to travel in August-September, which is also the time for some of the major festivals in the country, the risk of the third wave of the pandemic is set to rise, according to a survey.In a statement, online platform LocalCircles also said its survey on April 12 had outlined the immediate second wave risk suggesting governments to impose travel restrictions.To estimate the risk once again in light of a potential third Covid-19 wave and to understand people’s travel plans for the coming months, LocalCircles conducted another survey. It also sought to understand the reason for their travel amid the second wave of the pandemic, it said.The survey received over 18,000 responses from citizens residing in 311 districts, with 68 per cent of respondents men and the rest women.LocalCircles said 28 per cent citizens are planning to travel during August-September though only 5 per cent have made their bookings. It added that during the second wave of the outbreak, many citizens faced teething issues to cancel their travel plan for the summer.In many cases, the travel agent or the airline did not refund anything, and some citizens lost the complete ticket amount, while some were able to retrieve a partial amount, and others were asked to re-book the ticket for a later date, it stated.As many citizens now look forward to travelling in August and September, the first question in the survey was to know about their current plan.“In response, it received from 9,146 people, 63 per cent of citizens said they don’t have a plan to travel during these two months.“Five per cent said they have plans and have booked the tickets, along with stays while 23 per cent said they have a plan to travel during these two months but have not booked tickets and they stay yet. Nine per cent  said they are undecided,” LocalCircles said in the statement.During this time, many parts of India have holidays for festivals and there is a good bit of travel that takes place. Many also tend to club these holidays with weekends by taking a day or two off, it stated.The survey also asked citizens about what kind of personal travel do they plan to undertake in the next two months.“In response, 13 per cent citizens said ‘holiday destination’, 39 per cent citizens said ‘visit family and friends’ and 22 per cent said ‘other travel’,” it said.The report added that the results of the survey indicate that of those who plan to travel in August-September, 54 per cent will be visiting friends and family.On an aggregate basis, if the data of those planning to travel in August-September is analysed, it indicates that 54 per cent plan to ‘visit family and friends’, 26 per cent will be travelling to ‘holiday destinations’, and 32 per cent will be undertaking other kinds of travel, according to the statement.In summary, with the decline in daily Covid-19 caseload, 28 per cent citizens plan to travel in August-September. As indicated by the findings of the survey, 23 per cent of citizens plan to travel in the next two months, though they haven’t booked their tickets yet and only 5 per cent of citizens surveyed have booked their tickets and accommodation, it stated.Of those who are planning travel, the majority of 54 per cent citizens are planning to meet their friends and family, while 26 per cent plan to travel to a holiday destination, LocalCircles said.“The government must continue to create awareness among people about limiting non-essential travel till the time the risk of a third Covid-19 wave greatly reduces.“The biggest challenge with travel when the virus is spreading was observed in March and April during the Kumbh Mela when as devotees went back to their hometowns, many came back with the infection,” LocalCircles said.The platform said it will also submit the findings of this survey with central and state governments, so that the same can be used as an input in policy decisions in regard to mitigating the risk of the third Covid-19 wave in India.Although the daily cases in India have declined significantly for nearly two months from four lakh to 40,000 range, infections in some districts continue to remain on an upward trajectory, particularly in Kerala and Maharashtra, said LocalCircles.“The test positivity rate in as many as 45 districts across India is reportedly still 10 per cent or higher.“PM Narendra Modi earlier this month expressed concerns about overcrowding at tourist destinations and markets and about the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra and Kerala, as they have been reporting an increasing number of infections,” it stated.It can be recalled that the spread of infection was highly concentrated in Maharashtra at the start of the second wave but the impact was later felt all across the country, the online platform said.It added, “PM Modi has told the Council of Ministers that there should be no space for carelessness or complacency and directed the ministers to take all possible precautions to contain and mitigate the spread.”          Experts have warned that with crowds building up, low adherence to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, the third wave is inevitable, and it could hit the country in August-September.Some experts have also highlighted the danger of Delta Plus variant spreading. However, so far, the number of cases of Delta Plus variant identified via genome sequencing across India have been less than 500, according to the statement.

25-07-2021||New Delhi||Tax raids against Dainik Bhaskar, Bharat Samachar smack of mala fides: Vivek Tankha||Asserting that there can be no democracy without freedom of press, Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha of the Congress on Sunday said the income tax searches against Dainik Bhaskar and Bharat Samachar smack of mala fides.The strong public perception is that these draconian actions have been initiated against these two media companies selectively to punish them for public-spirited reporting on the COVID-19 pandemic, he said in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.“There is no denying that the publication in question was critical of the government’s handling of the pandemic. It was stressing for more transparency while trying to hold accountable all those in power across political spectrum,” said Tankha, a Rajya Sabha member from Madhya Pradesh.He said it appears that the Income Tax Department has not adhered to the basic tenets of rule of law in their sensational press releases when the tax searches are in progress.Tankha, also a senior Supreme Court advocate, said it is disheartening to take note of various articles in newspapers that the Income Tax Department has pre-decided evasion liability of assessee whilst the search proceedings are still in operation and the steps of appraisal are yet to commence.Citing circulars by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the search and seizure manual, he said they make it clear that “such actions of issuing information pertaining to search operation to press are not only unwarranted, but also highly illegal”.“The basic tenets of rule of law require adherence to norms and prescriptions in vogue, lest our constitutional democratic values are rendered otiose and it turns into a power-centered rule of men,” he said.The CBDT had on Saturday claimed to have detected “fictitious transactions” of Rs 2,200 crore after the Income Tax Department carried out multi-city raids against the Dainik Bhaskar media group.It said the searches that were launched on July 22 in nine cities, including Bhopal, Indore, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Noida, are “continuing and further investigations are in progress.”                  The CBDT claimed to have seized documents and digital records that indicate “unaccounted” transactions of about Rs 200 crore after it raided the Lucknow-based Hindi news channel Bharat Samachar and its linked businesses.These searches were also carried out on July 22 in Lucknow, Basti, Varanasi, Jaunpur and Kolkata and at the residential premises of Bharat Samachar Editor-in-chief Brajesh Misra, state head Virendra Singh, BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh’s Harraiya Assembly seat Ajay Singh and some others.Tankha said, “There can be no democracy without freedom of press. As a concerned citizen, I would not raise a public protest for any legitimate action under the Income Tax Act; but today the nation stands convinced that the action against Dainik Bhaskar and Bharat Samachar under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act smacks of malafides.”        “By doing this media trial, and making onslaughts on the 4th pillar of democracy, what message your officials are giving to the masses?” he asked.“That to hold those who govern to any accountability is scorned at and will be met with vengeance? If anyone critical of the governments will be met with a media trial and sensationalisation, then don’t these actions reduce the whole idea of ‘of, by and for’ the people to a nullity?” Tankha said.In fact, playing to the gallery also casts a shadow on the genuineness, if any, of the actions of CBDT officials, Tankha said.This is anguish and a request to look beyond small vested interests in the larger public interest and goals which are founded on solemn constitutional aspirations, he said.He requested Sitharaman to “give due attention and confer required seriousness on the implications of what seems to be done unmindfully or by design by a handful of officials.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tax-raids-against-dainik-bhaskar-bharat-samachar-smack-of-mala-fides-vivek-tankha-288145
25-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sports techniques can be adapted for faster acclimatisation of troops in high altitude, says DRDO study||A new study by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has suggested that techniques used by sportspersons to enhance their performance can be used for faster acclimatisation of troops being deployed to high altitude areas.Since the Olympic Games were held at a high altitude in Mexico City in 1968, the usefulness of training at altitude or in hypoxic conditions for the improvement of aerobic exercise performance has received considerable attention among athletes, coaches, and scientistsIntermittent Hypoxia Training (IHT) at sea level has been recommended before proceeding to high altitude as an approach for rapid acclimatisation. This approach may be helpful to reduce the occurrence of acute mountain sickness and leads to better acclimatisation at high altitudes in a shorter duration.IHT consists of sessions in which an individual is required to breathe hypoxic or low oxygen level air for a few minutes alternated with intervals of breathing hyperoxic or normal air. Recent research has shown that the use of IHT in sports medicine improves physical performance and induces pre-acclimatisation without any pharmacological interventions. Exposure to moderate hypoxic episodes has also been shown to elicit beneficial effects by activating the adaptive responses in the human body and protects against hypertension, myocardial injuries, heart arrhythmia and bronchial asthma.Thirty Army personnel were divided into two groups. IHT was administered for four hours per day for four days at sea level and within 24-48 hours they were airlifted to 11,700 feet in Ladakh. Their bio-markers and vital parameters were analysed.Tests showed that IHT exposure decreased the oxidative stress markers and enhanced the level of antioxidants which facilitates faster acclimatisation to high altitudes. The findings of the study, undertaken by six scientists from DRDO’s Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, were published in June 2021.High altitude, according to the study, is associated with several environmental challenges such as low temperature, high-velocity winds, ionizing radiations, and low oxygen levels, which lead to a decrease in physical and mental performance. Rapid ascent to high altitude without proper acclimatisation may cause detrimental effects on health and also compromise operational capabilities.Proper acclimatisation can resolve the problems and reduce the severity of illness. This is vital in the Indian context as the Army deploys a large number of soldiers in high altitude areas in the eastern as well as western theaters. This number went up exponentially since the ongoing stand-off with China along the Line of Actual Control began in May last year.DRDO as well as the Directorate General Armed Forces Medical Services have been working on various technologies and methodologies to cut down on the acclimatisation period and mitigate mountain sickness. The present acclimatisation protocol is divided into three phases spread over 11 days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sports-techniques-can-be-adapted-for-faster-acclimatisation-of-troops-in-high-altitude-says-drdo-study-288139

25-07-2021||New Delhi||PM must make statement in Parliament, clarify whether snooping was done: Chidambaram on Pegasus row||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Sunday said the government should either call for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the Pegasus snooping allegations or request the Supreme Court to appoint a sitting judge to investigate the matter, and demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi make a statement in Parliament clarifying whether there had been surveillance or not.The former home minister said he was not sure that one can go to the extent of saying that the entire electoral mandate of 2019 was vitiated by the “unlawful snooping” but added that it may have “helped” the BJP to score that victory which has been “tainted” by the allegations.In an interview with PTI, Chidambaram also said a probe by a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) can be more effective than an investigation by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, asserting that the former would be more empowered by Parliament.Asked about Parliament IT panel head Shashi Tharoor’s remarks that the subject is “already on the mandate of my committee” and a JPC is not required, Chidambaram expressed doubts whether the IT panel with a majority of BJP members will allow a full investigation into the matter.“The parliamentary committee rules are rather strict. For example they cannot take evidence openly but a JPC can be empowered by Parliament to take evidence in public view, to cross examine witnesses, and to summon documents. So I think a JPC will have far more powers than a parliamentary committee,” he said.At the same time, he said he is not diminishing the role of the parliamentary committee to the extent it can probe the matter and is welcome to do so.Last Sunday, an international media consortium reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers, including of two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders besides scores of businesspersons and activists in India, could have been targeted for hacking through the Pegasus spyware of the Israeli firm NSO.The government has been denying all Opposition allegations in the matter.On the government’s response to the allegations, Chidambaram referred to IT and Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw statement in Parliament, saying he is obviously a very “clever minister” and therefore the statement has been “very cleverly worded”.“He (Vaishnaw) denies that there was any unauthorised surveillance. He does not deny that there was surveillance. He does not deny that there was authorised surveillance. Surely the minister knows the difference between authorised surveillance and unauthorised surveillance,” the Congress leader said.Posing questions for the government, he asked whether there was surveillance at all and whether snooping was done through Pegasus.“If Pegasus spyware was used, who acquired it? Was it acquired by the government or by one of its agencies,” he asked.The Rajya Sabha member also asked the government to come clean on the amount paid to acquire the spyware.“These are simple, straightforward questions which the average citizen is asking and the minister should answer that directly. After all, France has ordered an investigation when it was revealed that President (Emmanuel) Macron’s number was one of the numbers that were hacked. Israel itself has ordered an investigation by its National Security Council,” he said.If two major countries can order investigation, why should India not order a probe and find answers to the four simple questions, he asked rhetorically.Chidambaram said the matter also raises issues of national security because, if the government says that it did not conduct surveillance, then the question arises who conducted the snooping.“Was it a rogue agency in India doing it without the knowledge of the government or was it a foreign agency hacking into Indian telephones without the knowledge of the government. Either way...it is a more serious matter than the government conducting the surveillance,” he said.Asked about the Opposition’s demand of a Supreme Court-monitored probe and whether the top court should take it up suo motu, Chidambaram said he would not want to comment on what the court may or may not do, but pointed out that there is already a public interest litigation filed by one or two persons, separately, asking it to take suo motu cognisance of the Pegasus revelations.“Be that as it may, the government should request either Parliament to constitute a JPC or the government should request the Supreme Court to spare an honourable judge to conduct the investigation,” he said.Asked about Home Minister Amit Shah’s assertion that the allegations were aimed at humiliating India at the world stage, Chidambaram said the home minister chose his words very carefully and did not deny that there was surveillance.“He (Shah) does not deny that a certain number of telephones in India were hacked using Pegasus software. So, in fact, rather than what the home minister said, what he did not say is more important,” he said.If the home minister is unable to categorically deny that Indian telephones were infiltrated by the spyware, then obviously he must take responsibility for this “scandal” happening under his watch, Chidambaram said.Asked about the logjam in Parliament over the issue and calls from Opposition ranks that the PM should make a statement on the Pegasus issue, he said Modi should have made a statement on the first day of Parliament’s Monsoon Session itself when the allegations came to the fore.“Each minister knows only what is under his department. The PM knows what is happening under all departments. So, it is the prime minister who should come forward and say whether there was surveillance or not and if there was surveillance whether it was authorised or not,” Chidambaram said.“There are many questions and there will be supplementary questions which only the prime minister can answer. So why should the PM shy away from Parliament, he should come to Parliament and make a statement,” he said.—  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-must-make-statement-in-parliament-clarify-whether-snooping-was-done-chidambaram-on-pegasus-row-288133
25-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||In Goa, Nadda backs Pramod Sawant, says he has done good work||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 25Ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections, BJP president JP Nadda on Sunday said the party will be “going forward” with incumbent CM Pramod Sawant as its face.In Goa for a two-day visit to kickstart the party’s strategy for the upcoming polls to the 40-member Assembly, Nadda said Sawant has “done a very good job. Under his leadership, all-round development has taken place. We are going forward with him (as CM face in 2022 elections). In BJP, Parliamentary Board makes the official declaration but there is no need to think about any other name”.Speaking to the media, the BJP president also dismissed as “baseless and issueless” the Pegasus spyware controversy. “The Opposition led by Congress has got no issue which is related to people. That is why they raise such issues,” Nadda said addressing a press conference in the tiny beach state today.Accompanied by Sawant, state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade and other leaders, Nadda also exuded confidence about his party’s prospects in the next elections.This will be the first time that BJP will go to polls in the state without Manohar Parrikar, the late Goa CM who managed to give a certain edge to the saffron party with his popularity and charisma. Nadda’s visit to Goa comes at a time when the party is under deep stress with opposition parties accusing it of “jumla politics and fake promises and Covid mismanagement”.Sources say during the internal discussions with the party president, several ministers, and MLAs raised serious concerns regarding issues, including “employment situation, resumption of mining activities and apprehensions among minorities”.Though the BJP failed to get the majority in the 2017 Assembly elections, it managed to form the government with the help of Parrikar, then the defence minister in the Narendra Modi government. Parrikar was sworn in as CM of Goa in March 2017 after the Goa Forward Party, one of the parties that allied with the BJP after results, said it would support only if Parrikar was brought back to Goa as the CM.The GFP walked out of NDA earlier this year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-goa-nadda-backs-pramod-sawant-says-he-has-done-good-work-288132

Out of them, a small group of 200 farmers are now staging a protest at Jantar Mantar in central Delhi after getting special permission.

25-07-2021||New Delhi||Shrinking forests concern for seed dispersal by birds: Study||Do you know how does a forest re-generate naturally? Do you know the role played by frugivorous (fruit-eating) birds by way of bird-seeding in forest regeneration?Let us tell you a story about a rich cluster known for its remarkable biodiversity and contiguous tracts of lowland tropical evergreen forests from eastern Assam in northeast India, especially the Upper Brahmaputra Valley.But that was about half a century ago. Now, for a multitude of reasons, including agriculture, conversion to tea plantations and extraction of natural resources such as oil and timber, these rich forests have undergone severe fragmentation.Scientists tell us that as much as up to 90 per cent of plants in the tropical forests could be dependent on birds and animals for the dispersal of their seeds.For this reason, frugivorous birds are particularly referred to as the gardeners of the forests. And the relation is mutual. While the birds benefit from the nutrition they get from the fruit pulp, plants benefit, as birds carry their seeds away from the mother plant before dispersing them. In fact, for some species, the treatment that seeds receive in the guts of animals enhances their ability to germinate.Such mutually benefiting actions—called the ecological interactions—between plants and frugivorous birds facilitate the regeneration of plants, maintain biodiversity, and ensure good health of the forests.These are the forests that harbour a rich diversity of mammals such as the Asian elephant, Western hoolock gibbon (the only non-human ape species in India), capped langur, clouded leopard, Indian giant squirrel, and Malayan sun bear, to name a few.And unfortunately, these tropical lowland forests in northeast India experiences among the highest rates of forest loss and habitat fragmentation in the world.A recent study published in the journal Biotropica has now revealed how India's last remaining rainforest fragments harbour crucial ecological interactions and is of high conservation value."The scale at which forests are shrinking, it is crucial to find out how ecological interactions like the ones between plants and seed-dispersing birds are altered because of fragmentation. Our study looked at the differences in the plant and frugivorous bird communities between forest fragments and contiguous forest and found that fragments harbour diverse sets of interactions, said Abir Jain, the lead author of the study.Titled 'A comparison of plant-seed disperser communities between fragments and contiguous forest in northeast India', the study was carried out by a team of scientists from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, and the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF), Bengaluru.The researchers collected field data between January and April 2019 by observing the feeding activity of frugivorous birds inside the forests and documented the diversity of fruit species they fed upon. They picked up sampling from two forest fragments experiencing degradation pressures -- Doom Dooma Reserve Forest and Kakojan Reserve Forest.Samplings were also picked up from a less disturbed, better protected contiguous forest patch - Dehing Patkai National Park.The observations showed that the habitat fragmentation resulted in a reduction in the diversity of interactions between plants and frugivorous birds as well as brought changes in their composition.However, despite this, forest fragments continue to harbour distinct sets of interactions between plants and frugivorous birds. The authors documented 238 interactions between 63 fruiting plant and 44 frugivorous bird species across all sites.The study also reported that small-sized frugivorous birds (bulbuls and barbets) fed upon the highest number of fruit species at all sites, highlighting their crucial role in seed dispersal in contiguous and fragmented forests.And that is not all. There were related interesting findings too. Habitat degradation and associated gaps in the tree canopy in forest fragments could promote the fast growth of shrubs and climbers, it was found. Interestingly, fruits of certain climber species and fig trees were found to be important resources for frugivores, particularly in the fragments."Different species and individuals of figs fruit at different times of the year and serve as a vital source of food all year round, including the lean season. This underscores the importance of figs and the need to conserve them," said co-author of the study, Navendu Page, a plant ecologist from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII).Interestingly, the near-threatened White-throated Brown Hornbills were also found to be important seed-dispersers of large-seeded plants in the fragmented forests. Besides, the authors also documented their breeding in these rainforest fragments."This study highlights the value of the remnant forest patches even for large-sized birds, like the Brown Hornbill, that plays an important role in the dispersal of large seeds which not many other birds can disperse. The range of Brown Hornbill is shrinking in northeast India due to habitat loss and hunting, thus conserving these remnant forest patches for the conservation of these birds is vital," said Rohit Naniwadekar from NCF, the co-author of the paper. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shrinking-forests-concern-for-seed-dispersal-by-birds-study-288105

25-07-2021||Mumbai||UIDAI has suggested 28 cuts for 'Aadhaar', film already cleared by CBFC: Director||The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has raised objections to certain dialogues of the Hindi movie "Aadhaar" and has suggested "28 cuts", the director of the film Suman Ghosh said on Sunday.A mail sent to the UIDAI on the matter did not elicit a response.The film, starring "Mukkabaaz" actor Vineet Kumar Singh, has been co-produced by Jio Studios and Drishyam Films.According to Ghosh, officials from the UIDAI, the government agency mandated to issue Aadhaar, an easily verifiable 12 digit random number to all residents of India, had called Jio Studios and asked for a screening in January.The film was cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in 2019 and was gearing for a release on February 5 earlier this year when it was abruptly "pulled out" a week before its opening, he said."I found out that the release has been postponed. I was informed by Jio Studios on phone that the government agency saw the film and proposed 28 cuts," Ghosh told PTI from Kolkata over phone.The filmmaker, known for the National Award-winning Bengali feature "Podokkhep" and the documentary "The Argumentative Indian" on Nobel laureate Amartya Sen", said his film is "pro-Aadhaar" and that is why he is baffled by the current situation."It is a very frustrating situation for me because I don't know the way ahead. I am sure that if the right people see it from the government, there will be no problem. It's a pro-Aadhaar film, not a propaganda. So I am surprised by this." Ghosh said he was verbally communicated that the UIDAI objected to certain dialogues from the film, including the line, "Main Aadhaar Hoon" meaning "I Am Aadhaar", which the director claimed the officials felt was demeaning the Aadhaar programme.According to the makers, "Aadhaar" follows the story of a villager, Pharsua (Singh), who is the first to enrol for Aadhaar card in his village but due to a premonition concerning his wife's health by the village priest, he sets on an uphill task of getting his number changed.Another sequence, the UIDAI reportedly did not like, was a scene involving a curious villager trying to understand the privacy concerns of the Aadhaar card, and wondering if the government will now be privy to what goes on in their bathrooms.Ghosh said he tried to contact the UIDAI officials, asking for a formal letter with a list of the objections, but there was no response."There was every attempt to talk to the government from Jio Studios, but nothing got resolved in the last six months."Even I tried to contact the UIDAI. I sent emails, made some phone calls, but they didn't respond to me either. I had written to them, asking to provide me with a list of the cuts, but was only told verbally about some of them by Jio Studios."The filmmaker, who in the past had a run-in with the CBFC with his 2017 documentary "The Argumentative Indian", said there was at least an open dialogue between him and CBFC chairperson Prasoon Joshi on the matter then."Prasoon Joshi saw the documentary and found nothing objectionable. We argued over the use of one word. My experience with Prasoon Joshi was wonderful last time. But here, I just want a hearing by the UIDAI, to let me at least have a dialogue. I want to fight and resolve this problem," he said.Ghosh said he is unaware of the current status of the film, but believes Jio Studios is trying to resolve it from their end."Even if they have an objection, we can have a dialogue and try to resolve it, rather than stopping a film like this, where I am not being able to talk to anyone, that I find quite bizarre and odd," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uidai-has-suggested-28-cuts-for-aadhaar-film-already-cleared-by-cbfc-director-288100
25-07-2021||Jaipur||No contradiction among Rajasthan Congress leaders on Cabinet reshuffle: Ajay Maken||AICC general secretary Ajay Maken on Sunday said there is no contradiction among the party’s leaders in Rajasthan on the issue of Cabinet reshuffle and that they have expressed confidence in the high command for the decision.After meeting ministers, MLAs and office bearers at the party office here, Maken said all of them have unanimously left the decision of the cabinet reshuffle on the party high command.However, Maken did not disclose a date of the Cabinet expansion.“I can say that there is no contradiction among the party leaders and they all have left the final decision about the cabinet expansion to the party high command,” he told reporters.Maken, together with AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal, arrived at the party office in Jaipur for the meeting. He said issues like inflation and the Pegasus matter were discussed.“People of the country are suffering from high inflation, many have lost jobs during the pandemic, and instead of spending money and resources for people, the central government misused the resources for snooping and spying on leaders, journalists and judiciary. This is highly condemnable,” he said.To a question on the BJP’s allegations against PCC chief and Education Minister Govind Singh Dotasra of influencing the interview process of the Rajasthan Administrative Services 2018 examination in favour of two relatives, Maken said Dotasra is being cornered as he had targeted RSS leader Nimbaram and the BJP.Nimbaram, the regional pracharak of the RSS, is named in an FIR registered with the Anti-Corruption Bureau in a matter related to graft, and recently, Dotasra had said that the state government would give “treatment” to the RSS leader.By saying “treatment”, he apparently meant action against the leader.Maken said he would come to Jaipur again on July 28 to hold discussions with MLAs on the appointment of district and block presidents of the party.Venugopal and Maken late on Saturday night held discussions on the issues of cabinet reshuffle and political appointments with Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot at his residence.After Punjab, the party high command has shifted its focus to Rajasthan, where demands for Cabinet expansion and political appointments have gained momentum after reports of resentment in the camp led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who along with 18 MLAs had rebelled against the leadership of Gehlot last year.Three days back, Pilot had indicated that the Congress would take suitable steps soon to address issues raised by him.He had said that he is in touch with the party high command over the issues raised by him and hoped that the required steps would be taken soon.Pilot was sacked as the deputy chief minister and Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief in July last year after he rebelled against the leadership of Gehlot. After a one-month-long political crisis, the party high command announced to form a three-member committee to look into the issues raised by him.Last month, MLAs from the Pilot camp said that the party should fulfil the promises made to Pilot last month, following which the demand for Cabinet expansion and political appointments gained momentum.At present, there are 21 members in the council of ministers, including the chief minister, and nine slots are vacant.Rajasthan can have a maximum of 30 ministers.

25-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC to hear plea against Ramdev for remarks against allopathy||The Delhi High Court will hear on Monday a plea by seven doctors' associations against Yoga guru Ramdev for allegedly spreading misinformation by his statements against allopathy amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.The matter will be heard by Justice C Hari Shankar, who had earlier asked the counsel for the associations to place on record the videos pertaining to the alleged misinformation.The associations before court are three Resident Doctors' Association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Rishikesh, Patna and Bhubaneshwar, Association of Resident Doctors, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, Union of Resident Doctors of Punjab (URDP); Resident Doctors' Association, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut and Telangana Junior Doctors' Association, Hyderabad.They alleged that Ramdev was misleading and misrepresenting to the public at large that allopathy was responsible for the deaths of several people infected by Covid-19, and insinuating that allopathic doctors were causing deaths of the patients.In their plea, the associations have submitted that the yoga guru was sowing doubts in the minds of general public with respect to the safety and efficacy of not only allopathic treatments but also Covid-19 vaccines.Being a highly influential person, it is apprehended that Ramdev's statements can influence lakhs of people and divert them from allopathic treatment which are prescribed as the standard form of care even by the government, the plea submitted.The associations alleged in the plea that the misinformation campaign was nothing but an advertisement and marketing strategy to further the sales of the product sold by Ramdev, including Coronil which claims to be an alternative treatment for Covid-19.With the third wave of Covid-19 likely to set in August, it is imperative that Ramdev's sustained misinformation campaign be brought to a halt, the association has pleaded.The court had on June 3 issued summons to Ramdev on a plea by the Delhi Medical Association in connection with his alleged statements against allopathic medicines and claims regarding Patanjali's Coronil kit.The court had refused to restrain Ramdev at that stage, saying the allopathic profession was not so fragile.It had, however, orally asked Ramdev's counsel to tell him not to make any provocative statements. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-to-hear-plea-against-ramdev-for-remarks-against-allopathy-288074

25-07-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19 effect: Schools report 20-50 per cent dip in revenue; 55 per cent teachers faced salary cut||With the Covid-19 pandemic leading to prolonged closure, the majority of private schools across the country have reported a 20-50 per cent decrease in revenue, leading to a reduction in teachers' salaries at some of them, a new report said.The report by the Central Square Foundation (CSF), an NGO working on quality school education in India, is based on a study with over 1,100 respondents (parents, school administrators and teachers) across 20 states and union territories.While over 55 per cent of schools said there was a major reduction in the number of new admissions this academic year, three-fourth of the schools have faced delays in RTE reimbursements.Non-minority private schools have to provide free admissions to students selected by the state government under the 25 per cent RTE quota. In lieu of the free admissions, the state reimburses them an amount fixed in advance."Revenue decreased in the range of 20-50 pc for most schools but the cost heads have largely remained the same, thus making it difficult to continue operations seamlessly. Schools' revenues were hit by the inability of parents to pay fees regularly. This was highest among the urban schools. Fifty-five per cent of schools suggest that there was a major reduction in the number of new admissions in this academic year," the report said.At least 77 per cent of schools said they are not interested in taking a loan to support school finances during Covid-19, and only three per cent have successfully accessed loans, while five per cent are waiting for their loans to be processed."The schools reported that preferred source of loan is a public sector bank and the least preferred source is an NBFC," it said.At least 55 per cent of teachers across private schools faced a reduction in salary during the lockdown."Schools paid teachers partially since other cost heads (bills, rent, etc.) couldn't be avoided. Sixty-five per cent teachers' salaries were put on hold by low fee schools as compared to 37 per cent teachers whose salaries were put on hold by high fee schools. At least 54 pc teachers do not have an alternate source of income, 30 per cent supplemented their salary with private tutoring and coaching," the report said.It noted that 55 per cent of teachers are highly confident that their schools will be able to continue operations till the situation returns to normal. The confidence level significantly reduces among rural school teachers and low-fee school teachers.On the part of parents, at least 70 per cent of them reported that school fees remained the same, and only 50 per cent of parents reported paying the fees, indicating a massive dent in school revenues during the academic year, the report said."Twenty per cent parents reported an increased expenditure on technology and infrastructure and 15 pc reported increased education expenses. Seventy-eight pc parents reported that they will be able to continue to afford their child's education at the same school," it said.Schools across the country closed in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus and shifted to online learning.While in October last year, several states reopened schools partially, they were again closed down during the aggressive second wave of COVID-19 in April this year. Schools have again begun to reopen in several states, while some others have adopted a wait-and-watch policy.Education being a state subject, there was no directive regarding school fees during the pandemic by the Ministry of Education. However, a few states granted relief to parents by directing schools to charge only tuition fees or charge fees with reduced heads.According to a UNICEF report, the economic shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic have hit low-cost private schools (LCPS) especially hard."LCPS have found themselves under significant financial stress; teachers have reported losing their jobs, having their salaries cut, or not being paid at all. Thousands of LCPS have already shut down, and thousands more are on the brink of permanent closures. LCPS also struggled to provide remote learning support to their students, and the likelihood of extensive learning losses among returning students is significant," a recent report said.

25-07-2021||New Delhi||Audi, Mercedes-Benz upbeat about electrification journey of passenger vehicles in India||Luxury carmakers Audi and Mercedes-Benz are upbeat about the electrification journey of passenger vehicles in India, with more states coming up with EV policies that encourage electric four-wheelers, according to company officials.Although the FAME II scheme by the Centre has not offered direct benefits for personal passenger vehicles, incentives like 5 per cent GST on electric cars will also help, they feel.While Audi kicked off its electrification journey in India with the launch of three all-electric SUVs under the e-tron brand last week, Mercedes-Benz has been selling its all-electric SUV EQC since October last year.Audi India Head Balbir Singh Dhillon said while the overall policy at present has focussed primarily on the two-wheelers and three-wheelers, many of the state governments are also coming forward to give incentives to electric cars."When the states have already declared, there won't be a registration cost on the cars. You already know the GST on electric cars is 5 per cent. So these are already certain incentives the government has put in place, which will also encourage luxury players to also sell cars in the electric segment and these are definitely positive steps," he told PTI.Recently, states like Gujarat and Maharashtra have announced their respective EV policies.Gujarat has offered demand incentives of Rs 10,000/kwh for e2W, electric three-wheeler (e3W) and electric four-wheeler (e4W) over and above any subsidies available from the central government, with the maximum ex-factory prices being capped at Rs 1.5 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh, respectively for the three vehicle categories.On the other hand, Maharashtra is offering demand incentives of Rs 5,000/khw on 10,000 electric cars with the maximum incentive per vehicle being capped at Rs 1.5 lakh besides exemption of road tax and registration charges.Last year, under its EV policy, Delhi had announced a purchase incentive of Rs 10,000/ kWh of battery capacity per electric four-wheeler with a maximum incentive of Rs 1.5 lakh per vehicle for the first 1,000 e-cars to be registered in the Capital state. It has also offered a waiver of road tax and registration fees on all EVs.Upbeat about the electrification of personal passenger vehicles in India, Dhillon said, "I firmly believe that electric is the future for sure, especially also on the luxury side. We have decided that our focus is definitely going to be electric cars."Audi India has already set a target of 15 per cent of its total sales in the country to come from EVs by 2025 and will bring some of the EV models out of the 20 electric cars that it would launch globally by 2025 to India as well."So our focus is very clear, short term to long term. We are focusing on electric cars and we have very positive thoughts on this topic," Dhillon said.Expressing similar views, Mercedes-Benz India Vice-President, Sales & Marketing, Santosh Iyer said, "Mercedes-Benz will play a pivotal role in the introduction of latest technologies and products from our global portfolio for the Indian customers." The company is very satisfied with the positive customer response to the EQC since its India debut and the subsequent interest and awareness it has created for the luxury EV segment, he added."We are glad to witness subsequent introductions in the luxury EV segment that will further strengthen and widen the luxury EV segment from a consumers' perspective," Iyer said, adding the company's EV strategy has already led to a strong order intake for the EQC after selling out the initial allocations.He further said, "We already have a strong order intake for the EQC that indicates a sustained customer interest for India's first luxury EV, and the next batch of EQC is expected to arrive by September." Globally, the EQ brand is witnessing "massive success" with strong customer response to the EQS luxury sedan, Iyer said adding in the H1 2021, around 39,000 all-electric vehicles were delivered, including more than 19,000 units of the EQA, EQC and EQV models."Some of these models will eventually get introduced for the Indian market and we are very excited about the success story of the EQ brand in India as well," he said.However, Iyer said, "While the government focus on electrification of two-wheelers, three-wheelers and public transport is in the right direction, any additional incentives in form of reduction in import duties will enable commencement of local assembly of world-class EVs like the EQC, which will create a cost parity with ICE vehicles and lead to faster adoption of luxury EVs."Dhillon agreed that electrification is "going to be a journey where we have to be patient and continue to work on infrastructure, apart from cars to be successful" as it is going to be a technical one. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/audi-mercedes-benz-upbeat-about-electrification-journey-of-passenger-vehicles-in-india-288056

He then raped her while she remained in an unconscious and battered condition.Thereafter, he beheaded her with a sharp knife and buried her body in a cane field. Her body was traced after a part of her foot became visible from the soil in the shallow grave.Additional district government counsel (ADGC) Reetram Rajput said, "The accused, Pravesh Kumar, was caught red-handed by the police. The policemen had found the murder weapon and bloodstained clothes from his house. Stains of spermatozoa were also found on the clothes which were verified during forensic tests. We had enough circumstantial evidence to prove that the minor was last seen with Pravesh and his own confession of the crime was also considered by the court."The ADGC further said, "Fifteen witnesses were presented before the court. Pravesh was found guilty under sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences) of IPC along with the POCSO Act. The court has also slapped a fine of Rs 3.55 lakh on Pravesh.

So chances are high that you are listed even if you haven't had a Clubhouse login," he wrote.However, according to independent security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia, the data leak claim appears fake as the alleged Clubhouse data contains only mobile numbers without names."No names, photos or any other details are available. This list of phone numbers can be generated very easily. The data leak claim appears fake," Rajaharia told IANS.In February this year, researchers at Stanford University in the US had warned that the app may be leaking users' audio data to the Chinese government.The Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) had claimed that Agora, a Shanghai-based provider of real-time engagement software, supplies back-end infrastructure to the Clubhouse app.The company has now removed its waitlist system so that anyone can join the platform in a hassle-free manner.The company also said that it has added 10 million people to the community since its launch on Android in mid-May. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-has-been-no-data-breach-says-clubhouse-288054

The other popular beverages included wine, vodka and rum," it said.According to the study, whiskey is the most preferred alcohol among males (37.9 per cent), followed by beer (29.1 per cent), whereas females preferred beer (28.6 per cent), followed by wine (20.4 per cent).In an analysis carried out to identify the choice of alcohol vis-a-vis age groups, the study revealed that for those in the age group of 18-30 years, beer is the most preferred alcohol followed by vodka.Beer is the top alcohol choice for those in the age group of 31-40 years, followed by whiskey."However, as the age group increases, it is observed that whiskey is the most preferred alcohol, followed by beer," the study said.As far as overall preference percentages go, beer is the most preferred drink among tourists visiting Goa, with 29 per cent expressing their preference for it, followed by whiskey at 23 per cent, wine at 11 per cent, vodka at 10 per cent, while only nine per cent of the domestic tourists prefer rum.Goa's homegrown alcohol, the traditionally manufactured cashew 'feni', ranks way below in the pecking order as far as the palette of domestic tourists is concerned."Among the lesser preferred alcohols were gin at 7 per cent, cocktails at 4 per cent, brandy at 3 per cent, feni, which is the local alcoholic beverage of Goa, at 2 per cent, followed by tequila and liqueurs at 1 per cent," the study revealed.Knocking down a few drinks at the restaurant table is most favoured by tourists when it comes to places to consume alcohol followed by pubs or taverns or beach shacks."The most popular drinkscape preferred by the tourists for consuming alcohol is restaurants (28 per cent), followed by pubs or taverns (19 per cent) and beach shacks (17 per cent)."The other popular drinkscapes in order of popularity are discotheques and karaoke bars (8 per cent each), lounges (6 per cent), hotels and upscale bars (3 per cent each), alcohol events/festivals (2 per cent) and tasting rooms (1 per cent)," the study said.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/beer-whiskey-top-picks-for-tourists-in-goa-wine-2nd-choice-study-288031

Hailing Amma’s never say die spirit, leaders across the political spectrum tweeted praises for her with Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan describing her an inspiration.Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan tweeted, “Bhageerathi Amma personified sheer determination to become literate. Her name reminds us of the usage Bhageeratha prayatnam. Her unfailing will to succeed in learning at the age of 105 was an inspiration to everyone who wishes to learn.” Minister of State for External AffairsV Muraleedharan also hailed the late Amma, saying age was just a number for her. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-oldest-learner-no-more-tributes-pour-in-287958

Thompson reacted sharply to the “whole notion of using this type of technology against civil society, or regime critics, or journalists, or anybody like that through extrajudicial means” and said as broader issue, the US has been vocal about trying to find ways for companies to ensure that their technology is not used in “these types of ways”.“And we will certainly continue to press those issues,” he added. But the thrust of Blinken’s talks with PM Narendra Modi, where NSA Ajit Doval may be present, and with his counterpart S Jaishankar will be on expanding security, defence, cyber, and counter-terrorism cooperation.After the Blinken visit, the next major engagement will be the US-India 2+2 ministerial dialogue involving foreign and defence ministers of both countries. The United States is likely to host PM Modi at the White House later this year. On Afghanistan, the US position, as stated by the officials, would be of interest to India. New Delhi has frequent high-level conversations with Kabul signalling its stakes in the current government.Speaking on Quad, the officials said its goal of producing 100 crore vaccines had faced some delay as India battled the second wave.

Gun-trotting Afghan Taliban terrorists, backed by Pakistan’s ISI, may not be able to come into Kashmir across the well-defended 772-km Line of Control (LoC).After 1989, when the Soviet Union Army exited Afghanistan, a large number of foreign terrorists who were fighting the Soviets were directed by the ISI towards Kashmir, which gave birth to terrorism in the Valley.In the past 20 years, the LoC has been fortified with an electrified fence, latest technology, and sensors and gadgets that can spot intruders. Snipers can fire at intruders with night-sight enabled rifles.In the early 1990s, terrorists could walk in with guns as there was no fence, no sensor or equipment for night surveillance. Data with the South Asia Terrorism Portal, which collates information on terrorism, says 994 persons, including 132 security personnel lost their lives to militants in the Valley in 1990. This was quantum jump over the 92 deaths, including 13 security personnel during 1989. In the next decade, between 1990 and 2000, a whopping 13,534 lives were lost, including 3,067 security personnel. During the same period, 12,247 terrorists were killed. Since 2002, when the US-led forces started controlling Afghanistan, there has been a steady decline in fatalities, with 2020 ending with 321 deaths, including 232 terrorists. The Indian security establishments are well aware of the Taliban, which work closely with the ISI. Western security agencies have identified thousands of Pakistani terrorists from the Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and other groups that are fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan.Other than the “morale boost” for a minuscule section of the radicalised youths in the Valley, Taliban’s control over Afghanistan is not expected to have any immediate bearing on ground as of now, say sources in the security establishment.Terror web(South Asia Terrorism Portal’s data)Pak deploys troops along Af border Decline in fatalitiesSince 2002, when the US-led forces started controlling Afghanistan, there has been a steady decline in fatalities, with 2020 ending with 321 deaths, including 232 terrorists.Prez on 4-day visit to J&K from todayPresident Ram Nath Kovind will visit Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh from July 25 to 28, and also grace the convocation ceremony of the University of Kashmir during his tour.

The tax effect and violation of other laws are being examined,” the statement alleged.The media group, on the day of the raids, had posted a message on its website saying the government was scared of its true journalism.From bodies in river Ganga to Corona deaths, the group that brought the real numbers in front of the country is being raided by the government, it alleged in a message in Hindi. “I am independent because I am Bhaskar, Only the readers’ will matters in Bhaskar,” it had said.The CBDT statement alleged that the group has more than 100 companies, including the holding and subsidiary companies, and that they have been operating several companies in the names of their employees that have been used for booking “bogus” expenses and routing of funds.“During the search, several of the employees, whose names were used as shareholders and directors, have admitted that they were not aware of such companies and had given their Aadhaar card and digital signature to the employer in good faith.“Some were found to be relatives, who had willingly and knowingly signed the papers but had no knowledge or control of the business activities of the companies, in which they were supposed to be directors and shareholders,” the CBDT claimed.Such companies, it alleged, have been used for multiple purposes like “booking bogus expenses” and “siphoning off” the profits from listed companies, routing of funds so siphoned into their closely held companies to make investments, making of circular transactions etc.“The nature of such bogus expenditures booked vary from supply of manpower, transport, logistics and civil works and fictitious trade payables.“The quantum of income escapement using this modus operandi, detected so far, amounts to Rs 700 crore spread over a period of six years,” it claimed.However, the quantum may be more as the group has used multiple layers and investigations are being carried out to unravel the entire money trail, it added.The statement said the tax department is probing the violation of certain sections of the Companies Act and Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement prescribed by SEBI for listed companies in this case.“Application of Benami Transaction Prohibition Act will also be examined,” it said.The CBDT said the real estate entity of the group is operating a mall and had been sanctioned a term loan of Rs 597 crore from a nationalised bank.  “Out of this, an amount of Rs 408 crore has been diverted  to a sister concern as a loan at a low interest rate of one per cent.”“While the real estate company has been claiming expenses of interest from its taxable profit, it has been diverted for personal investments of the holding company,” it alleged.The listed media company “does barter deals” for advertisement revenues, whereby immovable properties are received in place of actual payments, it said.“Evidences have been found indicating cash receipts in respect of the subsequent sale of such properties. This is under further examination,” the statement said.The CBDT said “evidences” found during the raids indicate receipt of on-money in cash, on sale of flats by the realty arm of the group.“The same has been confirmed by two employees and a director of the company.”“The modus operandi as well as the corroborating documents have been found. The exact amount of out-of-books cash receipts are being quantified,” it said.The tax officials found a total of 26 lockers in the residential premises of the promoters and key employees of the group, which are being operated, it said.

The result has been prepared on an alternative assessment policy decided by the board."In class 10, girls and boys have achieved a pass percentage of 99.98 per cent. In class 12, the pass percentage of girls is 99.86 per cent, while that of boys is 99.66 per cent," CISCE Chief Executive and Secretary Gerry Arathoon said.He noted that unlike previous years the option of rechecking of answer scripts will not be available this year as candidates have been awarded "imputed marks". However, a dispute resolution mechanism will be in place for correction of calculation errors, if any.A total of 2,422 schools had presented candidates for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) exam which is the class 10 examination, while 1,166 schools had presented candidates for the Indian School Certificate (ISC) exam which is the class 12 exam.A total of 2,19,499 candidates, including 54.14 per cent boys and 45.86 per cent girls, appeared for class 10 exams, while 94,011 candidates, including 53.67 per cent boys and 46.33 per cent girls appeared for class 12 exams.For class 10 exams, there were 59 written subjects of which 22 were Indian languages, 11 foreign languages and one classical language; and for class 12 exams, there were 50 written subjects of which 13 were Indian languages, five foreign languages and two classical languages.For evaluating class 12 candidates, the parameters included average marks of papers and subjects scored in class 11 and 12 through the academic years 2019-20 and 2020-21, respectively.The average of class 10 marks, including English and best four subjects, and marks of project work and practical exams during class 12 have also been considered in calculation of the final results.For class 10, the result has been tabulated on the basis of average marks scored by candidates in various exams and tests in class 9 and 10 besides internal assessment marks, including the project and practical work.The southern region has the best pass percentage (100) followed by the western region having a pass percentage of 99.99 per cent in class 10.Whereas in class 12, southern and western regions have the best pass percentage (99.91) followed by northern region having a pass percentage of 99.75 per cent.Also read:"This year has been an extremely difficult one for the entire country, with the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic wreaking havoc and impacting every aspect of life, especially the educational sector."In spite of the severe crisis, the CISCE has, against all odds and difficult circumstances, prepared, and tabulated the results for class 10 and 12. To tabulate the results, the CISCE, after much deliberations, had decided on the broad parameters which were used for the compilation of marks."The data submitted by the schools was analysed by a team of reputed statisticians from some of the premier institutions in the country, along with senior board officials. While devising the methodology for computing marks, the endeavour was to ensure fairness to all candidates concerned to the best possible extent," Arathoon said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cisce-results-girls-boys-achieve-same-percentage-in-class-10-girls-outshine-boys-in-class-12-287653

25-07-2021||Srinagar/New Delhi||Arms licence case: CBI carries out search at 40 locations in J-K, Delhi||The CBI on Saturday conducted searches at 40 locations in Jammu and Kashmir, and in the national capital in connection with cases related to alleged irregularities in the issuance of over 2.78 lakh arms licences to non-residents on forged documents during 2012-16, officials said.The search operation was spread across Jammu, Srinagar, Udhampur, Rajouri, Anantnag, Baramulla and Delhi at the official and residential premises of public servants, including IAS officers, around 20 gun houses among others in an ongoing investigation of a case related to arms licence racket, a CBI spokesperson said in a statement.Premises of two IAS officers—Shahid Iqbal Choudhary, posted as Secretary of Tribal Affairs in the Jammu and Kashmir government, and Niraj Kumar, Additional Resident Commissioner of UT in the national capital—were searched, the officials said."With reference to media reports, I have to confirm that CBI did search my residence and found nothing incriminating in ongoing arms license probe. Media friends may note the probe covers 4 years across all districts. I am fully answerable to CBI for my tenure," Choudhary tweeted.He said oversight or procedural indiscretion in a few cases cannot be completely ruled out as these pass through several clerical stages."Of the 36,000 licences issued in Udhampur between 2012-16, only 1,500 odd (less than 4 per cent) issued under my tenure," Choudhary said, adding that this number was the lowest among licences issued by all DMs.He said he has complied with the agency's enquiries and was committed to doing so in the future as well.He added that out of 4.49 lakh arms licences issued in Jammu and Kashmir during 2012-16, only 56,000 were issued in the three districts of Reasi, Kathua and Udhampur where he served as the DM."This is not disproportionate. Of the 56,000 licences issued in three districts—Reasi, Kathua and Udhampur—between 2012-16, only 1,720 were issued in my tenure which is three per cent of all licences issued in three districts in four years or during the period under investigation and 0.38 per cent of all such licences issued in Jammu and Kashmir," he said.The residence of a retired officer of Kashmir Administrative Service, Shabir Ahmad Bhat, who has served as DM of Rajouri, was also searched, the officials said.Besides this, premises of six additional DMs who had served in Poonch, Kupwara, Bandipora, Baramulla and Ramban during 2012-16 were also searched by the CBI, they said.The agency had registered two separate FIRs into the alleged irregularities on October 16, 2018.The CBI had in December 2019 carried out searches at over a dozen locations in Srinagar, Jammu, Gurgaon and Noida on the premises of then district collectors and magistrates of Kupwara, Baramulla, Udhampur, Kishtwar, Shopian, Rajouri, Doda, Pulwama, and several other places.The searches were carried out in connection with a probe into two cases pertaining to the alleged issuance of around two lakh arms licences from different districts of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by their collectors and magistrates. It is alleged that arms licences were issued in lieu of illegal gratification."During investigation and scrutiny of documents, the role of certain gun dealers was found who in connivance with the public servants i.e. the then DM and ADM of concerned district had allegedly issued such illegal arms licences to the ineligible persons. It was also alleged that the persons who got these licences were not residents of the places from where the said arms licenses were issued," CBI spokesperson RC Joshi said in a statement.It is alleged in the FIR that then public servants in cahoots with other accused issued arms licences to non-residents of state in violation of rules and received illegal gratification.The CBI spokesperson said it is alleged that more than 2.78 lakh arms licences were issued to non-entitled people between 2012 and 2016."The CBI also collected documents pertaining to the issuance of said armed licences allegedly spread over 22 districts of J-K," Joshi said.The Rajasthan ATS had unearthed the scandal in 2017 and had arrested over 50 people for their alleged involvement in the illegal issuance of arms licences. According to the ATS, over 3,000 permits were granted allegedly in the name of Army personnel.Based on ATS findings, then Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra had handed over the matter to the CBI. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arms-licence-case-cbi-carries-out-search-at-40-locations-in-j-k-delhi-287621
25-07-2021||---||Human rights, Pegasus to come up during Blinken's visit||New Delhi, July 24US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will arrive here on Tuesday with a heavy security-side agenda along with discussions on human rights, said two senior State Department officials while briefing the media on Blinken’s twin-country visit.Human rights is a regular talking point in meetings of Indian diplomats with their European and American counterparts but this administration will be attempting to draw a distinction between its responses and those by the Trump administration.  “We will raise it, and we will continue that conversation, because we firmly believe that we have more values in common on those fronts than we don’t,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Dean Thompson when asked why he hadn’t mentioned human rights in his opening statement.Asked if he could “quell any jitters” because of the Modi government's close ties with the previous US administration and whether India will remain a top priority under the Biden administration,” Thompson said the relationship with India had endured through administrations of “all colours and stripes in the United States, and will continue to do so”. The Pegasus controversy, but in a broader sense, could also be one of Blinken’s talking points. Thompson reacted sharply to the “whole notion of using this type of technology against civil society, or regime critics, or journalists, or anybody like that through extrajudicial means” and said as a broader issue, the US has been vocal about trying to find ways for companies to ensure that their technology is not used in “these types of ways”. “And we will certainly continue to press those issues,” he added.But the thrust of Blinken’s talks with PM Narendra Modi, where NSA Ajit Doval may be present, and with his counterpart S Jaishankar will be on expanding security, defence, cyber, and counterterrorism cooperation. The Biden administration’s move towards tighter geo-security proximity with India began with the visit by Defence Secretary Llloyd Austin. After the Blinken visit, the next major engagement will be the US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue involving Foreign and Defence Ministers of both countries. The US is likely to host Modi at the White House later this year.On Afghanistan, the US position, as stated by the officials, would be of interest to India. New Delhi has frequent high-level conversations with Kabul signalling its stakes in the current government. “We certainly intend to continue our relationship with the Afghan government,” said Thompson, adding that the US wanted “just and durable peace through a negotiated political settlement”.Blinken will hold talks in New Delhi “to realise that goal” and “to find ways to bring the parties together to end the longstanding war”. The US has already conducted bombing runs to destroy the equipment captured by the Taliban.  Speaking on Quad, whose summit was one of the first multilateral events Biden hosted (virtually) this year, the officials said its goal of producing 100 crore vaccines had faced some delay as India battled the second wave. But the working groups have been meeting and the plan still remains for the billion doses to roll out in 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/human-rights-pegasus-to-come-up-during-blinkens-visit-287610
