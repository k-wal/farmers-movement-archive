Though my parents are quite happy with this decision, for me it was disheartening because during lockdown, it was my only tool to get rid of so much of monotony,” Krishnatray told IANS.“Government has banned many apps but we need alternatives at the earliest,” he said.The news of PUBG ban spread like wildfire on social media platforms and within minutes “PUBG Banned” became the top trending topic on Twitter.Many “PUBG lovers” wrote paeans to the app, even as they lamented the days that they would have to pass without playing the game.The PUBG game, which has more than 600 million downloads and 50 million active players globally, has millions of users, especially young, in India.India’s move to ban PUBG Mobile and 117 other Chinese apps came after the fresh Chinese aggression in Indian territory at Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh.“This move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users. This decision is a targeted move to ensure safety, security and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace,” the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a statement, announcing the ban of the apps.Technology lawyer Mishi Choudhary said that the Indian government has the power to restrict access to the apps under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act.“Whether 59 apps are banned or 118, all this underscores how technology and geopolitical matters are becoming two strands of a braid,” said Choudhary, who is also Founder of SFLC.in, a legal services organisation working on law, technology and policy.“The data protection law, conspicuous by its absence, has never been more important than now,” she said.Meanwhile, several Indian startups have welcomed the decision.“The government, time and again, has proved to support the Indian startup ecosystem. This indeed would just motivate the Indian ecosystem, and we would see more Indian companies going global,” said Sumit Ghosh, CEO and Co-Founder of short video app Chingari.“Now Indian business apps will get ample opportunity to empower other local businesses with their technology, which will in turn boost the economy by leaps and bounds,” said Sonakshi Nathani, Co-Founder Bikayi App. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pubg-ban-in-india-parents-happy-youth-shocked-135328
02-09-2020||New York||Isha Ambani, Akash Ambani, Adar Poonawalla named in Fortune's 40 Under-40 list||Reliance Jio Board Directors Isha Ambani and Akash Ambani, Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla and Byju Raveendran, co-founder of India’s leading education technology company Byju’s, are among the “emerging leaders” from across the world named by Fortune in its annual list of influential people under the age of 40.The 2020 Fortune 40 Under 40 list highlights 40 influential people each in five categories of finance, technology, healthcare, government and politics, and media and entertainment from around the world.Featured in the list are 28-year-old Ambani twins, children of Reliance Chairman billionaire Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani.“They say data is the new oil— and when it comes to Reliance Industries, India’s largest company, that’s literally the case. The 47-year-old conglomerate amassed a fortune in petrochemicals before dominating India’s mobile connectivity market with Jio, a low-cost wireless carrier it debuted in 2016,” Fortune said.It added that Akash joined the company in 2014 after receiving an economics degree from Brown University and Isha joined a year later, following stints at Yale, Stanford, and McKinsey.“As Jio board members, they helped seal the company’s recent megadeal with Facebook—$5.7 billion for a 9.99% stake—plus major follow-on investments from marquee tech titans like Google, Qualcomm, and Intel. The flurry of investments lent the business an eye-popping $65 billion private valuation,” Fortune said.The US publication added that the siblings, along with their younger brother Anant, 25 are “training…to take on their father’s empire.“A major proving ground will be e-commerce. Recently, Akash and Isha helped launch Jio Mart, a venture that aims to challenge Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart for command of India’s massive and fast-growing online shopping market.”The list names Raveendran, the 39-year old CEO of Byju’s, India’s “biggest education technology company.”“Raveendran has shown the world that it really is possible to build a massively successful online education company,” Fortune said, adding that the company is helping “millions of students prep and study for the most important exams of their lives” while also teaching them about core topics like mathematics and science.“Since its founding in 2011, the red-hot education startup has raised over USD 1 billion and is now worth more than USD 10 billion. Raveendran will need that cash as he aims to expand Byju’s into new countries like the United States and the United Kingdom,” Fortune said.In August, Byju’s bought the education technology startup WhiteHat Jr. for USD 300 million.On Poonawalla, Fortune said “few people on the planet are more in demand right now than Poonawalla,” the CEO of his family-owned company, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines.It said the Serum Institute of India (SII) has long played a vital role in global public health and in a “normal” year, most of the 1.5 billion doses of vaccines the company produces go to immunise children in low- and middle-income countries through programs administered by organisations like Unicef and GAVI.“This year, of course, has been far from normal. With the race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 in full swing, SII, with its enormous manufacturing capacity, has been an obvious place for pharma companies to turn,” it said.SII has inked deals with both AstraZeneca and Novavax, committing to manufacture one billion doses of each vaccine, priced at USD 3 a shot, for low-and middle-income countries. The pharma company has expanded its geographical reach in recent years by acquiring production facilities in Czechoslovakia and The Netherlands and is also working to develop a couple COVID-19 vaccines itself, Fortune said.The list also includes SoftBank Group Senior vice president, investments Akshay Naheta (39), Head of digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) at TD Ameritrade Sunayna Tuteja, Global vice president Xiaomi and managing director, Xiaomi India Manu Kumar Jain (39), Maverick Ventures Managing director Ambar Bhattacharyya (37), PharmEasy Cofounders Dhaval Shah and Dharmil Sheth (31) and ACLU Chief product and digital officer Deepa Subramaniam (39).On Jain, Fortune said Jain knew nothing about smartphones when Chinese giant Xiaomi tapped him in 2014 to build its India operations from the ground up. Jain had founded fashion e-commerce player Jabong that was sold to Flipkart.“In his quest for knowledge at the start of his new gig, the executive regularly carried between 30 to 40 smartphones in his bag, testing out features and checking out competitors,” Fortune said.It added that under Jain, Xiaomi overtook Korean giant Samsung to become the smartphone leader in India in just three years, bolstered by a strategy to act more like an Indian company. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isha-ambani-akash-ambani-adar-poonawalla-named-in-fortunes-40-under-40-list-135327

02-09-2020||Washington||China engaged in clear, intensive intensifying pattern of bullying neighbours: Pompeo||Hoping for a peaceful resolution of the situation on the India-China border, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday asserted that the Communist Party of China is engaged in a “clear and intensive intensifying pattern of bullying” its neighbours from the Taiwan Strait to the Himalayas.That bullying is also evident in the South China Sea, he told reporters at the Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State Department.“We are hoping for a peaceful resolution of the situation on the India-China border. From the Taiwan Strait to the Himalayas and beyond, the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in a clear and intensive intensifying pattern of bullying its neighbours,” Pompeo said.“Last week, the US imposed sanctions and visa restrictions on Chinese individuals and entities responsible for the CPC’s imperialism and doing things such as unlawful energy surveillance activities in the economic zones of our ally the Philippines and other countries,” he said.The US, he said, also remains concerned about the activities of more than 300 Chinese flag vessels near the Galapagos which are almost certainly engaged in illegal fishing.The Galapagos Islands is a volcanic archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. It is a province of Ecuador.“In light of this maritime lawlessness, it is no surprise that Beijing’s candidate in the international tribunal for the law of the sea election last week received more abstentions than any other candidate,” he said.China is the most flagrant violator of the Law of the Sea convention and nations all across the world are registering their disapproval, the top US diplomat said.“We are also concerned about the Chinese actions… in light of the General Secretary (President Xi Jinping’s) recent calls on Tibetan Buddhism and fight split. We continue to call upon Beijing to enter into a dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives without preconditions to reach a settlement…” Pompeo said.Next week, Pompeo is scheduled to have a series of virtual meetings with his counterparts from Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Indo-Pacific countries. In addition to bilateral and regional issues, Pompeo said that he will also raise how the Trump administration is restoring reciprocity to the US-China relationship.“For years, the Chinese Communist Party has imposed significant barriers on American diplomats working inside the PRC (People’s Republic of China).“Specifically the Chinese Communist Party has implemented a system of opaque approval process which is designed to prevent American diplomats from conducting regular business, attending events, securing meetings, and connecting with the Chinese people, especially on university campuses and via the press and social media,” he said.The Secretary of State said that the State Department has established a mechanism requiring approval for senior Chinese diplomats in the US to visit university campuses and to meet with the local government officials.“Cultural events with groups larger than 50 people hosted by the Chinese embassy and consular outside our missions will also require our approval. Additionally, we are taking further steps to ensure that all official PRC embassy and consular social media accounts are properly identified as the Chinese government accounts,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-engaged-in-clear-intensive-intensifying-pattern-of-bullying-neighbours-pompeo-135325
02-09-2020||Mumbai||Rhea’s father questioned for 10 hours by CBI on second day||Actress Rhea Chakraborty’s father was questioned by the CBI for the second consecutive day on Wednesday in connection with the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, a police official said.He was interrogated for around 10 hours by the central agency team, the official said.The 28-year-old actress and her family members are accused of abetting the suicide of Rajput (34), who was found hanging in his flat in suburban Bandra on June 14.Her father Indrajeet Chakraborty reached the DRDO guest house in suburban Kalina, where the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team is stationed, around 10.30 am in a car escorted by a police vehicle, the official said.After the questioning, he left the place around 8.30 pm, he added.According to the official, Rajput’s manager Samuel Miranda, his cook Neeraj Singh, house staff Keshav and business manager Shruti Modi, who had also reached the guest house in the morning for questioning, left the place at night after Chakraborty.Rhea Chakraborty, her brother and mother were not summoned on Wednesday, the official said.On Tuesday, the probe team questioned the actress’s father and mother for over eight hours in connection with the case.The actress was earlier questioned for around 35 hours over four days from last Friday till Monday.Rajput was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14 following which the Mumbai Police registered a case of accidental death.The late filmstar’s father subsequently filed a police complaint in Patna, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his suicide and misappropriating his money.The Supreme Court last week upheld the transfer of the FIR lodged in Patna to the central agency.The CBI has so far remained tight-lipped about details of its probe into the high-profile case which has been hogging media limelight.

The Enforcement Directorate is probing allegations of money laundering against Rhea and her family; Narcotics Control Bureau is looking into claims that she used to consume drugs and also supply them to Rajput.

02-09-2020||New Delhi||Malicious campaign by few channels to defame Sushant’s family, benefit Rhea: Lawyer||Sushant Singh Rajput’s family lawyer Vikas Singh on Wednesday said a malicious campaign relating to his mental health was being run by few TV channels to defame his family and benefit actress Rhea Chakraborty, who has been accused of abetting the actor’s suicide.The senior advocate told the media that Sushant’s three sisters—Priyanka, Mitu and Rani—told him that they are extremely pained by the negative and false campaign related to his mental health which has been started by some news channels.            The lawyer said the FIR lodged by Sushant’s father is in public domain and in spite of this it is being said that the family was aware about his depression.“The FIR clearly mentions that Sushant started having mental problems after Rhea came in his life. It also mentions that she was responsible for the problems and he became anxious due to the mental problems. “Rhea never disclosed the files about Sushant’s treatment to the family. Some of the prescriptions which were shared only mentioned about tablets and not the disease,” Singh said at a press conference here.The senior advocate said that a campaign is being run relentlessly by some channels and it is the earnest appeal of the family that do not increase sufferings of a bereaved family.“Please do not add to the suffering of the family by spreading canard and false accusations,” he said.Singh also said that a suggestion is being made that Sushant had a life insurance policy and the family would not get the money if he is declared to have died by suicide.“And it is for this reason that the suicide theory was later changed to abetment of suicide. I must inform all of you that Sushant did not have any life insurance policy,” he said.He also said that Sushant’s father and sister have decided that no film/serial/book should be written/made without consent of his father and without script being shown to him.     “If anyone goes against it, they will do it at their own peril and appropriate action will be taken,” Singh said.Sushant, 34, was found dead at his Bandra residence. The actor’s untimely demise was followed by a high-profile investigation by Mumbai Police during which many big names from Bollywood, including filmmakers Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Aditya Chopra, recorded their statements.Later, the Supreme Court handed over the investigations to the CBI.Rhea is the main accused in the actor’s death case in which the Enforcement Directorate has registered a case of money laundering.The Narcotics Control Bureau has filed a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act after the ED shared with it a report following the cloning of two mobile phones of Rhea.

02-09-2020||New Delhi||GST shortfall: More states seek PM’s intervention, oppose Centre’s twin options||The Centre’s attempt of providing two options to give back states their GST dues failed to take-off after more Opposition Chief Ministers wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi while BJP ruled states of UP and Gujarat and Bihar have sought an extension of one week’s deadline to submit their preferences.On Wednesday, CMs of Kerala and West Bengal, Pinarayi Vijayan and Mamata Banerjee, respectively, wrote to the PM asking him not to go ahead with plans of transferring GST compensation burden on to states. They also mentioned the dire straits of state finances due to a massive revenue shortfall. Earlier, the CMs of Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu had written to the PM while the Chattisgarh CM had written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Besides, Punjab, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have also expressed their opposition.  Kerala suggested a third option that entailed the Centre borrowing the full amount on their behalf and the states extending the cess to recoup the amount. The states have also toyed with the option of approaching the Supreme Court but want to first exhaust the political options of approaching the PM as well as discussing the issue again at the next GST Council meeting on September 19. The Kerala CM said states had accepted the uniform GST rates despite the rate fall inbuilt in the GST structure because of the statutory backing given to the promised compensation.The move against the Centre’s two options to make good the shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore was first initiated by Punjab, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Puducherry who, in a webinar convened by Congress President Sonia Gandhi, had rejected the two options given by the central government to bridge the GST Compensation gap. Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal has suggested constituting a Group of Ministers which should make recommendations in a time-bound period of 10 days.Banerjee accused the PM of “undermining federalism’’ and directed her party to hold three rounds of protest for the withholding of dues. “This is a travesty and an abrogation of the fundamental basis on which the states gave up 70 per cent of their taxing powers, including the entire VAT regime, to usher in the GST regime,’’ the West Bengal CM said in a four-page letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-shortfall-more-states-seek-pms-intervention-oppose-centres-twin-options-135310
02-09-2020||---||US-led moves to outflank China in Asia Pacific trade, security||New Delhi, September 2When Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed at one day’s notice to deliver the keynote address on Thursday at the ongoing US India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), it was another indication of the strategy brewing among a clutch of Asia-Pacific democracies to pool-in their security and economic interests led by the US flag.At present, India’s diplomatic engagements seem to be more Kremlin-oriented. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has travelled to Moscow for the second time in recent months while Foreign Minister S Jaishankar will interact with his Russian and Chinese counterparts under the SCO and BRICS formats.That will be overlapped by interactions seeking to put more punch into an economic and security answer to China. “Our strategy is to push back against China in virtually every domain,” US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biguen admitted on Tuesday at a USISPF session. With the clashes at LAC, India appears to have signed on to a concept of Quad plus.As Biguen revealed, Foreign Secretaries of six Asia Pacific countries have been in unprecedented weekly conversations chaired by him. The other countries are India, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Vietnam and New Zealand, all of whom are informally called Quad Plus.India, once touted to be the weakest link, has shed its inhibitions and is set to host its first in-person diplomatic engagement after the pandemic broke in March with a two plus two with the US. The conversation between Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper with S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh would set the tone for a Quad Ministerial meeting later this year involving the External Affairs Ministers of US, India, Australia and Japan.The US Foreign Secretary also emphasised both legs – security and economic—of a joint strategy that will gradually seek to involve five democracies of the region and Vietnam. “We’re doing it in terms of outsized demands to claim sovereign territory, whether it’s in the Galwan Valley of India on the India-Chinese border, or whether it’s in the South Pacific. We’re also doing it economically,” he had said.His equal emphasis on the economic part would seek to bring back the balance from the present, heavy tilt towards the security side. As former NSA Shivshankar Menon wrote, “Where India and the United States once collaborated on a wide range of issues in pursuit of common goals, they now cooperate on security to the exclusion of much else.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-led-moves-to-outflank-china-in-asia-pacific-trade-security-135302

02-09-2020||New Delhi||Dealt cases with conscience, took decisions with conviction, says Justice Arun Mishra||Supreme Court judge Justice Arun Mishra on Wednesday bid farewell to the bar and the bench, saying he dealt cases with “conscience” and took every decision with “conviction”.Sharing the ceremonial bench on his last day as an apex court judge with Chief Justice S A Bobde, Justice Mishra addressed the court through video conferencing and urged the legal fraternity to “analyse (his) every judgment but do not give them this colour or that colour”.“I have dealt with every case with my conscience and took every decision with conviction”, he said.The CJI, who incidentally shared the bench with Justice Mishra for the first and the last time in the top court, praised the retiring judge by terming him as a “beacon of light”, “beacon of courage” and “beacon of fortitude” even in the face of all adversities.“Justice Mishra is leaving behind a legacy of hard work, erudition, great courage and fortitude”, the CJI said.Justice Bobde said: “I wish you Justice Mishra a very happy joyous and prosperous life ahead and I hope you remain in touch with us and we certainly endeavour to do that,” Justice Bobde said and added that he was privileged to have a worked with Justice Mishra.“I don’t know many people who have carried out work so bravely despite so many difficulties,” the CJI said.The last day of Justice Mishra, who delivered many key judgements including the AGR dues case granting 10 years’ time to telcos and the imposition of one rupees fine on lawyer Prashant Bhushan for contempt of court, has had the share of controversy as well.Senior advocate and SCBA president Dushyant Dave took objection after being allegedly deprived of an opportunity to speak at the virtual farewell ceremony of Justice Arun Mishra and shot off a letter expressing disappointment to the CJI.The moment the hearings in the cases finished, Attorney General K K Venugopal wished Justice Mishra a happy post retirement life and rued that due to the COVID-19 pandemic the farewell has to be done through video conferencing.Lawyers, including former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, also wished Justice Mishra who thanked them and colleague judges by saying that he always tried to borrow the “weapon of power given” from Bar and fellow judges.“All of you were the power behind whatever I have done. Have learnt so much from the members of the Bar...So many branches of law I have learnt from the Bar members,” he said.He said, “sometimes I have been very harsh in my conduct directly or indirectly. Nobody should feel hurt... If I have hurt anybody then please pardon me, pardon me, pardon me.”He also referred to the contempt case against Prashant Bhushan and said that Venugopal said that he did not want any punishment.Venugopal described Mishra as “the iron judge” and said, “We will miss him in Supreme Court and we wish him good health.”Shivaji Jadhav, President of Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association (SCAORA) read out the brief outline of Justice Mishra’s career especially his judicial career.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and few other bar leaders also attended it.Earlier on August 30, Justice Mishra had declined farewell invitations of bar bodies - the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Confederation of Indian Bar - citing “severe situation and sufferings the world over” on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.Justice Mishra had become an apex court judge on July 7, 2014. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dealt-cases-with-conscience-took-decisions-with-conviction-says-justice-arun-mishra-135285

02-09-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                              ||GST losses: Mamata urges PM Modi to borrow money to compensate states||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, September 2Instead of forcing the states to borrow, the Centre should borrow money to meet the shortfall in GST collection and give states the compensation promised to them at the time of implementation of the new tax regime.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today wrote this to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In a letter addressed to Modi, Banerjee said states would reciprocate by supporting a resolution for continuation of cess collection beyond five years till the entire debt of the Centre was completely liquidated along with interest payment.Mamata wrote that unlike the Centre, states did not have the power to monetise debt. The GoI also pays a much lower rate of interest for such borrowings. GoI can also raise resources to service debt, she argued.States gave up 70 per cent of their taxing power, including VAT, to usher in GST, Mamata wrote, while adding that “the only condition for giving up of all these powers was the promise of full compensation of shortfall in GST collection for five years under an agreed formula”.Mamata wrote that the late BJP leader Arun Jaitley had stated back in December 2013 that the sole reason why BJP was opposing the implementation of GST was because it did not trust the then central government regarding honouring its commitment of compensating the states for losses.“Today, his (Arun Jaitley’s) words are ringing in our ears as we are losing trust in the BJP government at the Centre,” Mamata wrote. She added that Modi himself, when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat, had opposed GST saying he did not have faith in the words of the UPA government then at power at the Centre.The Chief Minister wrote that two options, being thrust on the states, would both entail borrowing lakhs and crores of rupees at a time when some of the states were unable even to pay salaries and pensions to employees, not to speak of the neglect of development works.The Chief Minister urged the Prime Minister to intervene and “rekindle the trust between states and Centre at the GST council – a trust that had held for over three years and 40 meetings of the council”.Mamata wrote that on behalf of all the states of the country including her own state, she would request him (Modi) to not belie the trust.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-losses-mamata-urges-pm-modi-to-borrow-money-to-compensate-states-135276

02-09-2020||New Delhi||PM CARES Fund got Rs 3,076-cr in just five days: Account statement||The PM CARES Fund, set up in March to deal with emergency situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, received Rs 3,076.62 crore in just five days of its formation, as per an account statement made public by the fund on Wednesday.The ‘receipt and payment account’ showed nearly Rs 3,075.85 crore as ‘voluntary contributions’, while Rs 39.67 lakh came as foreign contributions.It put the fund’s closing balance as on March 31, 2020 at Rs 3,076.62 crore, after including interest income and deducting service tax on forex conversion.The fund started with an initial corpus of Rs 2.25 lakh, as per the account statement posted on the fund’s official website.It also referred to “accompanying notes to the financial statements”, but those were not made public on the website.According to details posted on the website of the ‘Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund)’, the fund consists “entirely of voluntary contributions from individuals/organisations and does not get any budgetary support”.“During 2019-20 (from March 27-31, 2020), an amount of Rs 3076.62 crore has been collected under PM CARES Fund,” it said.It further said this fund has been set up as a public charitable trust “keeping in mind the need for having a dedicated national fund with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation, like posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to provide relief to the affected”.The fund generated a lot of interest immediately after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced its formation in the last week of March after the COVID-19 outbreak and appealed for donations, prompting several private firms, government bodies and individuals, including celebrities, to donate money.The fund’s objectives include undertaking and supporting relief or assistance of any kind relating to a public health emergency or any other kind of emergency, calamity or distress, either man-made or natural, including the creation or upgradation of healthcare or pharmaceutical facilities, other necessary infrastructure, funding relevant research or any other type of support, according to its website.The government has used a part of the money to buy medical equipment, including ventilators, to boost the battle against the COVID-19 and has also provided relief to migrants.Opposition parties have, however, criticised the fund, claiming that its contributions and expenses are not transparent, a charge denied by the government.Reacting to the account statement of the fund, Congress leader P Chidambaram said the auditors of the fund have confirmed that the fund received Rs 3,076 crore in just five days, but the “names of these generous donors will not be revealed”.“Every other NGO or Trust is obliged to reveal the names of donors contributing more than a threshold amount. Why is the PM CARES Fund exempt from this obligation,” he tweeted.“The donee is known. The trustees of the donee are known. Why are the trustees afraid to reveal the names of the donors?” Chidambaram said.Last month, the Supreme Court had refused to direct the transfer of contributions made to the PM CARES Fund to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).The top court had also ruled that at this need of the hour no exception can be taken to the constitution of a public charitable trust PM CARES Fund to have necessary financial resources to meet the emergent situation, adding this fund and the NDRF were entirely different funds with separate object and purpose.While Prime Minister is the ex-officio Chairman of the PM CARES Fund, the Minister of Defence, Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Finance are its ex-officio trustees.The chairperson (Prime Minister) has the power to nominate three trustees to the board of trustees, who can be eminent persons in the field of research, health, science, social work, law, public administration and philanthropy.Also, any person appointed a trustee will act in a pro bono capacity.

They must be investigated immediately and when found guilty, punished,” Gandhi tweeted.IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also wrote to Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, accusing the social media platform’s employees of supporting people from a political predisposition that lost successive elections, and “abusing” Prime Minister and senior cabinet ministers.In a three-page letter to Facebook Chief Executive Zuckerberg, Prasad alleged “bias and inaction” by individuals in the Facebook India team on complaints by people supportive of right-of-centre ideology. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facebook-india-chief-ajit-mohan-appears-before-parliamentary-panel-135272
02-09-2020||New Delhi||Govt seeks to reduce Parliament to ‘notice board’: Tharoor on ‘no Question Hour’||Criticising the decision of not having the Question Hour in Parliament’s monsoon session, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday said questioning the government is the “oxygen” of parliamentary democracy and alleged that the Modi dispensation seeks to reduce Parliament to a “notice board”.There will be no Question Hour and private members’ Bills will not be taken up in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament, while the Zero Hour will be restricted, notifications issued by Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats said.Reacting to the development, Tharoor said, “I said four months ago that strongmen leaders would use the excuse of the pandemic to stifle democracy and dissent.”“The notification for the delayed Parliament session blandly announces there will be no Question Hour. How can this be justified in the name of keeping us safe?” the former Union minister said.Questioning the government is the oxygen of parliamentary democracy, he asserted.“This government seeks to reduce Parliament to a notice-board and uses its crushing majority as a rubber-stamp for whatever it wants to pass,” Tharoor alleged.The one mechanism to promote accountability has now been done away with, he rued.Tagging Tharoor’s tweet, another senior Congress leader Mukul Wasnik said on Twitter, “You may have misunderstood the government. This is not about your safety. It is about the government’s safety.”               There will also be no breaks during the session, which will be held from September 14 to October 1, and both Houses will function on Saturdays and Sundays as well, the notifications said.In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the session will be held in two shifts -- 9 am to 1 pm and 3 pm to 7 pm.Last week, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote to Speaker Om Birla urging him not to curtail the Question Hour and the Zero Hour.Chowdhury had said it will prevent lawmakers from raising issues of national importance.Meanwhile, according to sources, the government has reached out to the Opposition, sharing its compulsions to not hold the Question Hour in wake of the pandemic.

CAIT National President B C Bhartia and Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said banning more Chinese apps was necessary as they "were always a threat to country's safety, security and sovereignty as also for the protection of individual data these apps were accruing through their usages." Also, "Apps like PUBG were spoiling the next generation as more and more people of India were consuming their more time on PUBG and other apps," they were quoted as saying in a CAIT press statement. Here’s the full press statementThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India invoking its power under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act read with the relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules 2009 and in view of the emergent nature of threats has decided to block 118mobile apps (see Appendix) since in view of information available they are engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public orderThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.

02-09-2020||New Delhi||Deprived of speaking at Justice Mishra’s farewell, SCBA president writes to CJI||Senior advocate and SCBA President Dushyant Dave Wednesday shot off a letter to the Chief Justice expressing disappointment at being allegedly deprived of an opportunity to speak at the farewell ceremony of Justice Arun Mishra.Dave wrote to the Chief Justice SA Bobde expressing “strong disappointment and condemnation” and said he will never again participate in any function being organised by the Supreme Court till his term as Supreme Court Bar Association president is over in December.“I must confess, the Supreme Court has come to such levels where the Judges are afraid of the Bar. Please do remember, Judges come and go but we the Bar remain constant. We are the real strength of this great Institution because we are permanent.”“I must say, I am personally deeply saddened by this events and will never again participate in any function being organised by the Supreme Court till my term is over in December,” Dave said.He alleged that he got a link at 10.06 am to join the Ceremonial Bench of the Chief Justice of India at 12.30 pm from the Team SCI VC and which was sent on WhatsApp by the concerned Registrar.“I responded at 10.16 am accepting it which was acknowledged by the Registrar at 10.18 am. I joined through the link around 12.20 pm and was confirmed by the Team saying Video and Audio were perfect.”“I then had conversations with the Attorney General K K Venugopal, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, President SCORA Shivaji Jadhav, amongst others. Once the Court assembled, I saw and heard all the proceedings clearly. At the end Mr Mukul Rohtagi bid farewell,” he said.Supreme Court judge Justice Arun Mishra, who is superannuated on September 2, had earlier declined farewell invitations of bar bodies citing “severe situation and sufferings the world over” on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.Dave further wrote that after Court work, Attorney General was requested to speak.“When he ended, I thought that I will be requested to speak, instead Mr Jadhav was requested knowing full well I was present. For some unknown reasons, I was being disconnected again and again but I persisted and rejoined each time.”“I saw and heard Shri Jadhav fully and at the end of his address again I was not requested to speak though Shri Jadhav has acknowledged my presence in his address,” Dave said.He further wrote that after an address by the CJI, Justice Mishra was invited to speak.“At that stage realising the game plan I exited in the larger interests of the dignity of the Bar and Myself. But what is most important is that I messaged the Secretary-General on WhatsApp at 12.49 pm and again at 12.53 pm asking why I was kept on mute and why was I at all invited.”“Only at 1.02 pm, he responded saying he is instructing Registrar to look into it, by which time it was too late and so I messaged him informing that I had exited.” “The entire episode leaves much to be desired on the part of this great Institution. The whole attempt was to prevent me from addressing on behalf of the SCBA and its Executive Committee, after having invited and invitation having been accepted. This was clearly an affront to the Bar and to me personally,” he said.

02-09-2020||New Delhi||India's COVID-19 fatality rate slides to 1.76 pc, one of the lowest globally: Health ministry||India has been reporting one of the lowest COVID-19 fatality rates in the world with the figure further declining to 1.76 per cent as on date against a global average of 3.3 per cent, the Union Health Ministry said on Wednesday.It also said that COVID-19 deaths per million population in India is one of the lowest in the world."While the global average is 110 deaths per million population, India is reporting 48 deaths per million population. The comparative figure for Brazil and the UK is 12 and 13 times higher, respectively," the ministry highlighted.India's COVID-19 tally of cases galloped past 37 lakh on Wednesday with 78,357 new instances of the disease reported in a day, while the number of recoveries crossed 29 lakh pushing the recovery rate to 76.98 per cent, the Union health ministry data showed.The death toll climbed to 66,333 with 1,045 more fatalities reported in 24 hours. India has so far reported 37,69,523 cases of the viral disease, according to the data updated at 8 am.As part of the COVID-19 management and response policy, the Centre's sharp focus has been not only on containing the coronavirus-related fatality, but also to reduce deaths by providing quality clinical care to the critical and severe patients, it said.Collaborative efforts of the Centre, states and union territories have resulted in strengthening of the health facilities across the country, the ministry said.As many as 1,578 dedicated COVID hospitals are providing quality medical care. The Central government has also issued the standard of care guidelines incorporated in the Clinical Treatment Protocol.The AIIMS, New Delhi, has been conducting e-ICU sessions to build the capacities of the ICU doctors in clinical management of critical patients towards reducing the fatality. Knowledge and domain experts have been holding tele- or video-consultation sessions twice every week from July 8 for the doctors manning ICUs in state hospitals.Till date, 17 tele-sessions have been held and 204 institutions have participated in them, the ministry said.To further build the ICU, clinical management capacities of doctors for treatment of critical patients, AIIMS, New Delhi, in collaboration with the Health Ministry, has developed frequently answered questions (FAQs).One of these clarifies that Remdesivir and tocilizumab are experimental therapies and should not be used as empirical therapy for suspected cases. They should be used only in proven COVID-19 patients, where clinically indicated, the ministry said, underlining that there is no evidence to support the use of these two drugs in asymptomatic patients with comorbidities.In one of the answers, the ministry said, Tocilizumab is an experimental therapy, has a limited role, and should be used only in patients with cytokine syndrome after ruling out active infections.As for the role of Favipiravir, the ministry said studies have used this drug mainly in mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, claiming to prevent progression, whereas the majority of this cohort recover with just supportive care and monitoring and usually require no specific therapy.Evidence is weak for the use of Favipiravir and is currently not recommended in national guidelines, it said.According to the FAQs, depression is a common finding in patients with COVID which may be because of a number of reasons including staying in isolation, anxiety related to disease, social stigma, among others. Such patients need empathy and psychological counselling preferably by a trained healthcare worker like a psychologist / psychiatrist, it said.The ministry said that sudden deaths have been reported both at presentation to emergency department as well as in hospital. Reasons that have been proposed include a sudden cardiac event/ACS, preceding silent hypoxia that went unnoticed or due to a thrombotic complication such as pulmonary thromboembolism. "Patients with risk factors to develop severe COVID-19 or with prior comorbid conditions such as CAD or chronic lung disease should be strictly monitored for their saturation. They should not be allowed to move unattended. Anticoagulant should be used on all at-risk patients who do not have any risk factors of bleeding," the ministry elaborated.As far as the role of plasma therapy is concerned, the FAQs said that convalescent plasma collected from ABO matched donors with high neutralizing titers can be given to patients at risk of developing severe COVID in early stages of the disease. However, it should also be considered an experimental therapy and should be used with caution, it stated.

02-09-2020||New Delhi||Notes of despair: Wedding band owners and musicians on verge of penury||The music has gone out of their lives, quite literally, and the band of men who made their living drumming up tunes for parties, wedding processions and sometimes funerals too are on the verge of penury, scrambling for every rupee they can manage. Almost six months into the pandemic, those in the business of weddings bands have gone bust. With celebrations restricted to just a few people in the era of social distancing and no bookings, some like Khurshid Siddiqui are selling old clothes and others like Mohammad Ali are selling off the accoutrements of the trade – the buggy, lights and even the mare.Drummer Khurshid Siddiqui who ran the ‘band business' from his ancestral shop in east Delhi's Laxmi Nagar Market said there hasn't been a single booking in months, not from weddings, celebrations such as births and not even the odd funeral of an old person they sometimes played for.The 40-year-old said he has put his shop on rent for Rs 10,000 and is reduced to selling old clothes on the roadside.“All our old bookings were cancelled due to which even the little money that was left with us had to be returned,” Siddiqui told PTI.“I have completely stopped the work that had carried on for generations in my family. I have sent some of the items to my village, sold some and am selling clothes,” he added.Mohammed Ali, who owned the ‘Great Band' close by, spent a hefty Rs 4.5 lakh in January to buy a buggy, lights and a mare, all necessary for a big fat Indian wedding that is incomplete without ‘band, bajaa and baraat'.The mare, he said, cost Rs 2.5 lakh and he is now ready to sell it for just Rs 50,000 or rent it out for Rs 500 a day.“The buggy is getting damaged in the rain. There is trouble from all sides. The coronavirus has devastated us. And the government is also ignoring us,” the 40-year-old said.The signs of the desperate times are visible in the ribs jutting out of the mare standing in a corner. Part of the buggy lies on a garbage laden road with children playing inside it.Some kilometres away near the Loni border, trumpet player Navi Jaan echoes the despair.The 58-year-old said he had been working with a band but since 1985 but the owner shut shop and he has been jobless since.“I have been sitting without any work for the last five months. I called the owner on Eid for money but he refused, citing the lockdown. There are four people in my family who are dependent on me,” Jaan said.Of his 35 band mates, some are selling vegetables and some are driving rickshaws, he said.                Imran, owner of the Sahib Band Wala in Vaishali, opened his shop after five months, hoping to get some work with the lockdown being partially lifted.“The initial few weeks after the lockdown was imposed were still okay. But the constant re-imposition has created havoc. Because of the lockdown we couldn't deposit the bills and our electricity was disconnected. Since we have had no earnings, we haven't been able to pay the electricity bills and can't resume work.”It's a vicious circle, trapping scores of people. Sometimes, to remind themselves of the good times, a band member dresses up in the uniform, just wears the cap and picks up his instrument. It's a reminder of the times that were.

02-09-2020||New Delhi||India, China hold another round of commander-level talks||Days after China's "provocative actions" in Pangong Lake area in eastern Ladakh, the situation in the region remained sensitive on Wednesday while army commanders from both sides held another round of talks to defuse tensions, government sources said.The army of the two countries held Brigade Commander-level talks in Chushul with a focus on bringing down tensions in the Pangong Lake area, they said, adding that similar dialogue on Monday and Tuesday, each lasting over six hours, did not produce any "tangible outcome".Sources said India had achieved tactical gains in eastern Ladakh in the last few days by occupying a number of strategically important hill tops and locations.On Monday, the Indian Army said the Chinese military carried out "provocative military movements" to "unilaterally" change the status quo on the southern bank of Pangong Lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30 but the attempt was thwarted by the Indian troops.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Tuesday said the Chinese PLA was engaged in "provocative action" again on Monday when the ground commanders of the two sides were holding talks to ease the situation following China's attempt to change the status quo in the Pangong Lake area two days back."The situation in the area remained sensitive," said a source.The two sides were earlier engaged in a confrontation on the northern bank of Pangong Lake but it was for the first time such an incident occurred on its southern bank, they said.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday carried out a comprehensive review of the situation in eastern Ladakh at a high-level meeting attended by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane and Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria.It was decided at the nearly two-hour meeting that the Indian Army will continue to maintain its aggressive posturing in all sensitive areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to effectively deal with any Chinese "misadventure", sources said.They said the Indian Army had further bolstered its presence around the Southern Bank area of Pangong Lake by deploying additional troops and bringing in more weaponry, including tanks and anti-tank guided missiles.A battalion of the Special Frontier Force was also deployed in the area.Sources said the Indian Air Force (IAF) had also been told to enhance its surveillance on increasing Chinese air activities along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.There have been reports that China has deployed J-20 long-range fighter jets and several other key assets in strategically located Hotan airbase, which is around 310 km from eastern Ladakh.In the last three months, the IAF deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the LAC.The fresh attempt by China to change the status quo in the Pangong Lake area is the first major incident in the area after the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.China also suffered casualties but is yet to make the details public. According to an American intelligence report it was 35.India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks in the last two-and-half months but no significant headway has been made for a resolution to the border row in eastern Ladakh.

The former president was cremated with full state honours on Tuesday.The Bangladesh government on Tuesday announced that it will observe a one-day state mourning at the death of the country's "real friend".The government in a statement urged places of worship of different faiths to arrange special prayers for Mukherjee.Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina sent a letter to her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, saying as a renowned scholar and statesman of India, and a highly esteemed leader of South Asia, Mukherjee commanded the respect and admiration of all.She said 'Bharat Ratna' Mukherjee's tireless work for the welfare of the people of India will inspire the future generation of leaders not only in India but across countries in the region.Hasina called Mukherjee a “true friend” and said that “he was always been highly revered and loved by the people of Bangladesh” recalling his support and contribution in strengthening bilateral relations.In 2013, Bangladesh conferred the honour of ‘Bangladesh Muktijuddho Sommanona' (Liberation War Honour) on Mukherjee for his valuable contribution to its 1971 Liberation War. Hasina also called Mukherjee a “true friend” of Bangladesh and a guardian-like figure to her family.“The news of Mukherjee's demise deeply saddened her . . . she became emotional and nostalgic as she reminisced her many memories with him,” state-run BSS news agency reported, quoting the premier's press secretary Ihsanul Karim.Hasina said Mukherjee always extended her cooperation to her family while they were in exile in India after the assassination of her father and Bangladesh's founder Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975 along with most of his family members.“In such a bad time Mukherjee always enquired about my family and stood beside us in any of our necessity,” Hasina said, adding she also drew his cooperation and encouragement even after her return to Bangladesh.“He was our guardian and family friend and he always provided courage to us in any crisis,” she said.The prime minister said with Mukherjee's demise, India lost a learned and patriotic leader, while Bangladesh lost a very dear person.“He will remain alive as a glittering star in the politics of the sub continent,” she said.Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid and premier Hasina earlier expressed sorrow over Mukherjee's demise, describing him as a "true friend" and recalling his “outstanding and unforgettable” contributions to the country's 1971 Liberation War."His demise has caused an irreparable loss to the political arena of the sub-continent," Hamid said.Bangladesh High Commissioner to India Md Imran on Tuesday placed two separate wreaths on behalf of Prime Minister Hasina and Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen before Mukherjee's portrait at his residence in New Delhi.The envoy also handed over a message of condolence and tributes from Hasina to Mukherjee's daughter Sharmistha.Bangladesh's Delhi mission will hold a special condolence meeting on Thursday afternoon for Mukherjee, who played a stellar role for the cause of an independent Bangladesh and its international recognition.Parliamentary speaker Shirin Sharmin Choudhury, main parliamentary opposition Jatiya Party chief GM Quader and senior ministers also mourned Mukherjee's death. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bangladesh-observes-one-day-state-mourning-in-memory-of-its-real-friend-pranab-mukherjee-135224

02-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Bihar polls: BJP all set to hard bargain with ally JDU, sets eyes on 120 winnable seats||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 2Amid the tussle for a better share among the NDA allies, the BJP is believed to be “preparing” a list of 120 seats to contest in the upcoming elections to the 243-member Bihar Assembly.The party, which is fighting the elections with allies JDU and LJP under the leadership of incumbent Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, wants to shortlist at least 120 constituencies which it believes it can win and then approach the negotiating table with this list, said sources.Moreover, Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM is also joining the NDA and will have to be adjusted.Former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM (S) has formed an alliance with Nitish Kumar's JD(U)."We have forged an alliance with JD(U) and have become a part of the NDA. There has been no discussion about seat-sharing in the next Bihar Assembly elections," Manjhi was quoted as saying.Manjhi is believed to be seeking 10 seats. However, it remains to be seen how he is accommodated in the seat sharing formula between the NDA existing allies.“The core committee of the state is working on the list. The BJP is keeping a watch on all the 243 seats, examining its own possibilities and also assessing the ground strength of allies as chief JP Nadda wants state leaders and MPs to work not only for ensuring victory of their party candidates but also the nominees of the NDA allies and project a perfect picture of unity in the elections,” revealed the sources.At the same time, though, the party leaders admit that there will be a tussle over seats, which is “natural”. Eventually the JDU may end up with 115-120 seats, the LJP 25-30 and the BJP 95-105 seats.The BJP is leaving no stone unturned to retain Bihar with Nadda himself leading brainstorming sessions and strategy meetings.At a recent meeting of the Bihar core group, Nadda handed over tasks to state leaders, asking them to concentrate on booth management (which is the forte of the saffron party) and build on social-caste equations, especially in rural areas, said the sources.In another meeting with party MPs, including Central ministers, Nadda asked them to take the onus of ensuring the victory of all the NDA candidates in the elections expected in October-November and pay attention to the rural parts, they said.The MPs were asked to camp in at least two panchayats every day so that they can individually cover around 60 panchayat segments in September, they added.  The MPs will also celebrate the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 17 as Sewa Diwas (service day) by camping in their respective constituencies and ensure that relief works reach the people affected by the Covid-19 and floods.Nadda is likely to start campaigning after restrictions are eased by the state administration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-polls-bjp-all-set-to-hard-bargain-with-ally-jdu-sets-eyes-on-120-winnable-seats-135208
02-09-2020||New Delhi||India reeling under ‘Modi-made disasters’: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the state of the economy, rise in COVID-19 cases and “external aggression” at borders, alleging that India is reeling under “Modi-made disasters”.His attack comes after official data showed on Monday that the country’s economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 23.9 per cent as the coronavirus-related lockdown weighed on the already declining consumer demand and investment.“India is reeling under Modi-made disasters: 1. Historic GDP reduction -23.9% 2. Highest Unemployment in 45 yrs 3. 12 Crs job loss 4. Centre not paying states their GST dues 5. Globally highest COVID-19 daily cases and deaths 6. External aggression at our borders (sic),” Gandhi tweeted.Rebutting Gandhi’s attack in a video earlier this week on the state of the economy, the BJP had mocked him saying he should release a video about the “G-23”, a reference to the 23 leaders who wrote to the Congress chief seeking the party’s overhaul.Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian has said the economy was “experiencing a V-shaped recovery” after the lockdown was eased.

02-09-2020||Patna||Ahead of Bihar polls, Jitan Ram Manjhi’s party says it will join NDA||Former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) will join the NDA ahead of the Bihar elections, a party spokesperson said on Wednesday.The official announcement in this regard will be made by Manjhi on Thursday, said spokesperson Danish Rizwan.The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) will not merge with any party, rather it will be a part of the NDA in the Bihar elections that is due in October-November, he asserted.HAM(S) national president Jitan Ram Manjhi will formally announce the party becoming a part of the NDA in Bihar on September 3, Rizwan said.The number of seats the party will get to contest in the upcoming elections was never an issue for it as the HAM(S) will join the NDA for the states development, he said.The party is firmly standing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for their development works, he added.Manjhi had on August 20 severed ties with the Grand Alliance after spending two-and-a-half years in the opposition coalition, comprising of RJD, Congress, RLSP and Bollywood set designer-turned-politician Mukesh Sahni’s Vikasshil Insaan Party (VIP).The HAM(S) chief had also postponed a meeting scheduled on Wednesday with some non-NDA and non-Grand Alliance parties, including the Jan Adhikar Party of former MP Pappu Yadav, to discuss the strategy for the elections.Manjhi met the chief minister last Thursday and believed to have held talks on seat sharing.The HAM(S) wants to contest 15-20 seats, mostly in the Magadh region to which Manjhi belongs. But the JD(U) is willing to leave for it 10-12 seats, according to reports.Manjhi is the lone member of his party in the assembly. But, his induction would help the NDA’s outreach to Dalits, particularly other than Paswans which is the support base of the LJP.Dalits in Bihar are over 16 per cent of the electorate and about 40 seats in the 243-member house are reserved for them.Manjhi had quit the JD(U) in 2015 after being forced to step down as the chief minister to make way for the return of Kumar.Later, he formed the HAM(S) and contested 21 seats in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections as an NDA constituent. With the return of Kumar to the NDA in July 2017, he walked out of it to join hands with the opposition grouping.

02-09-2020||Washington||China using ‘coercive’ tactics in pursuit of territorial, maritime claims: Pentagon||China has been using “coercive” tactics in pursuit of territorial and maritime claims in the South and East China Seas, as well as along its border with India and Bhutan, according to a Pentagon report.China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond.“China’s leaders use tactics short of armed conflict to pursue China’s objectives. China calibrates its coercive activities to fall below the threshold of provoking armed conflict with the United States, its allies and partners, or others in the Indo-Pacific region,” the Pentagon said on Tuesday in its annual report on China to the US Congress.“These tactics are particularly evident in China’s pursuit of its territorial and maritime claims in the South and East China Seas as well as along its border with India and Bhutan,” said the report titled ‘Military and Security Developments involving the People’s Republic of China 2020’.The 200-page Pentagon report, however, makes no mention of the latest border row between India and China in eastern Ladakh.China seeks to set up military logistic facilities in about a dozen countriesChina is seeking to set up more robust logistics in about a dozen countries, including three in India’s neighbourhood, to allow its army to project and sustain its power at greater distances, a Pentagon report has said.In addition to the three Indian neighbours—Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar—the other countries where China is considering to base its military logistics and infrastructure are Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Seychelles, Tanzania, Angola, and Tajikistan, the report said on Tuesday.In its annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 2020” that was submitted to the US Congress on Tuesday, the Pentagon said these potential Chinese military logistics facilities are in addition to the Chinese military base in Djibouti, which is aimed at supporting naval, air and ground forces projection.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are vital to global trade.China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims over the area.In recent years, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has also increased patrols around and near Taiwan using bomber, fighter, and surveillance aircraft to signal Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan as a rebel province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force.“China also employs non-military tools coercively, including economic tools during periods of political tensions with countries that Beijing accuses of harming its national interests,” the report said.Since 1998, China has settled 11 land-based territorial disputes with six of its neighbours. “In recent years, China has employed a more coercive approach to deal with several disputes over maritime features and ownership of potentially rich offshore oil and gas deposits,” the Pentagon report said.“Tensions with India persist along the northeastern border near the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China asserts is part of Tibet and therefore part of China, and near the Aksai Chin region at the western end of the Tibetan Plateau,” the Pentagon said in its report to the Congress.Chinese and Indian patrols regularly encounter one another along the disputed border, and both sides often accuse one another of border incursions, it said.However, Chinese and Indian forces have regularly interacted since the 2017 Doklam standoff and generally kept disputes from escalating in 2019, it said.After the 22nd round of India-China border talks held in September 2019, China and India agreed for the first time to coordinate patrolling at one disputed point along the Line of Actual Control in Arunachal Pradesh as a confidence-building measure to maintain peace at the border, the report said.Giving its assessment of India-China border in 2019, the Pentagon said that officials from China and India continued regular meetings regarding their disputed border, while low-level face-offs persisted between Chinese and Indian military personnel.Chinese and Indian forces both continued construction and patrols in contested regions along the disputed border, but generally kept tensions from escalating in 2019, it said.In October 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Chennai to discuss economic relations and the importance of the peaceful resolution of contentious issues, particularly regarding the border. This meeting was the second summit between Xi and Modi, the first of which occurred in April 2018 following the 2017 Doklam standoff, it said.In August 2019, China submitted “early harvest” proposals regarding China-India border issues to India, which was the first time that China had approached India with resolution proposals, the report said.Although India was not pleased with the proposals, the 22nd meeting of the Special Representatives of India and China occurred in December 2019 and reinforced both sides’ shared intent to manage tensions in the border region, it said.

02-09-2020||Washington||China took ‘naive’ US for a ride; America now learning who are its real friends: Nikki Haley||China has taken a “naive” US and its leaders for a ride over the past several decades, according to former top Indian-American diplomat Nikki Haley, who said the Trump administration through its robust Indo-Pacific strategy is now learning who its real friends are.Speaking at the third India-US Leadership Summit organised virtually by the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), former US Ambassador to the UN Haley on Tuesday said Americans know that Indians are not a threat to them and as such, it is time for Indians to share their success story.The US has been pushing for a greater role for India in the strategic Indo-Pacific which is seen by many countries as an effort to contain China’s growing clout in the region.“Let’s acknowledge how China did it. China was very strategic. This was very planned out and America was very naive. The thought leaders in America thought that if we were nice to China, if we open doors to China, it would become more like the West, that China would become more democratic,” Haley said.Responding to a question from Mastercard CEO and president Ajay Banga, she said this was from both sides of the aisle—Republican and Democrat leaders, all of whom thought that if the US was nice to China, there would be an alliance.What the United States has to understand that the Chinese want to be communist and that they are not going to change, the 48-year-old former diplomat said.“Through this Indo-Pacific strategy, going forward America is learning who its real friends are. When you learn that, yes, it’s India. But now Indians need to go and show more of who they are,” she said.Explaining, she said that when people come across Indian businesses or an Indian professor or a doctor, they see the warmth, intelligence and genuine side of them, and they want to know more.“What we have to do is not be shy. But really get out there and brag about ourselves. Now is the time for Indians to be proud, be okay talking about those accomplishments and be okay talking about their successes and let chil9dren talk about their accomplishments. That’s really important going forward because...we have to make sure that we take to the next level,” said Haley, whose parents emigrated from Amritsar in Punjab.“Americans are not threatened by Indians and realise that Indians make our country better,” she said.Haley is considered a top contender for the Republican ticket to the US presidential race in 2024.Responding to a question, Haley asserted that the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the Trump administration has been a real game changer for India-US relationship.“When this administration took on the Indo-Pacific strategy, it was a real game changer for a lot of reasons. I had often thought that the US seemed to ally a little bit more with Pakistan and a little bit less with India,” she said.“It just makes sense that the US and India are natural allies. We have the same values...,” she said, adding that President Donald Trump very much saw that as well.“The Indo-Pacific strategy was one acknowledging something that should have been there all along, which is that the US and India should be natural allies,” Haley said.The Indo Pacific strategy, the former diplomat said, also acknowledged that the US and India face the same threat from China.“So it was a way of saying we’re going to start looking at things differently. We’ve seen that play out with the alliance that we see with the United States, India, Australia and Japan (a reference to the Quad group of countries). We are continuing to see that strengthen,” she said.From the military standpoint, the US and India have done well, Haley said, noting that the two countries still have some work to do on trade.“I’m hoping that we can break down some of those barriers that India has with tariffs on the United States. We will get there as well too,” she said optimistically.“This has been groundbreaking for a number of reasons. We have to continue to build on that because as we look at mutual threats that we have, whether it’s with China or what India has seen with Pakistan and going forward, I think it’s all the more reason why we should find other ways to be strengthened and work together,” Haley said.

02-09-2020||New Delhi||Pranab Mukherjee, the leader Sonia Gandhi found 'hard to spare'||As Pranab Mukherjee's mortal remains were laid to rest on Tuesday, veteran Congress leaders remembered the stalwart who remained indispensable to the party and the UPA government even when he could never become Prime Minister—the post he openly coveted.When then Congress chief Sonia Gandhi declined to be PM after the party staked claim to form the government in 2004, the expectation was that Mukherjee would be the next choice for the post. Sonia named Manmohan Singh instead.“This expectation of my being named PM was possibly based on the fact that I had extensive experience in government while Manmohan Singh’s vast experience was as a civil servant with five years as a reformist finance minister,” Mukherjee wrote in his last book, 'The Coalition Years: 1996 to 2012'—admitting his ambition to be India’s prime minister.Mukherjee mentioned in the same book that he was reluctant to work under Singh who had been his junior but he agreed to join the UPA government after Sonia Gandhi cited his indispensability to the regime.As it turned out, Singh would talk to Mukherjee on all important issues and in Mukherjee’s own words, “Manmohan Singh seemed to depend” on him.While the late leader went on to become a key crisis manager for the UPA, his political astuteness came in the way of his nomination as a presidential candidate in 2007.The Left Parties had announced support for Mukherjee’s nomination for the top office at the time with others seconding it and the decision was left to Sonia Gandhi.She declined to let Mukherjee go and told him, “Your name is being suggested as a presidential candidate by some political parties but it would be difficult for us to spare you as you are a strong pillar of the party in the government and the Parliament.”It was only in 2012 that Mukherjee finally bagged the coveted nomination and proceeded to Raisina Hill.A quintessential Congressman all his life, Mukherjee wrote in his memoirs of how as a child he nursed the ambition to become a member of the Congress Working Committee after reading biographical sketches of CWC members in his Rapid Reader Textbook in school in 1945.“As a child, I nurtured the ambition to be a member of the CWC,” Mukherjee wrote.He went on to serve the CWC from 1978 to 1986 and again from 1991 until 2012 when he became President of India.The same CWC bid him an emotional farewell before he proceeded to occupy the highest constitutional office of India.At the June 25, 2012, meet of the CWC, Sonia Gandhi famously declared to her colleagues, “I believe, like me, all of you will miss Pranab ji in the meetings of the CWC where his visible presence was so impressive and effective that we cannot imagine having a CWC meeting without him. Along with that, of course, I will miss some of his tantrums.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pranab-mukherjee-the-leader-sonia-gandhi-found-hard-to-spare-135181

Deputy Commandant Dharmendra was the second-in-command.  Head Constable Pradeep Negi, who was also a part of the expedition, climbed the peak for the second time.A native of Chhitkul, the last border village in Kinnaur, Negi has also scaled the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, twice.The team members took the necessary training and did the required acclimatisation in spite of limitations due to the corona crisis, read the statement.The Leo Pargil peak is considered one of the toughest and technically most difficult to climb as climbers have to deal with low oxygen level, extreme cold and high altitude sicknesses.The ITBP is considered as one of the fittest and toughest force as it has been working in extremely cold and high altitude terrain.The force is credited with 213 successful mountaineering expeditions since its raising, a record.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-team-scales-leo-pargil-peak-in-himachal-135180
02-09-2020||New Delhi||Rajnath leaves for Russia to attend SCO meet||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday left for Russia on a three-day visit to attend a crucial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and hold talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoigu on further boosting bilateral defence cooperation.The defence ministers of all eight SCO member nations are expected to deliberate on regional security challenges like terrorism and extremism and ways to deal with them "collectively" in Moscow on Friday, officials said.Heading to Moscow. During this visit, I shall be attending the combined meeting of Defence Ministers of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) & CIS members in commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of victory in the World War II.  The meeting is taking place under the shadow of a fierce border row between India and China, both members of the influential bloc.Chinese Defence Minister Gen Wei Fenghe and Pakistan's Pervez Khattak are expected to attend the SCO meeting.  Asked about the possibility of a bilateral meeting between Singh and Wei on the sidelines of the SCO event, officials said there is no such plan."Heading to Moscow. During this visit, I shall be attending the combined meeting of Defence Ministers of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) & CIS members in commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of victory in the World War II," Singh tweeted.He said issues of mutual interest will figure in his talks with Shoigu."India and Russia are privileged Strategic Partners. Looking forward to furthering this partnership during my visit," Singh said. In his meeting with Shoigu, Singh will press for expediting supply of a number of weapons systems, ammunition and spares to India by Russia under contracts which were concluded earlier, officials said.In the talks, both sides are expected to officially finalise a long-pending proposal to produce AK 203 rifles in India.Officials said Singh is also likely to request the Russian side to ensure timely delivery of the S-400 missile defence systems to India.The delivery of the first batch of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to India is scheduled by the end of 2021.In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctionsSingh will depart for India from Moscow on the evening of September 5, they said.The SCO defence ministers' meeting is taking place in the wake of fresh tension between India and China following the Chinese army's unsuccessful attempts to change the status quo on the southern bank of Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh.The two sides held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks to end the border standoff which began on May 5. The fresh attempts by China to change the status quo in the Pangong lake area escalated the tension further.On Saturday, India announced withdrawal from a multilateral war game in Russia this month after it emerged that Chinese and Pakistani troops will also be part of it. However, officially it was announced that India is not joining it due to the COVID-19 pandemic.It is Singh's second visit to Moscow since June. He had represented India at the Victory Day Parade in Moscow on June 24 that commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War.Russia has also invited External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to attend the SCO foreign ministers' meeting on September 10.The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea.The aim of the SCO is to maintain peace, stability and security of the region. India became a member of SCO in 2017. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-leaves-for-russia-to-attend-sco-meet-135179

02-09-2020||United Nations||Modi likely to address virtual UN General Assembly on Sept 26||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address the UN General Assembly on September 26, according to a provisional list of speakers issued by the world body for the high-level meeting.For the first time in the UN's 75-year history, the annual General Assembly session this year will be held virtually and heads of state and government will not be physically attending the annual gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. World leaders will submit pre-recorded video statements for the session.The Department for General Assembly and Conference Management at the UN on Tuesday issued the provisional list of speakers for the General Debate of the 75th session of the General Assembly to permanent missions.According to the list, Modi is expected to address the General Debate on the morning of September 26. However, it must be noted that the list is provisional and two more iterations will take place as schedules and speakers for the General Debate can change in the course of the next few weeks. The final speaking order for the General Debate could be different. The General Debate will commence on September 22 and run through September 29.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is listed as the first speaker. The US is traditionally the second speaker on the opening day of the General Debate and it is expected that President Donald Trump will travel to New York to deliver the final address of his presidency's first term in-person.According to the provisional list, President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to address the virtual General Debate on the opening day.The US is the host country of the United Nations and Trump will likely be the only world leader to address this year's virtual high-level week in-person.This would be Trump's final address to the General Assembly of the first term of his presidency before the US heads into elections in November. Trump could use the UN platform to highlight his foreign policy achievements, while also touting his campaign agenda.The Department for General Assembly and Conference Management said in accordance with the existing practice at the General Debate, a voluntary 15-minute time limit needs to be observed by the speakers.In the case of pre-recorded statements, the time limit would include remarks by the representative physically present in the Assembly Hall to introduce the pre-recorded video along with the video itself.The meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations will take place on September 21 and the Declaration will be formally adopted at the meeting.Along with the General Debate and the anniversary commemoration, other key sessions will also be held virtually at the UN.The Summit on Biodiversity will be held on September 30, the meeting of the General Assembly on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women on October 1 and the meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons on October 2. Member states will submit their pre-recorded video statements for these meetings as well.The General Assembly had adopted a decision in July that each member state, observer state and the European Union can submit a pre-recorded statement of its head of state, vice-president, crown prince or princess, head of government, minister or vice-minister, which will be played in the General Assembly Hall during the General Debate after introduction by their representative who is physically present in the Assembly Hall.The General Assembly session had particular significance this year as it would have commemorated 75 years of the existence of the United Nations and would have seen tremendous participation from leaders of the 193 member states to mark the event.

02-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant death case: Narcotics Bureau detains drug dealer in Mumbai||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Tuesday detained an alleged contraband dealer who has "links" with its probe in the drugs trafficking case pertaining to the death case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, officials said.The man, who has not been identified, apprehended by the federal anti-narcotics agency is understood to be involved in the supply of narcotics in the high-end party circles of Mumbai.He is expected to be arrested by the NCB on Wednesday after his questioning gave the agency sleuths some "vital leads" into the narcotics case registered against Rajput's live-partner Rhea Chakraborty and others, they said.The agency last week arrested two men for alleged drug trafficking in the western metropolis and it is understood that the leads against the detained man came after questioning them.      A special NCB team from Delhi, headed by deputy director (operations) K P S Malhotra, is camping in the city to take forward this probe. The team also includes agency officers from Mumbai and has been constituted by NCB Director General Rakesh Asthana.The agency filed a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) after the Enforcement Directorate, also probing the death case of the 34-year-old actor, shared with it a report after it cloned two mobile phones of Rhea.As per officials, the mobile phone chats and messages indicated procurement and consumption of drugs and these leads were shared by the ED with the NCB and the CBI.The NCB, as part of a linked operation, also seized about 3.5 kgs of bud or curated marijuana from foreign post offices in Delhi and Mumbai.Officials said the operation in Mumbai led them to a Goa-based man identified as F Ahmed who works as a driver at a prominent resort in the coastal state."Ahmed was supplying bud to some prominent receiver at Bangalore who has linkages with page 3 celebrities," an NCB officer said.An intensive operation has been conducted against the illegal import of curated marijuana (bud), which is primarily sourced from USA and Canada, and has huge market demand in Mumbai, he said.While the seizure made in Delhi was destined for Mumbai, the one made in Mumbai was sourced from Canada and destined for Goa, the officer said.  "The widespread use and demand of bud in Mumbai region has jacked up the prices in the grey market and it has huge pecuniary gains in the trafficking. The sourcing of the bud is primarily through the darknet and cryptocurrency which provides layers of anonymity to buyers and sellers," the NCB officer said.In the Delhi seizure, he said, the source of the bud was found to be the US."The consignee of the contraband was based in Delhi but was misguided by his contact at Mumbai that some legal stuff was being procured from the US and it was to be collected by Mumbai-based persons, whose search is underway," the officer said.

02-09-2020||Lucknow/Mathura||Out from jail, Dr Kafeel Khan likens Yogi govt to a stubborn child, fears he may be framed in another case||The Uttar Pradesh government, instead of observing 'Raj Dharma', was indulging in 'Baal Hatth' or childlike-stubbornness and could frame him in another case, Dr Kafeel Khan said after being released from the Mathura jail.The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday quashed Khan's detention under the National Security Act and ordered his immediate release. Following the court's order, Khan was released from Mathura jail late on Tuesday night.“Mathura jail administration informed at around 11 pm that Dr Kafeel will be released, and around midnight, he was released,” Khan's lawyer Irfan Ghazi said.Speaking after his release from the jail, Khan thanked the court. “I will always remain thankful to all my well-wishers, who raised their voice for my release. The administration was not ready for release, but because of the prayers of people, I have been released."Taking a dig at the Yogi Adityanath government, Khan said, “In Ramayana, Maharshi Valmiki had said that the Raja (king) should act for 'Raj Dharma'.” He also said he was apprehensive that the government can frame him in any other case, and claimed that he and his family had to face many hardships as the state government was "after" him because of the oxygen issue in BRD Medical College.Khan said he now wants to help flood-affected people in Bihar and Assam.  The bench, comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Saumitra Dayal Singh, passed the order on a petition filed by Khan's mother Nuzhat Parveen.The petition alleged that Khan was granted bail in February by a competent court and he was supposed to be released on bail. However, he was not released for four days and the NSA was subsequently invoked against him. Hence, his detention was illegal, the petition argued.Khan was in jail since January after he delivered an allegedly provocative speech at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in December last year.Kafeel Khan had hit the headlines for the first time in 2017 after the deaths of several kids due to lack of oxygen cylinders at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College, where he worked as a paediatrician.Initially, he was hailed as a saviour for the children for arranging emergency oxygen cylinders. However, later, he faced action along with nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital, all of whom were released on bail.A state government probe had cleared Khan of all major charges, prompting him to seek an apology from the Yogi Adityanath government. The doctor had alleged that an institutional failure had led to the deaths of the children.He subsequently faced threats, cases and even his family members were attacked, which the doctor dubbed as political vendetta on the part of the state government.

She had successfully conducted several anti-Naxal operations in Bihar and her cadre state.Appointed Inspector General (IG), she says it will be inappropriate to comment about her posting, insisting, “As always, I am looking forward to my new assignment.” Under her leadership, claims a senior CRPF official, various anti-Naxals operations were carried out in the two states. She was subsequently moved to sensitive Jammu sector as IG where she spent a successful tenure.Constituted in 2005, the Srinagar sector comprises Budgam, Ganderbal and Srinagar districts and Ladakh UT. The CRPF works in tandem with the Army and the J&K Police during anti-terror operations.The current CRPF Director-General, AP Maheshwari, was the first IG to head the sector, which includes two ranges, 22 executive units and three Mahila companies.A few years ago, Sonali Mishra, IPS officer of the 1993-batch Madhya Pradesh cadre, had served as the IG of another paramilitary force, the Border Security Force, in Kashmir. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/charu-sinha-first-woman-to-head-crpf-in-militancy-hit-srinagar-135059
02-09-2020||---||Japan offers India loan to fight Covid-19 pandemic||New Delhi, September 1Japan and the European Union (EU) have approved big loans to India to fight Covid and develop infrastructure, respectively.While Japan has lent to further equip hospitals, the EU bank has made its second largest lending operation outside its traditional sphere to support the building of a metro in Kanpur.The bank is also financing the construction of the metro in Lucknow, Bhopal, Pune and Bengaluru. The total loan from EU alone for the two metros in UP is estimated at Rs 8,000 crore.The ballpark figure for loans taken by India to battle the pandemic is over Rs 60,000 crore which is expected to rise as more tranches are being negotiated with multilateral banks.Japanese Ambassador to India Satoshi Suzuki and Indian officials exchanged documents concerning the provision of a yen loan for response to Covid. The maximum amount that India can draw is 50 billion yen (about Rs 3,500 crore).With its finances in acute disrepair, India has borrowed from Germany and France. Germany committed an emergency support measure of 460 million Euros (Rs 3,893 crore) to support the “One Nation One Ration Card” scheme, while France committed 200 million Euros (about Rs 1,700 crore) to boost the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana.The loan from Japan will help equip hospitals with ICUs and infection prevention and management facilities. It is also expected to lead to the enhancement of telemedicine using digital technology in numerous villages across India. The loan has been offered at 0.01 per cent per annum for 15 years.The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved a Euro 650 million loan (about Rs 4,500 crore) to build a metro in Kanpur. This will be its second biggest operation outside the EU to date. The EIB will finance a 32.4-km metro line with 30 stations and the rolling stock.

The other Foreign Secretaries were from Japan, Australia, South Korea, Vietnam and New Zealand.Describing the group as a “natural grouping of countries”, Biegun hoped they would do their best to advance their combination of interests in the Indo-Pacific. “As the fulcrum of global geopolitics and economics shifts to the Indo-Pacific, our partnership with India has become all the more vital. As with any close partnership, challenges do arise, but with a bit of goodwill, we can overcome any obstacle,” he said.Foreign Ministers of the Quad countries — S Jaishankar, Mike Pompeo, Maris Payne and Toshimitsu Motegi — are scheduled to meet in Delhi later this year, said Biegun.There is a temptation in governments to formalise it, but Quad members will be a bit careful in doing that “to make sure everybody’s moving at the same speed”.“It (institutionalising the Quad) could be something that would be very much worthwhile to be explored. It is not defined solely as an initiative to contain or to defend against China,” he said.Ties with India, he said, were helped by its own willingness to break out of decades of neutrality and a well-informed caution to extend its interests into the world.“India recognises that it can’t be a passive player in how that develops throughout the Indo-Pacific. So it’s a real coincidence of a variety of factors,” said the US Deputy Foreign Secretary. Speaking at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, he also paid a tribute to former President Pranab Mukherjee. “He’ll go down in history among India’s most distinguished statesmen and scholars,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ties-to-strengthen-as-india-breaks-out-of-neutrality-us-135020

The existing bank guarantees submitted regarding the spectrum shall be kept alive by the telecom service providers until the payment was made, it said."In the event of any default, interest would be payable along with penalty and interest on penalty automatically without reference to court.

Noting that the economy had contracted by 23% due to Covid-19, he said several steps had been taken for stressed sectors. The top court — which is seized of petitions demanding waiver of interest, or waiver of interest on interest on the suspended EMIs during moratorium — had earlier commented that there was no point in charging interest on interest. Maintaining that the matter can’t be delayed any further, the Bench posted it for further hearing on Wednesday.Announced in March for three months, loan moratorium was extended to six months till August 31.The Centre and RBI maintained that a complete interest waiver was not possible as banks too had to pay interest to depositors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/loan-moratorium-extendable-up-to-two-years-centre-tells-sc-135000

In this context, we expect the Chinese side to sincerely abide by the understanding reached earlier,” he said.Meanwhile, China has spoken in different voices on the issue. The Chinese mission said India “grossly violated China’s territorial sovereignty, violated relevant agreements, protocols and consensus”. Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong complained of Indian troops’ activity “across the LAC” at the southern bank of Pangong Tso and near the Reqin Pass.In Paris, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, however, said there were bound to be problems as the India-China boundary was not demarcated. “We are ready to manage all issues through talks,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-violating-bilateral-pacts-protocols-mea-134995
02-09-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Occupied LAC pass to plug intrusion||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 1The Indian Army occupied a critical mountain pass, Renchin La (called Reqin by China) located close to Spanggur Gap, east of Chushul, along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), in Ladakh on the night intervening August 30 and August 31.Indian occupation of the pass, which is located in the “grey zone” along the LAC, has led to a sharp reaction from China. “Grey zone” is the areas where perceptions of the LAC vary with both sides making counter-claims.Two Brigadier-level meetings (on August 31 and September 1) at Chushul ended in a stalemate, sources said.The Renchin La is one of the 13 identified possible routes of military ingress into Ladakh from the Chinese side. These routes are natural gaps in mountains along the 826-km LAC in Ladakh.The pass accords India a clear view of Spanggur Gap, Moldo Garrison of China, besides the southern bank of the Spanggur Tso. The move, a clear counter to the PLA, expands the ongoing stalemate south of Pangong Tso.So far, everything was happening north of the lake.The PLA reportedly moved its tanks from its base at Moldo and could have occupied any area of “grey zone” like they did at Finger-4 on the north bank of Pangong Tso.Indian surveillance systems picked up the PLA movement and the concentration of troops and tanks at Moldo necessitated a move to occupy heights.These positions dominate the Chushul-Tsaka la-Dungti road on the Indian side and overlook the Rezang La, where the two countries fought a pitched battle in 1962.The Renchin La had not been occupied by either side. Indian Army sources said Indian troops were firmly “within our perception of the LAC” and it was wrong for China to claim that our troops had intruded across.At the military meetings, it was conveyed that India had no intention of changing the LAC status, as was being attempted by the PLA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/occupied-lac-pass-to-plug-intrusion-134889
