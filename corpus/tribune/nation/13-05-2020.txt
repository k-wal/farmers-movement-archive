13-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Passengers’ boarding passes won’t be stamped by CISF personnel at airports, says BCAS||The aviation security regulator BCAS said on Wednesday the CISF personnel would not be stamping passengers’ boarding pass anymore during the pre-embarkation security check (PESC) at airports.The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), in an order accessed by PTI, said every airport operator will have to ensure that there are enough CCTV cameras at an appropriate height in the PESC area to record the identity of a passenger and his or her boarding pass.More than 13 CISF personnel, who were posted at airports in Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, have tested positive for COVID-19 till date.This order has been issued in view of the “prevailing situation of COVID-19 pandemic and countermeasures being taken to contain its spread by touch/contact”, stated the BCAS.All scheduled commercial passenger flights have been suspended since March 25 when the Modi government imposed a lockdown to curb the coronavirus pandemic. However, repatriation flights, medical evacuation flights and cargo flights have been allowed to operate.“It has been decided to dispense with the procedure of stamping the passengers’ boarding pass that is being done by Aviation Security Group (ASG)/Airport Security Unit (APSU) after completion of PESC of the concerned passenger, till further orders,” the order stated.Both the APSU and the ASG are part of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which provides security at more than 60 airports across the country.In its order to airports, airlines and other stakeholders, the BCAS said, “The airport operator shall ensure that the requisite monitoring system of high definition fixed CCTV cameras and supporting infrastructure are maintained all through at PESC points at an appropriate height so that boarding pass of the passenger and his/her identity are digitally recorded.”“The CCTV recordings shall be preserved for 30 days, as per established practice,” it added.The novel coronavirus has infected over 75,000 people and killed around 2,400 in India till now.

He was arrested by the ED and is currently in judicial custody.The central probe agency has alleged that the scam started taking shape between April and June 2018 when Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of the scam-hit DHFL.In return, the Wadhawans allegedly “paid kickbacks of Rs 600 crore” to Rana Kapoor and his family members in the form of loans to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a firm controlled by his family, the ED said.

The Rs 20 lakh crore package announced by the PM will not only lead to end the “ills of badly designed and implemented 1991 liberalisation and subsequent integration into exploitative globalisation but will lead to employment oriented inclusive growth”, it added.“This is not only fulfilling, but we also believe that PM Modi’s 30-minute televised address vindicates the SJM’s 30 years of struggle to see India economically independent and self-reliant,” said Ashwani Mahajan of the SJM.The Sangh affiliate dealing with economic issues has offered views and positions on matters ranging from foreign direct investment to trade deals, mobilising public opinion to influence the government policy. A staunch supporter of ‘swadeshi’ (local) products which formed the crux of PM Modi’s speech yesterday, the SJM has been urging the government to ban or regulate Chinese firms like Huawei and TikTok, stricter regulation of the e-commerce sector and against genetically modified cropsIt also has a tough stance on trade issues. Highly critical of FDI, recently it was also instrumental in influencing Modi government’s stance on global trade treaty RCEP. On the PM’s efforts to create the plug and play infrastructure for investors who wanted to shift base from China to India also, the SJM had some advice.Mahajan said the SJM supported PM’s efforts to create the plug and play infrastructure for all those global investors who want to shift their base from China to India, provided they do backward integration for utilisation of domestic content, not allowed to repatriate the royalties and investments would be for the export oriented products. If they want to sell their products to the Indian markets, then custom and other import tariffs should apply.Meanwhile, praising the Prime Minister for “identifying this as an appropriate time to take a quantum jump”, Mahajan said it has set the foundation for India to take not only quantum jump but also create more opportunities and respect for the indigenous entrepreneurs.“The PM’s call to be vocal for local will have strong resonance. The appeal has a large reach, and it will strengthen indigenous and local brands among the consumers, to ultimately become global brands. The constant endorsement of the PM Modi, would help these entrepreneurs get more respect and acceptance globally,” he said.Mahajan said the “Chinese virus (Covid-19) has already accelerated the collapse of the existing model of globalisation. The model, which is not only exploitative but also reduced the opportunities for job creation”.“The era of economies of scale is passé, and the forthcoming era is of economies of scope. Chinese virus will be a natural non-tariff barrier for various products in many jurisdictions. SJM believes that the new era, would be to make products inside the geographical limits of the nation”.As per Mahajan, PM Modi was right when he said that the Indian model of globalisation would be more inclusive and lead to opportunities not only in India, but also in the partner emerging economies. “India’s business ethos always believed in the partnership, not exerting ownership. SJM strongly backs PM Modi’s call for rebuilding the globalisation on the principles of ‘Vasudeva Kutumbkam’ or world as a family,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-hails-pm-modis-call-for-atmanirbhar-bharat-abhiyan-84333

13-05-2020||London||India submits more proof against Nirav Modi in UK court||The Indian government on Wednesday submitted further documents as “corroboratory evidence” in its case of fraud and money laundering against fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, who is contesting his extradition to India at an ongoing hearing in a UK court.Westminster Magistrates’ Court District Judge Samuel Goozee expressed concern at the late submission of the documents, said to include largely bank statements relating to the diamond merchant’s companies, but allowed the application.“On balance, I am going to allow the evidence to be introduced but time would have to be allowed for these to be analysed,” he said.The ruling means a delay to the timetable of the extradition case, with closing submissions on the prima facie case against Modi now moved to a second hearing already scheduled in the two-part case – planned for five days from September 7.The hearing this week, initially scheduled to end on Friday, is now likely to conclude on Thursday after a final witness is produced by Modi’s lawyers.“The presentation of evidence in this case, which is voluminous, is not in the clearest of forms. I hope the government of India considers this carefully when preparing for the second hearing,” the judge added, in reference to the very large bundles that make up the CBI and ED case.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing in court on behalf of the Indian authorities, had said while it was not necessary for the judge to see the new evidence, the documents “help clarify matters” and “back up what is already said” on the charge against Modi of defrauding Punjab National Bank (PNB) by deceitfully obtaining letters of undertaking (LoUs), or bank guarantees, and then laundering the proceeds through a complex set of worldwide transactions using dummy companies.But Modi’s defence team raised objections to the late submission as a “very troubling” and “highly contentious” move.“Our case seems to have become a stress test for the government of India and for them to provide random pieces of evidence,” said Modi’s barrister Clare Montgomery.The third day of the extradition trial, being held in a partly remote setting, was disrupted a few times as the link to the court’s common viewing platform (CVP) faced some technical issues. It was finally stabilised for two defence witnesses to give their evidence via videolink – Thierry Fritsch, a high-end French jewellery expert, and Justice Abhay Thipsay from India.Fritsch, who had served on the Advisory Board of Modi’s company for three years since 2015, vouched for Modi’s “integrity” and skills as a great entrepreneur and a creative person, who was passionate about establishing the first international brand of luxury jewellery out of India.“I was totally impressed with the craftsmanship at the workshop (in India). It was the best quality I could see anywhere in the world,” he said.While his evidence was countered by the CPS as Fritsch being involved with only one aspect of the Modi brand, Justice Thipsay’s witness statement on the legal nuances under Indian law around the inadmissibility of the some of the police statements as well as the definition of deception under Indian law was also challenged.The 49-year-old jeweller has been following the court proceedings via videolink from a room at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, where he has been lodged since his arrest in March last year.Dressed in formals, he can be seen listening carefully and occasionally making notes as he refers to papers on a desk.Modi has made repeated attempts at bail over the past year, each of which were turned down as he is deemed a flight risk.The jeweller was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard and will be the subject of a second hearing in September when the two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” are to be heard.The judge has said both the cases are “inextricably linked” and therefore the judgment will be handed down only at the end of both hearings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-submits-more-proof-against-nirav-modi-in-uk-court-84330

13-05-2020||Bijapur||‘Not without my husband’; wife rescues cop abducted by Naxals||A woman in Chhattisgarh trekked through a forest for four days, tracked down a group of naxals, and persuaded them to release her policeman husband.When asked what made her undertake this perilous mission, Sunita Kattam’s reply was that she decided not to sit on her hands and worry, but to act.Santosh Kattam (48), a constable posted at Bhopalpatnam police station in Bijapur, was kidnapped from Gorana village in the first week of May.“He left house on the evening of May 4 to buy groceries and did not return,” Sunita (39) told PTI on Wednesday.Two days later she learnt that naxals had abducted her husband. She was a little skeptical at first, as Santosh had left home without telling anyone on a few earlier occasions too.But after it was confirmed that naxals were behind his disappearance, she informed police and also started contacting her acquaintances in the area to find his whereabouts.“I decided not to think too much and make efforts on my own to free him,” she said.She was no stranger to the naxal menace as her family lives in Jagargunda area in the neighbouring Sukma district, a hotbed of rebel activities.On May 6, Sunita, her 14-year-old daughter, a local journalist and some villagers entered a forested area to find her husband.She left her two other children with their grandmother at their house in Bijapur Police Line.“We rode on motorcycles and walked through rough terrain for four days before finding the naxals who had abducted my husband on May 10,” she said.Next day, Maoists held a ‘Jan-adalat (kangaroo court) to decide Santosh’s fate. That was when Sunita could see her husband for the first time in six days.“The villagers and I persuaded naxals to release him,” she said.According to local sources, before releasing him, naxals warned Santosh that he will face consequences if he continued to serve in the police force.When asked how did she muster courage to venture into the forest on the trail of naxals, Sunita said, “A woman can go to any lengths to safeguard her husband.” Inspector General of Police (Bastar Range) Sundarraj P said after receiving information of Kattam’s abduction, the police were trying to trace him through various sources but did not launch any operation to ensure that naxals did not harm him.Kattam’s family was also trying to secure his release, he said.After he returned to Bijapur on May 11, his medical examination was conducted and his statement was being recorded, the IG added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-without-my-husband-wife-rescues-cop-abducted-by-naxals-84328

As you know, they invent the rules themselves,” Lavrov said while dismissing the accusations against China as “baseless”.The SCO joint declaration also noted the importance of effective cooperation between the SCO and WHO in the fight against coronavirus infection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sco-comes-to-chinas-defence-seeks-who-led-role-to-battle-covid-84326
13-05-2020||Hyderabad||Now, Telangana farmers can only grow what government wants||Telangana farmers will now be able to grow only what the government wants them to grow.The state’s new agriculture policy aims at making farming profitable and area of cultivation for every crop will be determined so that there is no glut, Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (RAO) has announced.Telangana becomes the first state in the country to enforce regulation that will ensure a “glut free” produce.To make the implementation of the agriculture policy a success, the government will pay minimum support price (MSP) for only those crops cultivated on its suggestion and other farmers may even be denied the benefits of the ‘Rythu Bandhu’ scheme that grants farmers Rs 8000 per acre per year for purchase of seed, etc.The new policy says it aims to make Telangana a role model in crop colonies for the entire world.KCR said the move is aimed at making agriculture more profitable based on market demands.Regulated farming will be implemented in the state from the upcoming Vaanakalam season that is marked with the sowing of paddy. Paddy cultivation will be limited to 50 lakh acres.Besides fine and coarse varieties of paddy, Telangana Sona variety alone would be cultivated in about 10 lakh acres. The decisions were taken at a high-level meeting held by the chief minister at Pragathi Bhavan on crop colonies and cultivation of alternative crops.Detailed instructions will be given to field-level officers through a video conference on May 15.The regulation is also applicable to the cultivation of vegetables and farmers would be guided on varieties of vegetables to be cultivated based on location and extent of area.The government also decided to set up a new Seed Regulatory Authority to ensure only seeds of crops identified by the government are sold.Seed producers and traders would also be instructed to strictly adhere to the state government guidelines in this regard. If required, the state government would bring about necessary amendments in the existing Telangana Seeds Act, it is learnt.In tune with the new comprehensive agriculture policy, both the agriculture and marketing departments will be revamped.While Prof Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University will conduct more research on the required crops for cultivation in the state, the Rythu Bandhu Samithis will actively coordinate with the farmers on all agricultural issues.The chief minister has said, “Unfortunately, none of the political parties which led the previous governments in India made no focused attempts to bring agricultural reforms. But the Telangana Government has been making numerous efforts to improve the conditions. Besides resolving all pending problems, we are bringing reforms to change the entire manner in which cultivation was taken up earlier.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-telangana-farmers-can-only-grow-what-government-wants-84325

13-05-2020||New Delhi||Idol immersion: Ban on use of plastic, plaster of Paris, thermocol to make statues||In a bid to ensure idol immersion in an eco-friendly manner in the country, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has banned the use of plastic, thermocol and plaster of Paris in making idols of gods and goddesses.The CPCB has revised its 2010 guidelines on idol immersion after taking views of stakeholders, especially emphasising use of naturally occurring clay, colours in place of synthetic paints and chemicals for colouring idols.It said the use of single-use plastic and thermocol shall not be permitted at all and only eco-friendly material such as straw structure shall be used in making idols or decoration of idols/pandals/tazias in order to prevent pollution in recipient water bodies.“Idols made up of only natural, bio-degradable, eco-friendly raw material without any toxic, inorganic raw material [such as traditional virtuous clay and mud as well as free from plaster of Paris, plastic and thermocol (polystyrene) should be encouraged, allowed and promoted, and idols made up of plaster of Paris (PoP) shall be banned.“Only dried flower components for making ornaments of idols and natural resins of trees may be used as a shining material for making idols attractive,” the apex pollution control body said in its revised guidelines issued on Tuesday.Every year, the water bodies in the country get highly polluted after idol immersion during festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Pooja as the idols are made up of inorganic and toxic material instead of traditional eco-friendly mud and clay.The guidelines formulated by the CPCB in the past have gone largely unheeded as the water quality continued to go down after these festivals.The revised guidelines have now prohibited the use of toxic and non-biodegradable chemical dyes/oil paints for painting idols as well.“Only naturally occurring colours from plants (flowers, barks, stamens, leaves, roots, seeds, whole fruits), feathers of different birds, mineral or coloured rocks shall be used,” it said.The CPCB has also directed the concerned State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in states and union territories to conduct water quality assessment of water bodies, preferably in tier-1 cities (having population of more than 1 lakh), at three stages i.e. pre-immersion, during immersion and post-immersion. “Post-festival, samples should be collected preferably after third, fifth and seventh and ninth day of the festival,” the pollution watchdog said.“SPCBs/PCCs shall help district administration in preparing material for creating mass awareness as well as to assess innovative approaches for eco-friendly idol making by idol makers or craftsman or artisans,” the CPCB said.It also said the concerned authorities in state governments and UT administration dealing with safety and security in coastal areas shall take care of the necessary arrangements like motor boats with security personnel/home guards with adequate safety equipment to supervise idol immersion activities during festive season.“As far as possible idol immersion in rivers/ponds/lakes shall be encouraged only at specific designated artificial confined tanks/ponds with liner made with well graded/highly impervious clay or eco-synthetic liner, on the banks shall be promoted. “A temporary artificial tank or pond with liner made with well graded/highly impervious clay or eco-synthetic liner (HDPE), and having earthen bunds on the bank of the river/lake/pond shall be created for idol immersion,” it said.It also suggested that the charges of hiring agencies to clean-up the waste from the designated idol immersion sites should be collected as ‘visarjan charges’ from every individual citizen or community.“The ‘visarjan charges’ collected should be utilised to clean-up immersion sites, to manage polluted water from artificial temporary tank/ponds and for environmentally sound management of solid remains of idol.“The waste water collected from the designated temporary artificial ponds/tanks after ensuring on-site pre-treatment shall be discharged into or public sewers leading to sewage treatment plants/common effluent treatment plants,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/idol-immersion-ban-on-use-of-plastic-plaster-of-paris-thermocol-to-make-statues-84322

There is nothing for the unorganised sector, public spending and employment generation,” she said while addressing a press conference here.“Yesterday, when the PM announced Rs 20 lakh crore package, we were hopeful that the interest of the states will be looked into, the FRBM limit would be increased. But today, after the Union finance minister made the announcements, it was found that everything that was said yesterday was a bluff,” she said.Hitting out at the Centre for allegedly not offering anything to the financially starved states, The Trinamool Congress supremo claimed it was trying to “bulldoze” cooperative federalism.

I brought it to the notice of CM...We will give permission, ensuring safety,” he added.With all tourism activities having come to a standstill and all bookings cancelled, following the coronavirus-driven lockdown, the tourism department is focusing on promoting local tourism with the concept of “Love Your Native”.Ravi said he had drawn the chief minister’s attention to a “survival and revival” plan for the tourism sector and added that the mindset will have to change towards “Love Your Native” concept, aimed at encouraging local tourism.“Then comes inter-district with the concept ‘Nodu baa Nammura’ (Come, See Our City). After that we will consider inter-state and international tourists, while maintaining safety and hygiene,” he said.“We are also waiting for a central package.

On Tuesday afternoon, Sanjiv reached Saleem's office and enquired about purchasing a plot of land in Chirori.Senior Superintendent of Police Kalanidhi Naithani told PTI that Saleem and his wife Divya took Sanjiv to Chirori to show the plot in their car.Saleem was driving the vehicle and Divya was sitting next to him while Sanjiv was in the rear seat, the SSP said.When the vehicle reached the plot, Sanjiv apparently took out a gun and pumped bullets in Divya's back. After alighting from the car, Sanjiv fled the spot on a motorcycle driven by his accomplice who was waiting for him.When police detained Saleem for interrogation, he narrated the incident but went back on his words later. Upon pressing further, Saleem confessed to the police that he hired Sanjiv to kill his wife as he thought that she was trying to capture the land in Chirori town.According to police, Saleem claimed that Divya had stopped him from going to his office many times in the past. Saleem was apparently irritated at his wife's undue interference in the business and planned to eliminate her with Sanjiv's help for which he paid him money. She was Saleem's third wife and the couple had married in a court three years ago.Divya succumbed to her bullet wounds while undergoing treatment, police said.Saleem has been sent to judicial custody under IPC Sections 302 (punishment for murder), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 120B (punishment for criminal conspiracy). Sanjiv and his accomplice are on the run, SSP Naithani added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/property-dealer-held-in-ghaziabad-for-hiring-contract-killer-to-shoot-dead-his-wife-84304

The staff at the location was stunned to see her feeble condition as she looked quite tired and lacked energy. When asked if she had food, she simply refused. It also seemed as if she was in pain."The officials at the checkpoint hence informed the SDM and other officials. Soon a team of doctors from nearby medical checkpost arrived at the location to review her medical condition. It was evident that she was not in a condition to walk but had walked all along from Ahmedabad and hence they asked the family to rest overnight and offered them food and shelter, said Dwivedi.Next was the task to get her e-pass done as she was going to another state."It being night, I directly informed the ADM Krishna Pal Singh Chauhan about the chain of events, then collected her details from checkpost and got her e-pass formalities done from my mobile," Nayab Tehsildar Mayur Sharma made the report ready which was sent to the district collector for further approval.The administration, under emergency conditions, issued the pass. Once the pass challenge was resolved, they arranged an ambulance for her.A nearby hospital came forward for help and offered their ambulance without charging a single penny.The entire family departed from this border on Tuesday morning, said Chhaya Chaubisa, assistant director, information and public relations."Dungarpur district administration has made all arrangements done to tackle such situations. If there are migrants reaching here after walking from far off locations, we have got mini bus and other modes of transportation available for them," she said.

13-05-2020||New Delhi||Boost for MSMEs, TDS reduction: FM announces first of series of economic measures||Detailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Rs 20-lakh crore economic stimulus package, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a 25 per cent cut in the tax deducted at source (TDS), a two per cent interest subvention for PF contributions and a Rs 3.7 lakh crore loan package for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).As part of a series of press conferences that will detail the fine print of the prime minister’s stimulus package, Sitharaman also announced infusion of Rs 90,000 crore in cashless electricity distribution companies and Rs 75,000 crore for non-star performers among non-banking financial companies, housing-finance companies and micro-finance institutions.In all, the first tranche of the package unveiled by the Finance Minister amounts to over Rs 6 lakh crore, of which about Rs 540 lakh crore will be loans from banks, Rs 50,000 crore in deferred tax and about Rs 21,000 crore from the Central Government. The amount foregone due to Centre’s contribution to six months of PF for small companies was not available.Sitharaman said several components of the package were directed at the mission of making India self reliant (“Atma Nirbhar Bharat”), a phrase she translated in several Indian languages for the benefit of those who do not understand Hindi.“This is a phrase you will hear quite often,’’ she said in her opening remarks. Minister of State Anurag Thakur paraphrased Sitharaman’s remarks in Hindi.The Rs 90,000 crore liquidity infusion in discoms would help them pay the power generating companies, which she said, was an example of “Atma Nirbhar Bharat”. Another example was the government’s decision to stop issuing global tenders for its purchases of less than Rs 200 crore.While radically revising the definition for MSMEs, Sitharaman said the loans will be under three heads—Rs 3 lakh crore for 45 lakh completely shut MSME units, Rs 20,000 crore via a trust to stressed units and a Rs 50,000 crore fund for viable but shaky units. The Finance Ministry’s contribution will be Rs 14,000 crore.The Government decided to bear both PF contributions of 3.6-lakh small companies for another three months and will pay two per cent PF in certain establishments that would cost the Exchequer Rs 6,750 crore.The Government also extended the Vivaad se Vishwas income tax amnesty scheme till December 31 with no penalties. It also extended the due date for income tax returns to November 30, tax audits to October 3 and the barring of assessments to December 31.For the real estate sector, the Urban Development Ministry will write to states to invoke the Force Majeure clause for ongoing contracts.HighlightsAssessment dates barred on September 30, 2020, extended to December 31, 2020.Dates barred on March 31, 2021, extended to September 30, 202125% cut in TDS to yield Rs. 50,000 croreLoans for MSMEs: Rs. 3.70 lakh croreLiquidity injection of Rs. 90,000 crore for DiscomsLoans of Rs. 75,000 crore for NBFC, HFCs, MFIsTwo per cent PF subvention for employers and employeesNo global tenders for Govt purchases up to Rs 200 croreRegulatory extensions for Vivad se Vishwas, IT returns and auditSix-month project extension for Govt contractors||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/boost-for-msmes-tds-reduction-fm-announces-first-of-series-of-economic-measures-84296

13-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Police opposes plea in HC to transfer Tablighi leader Maulana Saad’s case to NIA||Delhi Police on Wednesday opposed a plea in the Delhi High Court seeking direction that the NIA be handed over the investigation of a case against Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad for holding a congregation in alleged violation of the orders aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus.A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani, conducting the hearing through video conferencing, asked the petitioner to place the judgements in support of his plea to transfer the investigation from Delhi Police Crime Branch to National Investigation Agency (NIA).The petition, filed by Mumbai-based lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay, has also sought direction to the NIA to investigate the matter in a time bound manner and the probe be monitored by the high court. It alleged that Delhi Police has failed to arrest the leader despite the lapse of considerable time.Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain opposed the plea saying Delhi Police was conducting the investigation in a fair manner and argued that the petitioner has no locus standi to file the plea.The court listed the matter for further hearing on May 28.Advocates Subhash Jha and Yash Chaturvedi, representing Upadhyay, claimed that the crime branch of Delhi Police has miserably failed in tracing out/ apprehending/ arresting Saad despite lapse of considerable time and his photograph being published in electronic media.“It is virtually impossible for Maulana Saad to hide himself for such a long time and that too in the capital of the country. Performance of Delhi Police has been pathetic from the very inception and outset. Failure of  Delhi Police is explicit from the fact that despite there being lockdown and curfew like situation, Maulana Saad was able to arrange gathering of thousands of people belonging to Tabiligi Jamaat in the capital of India,” the plea claimed.It further alleged that “from media reports and evidence so far collected by Delhi Police Crime Branch, it is now axiomatic that Maulana Saad and his henchmen conspired to spread and transmit coronavirus in different parts of the country, with oblique and ulterior motive of causing massive deaths all over the country and thereby to derail the Government of India in preventing the deadly disease”.The Delhi Police’s crime branch had on March 31 lodged an FIR against seven persons, including the cleric, on a complaint by Station House Officer of Nizamuddin police station here for holding a congregation of Tablighi Jamaat followers in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of coronavirus.The Enforcement Directorate has also filed a money laundering case against Saad, trusts links to the Jamaat and others.The plea alleged that the acts of omission and commission of Saad and his associates / Tabligi Jamaat constitute “terrorist acts/activities” as defined under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and claimed that the Delhi Police has failed to arrest the leader despite lapse of considerable time.It said people of Tablighi Jamaat have been spreading the deadly virus all over the country not only by defying the national lockdown, also by assaulting corona warriors who have been treating the patients. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-opposes-plea-in-hc-to-transfer-tablighi-leader-maulana-saads-case-to-nia-84293
13-05-2020||Vijay Mohan||Manali-Leh highway to open on May 18 as BRO almost clears it of snow||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 13The strategic Manali-Leh highway that provides an alternative road link to Ladakh is expected to be opened for traffic next week. Only a stretch of about two kilometres on the 490-km-long highway remains to be cleared of snow.“The remaining stretch is at Baralacha La top, the 16,000-ft high pass near the Himachal Pradesh-Ladakh border,” a senior Border Roads Organisation (BRO) officer said. “We expect to clear it by May 18-20,” he added.“The height of snow at higher altitudes ranged from 10 feet to 35 feet, with numerous avalanches and other ice hazards,” an officer said. “Snow blizzards and sub-zero temperatures are other challenges faced by the workforce,” he added. The average elevation of the highway is 13,000 feet, with the highest point being 17,480 ft at Taglang La top.The road from the other side from Leh to Baralacha La, which has four high passes en route, is already open, according to BRO sources. This year, the BRO worked to open some of the passes about 2-3 weeks earlier than usual. In April-end, Rohtang Pass, a popular tourist destination near Manali that links the Kullu Valley with Lahaul Valley in Himachal was opened by BRO three weeks earlier as compared to past years.Work of opening the strategic road, which remains closed to traffic during winters because of heavy snow, continued despite the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due precautions and safeguards were taken for the workforce.BRO sources said that for the first time road-clearing teams and equipment were inducted by helicopters to Sarchu, ahead of the Baralacha La when proceeding from Manali to Leh, so that work could be undertaken simultaneously from both ends. BRO’s 70 Road Construction Company is deployed on this stretch.The opening of the Manali-Leh road not only has socio-economic benefits for the civilian populace in the region as much needed supplies can be transported in, but also has strategic implications for the forces deployed in the northern sector. The route is an important logistical and communications element.Ladakh, which remains cut off from the mainland for over five months in winters, has two primary access roads — the national highway from Srinagar over the 11,570-ft high Zoji La between Sonmarg and Kargil and the Manali- Leh road. A third link is from Darcha near Keylong in Himachal to Kargil, which is now being widened.In winter, movement of troops and supplies to Ladakh depend upon the Air Force which ferries them in on cargo aircraft based at Chandigarh.  Tunnels are being made under the passes on both axis to permit all-weather access to Ladakh, but it is a long-drawn prospect.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manali-leh-highway-to-open-on-may-18-as-bro-almost-clears-it-of-snow-84292
13-05-2020||Beijing||China claims its troops patrolling on Chinese side of LAC||Amid tensions between the Indian and Chinese soldiers at Pangong Tso lake area, China said on Wednesday that India should refrain from taking any action to “complicate” the issue and claimed that the PLA troops were conducting “normal patrol” on the Chinese side of the border.Asked about the continued tensions along the border and whether the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops action was anyway related to the disagreements with the Indian government’s plan to lure business out of China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said both the countries were in diplomatic contact over the face-off between their troops.“China’s position on the border issue is consistent and clear. Chinese border troops have been upholding peace and tranquillity along the border areas,” Zhao told a media briefing here.“China is conducting normal patrol along the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). We urge the Indian side to work with China and refrain from taking any complicating move so as to create enabling conditions for the development of our bilateral relations and peace and stability at the border areas,” he said.“The two sides stay in diplomatic communication on the relevant border issue,” he said.The tensions began at the Pangong Tso lake area in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 and continued.On Monday, Zhao said Chinese troops there are “committed to uphold peace and stability.” At least a couple of Chinese military helicopters were spotted flying close to the un-demarcated Sino-India border in the area after the fierce face-off on May 5 following which a fleet of Sukhoi-30 jets of the Indian Air Force too carried out sorties there, the sources said in New Delhi.The troops on both sides held on to their respective positions and even reinforcements were brought in an apprehension of further escalation in tension, they said when asked about the face-off.They said tension was still prevailing in the area, though both sides agreed to disengage during a meeting of local commanders on May 6.“The situation remains tense,” said a source in New Delhi.The sources said the spotting of Chinese helicopters in the area was nothing unusual as India too flies a fleet of military choppers in the area from three bases in the region.On May 5, scores of Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed with iron rods, sticks, and even resorted to stone-pelting, sources said, adding a number of soldiers on both sides sustained injuries in the incident.In a separate incident, nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector of the Sino-India border on Saturday. At least 10 soldiers from both sides sustained injuries in the incident.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border between the two countries. Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first informal summit in April 2018 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, months after the Doklam standoff.In the summit, the two leaders decided to issue “strategic guidance” to their militaries to strengthen communications so that they can build trust and understanding.Modi and Xi held their second informal summit in Mamallapuram near Chennai in October last year with a focus on further broadening bilateral ties. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-claims-its-troops-patrolling-on-chinese-side-of-lac-84291

It's a pilot project. From next week we will be sitting here only. Lawyers can argue from their chamber," Justice Rao had said."Good idea...It will also ensure we don't infect each other," Mehta had responded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-forces-dress-code-change-for-sc-judges-84289

The previous dates were based on the data from 1901 to 1940.    However, the onset date for monsoon over Kerala remains unchanged, Rajeevan said.In states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and parts of Uttar Pradesh, monsoon will be delayed by 3-7 days compared to the existing normal dates.For the national capital, the new normal onset date for monsoon has been revised from June 23 to June 27.

We are also developing machine learning and artificial intelligence based models for avalanche forecasting as well as undertaking avalanche hazard susceptibility mapping of the region,” Naresh Kumar, Director SASE said.A Defence Research and Development Organisation laboratory based at Chandigarh, SASE’s mandate includes mountain meteorology and avalanche forecasting, artificial triggering and structural control in snowbound high altitude areas, mountain hazard mapping snow geo-intelligence and snow climate research.During winters, many parts of the Indian Himalayas get affected due to severe cold weather events because of the movement of synoptic systems known as Western Disturbances. Heavy snowfall and gales associated with these systems cause snow avalanches and road blockages in snow bound mountainous regions.According to Naresh Kumar, Sikkim has been experiencing heavier precipitation and longer spells of snow lately, resulting in a few causalities due to avalanches during last couple of years. SASE has already started issuing three-day advance avalanche warning and weather forecast for all critical sites in Sikkim on a daily basis. The forecast footprint would be further expanded.SASE is also training Army personnel deployed in snow bound regions of the state in safety, search and rescue in avalanche prone regions. Already, three such programmes have been conducted at different locations in Sikkim, which were attended by over 500 officers and troops.The network of meteorological observatories and automatic weather stations being set up across Sikkim under project SAHAS will provide real time climatic data for developing avalanche and weather forecasts. This infrastructure is likely to be established before the onset of the winter this year.A novel technological system, Avalanche Radar, is also planned to be made operational in Sikkim, which can sense the triggering of an avalanche and sound an alarm or automatically close road barriers to save people.“We have also interacted with the Government of Sikkim and our services will be extended to civilian population as well as the state disaster management authority in the coming years,” Naresh Kumar said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sase-begins-avalanche-forecasting-for-critical-sites-in-sikkim-84271

13-05-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Situation tense in eastern Ladakh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 12Tension is prevailing in eastern Ladakh as the Indian and Chinese armies have literally dug in their heels, indicating that the clash on the night intervening May 5 and 6 between the two sides is still simmering.Colonel Aman Anand, Army spokesperson, said on Tuesday that there was no continuing face-off at Pangong Tso.Sources said Indian troopers are at a location which India perceives as its territory along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC). The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China disputes Indian claims at this particular location and their troops are stationed just across this claim line on what is their side. The Chinese do not have a post at this location. They normally come for patrolling and return.The location is at a position on the north bank of the Pangong Tso (lake). This is just a few hundred metres away from the spot where troops of both sides clashed a week ago and even pelted stones resulting in injuries to several persons on either side. China has some 80-100 troopers at this location and has an estimated 1,200 men in a back up location.Army officials said, “Incidents of face-off and aggressive behaviour occur on the LAC. Patrols disengage after local-level interaction and dialogue. Temporary and short duration face-offs occur as boundary is not resolved.”Sources said the matter had been bubbling since February when the PLA stopped an Indian patrol at a location called ‘Finger 2’ on the north bank of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial melt lake which straddles India and China, at an altitude of 13,000 feet.That ‘Finger 2’ is not in dispute and is held by India. India retaliated and stopped Chinese patrols at locations much ahead or eastwards of ‘Finger 2’.Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force was asked to fly in a pair of Sukhoi 30 MKI after helicopters of China were seen flying on their own side. As per existing arrangements, fighter jets maintain a certain distance from the LAC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/situation-tense-in-eastern-ladakh-84000

The current 3.0 version ends on Sunday and the PM said an announcement would be made by the end of it as states were sending in suggestions.The country, he said, would have to learn to live with the virus but that should not hold it back from embarking on the path of India’s concept of self-reliance based on five pillars —- quantum jump in economy; modern infrastructure the country can take pride in; technology-driven systems; demographic energy; and creation of a strong demand and supply chain within the country.The package that accounts for 10 per cent of the GDP includes Rs 5.50 lakh crore announced earlier by the finance ministry and the RBI, he said. The RBI announced plans to infuse Rs 3.74 lakh crore liquidity while the Finance Minister came out with a Rs. 1.73 lakh crore package for the economically weak.Overall, it takes care of all sections and segments of society while addressing issues of land, labour, liquidity and laws. Special focus will be on the toiling masses which suffered and endured the most since March 25 lockdown.At a time when the definition of self-reliance is changing to look inward, the Prime Minister said India’s hoary past advocates “Vasudeva kutumbakam” (Whole world is a family) and that the country would like to be part of a competitive global supply chain. He urged people to promote local products, which stood the country in good stead during the current situation.Key takeaways from prime minister’s address||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-20-lakh-cr-stimulus-to-bring-in-self-reliance-84007
13-05-2020||New Delhi||Retirement age of Army jawans to increase, says Gen Bipin Rawat||The retirement age of jawans in the Army, airmen in the IAF and sailors in the Navy is set to increase.“We are soon bringing a policy to extend the service profile of the men (forces nomenclature for troops) and have an increased minimum retirement age, said Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat in an exclusive interaction with The Tribune on Tuesday evening.The move could benefit almost 15 lakh men of the three armed forces.When asked if he was looking to cut manpower costs as mounting salaries and pensions were taking away a large chunk of the budget, General Rawat said: “I am looking at manpower costs. Why should a jawan serve for just 15 or 17 years, why cannot he serve for 30 years? We are losing trained manpower.”He allayed fears that this would change the age profile of the fighting force, saying the frontline combatant could be young. “We have an Army Medical Corps, why can’t the nursing assistant serve till 50 years of age?” Citing the example of EME, he said those at base workshops remain there even in war, so why can’t they serve till 50. And at any given time the forces should not have more than a defined number who are above 40 years of age.Speaking on the impact of Covid, he said the transformation and restructuring that everyone had been discussing was the need of the hour. “There is transformation required in the armed forces and Covid means it will be done now,” General Rawat said. On being asked if the target for having joint commands within three years would be met, General Rawat said: “I don’t visualise this going beyond three years. We will have a structure and implementation will start in three years”.“For now we are moving ahead with joint Air Defence Command, the IAF chief has given a presentation on the matter and in six months we expect to have things in place. This command will have its own doctrine and amalgamate all training and logistic support.The next would be the maritime command followed by the joint commands. The Army is doing a study on joint commands and the Navy on maritime commands. “The office of the CDS has given guidelines and studies will be completed by the year-end,” General Rawat said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/retirement-age-of-army-jawans-to-increase-says-gen-bipin-rawat-84010

The US is accusing China of not being accountable for the spread of disease all over the world and for hiding the spread of epidemic during the initial days.The US has also been on a publicity binge with its local missions actively pushing steps being taken by Washington’s all over the world. Each missive unfailingly mentions in publicity about its various cooperation initiatives — with Asia Pacific, trans-Atlantic, etc — that the US is the world’s largest aid giver.China too has been upfront in publicising the dispatch of masks, personal protection equipment and medicines to countries around the world. At the same time, it has been extremely proactive in countering insinuations about opaqueness from the US Government as well as in pushing back at suggestions that call for the inclusion of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly general conference.India has refrained from entering the US-China spat till it is able to counter the Covid epidemic, suggest sources. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already spoken of the need for reforms in the World Health Organisation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pompeo-dials-jaishankar-others-to-counter-china-84013
