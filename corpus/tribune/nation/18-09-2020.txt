That is the first step for restoration of peace and tranquillity along the border," said a source.The sources said the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) was yet to respond to the Indian Army's communication to it on holding the next round of the Corps commander-level talks."There is no date as of now as the Chinese military is yet to respond to it. The talks could take place sometime next week," said the source.The two sides have so far held five rounds of talks at the level of Corps commanders.The sources said the situation remained tense at both the north and south bank of the Pangong lake area as well as at other friction points in eastern Ladakh.There have been at least three attempts by the PLA  to "intimidate" Indian troops along the north and south bank of Pangong lake area in the last three weeks where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday said China should take forward the process for complete disengagement of troops from all friction points, including at the Pangong lake area, and asked it not to make unilateral attempts to change the status quo.He said both sides should focus on easing tensions in the friction areas by refraining from any actions that may lead to an escalation in the situation.The assertion by Srivastava came in the backdrop of remarks by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday that it was for India to initiate the process to disengage and restore peace along the LAC.Both sides reached a five-point agreement to resolve the border standoff at a meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet in Moscow.The agreement included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.India occupied a number of strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake and strengthened its presence in Finger 2 and Finger 3 areas in the region to thwart any Chinese actions. China has been occupying the areas between Finger 4 and Finger 8. The mountain spurs in the area is called Fingers.China has strongly objected to India's move. However, India has maintained that the heights are on its side of the LAC.India has also rushed in additional troops and weapons to the sensitive region following China's transgression attempts.Following China's fresh attempts to change the status quo in the southern bank of Pangong lake, India has further bolstered its military presence in the region.

It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues,” Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava had said.      The Nepal government has also decided to issue coins with the inclusion of Kalapani area.The government has instructed the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, to mint the coins with the revised map. An official at the bank, however, said that they had no immediate plan to mint the coin, though preparations are on to issue coins worth Rs. 1 and Rs. 2 with the inclusion of the new map within a year.The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.

With increasing number of active cases of COVlD-19, the consumption of oxygen is also expected to increase.”In the letter the Home Secretary said, it has come to the notice that some states are trying to curb the inter-state movement of oxygen supplies from manufacturing units situated in their respective states by exercising power under various laws including Epidemic Disease Act 1897, the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Essential Commodities Act. He further emphasised that medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and any impediment in its supplies in the country may critically impact the COVID-19 management in other parts of the country.Therefore, Bhalla in the letter advised that “no such restriction is imposed” on the movement of medical oxygen between states. He also noted that transport authorities “shall be instructed to accordingly allow free inter-state and intra-state movement of oxygen carrying vehicles”.“It is also requested that all states and UTs may constitute multi-disciplinary teams, comprising representatives of the health, industry, transport and other related departments, to continuously monitor the availability of medical oxygen in their respective jurisdictions,” he advised in the letter, while suggesting that any shortfall or related problems should be immediately brought to the notice of the Central Control Room that has been established in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-centre-asks-states-to-ensure-free-movement-of-vehicles-carrying-medical-oxygen-143030

This is what Modi government has done in the farmers bills. BJP and Congress are on the same page here.” Suspended Congressman Sanjay Jha tweet triggered a row within the party hours after the BJP had said the same thing.Congress veteran P Chidambaram, however, came down heavily against this narrative saying the Congress manifesto promised to create thousands of Farmers’ Markets in small towns and large villages and “once that is accomplished, APMC laws can be changed.”Chidambaram said the way to liberalise agricultural marketing is to create more accessible markets and choice for the farmer. There will be rules to regulate such markets,” he said, noting that the APMC system is indeed a safety net for the farmer but it is a restricted market that is not accessible to millions of farmers.“We need to enlarge the market for agriculture produce while preserving the ‘safety net’ principle through MSP and Public Procurement,” said Chidambaram.Jha, who was the first in early August to warn of a letter bomb in the Congress, also said today, “Opening up the national market for farmers is a sensible move to give greater control over fair to attractive remuneration; less middlemen will boost farmer profitability. Protection against corporate exploitation can be built-in, as an assured MSP. Prima facie, welcome step!“Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of compromising farmers’ interests, and said, “Farmers have lost faith in the Modi government as there has been a difference in their deeds and actions right from the start - demonetisation, wrong GST and heavy tax on diesel. Awakened farmers know - With the Agriculture Bills, the Modi government will increase the trade of its ‘friends’ and will attack the livelihood of farmers,” Gandhi tweeted. Congress spokesman Rajdeep Surjewala stepped up the offensive by terming the BJP as “Kauravas” and said Congress will stand with “pandavas” in the fight.Chidambaram, meanwhile, dared the BJP to offer clarity on the Bills and asked “can anyone point out the clause in the Farm Bills that stipulates that the price that the farmer will get from the purchaser “shall not be less than the MSP”?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chidambaram-refutes-bjp-charge-on-cong-promise-of-apmc-act-abolition-143019

18-09-2020||New Delhi||SC agrees to hear plea against use of artificial reproduction technique on animals||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a plea which has sought declaring as “cruel” and “illegal” the use of artificial reproduction technique (ART) performed on animals without any proven bio-medical need.A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde issued notices to the Centre and others, including Animal Welfare Board of India and National Biodiversity Authority, seeking their responses on the plea against cruelty meted out to animals during the ART claiming it is unconstitutional.“Issue notice,” the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said.The plea has alleged that ART performed on livestock/animals violate some provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act 1960, the Biological Diversity Act 2002, the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, and also the Constitution which mandates protection of environment and nature along with animals.“Reproduction is a basic natural and biological need as well as urge of all living beings, save and except monosexual organisms. No authority can arbitrarily trample or destroy the rights or needs of any living being including animals by means of policy or practice, which in itself against nature and natural principles,” said the plea, filed by Madurai-based S Venkatesh.“Bypassing and preventing the natural mating and artificially reproducing as a principle/policy is by itself cruel; not to mention the cruelty or pain inflicted by the artificial process and methods of reproduction in animals,” it said.It has also sought an interim direction that ART on livestock/animals, including but not limited to collection and extraction of semen from bulls and male animals, be stayed pending disposal of the petition.The plea said the Constitution has explicitly recognised the value of lives and welfare of animals, including when they are being used for meat consumption, and mandates that all living beings be treated with compassion and respect.As per the National Dairy Development Board data, the number of artificial insemination performed in dairy animals was over 73 million in 2017-18 alone, it said.The petitioner has claimed that in the Budget speech 2020-2021, the Finance Minister stated that coverage of artificial insemination shall be increased from the present 30 per cent to 70 per cent.Referring to the December last year written reply in Lok Sabha by Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, the plea has claimed that in the last five year the government has incurred expenditure of over Rs 1,200 crore through ‘Rashtriya Gokul Mission’ towards ART, including artificial insemination.“ARTs contributes to environmental pollution; items and tools, including single use items, that are needed for ART are made of plastics, and similar eco unfriendly materials. The ART process, including preparation and storage, has couple dozen or so steps many of which are carbon foot print intensive and thus contribute to global warming and eco degradation,” it said.Referring to the alleged ill-effects of ART, the plea said in the US, it has led to extinction of variation and diversity in genetic resources in cattle which may have potentially led to increase in unhealthy and non-nutritious dairy products being produced.It said there had been a steep decline in the population of ‘desi cattle’ in India, some of them are already extinct.While referring to the statistics from livestock census, it said that in the last three decades the population of desi bulls has decreased by a whopping 55 per cent and in the same period, population of desi cow has decreased from 90 per cent to 67 per cent.“Mating is a biological need and a natural process and thus interfering and encourage ART is cruelty meted to animals and in addition would adversely impact, among others things, the eco-system in mid and long run, and the impact could be irreversible,” the plea said, adding that it is the duty of state to protect the rights of animals and safeguard their welfare.It alleged that indiscriminate ARTs are converting animals into “just a reproducing machines” and not treating them as living being.

18-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Farm legislations: The tussle between farmers, Centre and Opposition||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 18Every story has two sides but the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three agriculture-related legislations has more than that with farmers, middlemen or ‘arthiyas’, States and the Centre forming the various facets. Interestingly as agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar points, sides traditionally at odds (farmers and arthiyas) are together in this one-on-one against the BJP-led Centre aided by Opposition parties, farmers’ organisations and activists.Perhaps the real issue is too technical and the threat of new ecosystem rendering MSP irrelevant more impacting. The Tribune talked to different sides to understand the dynamics of the evolving agitation in the light of the contentious legislations which the Narendra Modi government calls “pro-farmers and revolutionary” but still forced an unprecedented reaction from its cornered ally, the Akali DalThis is what BKU General Secretary Yudhvir Singh said after Prime Minister Modi on Friday accused the Opposition, primarily the Congress, of “misleading farmers with disinformation campaign”, “spreading lies” and “supporting middlemen”: “The Prime Minister is trying to suppress realities with these allegations.”“Farmers’ virodh (opposition) has not happened for the first time, we have fought several battles against the government, including in the regime of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh," he said. "The Akali Dal (Harsimrat Kaur Badal) was forced to resign from the government, otherwise it would not have been able to enter Punjab, this is the situation today,” said Yudhvir Singh, adding that if ‘mandis’ cease to exist so will the MSP. This despite the government’s repeated claim that “MSP will remain now and forever”. “The system of MSP exists in ‘mandi’ and ‘mandi’ is governed by the APMC Act. Yes, farmers are exploited by ‘arthiyas’ but the aim should have been to fix that lacuna in the system,” says the BKU leader.  “Procurement at the MSP is only for a limited period and farmers who are not able to sell during the period are forced to sell at lower prices to ‘arthiyas’, but the same group will step in case the system changes. The government is acting at the behest of WTO, World Bank and IMF and using Covid-limitations to push in legislations that will destroy farmers,” he said. Meanwhile, upset with PM’s attempt to “eliminate middleman”, 'arthiyas' say they are the “facilitators” and "integral part of the food grain procurement network system working for benefit of both farmers and government agencies.Ravinder Singh Cheema, president of the Punjab Aarhtia Association, says: “These legislations will ruin the agriculture marketing infrastructure network created in the past five decades. ‘Aarhtias’ work like bridge, take the responsibility of quality and quantity of the government stock up to 45 days in procurement season and protect farmers against officials trying to shortchange them with objections about moisture content, quality of the grain etc.” "Big companies will also purchase grain through agent/ distributor,” he said, also rejecting the observation that they were trying to fire from the shoulders of farmers."The movement is led by young educated farmers who know what is right. If the government does not change the decision, the central agency will not be allowed to purchase a single grain from Punjab and Haryana, all movement will be blocked. It is because of strong ‘mandi’ system that Punjab and Haryana farmers are able to get 100% MSP whereas in states like UP, Gujarat and MP they are exploited by officials."The BJP, which is accusing the Congress of “misleading, lying and double-speak" on the "revolutionary agri-reform steps that will change the face of the farming sector and state of farmers in the country" also points to its poll' promise in 2019 to repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act in 2019.BJP president JP Nadda says: “UPA between 2013-14 de-notified fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act in its states, including Haryana, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Karnataka.”“The Congress in its 2019 Lok Sabha elections manifesto made it clear it will  repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees Act and make trade in agricultural produce, including exports and inter-state trade, free from all,” he said.“Not just this the Congress in paragraph 21 stated: ‘The Essential Commodities Act 1955, belongs to the age of controls. Congress promises to replace the Act by an enabling law that can be invoked only in the case of emergencies’." Not just Nadda and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, PM Modi has also specified that “MSP in 'mandis' and APMC Act  will not be impacted by the legislations".  “Farmers who do not want to sell in ‘mandis' can sell outside, it should be their choice.  MSP is limited to ‘mandis’ and available for limited period. These agri-reforms are dedicated to farmers, giving them choice and freedom to cross barriers, helping them increase produce and investment in the sector," he saysHowever, agriculture expert Panwar believes implementation of new agriculture legislations will be difficult. There are many reasons but most important is “lack of consultations with stakeholders”.“Punjab and Haryana will be affected the most because of loss of ‘mandi’ tax, which is a good source of revenue. While ‘arthiyas’ will also lose their commissions and traditional business, farmers are apprehensive about the functioning of new land contract system and agriculture market.”“What is proposed in the ordinances/legislations appear to have strong biases either towards corporate or uncertainties. Therefore, much depends upon how new system face challenges in the field and evolves,” he says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-legislations-the-tussle-between-farmers-centre-and-opposition-143003

Before hurling stones at Adhir Chowdhury, I urge you (Banerjee) to ask your leaders to look at themselves in the mirror,” he said.The five-time Bahrampur MP said the timing of the allegation was “interesting” as it was made soon after he was made the president of West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee.“They are making such malicious allegations as they know that Adhir Chowdhury will not work in accordance with their diktat,” he stated.Chowdhury, who is also the Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha, sought to know why the state’s ruling party MPs had skipped voting on the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB).“If Didi (Mamata Banerjee) had ordered them to vote against the CAB, would any of her party MPs have had the guts to remain absent?” he contended.All regional parties in the country know well that the Congress is the “only option” to fight the BJP, the veteran leader maintained.“Just because the TMC supremo along with some other states opposed the GST issue, it does not mean that regional parties will accept her as the all-India leader in their fight against the saffron camp.“It is because the Congress put pressure on the BJP government at the Centre, the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan was introduced for returnee migrant workers,” Chowdhury claimed.Lakhs of migrant workers who returned to Bengal due to the lockdown are now going back to their places of work, having got no relief or work in their own state, he said.“Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said 11 lakh migrant workers returned to Bengal. The state, however, did not gain anything from the Rs 50,000-crore project (Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan), the benefits of which were reaped by Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha,” the senior Congress leader added.

18-09-2020||New Delhi||Shadow cast on Opposition unity||A shadow has been cast on the unity of opposition parties at the Centre on account of competitive politics of Trinamool Congress vs Congress and Left parties in West Bengal.This was on display on Thursday in Parliament's premises when Trinamool Congress organised demonstration of MPs of eight opposition parties to protest against Centre for not releasing GST compensation money to the states.The Congress, the main opposition party, and the Left parties were kept out of the loop.TMC's chief Whip Kalyan Banerjee in Lok Sabha reasoned that Congress cannot expect cooperation from it at the Centre while it (Congress) acts against TMC's interest in West-Bengal.The development is bound to be welcomed by the BJP which would want to see the Opposition in disarray.West-Bengal goes to Assembly poll in May, next year.While for the BJP West-Bengal is the frontier state to in eastern India to be won, the ruling TMC wants to return to power for the third consecutive term.The BJP has never been in power in the state, not even in a coalition in the state. On the contrary, its rivals have ruled it individiually on their own in the past.The Congress and the Left parties will in all probability contest the coming assembly election in alliance.The paradox for the Left, TMC and the Congress is that they swear by Opposition unity at the Centre, but are adversarial among themselves when it comes to politics relating to the states concerned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shadow-cast-on-opposition-unity-142983
18-09-2020||---||Uproar in Lok Sabha over Anurag Thakur's remarks on Jawaharlal Nehru||New Delhi, Sept 18The Opposition and the ruling BJP-led government clashed over setting up of the PM Cares Fund, leading to Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur expressing ‘regret’ over his remarks on Jawaharlal Nehru to restore the House proceedings.   The House was adjourned four-times between 4 pm and 6 pm after Thakur took a jibe at the former Prime Minister.The argument started when the ‘Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020’ was tabled. Thakur, while answering points raised  by the Opposition on the need to create a new PM Cares Fund, said the earlier Prime Minister's National Relief Fund was created by Nehru ji (Jawaharlal Nehru) like a royal order.From 1948 till today, it has not been registered. How did it get (foreign contribution) FCRA clearance? The trust is not registered, he said.The PM CARES is a registered public charitable trust.This is for 130 crore people, said Thakur, adding “You created a trust for the Gandhi family. Nehru, Sonia Gandhi were members of the PM National Relief Fund. This should be investigated.”This led to a pandemonium as the Congress leader of the House in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary retorted saying have we said that Modi is stealing from funds, how did he (Anurag) use the words for Nehru.“He  is lowering the respect of the Chair of Speaker,” Chaudhary told the Speaker.   Gaurav Gogoi demanded that Thakur should apologise.At 6 pm, the House resumed normal business after Thakur said: “I did not want to hurt anyone. If anyone is hurt I regret my words.”Manish Tewari while protesting the tabling of the Bill cited a clause saying it allows the Centre to avoid paying the GST dues to states. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman assured the House “we are not running away from responsibility”.“We have not said that we will not pay the states,” she said.Meanwhile, Kalyan Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress (TMC),  accused Speaker Om Birla of “protecting” BJP members, saying, “You tell us to sit down and you don’t say anything to BJP members who shout. You are protecting the BJP and not allowing us to speak.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uproar-in-lok-sabha-over-anurag-thakurs-remarks-on-jawaharlal-nehru-142974

Hence, instead of today, ‘Viraat’ will be towed (to Alang) tomorrow (Saturday), it said.The vessel had served the Indian Navy for 30 years before being decommissioned in 2017 in Mumbai.It was the only warship in the Indian fleet which had served in the Royal Navy of the UK and later in the Indian Navy.There were attempts to convert ‘Viraat’ into a museum or a restaurant, but one of the plans fructified.Alang-based Shree Ram group had won the bid for dismantling the ship.The company has its own high capacity tugs which will tow the vessel to Alang and it would take two days to complete the journey, a Navy official said.Alang, a beach town, houses the world’s biggest ship breaking yard.

In order to effectively scan the passengers for COVID-like symptoms, CR has set up a body screening facility (FebriEye) at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) in Mumbai," CR spokesperson Shivaji Sutar told IANS.It not only ensures contactless entry for travellers to avoid the spread of coronavirus but also helped detect 28 passengers whose body temperature was above normal."They were not allowed to travel by trains and advised to go for medical check-up and further necessary medical action," he added.The CR is using the FebriEye human body screening facility developed by Vehant Technologies, which is a thermal and vision camera that not only measures forehead temperature but also detects face mask and social distancing violations.Sutar said that FebriEye cameras can cover a large area for scanning, which means these can detect and record body temperatures of a number of people entering at once into a premise even while the prospective passengers are on the move.Kapil Bardeja, CEO and co-founder of Vehant Technologies, said: "FebriEye has already been used successfully by the Indian Railways at their Mumbai HQ (Central Railway)." Besides, the system has been installed at Bilaspur, Raipur, and Guwahati (North Frontier Railway), he added.Bardeja said that the equipment is reliable, and generates alerts for violation of any protocols on face masks. It is suitable for deployment in high-footfall areas.He said that as per the standard operating procedure, passengers are screened with FebriEye before they are allowed to board trains. "Till date, over seven lakh passengers have been screened in Mumbai," Bardeja said.CR officials said that Febrieye is equipped with 'Black Body', a constant temperature source that ensures accuracy in body temperature readings up to plus or minus 0.3 degree Celsius."The device helps maintain a stable thermodynamic ambience. We are using AI- and CCTV- based software as it detects body temperatures and faces masks on a real-time basis, apart from social distancing." Amid the nationwide lockdown, the Indian Railways had suspended train services from March 25. It started operating Shramik Special trains from May 1 to transport stranded migrant workers, students, pilgrims, and tourists.The Railways started to run special air-conditioned trains from May 12 and 100 pairs of time-tabled trains from June 1. From September 12, the Railways also started operating 40 pairs of trains. --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ai-based-cameras-detect-rail-travellers-with-fever-without-masks-142958

18-09-2020||New Delhi||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Forensic re-examination hints at discrepancies||The 'medico legal opinion' of forensic experts, which holds the key to unravelling the mystery shrouding the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, hints at certain discrepancies relating to the inquest report and description of the crime scene filed by the police.A thorough re-examination of the scene of crime which includes the bedroom and duplex flat of Sushant where the star allegedly committed suicide, and autopsy files were conducted by the forensic experts of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to ascertain the cause of death of the young Bollywood actor.Highly placed sources in the Department of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, AIIMS told IANS that findings of its expert team would certainly shed light on the mysterious death of Sushant Singh Rajput."If an inquest report, which carries crucial details about the circumstances in which one died, has certain discrepancies then it could be an important finding. However as the matter is subjudice, specific forensic findings cannot be shared," the source added.The Head of the Department of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, AIIMS, Dr Sudhir Gupta also stated that findings which are conclusive will only be shared with CBI."At this stage I can only say that the opinion of the medical board will clear all doubts (relating to the star's mysterious death)," said Dr Gupta while refusing to comment on the nature of discrepancies or any sign of lapses in conducting autopsy and other forensic investigations.The results of the viscera test which holds conclusive opinion on the death of Sushant will also be shared by the AIIMS team with CBI officials early next week.The forensic experts of AIIMS were requested by the CBI to examine the lapses in initial investigations, primarily the forensic aspects. Tampering of any evidence at the crime scene or omission of any sign of foul play by Mumbai Police or panel of doctors which conducted the post-mortem, were the key areas where the forensic team has gathered information based on a thorough investigation.The AIIMS experts were flown from Delhi to Mumbai to make an on-spot assessment of the sequence of events and scrutiny of documents related to forensics.Earlier a team of doctors including two forensic surgeons of Mumbai, Dr Shiv Kumar Kolle and Dr Sachin Sonawane, which conducted an autopsy of the body on June 15 at Cooper Hospital had concluded that Sushant died of asphyxia due to hanging. In their autopsy report the panel of five doctors have not indicated any sign of foul play or observed any trait or feauture which led to suspicion of murder.However re-examination of all forensic investigations by the team of AIIMS has given a much clearer picture of what really happened on June 14 at the flat in Bandra where Sushant was found dead.Meanwhile, sources in the CBI said that once all documents, case diaries, witness statements have been studied, the agency would first look into the involvement of any outside hand, if involved in the case."CBI is known for handling sensitive cases. We do not succumb to pressure. We are investigating the case with an open mind. Whether Sushant Singh was murdered or he committed suicide, the documentary and forensic evidence will give an insight," said an officer in the agency.

Farmers are not dependent on any middleman,” the PM said while speaking at a programme unveiling the development works for Bihar where polls are due shortly.He said the bills are being brought for progress and benefit of the farming community and are being opposed only by those who do not want the farmers to break away from the shackles of middlemen.Also read:President accepts Harsimrat's resignation; Tomar gets additional charge of her ministryNo going back on agri-legislations, say BJP leaders as they downplay differences with Akali DalKejriwal appeals to all non-BJP parties to unite in Rajya Sabha to oppose farm billsNew farm laws part of SAD-backed Central govt’s ‘Kisan maaru, Punjab maaru’ conspiracy: Capt AmarinderNavjot Sidhu breaks Twitter silence; says attack on Punjab's soul won’t be toleratedSunny Deol says agricultural ordinances will help farmers get better priceMansa farmer protesting at Badal village tries to commit suicideThe PM said the APMC Act had been done away by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, helping farmers to do business as per their choice.The very APMC on which the Congress is trying to do politics, they promised to repeal in their election manifesto in 2019, the PM said. “They are opposing just for the sake of opposition without realising that farmers are aware who these people are who are standing with the middlemen," he said.This is the Prime Minister's second clarification/statement on the issue in less than 24 hours.

He took the oath, along with other MPs, on the opening day of the current the Monsoon Session.With issues relating to the country’s economy likely to dominate national discourse in the coming times, the Opposition is expected to train its critical gaze in the Parliament on the performance and policies of the BJP-led NDA dispensation at the Centre.With the BJP well placed in the Lok Sabha, at least till the time full term of the present House, it is subjected to vulnerabilities to possible headwinds in the Rajya Sabha where its numbers would be predicated on its periodic performances electorally in the states.Hence, the BJP will have to bolster up its pool of talent resource to counter a feisty Opposition in the Rajya Sabha.The sling of debates and discussions from the Opposition benches in the Upper House had been sharp and of good quality during the first tenure of the Narendra Modi government and the present as well.House Chairman Venkaiah Naidu has, on many occasions in the past, also appreciated the quality of debate and discussions and the contributions by the Members of Parliament regarding the productivity of the House under his watch.The BJP has brought Islam to the Rajya Sabha through the quota of the state Uttar Pradesh ruled by it, even though he is a native of Jharkhand.Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar.In a political sense, the BJP is also indirectly trying to create a buzz in the two states by politically elevating Islam to the Rajya Sabha.Also, through Islam’s election, BJP has apparently sought to counter the allegation that Muslims were ignored, especially under Yogi Adityanath’s dispensation in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-hopes-to-add-power-to-partys-voice-in-rajya-sabha-newly-elected-mp-syed-zafar-islam-142938

I hope to be able to encourage communities to embrace a better civic sense to create sustainable living spaces — like when mountain-high landfills are detonated," Singhal said in the statement.According to Singhal's profile on his website, the student at The British School in New Delhi conceived the Glass2Sand project in late 2018 when the collection of bottles had become unviable for waste collectors due to dropping demand because large storage spaces were needed and the transport costs were high.Empty glass bottles were not segregated anymore and started to go for dumping in the landfills, the Glass2Sand website said, adding that Singhal's initiative has stopped over 8,000 bottles from being dumped in landfills and produced 4,815 kilograms of high-grade silica sand so far.The Young Leaders for the SDGs initiative is organised on a biennial basis by the Office of the UN Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth and is the office's highest-profile recognition opportunity for young people who are leading efforts to combat the world's most pressing issues and whose leadership is catalysing the achievement of the SDGs. “As the UN marks its 75th anniversary during unprecedented times, the 2020 Young Leaders for the SDGs are a clear example of how young people are leading the way in shaping a more sustainable and inclusive future for all,” the UN Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth Jayathma Wickramanayake said."Despite being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, young people around the world continue to demonstrate immense resilience, resourcefulness and leadership in finding innovative solutions to recover better and achieve the SDGs,” she said.The young leaders — between the ages of 18 and 29 years old — represent the diverse voices of young people from every region of the world, and are collectively responsible for activating millions of young people in support of the SDGs.This group will come together as a community to support efforts to engage young people in the realisation of the SDGs both through strategic opportunities with the UN and through their existing initiatives, platforms and networks.The 2020 Class of 17 Young Leaders includes representatives from Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Colombia, Egypt, India, Ireland, Liberia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Senegal, Turkey, Uganda and the United States.This year's Young Leaders for the SDGs include 22-year-old Mariama Djambony Badji of Senegal who is a young entrepreneur of green and smart architecture, 18-year-old Siena Castellon from Ireland who is an autism and neurodiversity advocate, 26-year -old Ilayda Eskitascioglu of Turkey who founded an initiative that aims to provide sanitary materials to rural women in the country, a 23-year-old climate activist from Uganda Vanessa Nakate. It also includes 21-year-old environmental engineer from Egypt Loay Radwan, a 22-year-old deep-tech architect from Bangladesh Zahin Razeen and 28-year-old Ralf Toenjes from Brazil, who is the founder and CEO of two national organisations Renovatio, a non-profit, and VerBem, a social business with the mission to democratise the access of eye care in Brazil and internationally. Renovatio/VerBem has been able to supply more than 150000 people with correct eye care and donate more than 60,000 eyeglasses to people in Brazil, Mozambique, Haiti, and India.In 2017, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appointed Wickramanayake of Sri Lanka as his Special Envoy on Youth and as the youngest senior official in the history of the organisation.Wickramanayake's mandate is to harmonise the UN system efforts on youth development, enhance the UN response to youth needs, advocate for the development needs and rights of young people, as well as to bring the work of the United Nations on youth closer to them.The Envoy on Youth also acts as the advisor to and the representative of the Secretary-General on youth-related matters.

A similar incident had happened with a passenger on one of the airline’s other Dubai flights previously,” said one of the officials.Therefore, the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority has suspended Air India Express flights from September 18 to October 2, the officials stated.Both incidents of passengers flying with COVID-positive certificates to Dubai from India on Air India Express flights happened during the last couple of weeks, the officials noted.When asked about this matter, Air India Express said it was focusing on reducing the hardship of the passengers and it planned to operate its four Dubai flights, scheduled to operate from India on Friday, to Sharjah instead.

18-09-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi removed ‘feudal’ customs, ‘red beacon culture’ in governance: Naqvi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed “feudal” customs and the “red beacon culture” to transform governance which perturbed those who regarded “circumambulation in the corridors of power” as their strength, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Friday.In a blog titled ‘Culture of Parikrama Replaced by Commitment of Performance’, the Minority Affairs Minister talked about Modi’s governance style and said the Prime Minister had opened regular communication channels with ministers and secretaries thereby increasing accountability and responsibility of all.The Prime Minister’s governance has perturbed all those who considered “circumambulation in the corridors of power” as their strength and a “passport to success” for the last several decades, he said, in an apparent dig at the Congress.They have now realised that the “work culture of result-oriented performance” was the only mantra paramount for the Modi government, Naqvi said.“Before 2014, receiving and seeing the Prime Minister off at the airport was a ‘loyal custom’ for the members of the Cabinet but this decades-old ‘feudal custom’ was given a quick and deserved burial by Modi,” Naqvi said.Prime Minister Modi also put an end to “red beacon culture” which was synonymous with “snobbery and naked show of power and status”, he said.“Many MPs and VVIPs used to consider certain subsidies and privileges such as occupying government bungalows even without being a minister or an MP as ‘constitutional right’ or ‘birthright’ and this was abolished firmly and without exception,” Naqvi said.Many ministries were accustomed to hastily spending the major part of their budgets in the last quarter or even the last month just to meet the March deadline but Modi has put an end to such “customary and lackadaisical” approach of the government, Naqvi said.He claimed that the “tradition of work for one day” and “outing for 10 days”, which was the “norm” during the foreign tours of the Prime Minister, ministers and bureaucrats, was ended by Modi, who has ensured that official overseas travels were result-oriented and work focussed.“Another area of concern had been the hold of middlemen and brokers who kept their links with the personal staff in the offices of ministers intact even after changes in government and ministers but Prime Minister Modi clipped the wings of these brokers by restricting the tenure of the personal staff of ministers to 10 years overall,” he said.One much-desired area of reform has been the prestigious Padma awards which were being given purely on political recommendations but now have become “people’s awards” where they were completely people-driven and the deserving were being honoured, Naqvi said.Noting that in recent months, India, along with almost all other nations of the world, had been going through an unprecedented crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, Naqvi said that like a true leader, Prime Minister Modi had led the fight against this pandemic from the front.“Timely actions and issuance of pan-India guidelines have helped the nation tackle the Corona challenge and the other challenges that came along such as floods, typhoons and the swarms of ‘tiddis’ (locusts), even as certain ‘fisaddis’ (losers) tried to create confusion,” the minister said.

There is no going back (on the three legislations),” they say.His very strong words on Thursday, cautioning “farmers against vested interests” (which observers read as a message for both the Congress and the Akalis in Punjab) and the SAD not walking out of the NDA and only quitting the government for now, BJP leaders say their ally has inadvertently “put in open its uncertainties and apprehensions regarding its future” in Punjab.Perhaps, the BJP now has a chance to break free of obligations of standing with the three-decades-old ally which has “now become a liability”, observers also conform.Notably, hailing the passage of three farm sector bills in the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister described these proposed legislations as historic and asserted that they would rid farmers and the farm sector of middlemen and other bottlenecks.With the Akalis joining the opposition in protesting these bills, Modi asserted that many forces were trying to “mislead” farmers and assured the farming community that the minimum support price (MSP) and government procurement of their produce would continue along with a lot of other options for them.So far as the Akalis are concerned, its leaders said:” For the time being, we are in NDA. In the next couple of days, our core committee will meet and decide. However, when our forces are eyeball to eyeball with the PLA, and Pak wants to ferment trouble in the border State of Punjab, Akalis will not do anything that weakens the government.”However, the BJP strongly believes that reforms will provide new opportunities for farmers to sell their produce and will lead to increased profits for them.Prime Minister Modi also urged farmers and those associated with the agriculture sector to listen to Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s reply to the discussion on these bills. Many forces were trying to mislead farmers, he added while assuring them of the benefits of these reforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-going-back-on-agri-legislations-say-bjp-leaders-as-they-downplay-differences-with-akali-dal-142910
18-09-2020||Washington||India-US strategic energy partnership takes deep roots: Taranjit Singh Sandhu||The strategic energy partnership between India and America has taken deep roots in a short span of time, India’s top diplomat to the US has said, asserting that this cooperation could energise the economic recovery of both the countries.The US remained a critical partner for India in meeting the development aspirations of 1.3 billion people, India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said, adding that there was no field of human endeavour where both India and the US are not cooperating.“However, some of the pillars of bilateral relations have emerged crucial over the years. Energy is one such,” he said while addressing the 2020 Natural Gas Summit which was organised virtually by the US Department of Energy Thursday.The summit was also addressed by Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette and Director of the White House National Economic Council Larry Kudlow.“In a short span of two years, it is gratifying to know that our strategic energy partnership has taken deep roots. India offers a huge market. Our energy requirement would only increase as we move up the development trajectory under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Sandhu said.Observing that energy security was vital to India’s national security, he said the United States was abound in energy resources and leading technologies, including natural gas.“The complementarities and synergies are striking. I also believe that India, US energy partnership can energise the economic recovery in both deletions,” Sandhu said.India is now the fourth-largest international market for US crude oil and the fifth largest for US LNG. The bilateral hydrocarbon trade has touched $9.2 billion during 2019-20, marking a 93 per cent increase over 2017-18 figures.The numbers would grow in future with Indian companies entering into more long-term contracts.“We welcome the entry of US LNG in the global markets as it offers us more diversity in our exports thus augmenting our energy security order. Further, US supplies have enhanced liquidity, flexibility and transparency of the global energy market,” Sandhu said, adding that India remained focused on expediting the development of gas infrastructure across the nation, namely gas pipelines, LNG terminals, city gas distribution networks, biogas projects.Investment opportunities of over $60 billion in developing gas infrastructure and associated industries have been created, as the government strives towards a gas-based economic system in the country.“We are developing a one nation one gas grid system,” he said, noting that the share of gas in the overall energy basket was likely to double in the next 10 years.“To promote the usage of energy in the transport sector, India is looking at developing the LNG retail ecosystem, along with national and state highways in India. There are a lot of opportunities for the US industries out there,” Sandhu said, adding that waste to energy was another focus area for India.The ambassador said that given the pandemic led supply and demand distortions, the commercial contracts between LNG exporters and importers entered earlier needed to be resilient and adaptive to market realities.“A timely and appropriate initiative from the US government will go a long way in restoring the confidence of Indian LNG buyers in the US projects, and would help greater LNG import growth in coming years,” he said.

The passage of the laws is a huge blow dealt by the BJP government to States’rights and federalism.”Chidambaram said farmers of Punjab and Haryana are on the streets protesting. “This captures the distance between the people and the government. The two Ordinances challenge the three pillars of our still-imperfect ‘food security system’. They are (1) MSP; (2) public procurement; and (3) PDS. The grave flaw in the Ordinances is that they do not stipulate that the price which the farmer gets ‘shall not be less than the MSP,” he said.Chidambaram said farmers in Tamil Nadu have told me that they are selling paddy at Rs 850 to private traders against an MSP of Rs 1,150.“State government must explain," he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-bills-passage-huge-blow-to-federalism-chidambaram-142902

The two leaders had their hands raised and clenched before a 1,25,000-strong crowd who had gathered to welcome the US president on his first India visit at Motera cricket stadium in Ahmedabad in February this year.At the event, Prime Minister Modi had said that a “new history” was being created. Modi and Trump enjoy a “special relationship” and have been working on a number of regional and global issues.They frequently talk over the phone and the countries have had an unprecedented level of cooperation even during the coronavirus pandemic.India supplied hydroxychloroquine to the US in the early stages of the pandemic and Trump ordered ventilators to India. The two countries are also collaborating on the development of vaccines and therapeutics.On Thursday, Lisa Curtis, the deputy assistant to the US president, told a top American think-tank the Trump administration has elevated the relationship with India and solidified the growing partnership “in ways not seen in any other US administration”.“The joint statement signed by President Trump and PM Modi following the Trumps’ visit to India in February is testament to this administration’s commitment to building this vital partnership,” Curtis said.“Whether we are talking about increasing collaboration to develop therapeutics and vaccines to combat COVID-19; increasing defence cooperation, such as India’s recent decision to purchase US multi-role and attack helicopters worth $3 billion; or enhancing collaboration on cybersecurity, the US-India relationship has never been better,” she said.Putin and Merkel wrote letters to Modi, and Johnson and several others tweeted. Several other organisations and individuals in the US also greeted Prime Minister Modi.“Best wishes to” Modi on his 70th birthday, US India Business Council said.“Prime Minister Modi has steered the US-India relationship to new heights, creating a vision for India to play a significant role in helping the world bounce back post-pandemic.

18-09-2020||Washington||Biden admn to place high priority on strengthening ties with India||A Biden administration will have no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia and will place a high priority on strengthening the ties between India and the US that are "natural partners", his campaign has asserted.Joe Biden, 77, officially accepted the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party last month, urging the American voters to come together to overcome a "season of darkness" that has cloaked the US for "much too long".Senator Kamala Harris, 55, accepted the Democratic Party's nomination to be the vice president of the United States last month, scripting history by becoming the first Indian-American and also the first Black woman to be on a major political party's national ticket."We believe that India and the United States are natural partners, and if elected, our administration will place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the US-India relationship," the Biden campaign said in a written response to a series of questions asked by the Hindu American Political Action Committee.The committee recently sent a series of questions to the campaigns of former Vice President Biden and President Donald Trump as part of its decision-making process to endorse either of them before the November 3 presidential election."A Biden-Harris administration will have no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia - cross-border or otherwise. Our administration will work to strengthen India's capabilities as a defence and counter-terrorism partner," the Biden campaign said.“During the Obama-Biden administration, the US and India strengthened their cooperation to fight terrorism in each of our countries and across the region, and if we are elected, the Biden-Harris administration will continue and build on this effort," it said.Expressing concern about dangerous conditions for religious minorities in South Asia and elsewhere, Biden said if elected, his administration would renew America's commitment to standing as a beacon of hope for refugees around the world, including those fleeing religious persecution and seeking the freedom to worship as they choose.Noting that the US is fundamentally a nation of immigrants, he said he is committed to immigration reform that provides a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants - including more than 500,000 from India.“We will remove the uncertainty for Dreamers by reinstating the DACA programme and explore all legal options to protect their families from inhumane separation. All of this is in direct opposition to Trump's actions,” the campaign said.A Biden-Harris administration will work with the Congress to increase the number of visas awarded for permanent, employment-based immigration - and promote mechanisms to temporarily reduce the number of visas during times of high US unemployment, it said.“We will also exempt from any cap recent graduates of PhD programmes in STEM fields in the US. We believe that foreign graduates of a US doctoral programme should be given a green card with their degree and that losing these highly trained workers to foreign economies is a disservice to our own economic competitiveness,” it said.“Critically, Vice President Biden believes that we need to reform our high skilled temporary visas support to establish a wage-based allocation process and establish enforcement mechanisms to ensure they are aligned with the labour market and not used to undermine wages, and, as part of that reform, he supports eliminating the limits on employment-based green cards by country, which have kept so many Indian and Hindu families in waiting for too long,” the campaign said.Ajay Bhutoria, national finance committee member of Biden campaign, said in a statement that a Biden-Harris administration would celebrate Hindu holidays, as was done in the Obama-Biden administration, which celebrated Diwali at the White House, the Vice President's residence at the Naval Observatory, and at the Pentagon.This election year Biden recognised Holi and Ganesh Chaturthi.“In doing this, our hope is to showcase how Hindu-Americans are, in every way, Americans and that we are all bound by common values and aspirations, and that this may help to minimise the kinds of misunderstandings about Hinduism that cause bullying,” he said.Bhutoria said the Biden campaign made history in its outreach to the Hindu-American community.“Biden became the first major-party presidential nominee to respond to a questionnaire for the Hindu-American community,” he said.Biden's a response to real concerns in the community, addressing the unique challenges facing Hindu students to the importance of reforming the immigration system to how to help small businesses recover from COVID-19, Bhutoria said.

But former Defence Minister AK Antony and Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad wanted to know whether the government would be able to restore the April status quo on the border and if the Army could reach the patrolling points in the Galwan valley and Pangong Tso that have been reportedly blocked by the Chinese PLA.Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterChina doesn’t keep its wordUnki kathani aur karni alag hai (China’s actions are at variance with its words)…. This time the number of Chinese troops and friction points on the border are very different… yet we are committed to peace.On the demand whether India was striving for the restoration of status quo, Rajnath said the issue had been completely clarified in his statement. Rajnath went over much of the ground he had covered in the Lok Sabha earlier this week. During his statement, the Defence Minister also laid emphasis on resolving the complex issue through talks. He also said initially both sides were committed to reaching a common understanding on the LAC but China dropped the subject after 2003.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/none-can-stop-us-will-get-back-all-patrolling-points-rajnath-142790

He insisted and assured that the government was determined to cross the US in the testing rate as well soon.“In the country of 135 crore people, we are doing 11 lakh tests daily and are second to the US only. It has been possible only due to the united fight against the disease,” he added.On the issue of possible availability of vaccine against the virus, the minister said, “We too are making efforts like other countries. Under the PM’s guidance, an expert group is looking at it and we have advanced planning in place. We are hopeful that the vaccine will be available in India by beginning of 2021.”The minister, however, said, “The vaccine can’t be made magically available to the whole of the population at once and it will take time. Therefore, till that time masks and social distancing is the only effective vaccine we have to break the contact chain.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aim-to-bring-down-mortality-rate-below-1-says-vardhan-142792

Did spinning a 'charkha' lead to the British leaving? It was a symbol chosen by Gandhiji. They don't know the history.While participating in a debate on Covid-19 in the House, AAP's Sanjay Singh said, “I want to ask this government, tell me any one research in the world that shows Covid can be prevented by clamping utensils. The entire Opposition will not go home, but will clap with the Prime Minister and light ‘diyas’ in Parliament."Noting that the government has brought “such absurd and foolish schemes and expect the entire country to be fooled by you”, Singh used the occasion to hit at the government to look for opportunity in times of disaster and alleged corruption in the procurement of equipment to fight the disease, including thermometers and oxymetres.Countering the accusation BJP’s Sudhanshu Trivedi hit back, saying the PM’s move was symbolic and sought to unite the country socially just like Mahatma Gandhi chose the symbol of "charkha" for national cohesion during the freedom struggle.Trivedi said, “Many of our friends have a problem with lighting lamps (diyas) and clanging utensils. Did spinning a 'charkha' lead to the British leaving? It was a symbol chosen by Gandhiji. They don't know the history."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-aap-spar-over-covid-handling-142809
