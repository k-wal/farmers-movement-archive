19-07-2020||---||Acknowledge community transmission: IMA to Centre||New Delhi, July 19The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has urged the government to acknowledge community transmission of COVID-19 in India, with the district as a unit.The government has been saying that India was not witnessing community transmission and was only seeing local outbreaks amenable to containment.While India is set to begin the trials of its indigenous COVID-19 vaccine from this week, a top official from the IMA has claimed that a vaccine cure for the deadly COVID-19 upon its development and marketing would reach usable stage only after 2020.“A usable vaccine to cure COVID-19 and bringing the same to good use would go beyond 2020. Developing a vaccine for viral infections is a longer process as firstly, these infections have shorter immunity and secondly, viruses mutate faster, so this makes developers clueless as to which mutation is there in which part of the country,” said Dr V K Monga, IMA Board of Hospitals Chairman.Dr Monga further added that for developing a vaccine there are multiple stages and steps.“Developing a vaccine is not a political decision. It involves a lot of steps and procedures,” he said. Explaining the process, he said: “First, we isolate the virus then you develop an antidote to that, followed by animal testing and then on human volunteers. Secondly, you see the efficacy, toxicity and then its longevity as to how long it sustains.”“Since the viral infections have shorter immunity; a vaccine with a longer effect is to be seen, secondly, we have to see that it has no side effect and thirdly, viruses mutate faster and hence, it has to be seen that the vaccine is effective on most of the mutants as we don't know which mutated virus is present in which part of the country,” he said.Speaking about the rise in the recovery rate, Dr Monga said in this particular disease, approximately 80 per cent of the people are recovering on their own.“These patients will automatically recover. Home isolation is a good thing,” he said adding that people using masks and adhering to social-distancing norms was also increasing recovery.However, he clarified that plasma therapy, which was being seen as the only solution to COVID-19 in place of the absence of the vaccine, can’t minimise the need of a vaccine.“In the case of COVID-19, only vaccine or immunity can defeat the present disease,” he said.Regarding community spread of this virus, he added that community spread of COVID-19 had begun in India and the major causes of this were the migration of labourers and discontinuing of contact tracing of COVID-19 patients.“We have indeed moved into community transmission phase. The government may not acknowledge it but look around how the people are getting infected. There are elderly who have not stepped out of home since months yet they have contracted the infection. There are women who have only gone out to buy vegetables in a week and carried home the COVID-19 infection,” he said.“The authorities are unable to track and trace the contacts of each positive case. Also, it is believed that 80 per cent of the population is asymptomatic and have not tested themselves. A few days ago, Kerala government admitted about community transmission in a few districts despite the state having fewer cases in comparison to Delhi and Maharashtra,” he added.With 38,902 new cases reported in the past 24 hours, India’s total COVID-19 cases on Sunday reached 10,77,618. With 543 new deaths the death toll stood at 26,816, Health Ministry data said. Karnataka is the new hotspot state nearing 60,000 cases, as Maharashtra remained the worst-hit state, with 3,10,455 cases and 11,596 casualties. It crossed the 3-lakh mark on Saturday with Mumbai reporting over 1 lakh coronavirus cases so far.It is followed by Tamil Nadu with total 1,65,714 cases and 2,403 deaths. The national capital, on the other hand, is projecting an uplifting trend. For 17 of the last 20 days, including 11 in a row now, the number of people recovering from COVID-19 in Delhi has remained higher than newly detected infections — no other state has come close to such a trend. — With inputs from IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/acknowledge-community-transmission-ima-to-centre-115130
19-07-2020||Washington||If elected as US Prez, Biden will help India get permanent UNSC seat: Aide||Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, if elected to power in the November elections, will help shape international bodies like the United Nations so that India get a permanent seat on the Security Council, a former top American diplomat has said.India has been pushing for reforms of the United Nations, including the Security Council, stating that its composition doesn’t reflect the current realities and is not representative enough.The UNSC has 15 members, including five permanent members — the US, the UK, France, Russia and China. China is the only permanent member of the UNSC which is opposed to India’s inclusion into the powerful grouping. Half of the 10 non-permanent members are elected every year for a two-year term. India, along with Mexico and Ireland, has been recently elected a non-permanent member for a two-year term starting January 1, 2021.“There’s no question that under his (Biden) leadership, he would help shape international institutions like the UN to give India a (permanent) seat on the Security Council, he would fulfil its (India) status as a major defence partner,” former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma said on Saturday.“He (Biden) would work together with India to keep our citizens collectively safe. That means standing up against cross-border terrorism and standing with India when its neighbours attempt to change the status quo,” he added.Verma, an Indian-American who was US ambassador to India from 2014 to 2017, joined three other prominent Indian-Americans to make a strong pitch for the small but highly influential community to support and vote for Biden in the US presidential elections.The 77-year-old former US vice president is set to be formally nominated by the Democratic Party in August. He will challenge 74-year-old incumbent President Donald Trump, a Republican in the November 3 presidential elections.Verma, Biden Unity Task Force Economic Policy advisor Sonal Shah, former US surgeon general Vivek Murthy and Centre for American Progress Action Fund CEO Neera Tanden in their address to a virtual event argued that over the past several decades, Biden has a proven track record of being the best friend of Indians and Indian-Americans, be it as a Senator from Delaware or as a vice president under the Obama administration.“There’s no question president Biden would build a more inclusive, tolerant just and fair administration that would take US-India relations to new heights,” Verma said at the event—‘An Electorate Coming of Age: Indian Americans for Biden Community Town Hall’.He urged the Indian-American community to make Biden’s dream of making India and the US the two closet nations in the world a reality.“I can confidently say, there would have been no US India Civil Nuclear Deal but for Joe Biden,” Verma said.“In 2006, I remember the remarks he made where he said, ‘My dream is that in 2020, the two closest nations in the world will be India and the United States. If that occurs, the world will be safer.’ Think about that for a second. He made those remarks in 2006. And here we are, it’s 2020. Let’s make Joe Biden’s dream a reality. That only becomes a reality if he becomes president,” he said.In her address, Neera Tanden urged Indian-Americans to take steps every day over the next three-and-a-half months to ensure that Biden becomes the president.Sonal Shah said she will vote for Biden as she wants a country that is open to people like her, to her friends, to her colleagues and to everyone else.“We are not just immigrants, we are not just people sitting on the side, we are part of that American fabric and welcome us to help create that fabric because we’ve been lucky enough to be able to do that. But it took people like Joe Biden to allow us and help us participate and give us those chances. We’ve benefited from that. So now I vote because I believe he is the right person, and we can build that country together with him,” she said.According to Dr Murthy, Biden’s recognition and appreciation for immigrants and for communities like Indian-Americans is forming an incredibly important part of the backbone of the United States of America.“This is a moment for our country when leadership matters, when values matter. When we go to the voting booth, as we think about how to build support for the candidate that will best reflect our vision and our hopes and our dreams. Let’s lead with our values. Let’s vote for the person who understands us,” he said at the event organised jointly by the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) for Biden, the AAPI Victory Fund and South Asians for Biden. Later in a statement, Ajay Jain Bhutoria, who is on National Finance Committee for Biden, said, “Most Indian-Americans would say without hesitation that Biden would be a better president and world leader and better for India on all counts.”“The choice is clear for voting in November 2020. The choice is even clearer for Indo Americans and South Asians. Biden is the best answer for India and Indian-Americans. The Indian community sees him as one of ‘our’ leaders,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-elected-as-us-prez-biden-will-help-india-get-permanent-unsc-seat-aide-115126

19-07-2020||---||Industry shows willingness to join ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ slogan, shift dependence on China||New Delhi, July 19An industry survey has shown that several sectors are willing to join the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ slogan that envisages products imported from abroad are locally manufactured and exported.After the Prime Minister’s exhortation on June 11 to the industry to focus on indigenous production and the Galwan Valley clash on June 15, which soured trade ties with China, certain sectors such as automotive, textiles machinery and leather are looking at alternative sources of inputs and raw materials, reads a FICCI survey released on Sunday.Around half of the respondents from the automotive sector, which was the worst hit in the April-June quarter, indicated they are planning to “reduce dependence on one country”.Over a quarter of this sector’s imports, estimated at Rs 30,000 crore, come from China.The willingness to shift is likely to be higher once the government completes the exercise of curbing imports of 1,173 non-essential products from China such as toys, plastics, electronics and auto components for vehicle manufacturing. So far, two-thirds of respondents from electronics and electricals are unwilling to change their input sourcing strategies. Imports by this segment from China average Rs. 90,000 crore every year.But half of the respondents from the leather and textile sectors were preparing to change their raw material import strategy. These sectors were among the worst hit in the April-June quarter and immediate prospects of revival look bleak, said the survey. Footwear and leather imports are estimated at Rs 5,000 crore annually.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/industry-shows-willingness-to-join-atmanirbhar-bharat-slogan-shift-dependence-on-china-115119
19-07-2020||Bhubaneswar||Covid-19 spread may spike in monsoon, winter with fall in temperatures: IIT-AIIMS study||A study conducted jointly by researchers at IIT-Bhubaneswar and the AIIMS here has shown that the spread of COVID-19 may pick up pace during peak monsoon and winter with a fall in the mercury.The rainfall, decrease in temperatures and cooling of the atmosphere coupled with progression towards winter may environmentally favour the spread of COVID-19 in the country, according to the study led by V Vinoj, Assistant Professor of the School of Earth, Ocean and Climatic Sciences at IIT-Bhubaneswar.The report titled “COVID-19 spread in India and its dependence on temperature and relative humidity” took into account the pattern of the coronavirus outbreak and the number of such cases in 28 states between April and June.The study revealed that the rise in temperatures leads to a decline in the transmission of the virus, Vinoj said.“The study, which is in its pre-print stage, shows that the temperature and relative humidity have a significant impact on the disease growth rate and doubling time.“It suggests that a one-degree-Celsius rise in temperature leads to a 0.99 per cent decrease in cases and increases the doubling time by 1.13 days, implying a slowdown of the virus spread,” he told PTI.The study also found that an increase in relative humidity tends to decrease the growth rate and doubling time of coronavirus cases by 1.18 days.The researchers, however, said since the study was not conducted during the period of high humidity starting from the monsoon and the onset of winter, more research needs to be undertaken to establish its exact impact.Dr Bijayini Behera of the department of Microbiology at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, who was part of the research team, said several studies suggested that a fall in the temperatures and a relatively low humidity facilitated such an outbreak in the past.The study also carried out an analysis of the impact of solar radiation on the spread of COVID-19.“We found that a higher surface-reaching solar radiation leads to a reduction in the number of infections and an increase in the doubling time of cases, similar to that of temperatures,” Vinoj said.There is an average temperature difference of seven degrees Celsius between the winter and summer seasons, he added.According to the study, there is a likelihood of an increased transmission of the coronavirus during winter, which may be a major challenge for health workers and policymakers to enforce mitigation and control measures.The objective of the study is to help authorities bring effective measures to combat the pandemic, Vinoj said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-spread-may-spike-in-monsoon-winter-with-fall-in-temperatures-iit-aiims-study-115111

(Sena president) Uddhav Thackeray had visited Ayodhya before becoming chief minister and even after taking charge,” he said.The Sena, the NCP and the Congress are partners in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.Sawant said ensuring health of people and providing them safety are priorities of the Sena-led state government, which is the concept of ‘Ramrajya’ (a rule of justice and truth).“....We are doing precisely this in our (the state government’s) fight against coronavirus in Maharashtra,” he said.

Among these 560 varsities, 194 have already conducted examination and 366 are planning to conduct examination in online, offline, blended mode in August and September. In addition, 27 Private Universities were established during 2019-20 and their first batch is yet to become eligible for final examination,” Secretary, UGC, said today in a statement.After the UGC postponed the academic calendar allowing varsities to plan end of semester exams by September 30, 2020, the universities were required to chart out a plan for completion of final year examinations in offline (pen and paper); online or blended (online and offline) mode following the prescribed protocols and guidelines related to COVID19 pandemic.The UGC guidelines mentioned that in case a student of terminal semester is unable to appear in the examination conducted by the university, he or she may be given opportunity to appear in special examinations for such courses which may be conducted by the university as and when feasible.UGC communicated to the universities on July 8 the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Conduct of Examinations as suggested by HRD Ministry.The varsities have now responded to the UGC sharing their exam schedules.UGC today reiterated that exams are an integral part of the education system. “The performance in examinations contributes to merit, lifelong credibility, wider global acceptability for admissions, scholarships, awards, placements, and better future prospects. A large number of best universities across the world including US, UK, Canada, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and other countries, have conducted or are conducting examinations by giving various options,” said the UGC today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/755-of-945-universities-respond-to-ugcs-final-year-exam-deadline-115107
19-07-2020||Hyderabad||International kidney racket busted, MBA selling kidneys arrested||Telangana Police busted an international kidney racket that was spread across foreign shores as far as Sri Lanka and Turkey for a hefty amount by luring poor and unsuspecting people.The police said one person had been arrested and “it seemed that the racket had been operating since long”.The incident came to light when a family who had paid Rs 34 lakh for a kidney complained to the police.Police in Hyderabad arrested 25-year-old DS Pavan Srinivas, a native of Guntur in Andhra Pradesh and a resident of Hyderabad, who himself had donated a kidney and after realising the huge money potential, started arranging kidney donors.Joint Commissioner AR Srinivas said the accused, an MBA graduate, facilitated around nine kidney transplants. For each transplant, the accused used to earn a commission of around Rs 6 lakh.After a family paid Rs 34 lakh towards the cost of a kidney transplant surgery, accommodation, and payment to a kidney donor in Sri Lanka or Turkey, the accused failed to fulfil his promise.As a result, a complaint was lodged with the Banjara Hill police station that registered a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust against Pavan.The police said after collecting the money, the accused had cut off contacts with the family and was missing.Bijjala Bharathi had complained to Banjara Hills police station that they came in contact with Srinivas at a hospital in the city where her husband, a dialysis patient, was undergoing treatment.He promised them to provide donor and get the transplantation done through his known sources in Sri Lanka or Turkey for which he collected the money, police said in a statement.The police investigations revealed that the accused spent the amount lavishly in casino games in Sri Lanka and cheated the family by not arranging the donor and transplant.Copies of the passports, which were obtained from the complainant and other donors for travel to Turkey and Sri Lanka were also seized.Police further said the accused had donated his kidney a few years ago in Sri Lanka to tide over a financial situation and come in contact with some doctors there.To make easy money he came up with a plan to work as an agent to provide donors for needy patients. He ran campaigns on social media to lure gullible people willing to sell their kidneys for money and paid them very less after extracting the organ. He would collect anywhere between Rs 30 and 50 lakhs from rich patients for the surgery, Srinivas said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/international-kidney-racket-busted-mba-selling-kidneys-arrested-115105
19-07-2020||New Delhi||First set of private trains to be introduced by 2023: Indian Railways timeline||The first set of 12 private trains will be introduced in 2023, followed by 45 more in the next fiscal, according to an initial timeline drawn by the railways which plans to roll out all 151 such train services by 2027, officials said.In a formal kick-start to its plans to allow private entities to operate passenger trains on its network, the railways earlier this month invited proposals from companies to run 151 modern passenger trains on 109 pairs of routes across the country. The project would entail a private sector investment of about Rs 30,000 crore.As part of the plan for private trains, the railways has planned to introduce 12 trains in 2022-23, 45 in 2023-2024, 50 in 2025-26 and 44 more in the next fiscal, taking the total number of trains to 151 by the end of FY 2026-2027.The request for qualification (RFQ), which was floated on July 8, is likely to be finalised by November, the financial bids will be opened by March, 2021 and selection of bidders is planned by April 31, 2021, according to a timeline for introduction of private passenger trains prepared by the railways.Bidders quoting the highest share in gross revenue shall be awarded the project, officials said.“We have worked out a plan by which we hope to begin private train operations. Tenders will be finalised by March 2021 and trains will operate from March, 2023,” a senior official said.The railways has said 70 per cent of the private trains will be manufactured in India which will be designed for a maximum speed of 160 kmph.There would be a reduction in journey time by around 10-15 per cent at 130 kmph and around 30 per cent at 160 kmph. The running time taken by a train shall be comparable to or faster than the fastest train of Indian Railways operating in the respective route.The private player will pay the railways fixed haulage charges, energy charges as per actual consumption and a share in gross revenue determined through a transparent bidding process. The railways is expected to receive total haulage charges of around Rs 3,000 crore per annum from operation of these 151 trains, they said.These trains shall be operated by the driver and guard of Indian Railways.The operation and maintenance of these trains would be governed by standards and specifications and requirements specified by Indian Railways. The operation of the trains by the private entity shall conform to the key performance indicators like punctuality (95 per cent), reliability (not more than one failure for one lakh km of travel), upkeep of trains and other necessities.The railways also has pre-specified penalties which will be recovered from the private players for failure to meet the prescribed performance standards and outcomes. Similarly, penalties will be pre-specified in the Concession Agreement for the failure on the part of the railways, officials said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-set-of-private-trains-to-be-introduced-by-2023-indian-railways-timeline-115103

My congratulations to you all on behalf of all of us,” Singh told one of the senior members of the regiment when Commander of 14 Corps Lt Gen Harinder Singh introduced the soldier to the defence minister.Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Yogesh Kumar Joshi and several other senior Army officials present on the occasion.Chinese and Indian troops clashed in Galwan Valley for several hours on the night of June 15 in their fiercest brawl in last five decades that left 20 Indian Army personnel, including a Colonel, dead.The incident significantly escalated the border tension, with India calling it “a premeditated and planned action by China”.The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs in carrying out brutal attacks on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China around patrolling point 14 in Galwan Valley.China has not disclosed the number of casualties its troops suffered. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.Last month, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane awarded ‘Commendation Cards’ to five soldiers for their bravery in dealing with Chinese troops during the Galwan Valley clash as well as another violent incident in Pangong Tso.The defence minister’s office on Sunday released a brief video of Singh’s interaction with the soldiers in Lukung.In his address to the soldiers in the forward post located at an altitude of 14,000 feet, the defence minister said the Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley clash not only showed exemplary courage in safeguarding the border but also protected the pride of 130 crore Indians.“I want to say that the country will never forget them. You inspire the whole nation. You are our real strength,” he said, asserting that India will not cede an inch of its territory.It was Singh’s first visit to Ladakh after the bitter border face-off between India and China began in multiple locations following a violent clash between the two sides on May 5 in the Pangong lake area.Following a series of diplomatic and military talks, the Indian and Chinese armies began a mutual disengagement process at most of the friction points from July 6.

19-07-2020||New Delhi||NCB arrests 12, seizes 1,655 kg of cannabis in Bihar, Jharkhand||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) said on Sunday it has arrested twelve people with over 1,655 kg of cannabis in Bihar and Jharkhand, as the agency could bust two ganja trafficking networks, which worked on a pan India basis.The officials in the anti-drug agency said, based on the intelligence input NCB personnel seized contrabands from trucks plying with national permit and a few other vehicles, and in one instance, cannabis was concealed inside peanut bags.Giving details of the seizure and arrest operations a senior NCB official said, “As the actionable intelligence was available, the officials of the Patna zonal unit seized the cache on July 15-16 in the two states.” It was informed that a large quantity of ganja (cannabis) being transported from the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border to Bihar and Jharkhand, he added.“With these operations we could manage to bust two ganja trafficking networks working on a pan-India basis,” the official said, adding that a total of 1,655 kg of cannabis was seized the NCB in Bihar and Jharkhand last week and 12 people were arrested.The busting of this drug network, operating out of Odisha, will prove to be a major achievement in combating the menace of cannabis smuggling in not only this region but will be a blow to such syndicates operating in other parts of the country, the official said.The officials in the NCB said, their investigation into these cases of cannabis seizures has revealed a similarity between what is happening in Jammu & Kashmir and in Naxal-affected areas of Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. “In Kashmir terrorists are using drug money to fund their activities, here in these areas the proceeds of cannabis trade are possibly going into anti-state activities by the Left extremist groups,” said another official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncb-arrests-12-seizes-1-655-kg-of-cannabis-in-bihar-jharkhand-115099
19-07-2020||Lucknow||Very few buyers and sellers in animal markets ahead of Bakrid||The animal markets, which are usually bustling with activity ahead of Bakrid, are desolate this year.The COVID-19 pandemic has shorn all festivals of public celebrations, and people are apprehensive that the tradition of animal sacrifice may be affected due to social distancing norms.Also there is a massive drop in demand for sacrificial animals due to the financial impact of the crisis.Chairman of All India Jamiat-ul-Quresh Sirajuddin Qureshi urged the government to come out with guidelines for carrying out the celebrations in the traditional way.The festival will fall on July 31 or August 1. Buyers and sellers start thronging the animal markets almost two weeks ahead of the festival. But this year only a negligible number of buyers have turned up in animal markets in old Lucknow areas including Nakkhas, according to traders.“It is very difficult to say as to what the government is thinking. ‘Qurbani’ is a matter of faith for the Muslims. We appeal to the government to deliberate and find a solution. This is a national problem, and our office bearers are speaking to different state governments,” Qureshi said.In the absence of guidelines, not many madrassas are buying animals for sacrifice, he said.“The madrasas where collective ‘qurbani’ is done, are also not coming forward. In Bakrid, along with goats, buffaloes are also sacrificed. The government should ensure that people who are transporting the animals are not harassed by the police,” Qureshi said.Prominent Muslim cleric Khalid Rasheed Farang Mahali said he had raised the issue with the Uttar Pradesh chief minister.“I have recently met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath requesting him to issue guidelines for Bakrid. I am hopeful that the guidelines will be soon released,” he said.Rahat Ali, a goat trader from Rajasthan said, thousands of people will be affected due to the reduced demand for animals.“The animal trade works in a chain involving farmers who rear animals, small traders and big traders.“The traders buy the animals from the farmers. These are then sent to various states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In the absence of demand, I did not purchase animals this year,” he said.Sajid, who supplies goats to various districts in western Uttar Pradesh, said the lockdown has affected the livelihood of people and not many have the money to buy animals for sacrifice.                           “The lockdown has drained the people of their money. As a result, the animals are not getting sold,” he said.The Maharashtra Government has come out with guidelines for Eid al-Adha, also known as Bakrid or Id-ul-Zuha, noting that there is a ban in place on all religious programmes and people should offer “namaz” in their homes and not in mosques.It also said sacrificial animals should be bought online or over the phone as markets dealing with them will be closed, adding that “qurbani” should preferably be symbolic.There will be no relaxation in restrictions for Eid in containment zones, and people are directed not to congregate in public places on the day of the festival, it added.

19-07-2020|| Jaipur||We’ll be kingmakers, says BTP as Rajasthan crisis unfolds||As the Ashok Gehlot government struggles to retain power in Rajasthan, the Bhartiya Tribal Party says it is now in a position to punch way above its weight despite its minuscule presence in the state assembly.“We have two MLAs in a House of 200, yet we are in the position of kingmakers,” party president Maheshbhai C Vasava told PTI on Sunday.At a joint press conference with the Congress on Saturday, BTP legislators Rajkumar Roat and Ramprasad Dindor made it clear that they are with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.This ended days of uncertainty over where the Gujarat-based party’s loyalties lie.The two MLAs supported the ruling Congress in the state in last month’s Rajya Sabha polls. But when the power tussle between Gehlot and his now sacked deputy Sachin Pilot re-surfaced recently, the BTP said it will remain neutral.Vasava said the party is now extending support to Gehlot after an assurance that its demands related to the development of tribal areas will be met.“We have fought against the Congress and the BJP on tribal issues but if the government now assures full support on the issues raised by us, why shouldn’t we support it? After all it is fulfilling the agenda of tribal welfare and development,” he said.When the crisis began last week, Vasava issued a whip directing both Roat and Dindor not to support any leader or party in case there is a floor test in the assembly.However, Sagwara MLA Ramprasad Dindor expressed defiance of the whip, saying both of them will support the state government.Later, party office-bearers and the MLAs held discussions with the chief minister on their demands.“We had supported the Congress government in the Rajya Sabha elections last month after an assurance by the chief minister on our demands,” Chorasi MLA Roat said.“But the demands were not fulfilled. Some of them could have been met in just one day,” he complained.The party then thought of not extending support to him, the MLA said.Last week, Roat appeared in two video clips, alleging that he was being stopped by Rajasthan police from travelling to his constituency in Dungarpur district.He claimed that police personnel had come in two vans and taken away his car keys. He also alleged that some people were forcing him to come with them.The videos were circulated by the Sachin Pilot camp and the BJP had questioned the state government over them.But Roat later dismissed the episode as a “misunderstanding” with police. He said the party’s agenda is development of tribal areas and they have raised 17 demands before the CM.Some of the demands are related to reservation in jobs and the utilisation of funds for tribal areas.The BTP came into being in 2017 in Gujarat, and expanded into Rajasthan the next year.In the December 2018 assembly elections, it fielded 11 candidates in the tribal belt in southern Rajasthan. Roat was 26 when he won and most other candidates too were young.“The youth are our power. Today’s youth is educated, understands issues and understands how the tribal people were deprived of their rights. We fielded many young candidates and the party’s performance was very good,” BTP state president Velaram Ghoghra said.The crisis in Rajasthan Congress has been brewing since the party picked Gehlot over Pilot for the chief minister’s post. Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister and the party’s state unit president when he and 18 other MLAs stayed away from two Congress Legislature Party meetings.The rebel MLAs were served notices by Speaker C P Joshi after the Congress sought their disqualification from the assembly. The Rajasthan High Court will on Monday resume hearing their petition challenging the notices.Including the dissidents, the Congress has 107 MLAs in the 200-member assembly and the BJP 72.If the 19 Congress dissidents are disqualified, the current strength of the state assembly will reduce to 181, slashing the half-way mark to 91 and making it easier for Gehlot to retain majority support.In the past, the ruling party has claimed the support of 13 independents, two MLAs each from the CPM and the BTP), and one from the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/well-be-kingmakers-says-btp-as-rajasthan-crisis-unfolds-115085
19-07-2020||Jaipur||Brief Rajasthan Assembly session may be held this week: Congress sources||A day after Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot met Governor Kalraj Mishra, Congress sources on Sunday said a brief session of the state assembly may be called this week.“The government has all options open, including a brief assembly session,” they said amid a political crisis caused by party leader Sachin Pilot’s rebellion against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.Meanwhile, Congress leader Ajay Maken said in a press conference: “The decision on when and how the floor test will happen, it has to be taken by the chief minister and the government. It is the CM’s discretion to move forward when required and if it is required”.Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had met Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Saturday and the meeting lasted for 45 minutes.However, a Raj Bhawan spokesperson said the CM briefed the governor about the efforts being made to protect the state from the coronavirus pandemic.On the other hand, party sources said the chances of calling a brief assembly session are there but nothing has been finalised yet.The party claims the Ashok Gehlot government has the numbers to prove majority in case there is a floor test.In the 200-member state assembly, the Congress has 107 MLAs, including former deputy chief minister Sachin pilots and 18 MLA loyal to him, who have rebelled against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.Rajasthan Speaker C P Joshi had earlier sent disqualification notices to the rebel MLAs after which they moved the state High Court. The next hearing in the matter will be held on Monday.The RLD, which has one MLA, is a Congress ally while the ruling party has the support of 10 of 13 Independent MLAs.The Bhartiya Tribal Party, which has two MLAs, has officially announced its support to the Ashok Gehlot government on Saturday. The state government considers both CPI (M) MLAs on its side. However, the CPI (M) says their stand is clear that they have to defeat the BJP but any decision regarding support to the state government will be taken by the party leadership in case a floor test is conducted.

19-07-2020||Jaipur||Rajstahan crisis: Congress demands Union Minister Shekhawat’s resignation for ‘involvement’ in conspiracy||The Congress on Sunday demanded the resignation of Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan.Citing the two audio clips, in one of which Shekhawat is allegedly heard during a conversation on a plot to bring down the state government, Congress leader Ajay Maken said the BJP leader should quit on moral grounds.He said the Anti-Corruption Bureau of the state police has registered a case in connection with the audio tapes against Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma, Shekhawat and one Sanjay Jain.“If Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is claiming that it is not his voice and the reference in the audio clip is of some other Gajendra Singh, then why is he afraid of giving his voice samples,” Maken asked.He said Shekhawat had no moral authority to continue as a Union Minister and should resign so that the investigation was not influenced.Maken also alleged that the police in Haryana and Delhi were giving protection to the rebel Congress MLAs from Rajasthan.He said the Centre was threatening in the name of the CBI because it wanted to stop the probe into the conspiracy.The former Union minister also asked why a team of the Rajasthan Police was “stopped by Haryana Police” to carry out its investigation and take voice samples of MLAs Bhanwarlal Sharma and Vishvendra Singh.If the BJP had no role in it, then why the MLAs took shelter in the party-ruled Haryana, he asked in an apparent reference to the 19 Congress MLAs’ stay at a hotel in Gurgaon.On charges of horse-trading, Maken asked the BJP to “reveal the route of black money” as it is being said that Rs 30-35 crore were offered to each MLA.Maken, who has come to Jaipur as a Congress observer, said it is the betrayal of people’s mandate and the murder of democracy if an elected government is toppled with money power.If such attempts were not stopped, then people would lose faith over the voting process and democracy, he added.

19-07-2020||New Delhi||Parliamentary panels have started scrutinising handling of COVID-19 in India: Venkaiah Naidu||Parliamentary panels have started scrutinising the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country a little over three months after Parliament was adjourned ahead of its schedule due to the virus and a shorter timeframe to hold the standing committee meetings would not have been possible given the present situation, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said on Sunday.In a Facebook post hailing the media’s role during the pandemic, the vice-president also said Parliament is “on course” holding the Monsoon session.The Rajya Sabha chairman said he has held several rounds of discussions with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on enabling the meetings of the parliamentary committees and the Monsoon session of Parliament.“Given the corona-induced social distancing norm, the logistics of seating of MPs required detailed deliberation and planning. The government also recently reached out to both the presiding officers (Naidu and Birla) on holding the Monsoon session.“We are on course,” Naidu said.With the easing of restrictions on domestic air travel in May and to a lesser degree on rail travel, the department-related standing committees of both Houses of Parliament have resumed their meetings this month, he pointed out.They have undertaken an examination of various aspects of the management of the pandemic and its fallout, Naidu said.“This, in effect, means the required parliamentary scrutiny of the handling of the pandemic started in about three and half months of the last sitting of the apex legislature of the country. Any other shorter timeframe may have not been possible given the situation prevailing in the country,” he asserted.Some members of Parliament had suggested holding the standing committee meetings online due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown.But the committees met physically.At least four parliamentary panels have met in the last few days and the ones relating to home affairs and science and technology have discussed various aspects of the pandemic.Naidu pointed out that the Budget session had to be cut short a few days ahead of the schedule as the MPs wanted to be with the people in this hour of crisis.Both Houses were adjourned sine die on March 23. According to the provisions of the Constitution, Parliament has to meet within six months of the last sitting. Normally, the Monsoon session starts in July with some exceptions over the years.“This year, we are living in abnormal times due to the pandemic. The central and state governments are engrossed in handling the pandemic for the last over four months on a day-to-day basis,” Naidu pointed out.Referring to journalists, he said the media, as the fourth pillar of democracy, is often said to be the bridge between parliamentary institutions and people by enabling a two-way communication.“This role has assumed even more significance during the time of the pandemic,” the vice president said.

19-07-2020||Bhopal||Rajasthan crisis: Pilot shouldn’t go Scindia way, says Digvijaya Singh||Blaming the BJP for the political drama in Rajasthan, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Sunday asked Sachin Pilot not to leave the grand old party.In an interview to PTI, the former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister said Pilot should not follow Jyotiraditya Scindia into the BJP, as he has bright future in Congress.His remarks follow Pilot’s open rebellion against the Ashok Gehlot government, which has been on shaky ground with at least 18 legislators backing the rebel leader.Pilot was sacked as Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister and the state Congress chief recently and the Congress has accused the BJP of making efforts to topple the Gehlot-led government by indulging in horse-trading.“The BJP is behind the crisis in Rajasthan,” Singh said.The Congress veteran said he tried to call Pilot, but his calls and text messages went unanswered.“Age is on your side. Ashok (Gehlot) may have offended you, but all such issues are best resolved amicably. Don’t make the mistake that Scindia made. BJP is unreliable. Nobody who joined it from any other party has succeeded there,” Singh said.He said this is the first time that Pilot hasn’t responded to him.“Sachin is like my son. He respects me and I also like him. I called him three-four times and also texted him. He didn’t revert. He used to respond immediately earlier,” he said.“It is good to be ambitious. How can one move forward without having ambitions? But along with ambition, one must also have commitment to your organisation, ideology and the nation,” Singh said.“I heard that he (Pilot) may form a new party. But what is the need for it. Has the Congress not given him anything?He was made an MP at 26, a Union Minister at 32, the state Congress president at 34 and Deputy Chief Minister at 38.“What else does he want? Time is on his side,” Singh said.If Pilot had any issue, then as the state party unit president, he should have called a meeting and discussed the matter, he said. Pilot could have involved Congress national general secretary and Rajasthan in-charge Avinash Pande in talks with Gehlot to resolve differences, he added.“If you have faith in your legislators, why have you confined 18-19 of them in ITC Grand hotel at Manesar in Haryana,” Singh said.This is the same hotel where the BJP kept MLAs from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh (during political dramas in those states), he said.Pilot should forget whatever has happened, come back and sit across the table to discuss how the Congress could be strengthened, he said.

19-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID crisis: Survey says 55.1% households had only two meals a day||About 55 per cent of households in 24 states and two union territories managed only two meals a day during the period from April 1 to May 15, indicating affordability challenges amid the COVID crisis, according to a survey of 5,568 families.The ‘Unmasking the Impact of COVID-19 on Asia’s Most Vulnerable Children’ early recovery assessment report released by child-rights NGO World Vision Asia Pacific, found that resulting economic, psychosocial, and physical strain on Indian families has negatively affected all aspects of child well-being including access to food, nutrition, healthcare, essential medicines, hygiene and sanitation facilities, as well as child protection and safety.The report based on data gathered from 5,668 households across 119 districts from 24 states and 2 union territories (Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir) during the period of April 1 to May 15 highlighted that the livelihoods of more than 60 per cent of parents or caregivers were fully or severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.Daily workers, who are the largest segment in the survey, are the hardest hit and the loss of livelihoods that has resulted from government lockdown measures has become the top-most concern for the rural and urban poor, the survey found.“About 67 per cent of urban parents/caregivers have reported loss of jobs or income reduction in the previous weeks,” it said.The results of the report revealed that 55.1 per cent of the interviewed households could get only two meals a day, which indicated limited access to basic food supplies due to affordability challenges, the report said.The study found that only 56 per cent of respondents always had access to hygiene items, and 40 per cent had access only sometimes.“Access to adequate water and sanitation remains a challenge, which increases the risk of malnutrition and the spread of the diseases, including COVID-19.“The stress on families related to loss of income, lack of school, change of children’s behaviour and quarantine measures contributes to children experiencing physical punishment and emotional abuse,” the report said.The report also indicated that 40 per cent of children are stressed out due to the current situation.“Women and children are usually the worst affected in any disaster. The COVID-19 crisis is proving to be no different. It is causing cascading damage to poor and vulnerable children — through stretched health services, inadequate medical supplies, higher risk of violence & exploitation, minimal access to education and lower intake of nutritious food stemming from the severe drop in income levels in families,” said Cherian Thomas, Regional Leader, World Vision International, South Asia and Pacific region.The report which also covered other Asian countries of Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka gave short and long term recommendations for helping the impacted communities.In the short-term (through end of 2020), the report recommended scaling-up of social protection interventions for nutritious food, cash, and voucher assistance that are child-sensitive, gender-responsive which provide a pathway to broader social protection, optimising the targeting of beneficiaries in government social assistance schemes and increasing investment in public works programmes among others.In the medium to long-term (2021-2022), the report recommended increasing government resources for these social assistance interventions, leveraging multi-sectoral responses to promote child well-being, invest in rebuilding of livelihood interventions that promote inclusion of vulnerable populations and women’s economic empowerment among others. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-crisis-survey-says-55-1-households-had-only-two-meals-a-day-115048

19-07-2020||New Delhi||India to store crude oil in US||India plans to store its crude oil in US strategic petroleum reserves for use not just during emergencies but also for trading to capture any price advantage, officials said.India and the US on July 17 signed a preliminary agreement for cooperating on emergency crude oil reserves, including the possibility of India storing oil in the US emergency stockpile.“It is a good concept but comes with a lot of riders,” a senior government official said.For one, India will have to pay a rental for hiring the storages in the US. This rental will be on top of the international price for oil.“The alternative is to build our own strategic reserves which will involve huge capital cost and will take a few years to construct. So the rental is a small fee to pay to get immediate access to a strategic reserve,” the official said.Strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) in the US are built and maintained by private companies.The oil stored in the US reserves can be used for the nation’s own needs or can be traded to capture price advantage, he said adding these two scenarios work when oil prices rise after India has bought and stored oil in US reserves.“But if the prices fall, you will book losses,” he said.Also, if the sea route is obstructed, having a stockpile in the US will make no difference to India’s energy security as the country will not be able to access them, he said. “It takes a month to ship oil from the US.”           Storing oil in the US is a kind of physical hedging and all hedging comes with a cost, he said.More importantly, storing large volumes involves paying upfront on purchase of crude oil and companies will have to block so much capital.India had begun exploring the possibility of storing oil in the US a few months back but couldn’t make much headway as COVID-19 pummelled demand, leading to excess oil around the globe that filled every inch of storage including those on ships.Demand is returned but is less than pre-Covid levels.          In such a scenario, storing oil in the US would make a lot of sense if India were to hire a strategic facility maintained by an American oil producer.“The commercial deal can be structured in such a way that we support the US firm to keep producing even when demand falls, and in return get access to its storage,” the official said.On July 17, India and US signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that will allow the US to begin sharing with India the knowhow on establishment of a strategic petroleum reserve (SPR). The pact also allows India to explore the possibility of storing its oil in US SPR, comprising underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana.US President Donald Trump in March ordered filling the SPR to its full capacity of about 714 million barrels but Congress failed to fund a purchase.Speaking to reporters after signing of the MoU, US Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette had stated that the India pact could mirror a recent plan with Australia, which in April committed to spending about USD 60 million to build an emergency oil stockpile, first by buying crude to store in the US SPR.Global oil prices fell steeply earlier this year as shutdowns from the novel coronavirus sapped demand, but have stabilised at around USD 43 a barrel.“We are in an advanced stage of discussions for storing crude oil US strategic petroleum reserves to increase India’s strategic oil stockpile,” Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said on Friday after co-chairing the second India-US Strategic Energy Partnership Ministerial with Brouillette.The US has 714 million barrels of oil storage capacity in its strategic petroleum reserve, the world’s largest supply of emergency crude oil.In comparison, India stores 5.33 million tonnes (about 38 million barrels) of crude oil in underground storages at three locations on the east and west coast, hardly enough to meet its 9.5 days needs.The International Energy Agency (IEA) prescribes its members to have at least 90 days of stock in the strategic reserves.India has been looking to expand the storage capacity by another 6.5 million tonnes and is also exploring the possibility of hiring storage in the US to stock some oil that can be used in times of extreme price volatility or supply disruption.India is the fourth-largest export destination for US crude.  “Between 2017 and last year, US crude oil exports to India rose by nearly 10-folds to almost 2,50,000 barrels per day. Between March 2016 and May of this year, 68 LNG shipments of over 234 billion cubic feet were exported to India,” Brouillette had said on Friday.The US is India’s sixth-largest oil supplier.India began importing crude oil from the US in 2017 as it looked to diversify its import basket beyond the OPEC nations. It bought 1.9 million tonnes (38,000 bpd) of crude oil from the US in 2017-18 and another 6.2 million tonnes (1,24,000 bpd) in 2018-19.The volume that Brouillette talked about translates into 12.5 million tonnes of oil imports in a year.India, which is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs, bought 101.4 million tonnes of crude oil from overseas during April 2019 to March 2020. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-store-crude-oil-in-us-115043

We are conducting an investigation in the case," he added.On Thursday, sharing a screenshot of a hate message she received on Instagram, Chakraborty said while she had ignored many abusive texts sent to her in the past month, the harassment was now unbearable.The 28-year-old actor eventually disabled the comments section of her Instagram page.Chakraborty, known for films such as "Mere Dad Ki Maruti" and "Jalebi", had tagged the cyber cell and requested the authorities to look into the threats.On June 18, she was called to the Bandra police station to record her statement in connection with Rajput's death.

The social media company has several times disabled or commented on tweets by the president because of what it said were copyright complaints or violations of a policy against threatening violence.Twitter removed an image the president tweeted on June 30, which included a picture of Trump, because of a complaint from the New York Times, whose photographer had shot the image.The company also put a tweet from the president behind a warning label in late May, saying that he had violated its rules against “glorifying violence” when he advocated that Minneapolis authorities be tough in responding to protests over the death of George Floyd.— Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-disables-trump-tweet-over-copyright-complaint-115027

19-07-2020||---||Delhi riots report points finger at Amit Shah, says violence organised||New Delhi, July 18The Delhi Minorities Commission has named senior BJP leaders in its fact-finding report for their role in the riots that broke out in northeast Delhi in February. It has also slammed the Delhi Police for their “failure to protect life and property” during the riots.The 130-page report released by Zafrul Islam Khan, Chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, and submitted to the Delhi Government is highly critical of the role of BJP leaders and the police in the riots. While the Delhi Police and the BJP have trashed the report, sources in the Delhi Government said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal “may consider some of the recommendations of the panel”.The report by the nine-member committee, chaired by Supreme Court advocate MR Shamshad and comprising Haseena Hashia, Tehmina Arora, Gurminder Singh Matharu, Saleem Baig, Aditi Dutta, Tanvir Kazi, Abu Bakr Sabbaq and Devika Prasad, states that “even after the violence, bias continued against Muslims in the registration of FIRs and investigation of cases”.Along with the allegations of “inaction” by the police during and after riots, the report also points a finger at senior BJP leaders Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath for “inciting” people through speeches during the Delhi Assembly elections. “…there were a number of speeches by Delhi BJP leaders inciting people against anti-CAA protesters,” it states.Under subhead "Initiation of the violence", the committee specifically names BJP leader Kapil Mishra. “Violence started in different pockets almost immediately after Mishra's speech on February 23, in which he called for forcefully removing anti-CAA protesters at Jafrabad in northeast Delhi,” it said.“He (Mishra) clearly said his supporters and him would take matters in their own hands, alluding to extra-legal vigilante tactics,” the report said, also stating that Ved Prakash Surya, Deputy Commissioner of Police, north-east stood next to Mishra during the speech. “Multiple testimonies collected by the committee recount reports of police inaction even as the violence unfolded and how the police did not respond to people despite repeated calls,” the panel report states. Testimonies of affected people revealed that violence was not spontaneous, but was “planned, organised and targeted”.How events unfoldedFebruary 22 a group, largely comprising women, were staging a peaceful protest against the CAA under the Jaffrabad Metro station.February 23 a rally was taken out in nearby Maujpur, where Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra demanded that anti-CAA protesters in Chand Bagh and Jaffrabad be removed within three days. Soon after, stone pelting began in the area, and, by the evening, groups opposing and supporting the CAA were squaring off. There was heavy police deployment.February 24 violence erupted in Maujpur, with large-scale stone throwing, and members of two communities blaming each other for the wave of unrest.February 25 the situation spiralled out of control. The violence had spread to an even wider area on either side of the Jaffrabad main road.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-report-points-finger-at-amit-shah-says-violence-organised-114938

It said out of the 755 universities which sent their response to it, 194 universities said they had conducted their examinations while 366 said that they would hold examinations in August/September.But Yuva Sena demanded all states be given the right to take appropriate decisions based on the situation prevailing in their respective areas.The Maharashtra Government has already cancelled the final year/final semester examinations for professional and non-professional courses.“The number of Covid cases has been steadily on the rise and there has been no flattening of the virus curve. Many states and cities have been placed under lockdown again,” a party spokesperson said in Mumbai.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aditya-thackeray-moves-sc-against-ugc-decision-on-exam-114939
19-07-2020||Satya Prakash||65 years on, apex court decides dispute over will||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 18The Supreme Court has decided a case that started in 1955 in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, over a will and went on for 65 years at various levels of the hierarchy of courts. A Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul dismissed appeals challenging a 2007 judgment of the Madras High Court with regard to a family dispute that revolved around a will but actually related to a partition in the Naidu family in 1932.To understand the case, it’s important to know the family tree of the Naidus. One R Venkitusamy Naidu had two sons— Lakshmiah and Rangaswami. Rangaswami was married to R Krishnammal and they were childless. ButLakshmiah had four sons—Bakthavatsalam, Venkatapathy, Jagannathan and Ramaswamy. After Rangaswami’s death, a ‘possession’ dispute started in 1955. Rangaswami’s widow and nephew on side and Lakshmiah and his sons on the other started a legal fight. The wife claimed Rangaswami died after executing a ‘will’. But a magistrate decided in favour of Lakshmiah, but didn’t discuss the ‘will’.A suit filed in 1958 by Rangaswami’s widow ended in a compromise decree. Two other family members in 1963 filed a suit which resulted in another compromise decree. After Ramaswamy and Krishnammal died in 1976 and 1977, a suit was again filed for partition by A Alagiriswami and partition was ordered by the sub-judge in Coimbatore.The legal heirs of Lakshmiah questioned the will on the ground that it was obtained by coercion. Their suit was decreed but the first appellate court reversed the findings. Both courts held there was no proof of 1932 partition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/65-years-on-apex-court-decides-dispute-over-will-114940

But now we have asked the academy to work out an advance course, so that our troopers deployed at LAC become proficient both in speaking and writing,” said a senior official, adding that the aim is to make the entire force with a strength of 90,000 to learn the language as per their requirement.  “Earlier, the Chinese language programme was there, but now the course is being developed in a more planned manner. Every officer and jawan has to complete the course, which will include basic learning and refresher courses,” said the official.Even the Army personnel will be taught Chinese language at the ITBP facility in Mussoorie, where the work is in progress to revamp the curriculum, as the focus would be more on audio and video sessions, the officials said.Currently on the borders, ITBP jawans use a very few Chinese expressions like “Ni Hao”, which means “Namaskar” and “Hui Ku”, which means “Go back”, but soon the troopers will be using banners written in Mandarin and will be able to better communicate with their counterparts on the other side of the border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-mandarin-must-for-troops-itbp-instructed-114737
