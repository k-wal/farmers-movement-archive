15-12-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 can either be a mild disease or one with complications: Govt||Amid reports of deadly fungal infection in recovering coronavirus patients leading to loss of eyesight, the Centre on Tuesday said COVID-19 can either be a mild disease without any symptom or a serious one with complications like these which have not occurred before.ENT surgeons at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) here had reported that they had seen 13 cases of “COVID-19-triggered mucormycosis” in the last 15 days.This alarming affliction, although rare, is not new. What is new is COVID-19 triggering mucormycosis, they said on Monday.Black fungus or mucormycosis has been a cause of disease and death of patients in transplants, and ICU and immunodeficient individuals since long. However, it is the rapid increase in the numbers seen in unsuspected recovering COVID-19 patients that is causing the grave concern, the SGRH said in a statement on Monday.“In the last 15 days, ENT surgeons have seen 13 cases of COVID-19-triggered mucormycosis in over 50 per cent patients, with loss of eyesight, and removal of nose and jaw bone needed,” it said.When asked to comment about the development, V K Paul, NITI Aayog member (Health) said at a press briefing here, “Yes, we are aware (of this). This is a fungal disease. In diabetics particularly, even before COVID-19, this has been there. This is quite a devastating disease. There is a deep infection. The cure for this is not easy.“As there is an all-round systemic spread in COVID-19, there is a depression in functioning of organs, so as we get more information about COVID-19, some things have come to the fore... This is a new information that has come to the fore. We have to be careful,” he said.“While COVID-19 can be a mild disease by itself, it can be without any symptom or even be a serious disease with serious complications like this which have not occurred before,” the official added.The SGRH authorities had said mortality is currently being seen in the range of 50 per cent (five patients), with certain deaths when there is involvement of brain.Doctors had to do these resections in about 10 patients over the last fortnight, with “about 50 per cent losing their eyesight permanently”. Five of these patients required critical care support due to associated complications. There also have been five mortalities so far in this subgroup, they said.According to Manish Munjal, senior ENT surgeon, at the hospital, “The frequency with which we are witnessing the occurrence of COVID-19-triggered mucormycosis with high morbidity and mortality has never been seen before and is shocking and alarming.” Varun Rai, consultant ENT surgeon at SGRH said, “Early clinical suspicion on symptoms such as nose obstruction, swelling in the eye or cheeks, and black dry crusts in the nose should immediately prompt the conduct of a biopsy in the OPD and start of the antifungal therapy as early as possible.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-can-either-be-a-mild-disease-or-one-with-complications-govt-184778
15-12-2020||Jalpaiguri (WB)||BJP spending crores to bring in AIMIM to split Muslim votes: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday slammed the BJP for trying to import Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM in Bengal to sharpen the communal polarisation and divide the Hindu-Muslim votes among themselves.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) after its good show in the Bihar Assembly polls has announced to contest in next year's Bengal polls.In the recently concluded Bihar elections, the AIMIM won five seats in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region on the border of West Bengal."To divide the Muslim votes, the BJP is spending crores of rupees to bring in a party from Hyderabad. The plan is that BJP will eat into Hindu votes, and this Hyderabad party will eat into Muslim votes."In recent Bihar elections, they did the same thing. This party is a B-team of the BJP," Banerjee said while addressing a rally here.The political parties in West Bengal are apprehensive that political equations in the communally polarised state is set to witness significant changes as the sway of non-BJP parties over minorities, a key factor in several seats, appears to be set for a stiff challenge with AIMIM announcing that it will enter the poll fray in Bengal.A deciding factor in nearly 100-110 seats in the state, the 30 per cent Muslim population, till 2019, have acted as a bulwark of the TMC against its rivals, with most of them voting in favour of the party, considering it to be a "credible" force that can resist the saffron surge.A section of the TMC leadership is apprehensive that with the entry of AIMIM, equations are likely to alter.Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are due in April-May next year.

She died on December 29, 2012, at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.Four of the six men were convicted and hanged on March 20 this year. One of them, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail days after the trial began in the case and another, a juvenile, was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.Nirbhaya’s father, who joined an online petition which was started by NGOs Save the Children and Yuva to mark the eighth anniversary of the gruesome gangrape case, said that “the fight is not over yet”.“You have probably never heard from me. Today, I felt it was necessary for you to hear my voice. My name is Badrinath Singh. But since the night of 16th December, 2012, I am known as ‘Nirbhaya’s father’. This is how I will be known for the rest of my life,” he said in a statement.Eight years ago when, “my daughter was snatched away from us in the most brutal way, crowds led by women came out on the streets” and they made “my family’s fight their fight for justice”, he said.“I thought this case would change us as a country for good. But when I turn on the news, there is a new case of another daughter being brutally assaulted every day. Nothing has changed,” Nirbhaya’s father said.While laws and systems help, a permanent change will only come when people’s collective mindset changes, he said, adding that men must stop being mute spectators while women face abuse online and on the ground.“Therefore, I invite every boy and man to become an ally, an active supporter in the fight for women’s safety,” he said.“If you see a woman being trolled and threatened with rape on social media, speak up and report it. If you notice this happening in your surroundings, stand up with her,” he said.Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) were executed at 5.30 am on March 20 for the savage assault on the 23-year-old woman who came to be known the world over as Nirbhaya, the fearless one.After raping and brutalising the woman, they dumped her on the road and left for dead on the cold winter night. Her friend who was with her was also severely beaten and thrown out along with her. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/daughters-being-brutally-assaulted-every-day-fight-not-over-yet-nirbhayas-father-184776

15-12-2020||---||COVID-19: AYUSH practitioners can’t prescribe medicines as ‘cure’||New Delhi, December 15Qualified AYUSH and Homoeopathic practitioners can prescribe government-approved tablets, mixtures as add-on drugs to conventional treatment for COVID19 patients, the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, however, said such qualified AYUSH and Homoeopathic practitioners can’t advertise anything as a cure for COVID19.The verdict came on an appeal against an order passed by the Kerala High Court on August 21 that prohibited AYUSH doctors from advertising or prescribing medicines as cure for COVID19, except for the purpose of boosting immunity, as permitted under the Centre’s March 6, 2020 advisory.Noting that Homoeopathy, Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and naturopathy can be used for enhancing immunity to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, the High Court had given liberty to the state authorities to take appropriate action under the Disaster Management Act against those violating the advisory.The Centre had submitted that homoeopathy practitioners can prescribe treatment to COVID19 positive patients as a preventive measure and not as a cure.The Ministry of AYUSH had said all these medicines were to be administered as a preventive measure or as an add-on to the conventional treatment and should not be prescribed as a cure.The drugs prescribed by Homoeopathic medical practitioners were for preventive and prophylactic use, for symptom management of COVID19-like illnesses, and add-on interventions to conventional care, it had clarified.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-ayush-practitioners-cant-prescribe-medicines-as-cure-184761
15-12-2020||Lucknow||Kejriwal’s UP poll plan: Yogi govt reminds him of Varanasi defeat, says he failed in Delhi||Hours after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced Aam Aadmi Party’s intention to contest the next assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, the UP government called him an inefficient administrator and a “habitual liar”.The barbs from Uttar Pradesh minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh on Tuesday were in reaction to the AAP leader’s criticism of the BJP government in UP while  announcing his party’s plans for 2022.“He is a habitual liar while his inefficient administration skills have been exposed thoroughly, especially during the COVID-19 crisis,” the minister said, claiming that the AAP government in Delhi has been an “abject failure”.Singh also reminded Kejriwal of his defeat in Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency, and called his Uttar Pradesh plans just daydreams—‘Kejriwal ke Haseen Sapne’.“It seems that you have forgotten 2014, remember what happened with you in Varanasi,” the BJP leader said. Modi won the seat by a huge margin of 3.37 lakh votes.The UP minister also recalled the exodus of migrant labourers from Delhi during the lockdown after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.“It is hard to imagine how he turned out the hapless people of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand from Delhi during the trying times of coronavirus,” Singh said.“It was for the Yogi government to receive them, provide them free rations, give them a sustenance allowance and get them tested for coronavirus for free,” he added.Singh said it is surprising that the Delhi CM has something to comment on the UP government despite having “failed” Delhi on more than one occasion.He said UP has conducted more than two crore tests for coronavirus, compared to 72 lakh in Delhi.He said Delhi has recorded 6.08 lakh cases of the virus while the figure for UP, which is several times bigger, is 5.66 lakh.The minister also referred to a Delhi High Court observation on the handling of pandemic in the national capital.Singh said Kejriwal owed an apology for “insulting” people from Purvanchal by saying that they come to Delhi on a Rs-500 ticket to get medical treatment worth Rs 5 lakh, depriving Delhi’s citizens of the facilities.“Don’t you forget that even Purvanchal has enough facilities to match the standard of your hospitals,” Singh said.The minister also took a dig at Kejriwal over his claim on providing oximeters to COVID-19 patients recovering at home.“I would suggest you to kindly get your oxygen level checked with an oximeter,” he said.Singh said the Yogi Adityanath government has cleared UP sugarcane farmers’ dues of about Rs 1.12 lakh crore, claiming that this amount alone was more than the Delhi government’s entire budget.“Yet another political foray of Kejriwal into UP is like ‘Mungerilal ke Haseen Sapne’ which will change to ‘Kejriwal ke Haseen Sapne’ after 2022,” he said, in an apparent reference to an old TV serial and the Delhi CM’s 2014 Lok Sabha defeat.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal said UP is being held back by its “dirty politics” and “corrupt leaders” and compared medical and other facilities there with those in Delhi.“Why do the people of UP travel to Delhi for every major and minor facility? If a family living in Kanpur has to send their child to a good college, they have to send her to Delhi. If a person living in Gorakhpur has to get good medical treatment for his parents, they have to come to Delhi. Why?” he had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kejriwals-up-poll-plan-yogi-govt-reminds-him-of-varanasi-defeat-says-he-failed-in-delhi-184757
15-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt willing to continue talks with genuine farm unions; MSP will continue as it is: Tomar||As a standoff continues between the government and groups of protesting farmers over three new farm laws, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Tuesday said the Acts have been welcomed in various states across the country but the Centre is willing to continue its talks with “genuine farm unions” to find a solution with an open mind.He also said that the Minimum Support Price (MSP), at which the government commits to procure the produce from farmers, is an administrative decision and it “will continue as it is”.Tomar’s comments followed a meeting with members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Kisan) from Uttar Pradesh, who submitted a memorandum to the minister with suggestions regarding the Farm Acts and the MSP.Bharatiya Kisan Union (Kisan) has also decided to end for now its protest, which it was holding at district levels in Uttar Pradesh. They have not been part of nearly 40 farmers’ groups that have been protesting on various borders of the national capital and had attended the recent rounds of talks with the Centre without any breakthrough.According to the ministry’s statement, Tomar thanked the BKU (Kisan) leaders for coming out in support of the Farm Acts and said these laws have been welcomed in various states across the country.“He (Tomar) further added that the government is willing to continue dialogue with genuine farm unions and is willing to find a solution with an open mind,” the statement said.The BKU (Kisan) leaders suggested that farmers be given an option of going to civil courts in case of a dispute. They also suggested that the Panchayat head should be accorded the same importance as the head of the mandi to safeguard the rights of the farmers in small towns and villages.In the case of the Essential Commodities Act, they suggested that it should prevent hoarding and black marketing.The union leaders also suggested that electricity rates for irrigation should be reduced and electricity should be available for longer hours in Uttar Pradesh.They also proposed that standards for crops should be decided at the procurement centres so that farmers do not face any problem in selling the produce.After the meeting, BKU (Kisan) president Pawan Thakur told reporters, “The minister explained the laws in detail and we realised the laws are really good. We had some doubts, he cleared them all. ...The minister said he will look into our demands.”           He also said the union stopped its protest for the time being in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“If our demands are not met, we will protest again,” he added.“The minister listened to our key amendments carefully. He said the government is discussing these issues already. We suggested six issues to make the laws more effective. We are happy with talks with the minister. We believe that the government is working positively,” said Acharya Ram Gopala Dixit, BKU (Kisan) Patron since 2009.According to a memorandum earlier given by the union members, they pressed for a separate legislation to ensure guaranteed MSP for crops, saying the middleman buy crops at lower rate from farmers and sell it to government at MSP.“We want a law on MSP so that crops outside mandis can not be sold below that rate. Farmers incurred losses this kharif season as they were forced to sell below the MSP. If our demand is accepted we are ready to support the laws. We don’t know at what rate crops will be sold. Ideally, our crops should be sold above MSP but it is sold below that rate,” Thakur had said before his meeting with Tomar.Tomar and some other ministers, including Rajnath Singh, have been meeting various farmer unions in the past few days who have extended support to the new laws.However, several other farmer unions, particularly from Punjab and Haryana, are continuing to protest for more than two weeks against the three farm laws, saying the new legislation will lead to the dismantling of the MSP and mandi systems and leave them at the mercy of corporates.Some ministers have also said that a few anti-social elements and Maoists are misusing the platform of farmers’ protest to further their own agenda.Speaking in Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said separately that “a conspiracy is afoot to confuse farmers who have gathered near Delhi at present”.               The Centre announces MSP for more than 20 Kharif and Rabi crops. It mainly procures wheat and paddy to fulfil commitment under the National Food Security Act and to create buffer stock.The government, under the food law, provides 5 kg of wheat or rice per person per month at Rs 2-3 per kg to over 80 crore people through ration shops.  Of late, the Centre also procures pulses and oilseeds under different schemes such as the Price Stabilisation Fund.In its proposal to farmers on Wednesday last week, the Centre had said it will give a written assurance that the MSP system will remain and also redress their other key concerns. The unions, however, are demanding complete rollback of the central laws and have threatened to intensify their agitation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-willing-to-continue-talks-with-genuine-farm-unions-msp-will-continue-as-it-is-tomar-184753

Miller today. India-US partnership in the field of Defence sector has matured into a strategic nature over the last decade,” he said.Singh said 2020 was a “landmark year” in the India-US defence relationship.“Conclusion of BECA is a powerful signal of our future direction of high-end cooperation for capability enhancement,” he said.Officials said issues relating to strategic cooperation were discussed during the conversation.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June 2016, the US had designated India a “Major Defence Partner” intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.The two countries signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other’s bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two countries signed another pact called COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and sale of high end technology from the US to India.In October, India and the US sealed the BECA to further boost bilateral defence ties. The deal provides for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries. According to the US government, India maintains the largest fleets of C-17 and P-8 aircraft outside of the US, and as of 2020, Washington has authorised more than USD 20 billion in defence sales to India.

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Assam students develop mobile app for farmers to smartly manage their crops, farms||Students at IIT Guwahati, NIT Silchar and Dibrugarh University in Assam have jointly developed a multi-lingual smartphone application for farmers to smartly manage their farms and remotely monitor distress activities.Developed with a goal of optimising the in-farm productivity through Artificial Intelligence (AI), the application called “AgSpeak” will help the farmers in making decisions and managing farm activities through their smartphone or computer. “India is a leading agricultural country with immense potential, yet 2 billion people globally did not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food in 2019 alone. To end this global starvation, we need to double agricultural productivity in the next 15 years. Unless we use technology appropriately in the agricultural sector, this would be impossible,” said IIT Guwahati Director TG Sitharam.According to Manik Mittal, a student at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, the startup is leading this initiative in the northeastern India, which has untapped potential with diverse ecosystems having agriculture as the major economic activity.“The developed application is multi-lingual and has an option of Assamese as well. This feature is a first among all the agri-tech applications available in the market.Driven by hyper local crop data coming from satellite and smart IOT devices, AgSpeak considers up to 20 local crop parameters which are key indicators of their health like rainfall, sunlight hours, soil health status, among others, to alert farmers about probable crop threats in advance and suggest best practices to tackle the incoming threat, hence optimising resources used and maximising productivity,” he said.“The app along with the internet of things hardware has been tested for the past three months with 500 farmers and two tea estates. Some of the major breakthroughs by the algorithm were precise prediction of blight in potato and tea mosquito bug, along with water stress in winter crops.“These are major reasons of woes to farmers and small tea growers of Assam and cause lakhs in crop damages if not controlled in time,” he added.Another IIT Guwahati student Akash Sharma, said, nearly 250 farmers have already been provided hands on training in utilising the full potential of the app.“However, the user friendliness and multilingual features of the app make it extremely easy for farmers to use and seldom require training. The mobile app is completely free for general small farmers. There are in-app purchases like soil testing and agri-doctor consultation.“Besides this, the IOT devices can be rented on monthly or yearly purposes by commercial farms to further enhance precision farm management. It has been tested with many farmers and its practical utility established,” he added.The other co-founders include Siddhartha Bora (NIT Silchar), Nitin Chauhan (IIT Guwahati), Dhritiman Talukdar (NIT Silchar alumnus) and Kookil Pran Goswami (Dibrugarh University).

FB also feared that its employees & offices will be attacked. The cost of keeping the BJP happy was that FB ended up amplifying hate and violence against minorities,” Owaisi said in a tweet.He asked Facebook to act against all hate mongers and take action by banning the right-wing groups. He questioned Facebook if its inaction against the Bajrang Dal was out of a choice to choose between safety of Indians and its own investments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/owaisi-asks-facebook-to-act-against-bajrang-dal-184732

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Micromanaging every content online not effective approach of regulation: Facebook’s Nick Clegg||The most effective approach of regulation is not the one that seeks to “micro manage” every content online but rather the one that holds companies accountable and insists on a high level of transparency of systems and policies, Facebook Vice-President for Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg said on Tuesday.Speaking at the Facebook Fuel for India 2020 event, Clegg said the digital industry is still young and has had a profound impact on the way in which one works and interacts.He said it is right that rule makers and democratically elected rule makers should seek to introduce new guidelines and guardrails in the way in which the internet operates.“What I observe is that the most effective and intelligent approach to regulation is one that doesn’t seek to try and micromanage every post and every line of content online... but instead to hold companies like Facebook accountable, and insist on a high level of transparency for the systems and the policies that they have in place,” he added.Further, he said regulations that do not “hinder the way in which the international economy now relies on international data flows” would be a “sensible overall approach”.Currently, digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google are categorised as intermediaries and regulated by the IT Act, 2000 that defines their role to be limited to processing, storing and transmitting data of third party users.The Indian government is working on amending the IT rules for intermediaries to make them more responsive and accountable.The government is also crafting data protection law to ensure privacy, safety and security of user data. These include provisions around the handling of data of adults and minors, storage within the Indian borders and penalties for non-compliance.Facebook and WhatsApp have drawn flak in India over issues like handling of hate speech and misinformation on these platforms.Clegg noted that the company is “very responsive” to law enforcement requests in India or elsewhere for cooperation and that it disables a huge number of accounts and groups on Facebook and Instagram for nefarious behaviour.However, WhatsApp is a private, intimate messaging system that is quite different from the public or semi-public experience of Instagram and Facebook as it is end-to-end encrypted, he said.“What we say to policy makers in India and elsewhere is because we can’t see the content that doesn’t mean that we cannot use signals that we do pick up, what is called metadata. We can use metadata to pick up signals so that we can go after people on an encrypted messaging system,” Clegg said.He added that about two million WhatsApp accounts are removed every month, especially when they are used for bulk broadcast of messages, which is not the purpose of the app.“We will continue to explain to policy makers as best as we can, that we think that millions and billions of people around the world, expect the privacy of an intimate end-to-end encrypted messaging service, even as we continue to cooperate with them in other ways,” he emphasised.Asked if it would make sense to have India-specific community guidelines, Clegg said it is a complex issue.“The complex thing about all this is that Facebook as a company has been put under tremendous political pressure, whether it is in India or elsewhere, by people who have different views and often conflicting views about what shouldn’t and shouldn’t be circulating freely on the internet, even though it is legal,” he said.Clegg said given that Facebook is a global company, it has community standards that it applies evenly and consistently.“It doesn’t mean that there aren’t national legislative requirements and other exceptional requirements that we don’t respond to,” he said.He cited the example of Germany where it is illegal to say certain things about the Holocaust, which was not the case in other countries, and so Facebook geo-blocked that content in Germany.“There is adaptability... they must be for specific circumstances,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/micromanaging-every-content-online-not-effective-approach-of-regulation-facebooks-nick-clegg-184728

The government has announced that the decision has been taken keeping in view the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government issued orders for this late last evening. This decision was announced after the Telangana State Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee asked the government to fix the fee structure for MBBS and BDS courses for a period of 2020-2023. The government orders say that the tuition fee in medical colleges for medical students for the entire year in all A category (50 per cent) would remain at Rs 60,000, for students in B Category (35 per cent) is Rs 11,00,000 and tuition fee for C Category (15 per cent). The annual tuition fee across dental colleges in the State for students under A Category (50 per cent) is Rs 45,000, B Category (35 per cent) is Rs 4,00,000 and C Category (15 per cent) is Rs 5,00,000. The order further clarifies that the students will pay the same tuition fee for the entire course period, as paid during the time of the admission. The medical or dental college will collect the tuition fee every year in advance only for that particular year. Telangana state has one of the lowest fee structures for medical students in the country. In comparison Punjab increased the fee for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) course fee in May this year by 78 per cent from Rs 4.4 lakh to Rs 7.81 lakh for 2019-20 session making the Punjab fee structure to be among the highest in the country.While there is no increase in fee in Telangana, in Punjab the fee for the four-and-a-half years course has been split to Rs 1.5 lakh the first year, Rs 1.65 lakh the second year, 1.80 lakh the third and 1.95 lakh the fourth year, and Rs 91,000 for the final six months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-says-no-hike-in-medical-and-dental-fee%C2%A0for-now-184726
15-12-2020||New Delhi||Decimation of parliamentary democracy is complete: Congress slams government over no winter session of Parliament||Slamming the government for its decision to not hold Parliament's winter session in view of COVID-19, the Congress on Tuesday said the "decimation of parliamentary democracy is complete" and asked if election campaigning could be done amid the pandemic then why can't the session be held.Senior Congress leader and the party's chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh also said that the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, was not consulted on the matter.In a letter to leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said, "Winter months are very crucial for managing the pandemic because of recent spurt in cases during this period, particularly in Delhi. At present, we are in the middle of December and a COVID vaccine is expected very soon."    The minister said he had informally contacted floor leaders of various political parties and "they have expressed their concerns about the ongoing pandemic and opined of doing away with winter session".Responding to the minister's remarks, Ramesh tweeted, "The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha was not consulted. Mr. Pralhad Joshi is as usual departing from the truth."Hitting out at the government, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter, "Modi ji, decimation of 'parliamentary democracy' is complete. NEET/JEE exams can be held during COVID. Schools can be opened, universities can hold exams. Rallies can be held in Bihar-Bengal. But winter session of Parliament can't be held.""Any semblance of democracy left?" he asked.On its official Twitter handle, the Congress said, "Another step in the BJP's attempt to destroy democracy.""The BJP brought crisis on democracy is not limited to parliamentary sessions, but is a crisis on every common person's life, their independence, their wishes. We will fight this crisis," the party said in a tweet in Hindi.Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said, "Bihar election – not postponed. New Parliament building ceremony – not postponed. BJP Bengal rallies – not postponed. But Parliament winter session – postponed due to COVID-19.“Winter session postponement is BJP's expected sinister strategy to avoid debate, questions on farmers' protest."Another Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed also hit out at the BJP for going ahead with poll campaigning amid the pandemic, but citing COVID-19 to no hold the winter session of Parliament."If COVID-19 hasn't stopped the BJP government from campaigning for elections or even going ahead with a new Parliament building, why should winter session of Parliament be scrapped because of it? BJP is using the pandemic as an excuse to undermine essential democratic processes!" she tweeted.Senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said the Inter-Parliamentary Union data shows more than 105 countries across the world held multiple Parliamentary sessions amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.He asked why the Modi government was evading the accountability by cancelling the Parliament session.

15-12-2020||Sonepat||Won’t back down, will send our written response to Centre tomorrow, say farmers’ unions||Farmers’ unions have said they would send their written response to the central government’s latest proposal on Monday---a development that comes days after the fifth round of talks between the central government and the protesters remained inconclusive.Farmers unions addressed the press after a massive day-long hunger strike they undertook as part of the protest against three controversial laws that farmers have been protesting since September.“Our Monday demonstration in 350 districts across country was successful. 150 toll plazas were also made 'free' by farmers,” Union leaders who addressed the press at Singhu Border. The main sticking point for the two parties is the central government’s refusal to repeal the three laws. Farmers say they will not climb down from that demand.   “Government is saying they won't repeal these laws, we are saying we will make you do it,” a union leader Jagjeet Dallewal said. “We are not running away from negotiation, but government has to pay heed to our demands and come forward with concrete proposals,” another union leader said.They are determined to go on until their demands are met, the leaders said.“The fight has reached a stage where we are determined to win it no matter what,” they said.The unions have also decided to hold ‘shradhanjali’ (dedication) to the 20 protesters who have died since their protests began. This shrandhanjali will be given in every village across the country on December 20, some leaders said.“Around 20 farmers become 'shaheed' during protest so far. On an average, one farmer has died every day since protest started,” leaders said.“People across villages and blocks to pay tribute on December 20 to farmers who lost their lives during agitation,” a leader, Inderjeet, told the press. --- With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-back-down-will-send-our-written-response-to-centre-tomorrow-say-farmers-unions-184722
15-12-2020||Mumbai||TRP case: No coercive action against ARG employees, police to Bombay HC||The Mumbai Police on Tuesday assured the Bombay High Court that no coercive action will be taken till December 16 against officials and employees of ARG Outlier Media, which operates Republic TV who has been named in the chargesheet in the TRP (Television Rating Points) rigging case.The ARG Outlier Media had approached the HC seeking, among other things, that the police be restrained from taking any coercive action against its employees.Public Prosecutor Deepak Thakare, who appeared for the Mumbai Police, made a statement before a bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik that no coercive action will be taken against employees of ARG Outlier Media.Earlier in the day, advocate Abad Ponda, who appeared for ARG Outlier Media, had read out from the chargesheet to point out that the police had mentioned the owners, managers, and related persons of Republic TV, as suspects in the case.The chargesheet read, “Republic Channel, maalak, chaalak ani sambandhit vyakti” (Republic channel, owner, managers and related persons).Advocate Ponda said this could mean that the police could arrest anyone related to the channel and that the same constituted “gross illegality”.This prompted the bench to remark that the words ‘maalak’ and ‘chalak’ were so “broad that they may include anyone, even reporters on the field”.The bench then asked advocate Thakare to take instructions from the police that no coercive action will be taken against the employees till further hearing on December 16.“Why can’t you make a statement that you (police) will not take any coercive action till tomorrow,” the bench asked.“No one is stopping you from investigating,” it said.Following the HC’s remarks, advocate Thakare made the statement assuring the court that no arrests will be made and no other coercive action will be taken against the employees referred to in the chargesheet in the case, till Wednesday.The HC recorded this statement. It will continue to hear the matter on Wednesday.ARG Outlier Media had filed several pleas and interim applications in the HC urging transfer of the probe in the TRP case to the Central Bureau of Investigation or any other independent agency.The pleas also requested the high court to stay in the meanwhile, any further investigation in the case, and to restrain the police from taking any coercive action against the petitioners, their employees, or investors.The police began a probe in the alleged TRP scam after ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Agency about rigging of TRP by some channels.TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers.The BARC engaged Hansa to install and maintain barometers which record TV viewership data at sample households.It was alleged that some of these families were being bribed to tune into certain channels to ramp up their TRP.In a charge sheet filed recently, the police alleged that an official of Hansa paid money to sample households to tune into Box Cinema, Fakt Marathi, Maha Movie and Republic TV.The Republic TV has denied any wrongdoing.The police have so far arrested 13 persons, including Republic Media Network’s CEO Vikas Khanchandani, in the case.

15-12-2020||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: 2 agitating ANMs attempt self-immolation seeking regularisation of jobs||Two of the agitating Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM), who were on a dharna here for 18 days demanding regularisation of service, attempted self-immolation on Tuesday, police said.The two poured kerosene on their bodies and about to light a matchstick when co-agitators stopped them. They were later taken to a hospital, police said."We are on dharna for 18 days demanding regular jobs.As the government has turned a deaf ear to our genuine demand, there is no other alternative than killing ourselves," said Rutupragyan Sahu, one of the women who attempted self- immolation.She said at the dharna site that they used to earn Rs 7,000-Rs 8,000 a month working in private hospitals. They left those jobs to join the COVID Care Centres (CCCs) and COVID Care Homes (CCHs) of the state government.CCCs were set up by the health department to treat less serious coronavirus patients while asymmetric patients were initially kept at CCHs.Sahu said that they were disengaged after a decline in the number of new COVID-19 patients across the state.A section of the around 1000 agitating ANMs have also started hunger strike at the protest site and a few of them were recently hospitalised as their health condition deteriorated.During the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, the Odisha government had provided employment to ANMs, nurses and other paramedical staff. As many as 21,000 ANMs were given temporary jobs on a daily wage basis for a period of three months or till CCCs and CCHs are functional, officials said.Health and Family Welfare Minister N K Das on Monday advised the agitating ANMs to apply for regular jobs when the government would advertise for vacant posts.Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition P K Naik of the BJP wrote a letter to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday urging him to consider the "genuine" demands of the health workers who were engaged in the CCHs and CCCs.Naik also requested the chief minister to look into the issues concerning the livelihood of health workers who saved many lives during the pandemic."The government should fill up the vacant posts of ANMs in different public health centres, community health centres and district headquarters hospitals," he said alleging that thousands of positions are lying vacant in government health facilities.The ANMs can also be engaged in various government hostels and in creating awareness on tuberculosis, malaria and polio in villages, Naik said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/odisha-2-agitating-anms-attempt-self-immolation-seeking-regularisation-of-jobs-184718

Seventeen of the dead were Thakurs, the dominant caste in the village.Rajaram Singh's younger brothers Banwari Singh and Himmat Singh, cousin Naresh Singh and nephews Dev Singh, Hukum Singh and Dashrath Singh were among those allegedly killed by the Phoolan Devi gang.Singh once told a journalist that he wished to see the accused hanged for their crime."But God only knows whether I will be able to witness it as I am suffering from chronic liver ailment. I will get peace only when the killers are punished in my lifetime,” he was quoted as saying.A Kanpur court framed charges in the case in August 2012, three decades after the massacre.Out of the 23 accused, 16, including Phoolan Devi, are already dead.Charges were then framed against the four surviving accused, and the court issued non-bailable warrants against the three absconders among them—Maan Singh, Ramkesh and Vishwanath alias Ashok.A special court (dacoity) had initially fixed a date in January 2020 for pronouncing the verdict. But it was adjourned several times as the original case diary was reported missing from court records, and a probe was ordered.The court has to give its verdict on the role of the four surviving accused—Posha (75), Shyambabu (70), Bhikha (65), and Vishwanath (54). While Posha is still in jail, the rest are out on bail.In the years following the massacre, Phoolan Devi went on to surrender and later become an MP. She was gunned down outside her official residence in New Delhi on July 25, 2001. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/main-witness-of-behmai-massacre-dies-court-yet-to-pronounce-verdict-in-1981-case-184712

15-12-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Sabarimala’s COVID count at 299; Health Dept revises guidelines||All officials on duty at Sabarimala, where the Lord Ayyappa temple is located, besides pilgrims should undergo the RT-PCR test as the Kerala Health Department has revised its guidelines following increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the area in recent days.The revised norms were issued in connection with the pilgrimage at the temple and one of them was making the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test mandatory for all pilgrims and officials on duty who reach the shrine after the Mandala Puja on December 26.According to official sources, 299 people, including 51 pilgrims, 245 employees and three others, have contracted the infection so far after the hill temple was thrown open for the annual Mandala-Makaravilakku pilgrimage last month.There was a 31 per cent increase in COVID-19 cases in Pathanamthitta, the district where the temple is located, and 11 per cent in nearby Kottayam district during this period as per reports, state Health Minister K K Shailaja said.As per the revised guidelines, all officials on duty at Sabarimala should undergo the RT-PCR tests, she said here in a statement.Even if the officials on duty have already undergone the test before being deployed at Sabarimala, the mode of testing has been changed as the COVID positive cases are reported high among them.“All pilgrims and officials on duty, who reach Sabarimala after the Mandala Puja on December 26, are required to undergo the RT-PCR test.All of them should bring the Covid negative certificate taken from an accredited lab 24 hours before reaching the base camp, Nilakkal,” Shailaja said.She said special attention was paid to ensure a safe pilgrimage at Sabarimala as there were reports of extreme spread of the disease in many parts of the world including in some states in the country in connection with pilgrimages.Urging pilgrims to follow the COVID protocol strictly, the minister said all should keep physical distance while trekking the holy hills and close contacts between devotees should be avoided to ensure there was no chance of super-spread of the infection.Those who contracted the disease recently or having symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath or fatigue should refrain from the pilgrimage, she said, adding that overcrowding should be avoided at the base camps and toilets should be disinfected after each use.

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Late Pranab Mukherjee’s family feuds over his memoirs||Pranab Mukherjee’s children are on a war path over the publication of the late President’s memoirs which appear to feature some disparaging references to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whom Mukherjee blamed for the party’s 2014 electoral loss.In a dramatic turn of events today, Mukherjee’s son and former Congress MP Abhijit Mukherjee shot off a letter to publishers Rupa asking them to stop the publication of the memoirs entitled “The Presidential Years”.@kapish_mehra @Rupa_Books I , the Son of the author of the Memoir " The Presidential Memoirs " request you to kindly stop the publication of the memoir as well as motivated excerpts which is already floating in certain media platforms without my written consent .1/3Mukherjee’s daughter Sharmishtha who is in custody of her late father’s notes and diaries however asked her brother not to make trouble by preventing the publication of the content for “cheap publicity”.“ I, daughter of the author of the memoir ‘The Presidential Years’, request my brother @ABHIJIT_LS not to create any unnecessary hurdles in publication of the last book written by our father. He completed the manuscript before he fell sick. The final draft contains my dads’ hand written notes & comments that have been strictly adhered to. The views expressed by him are his own & no one should try to stop it from being published for any cheap publicity. That would be the greatest disservice to our departed father,” Sharmishtha wrote on Twitter after her brother earlier tweeted, “I , the Son of the author of the Memoir “ The Presidential Years” request you to kindly stop the publication of the memoir as well as motivated excerpts which is already floating in certain media platforms without my written consent.”Abhijit said his father would have done the same had he been alive.The memoirs whose excerpts were this week released by Rupa have Pranab Mukherjee blaming Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the party’s dismal 2014 showing.Pranab says in the memoirs that some in the grand old organisation believed that the debacle could have been averted had he been prime minister.“The Presidential Years 2012-2017” is set for January 2021 release and features the late President’s impressions of the two prime ministers he worked with – Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi.Mukheerjee says, “I believe that the moral authority to govern vests with the PM. The overall state of the nation is reflective of the functioning of the PM and his administration. While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his ­first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature and the judiciary. Only time will tell if there is a better understanding on such matters in the second term of this government.”On Congress party’s 2014 electoral rout, Mukherjee makes a candid admission, “Some members of the Congress have theorized that, had I become the PM in 2004, the party might have averted the 2014 Lok Sabha drubbing. Though I don’t subscribe to this view, I do believe that the party’s leadership lost political focus after my elevation as president.

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Contempt case: Prashant Bhushan moves SC, seeks hearing on his plea before review petitions are considered||Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction that his two pleas, in which he has sought review of the orders convicting and sentencing him for contempt of court for his tweets against the judiciary, be heard after adjudication of his separate petition raising the issue of right to appeal in such matter.The application has been moved by Bhushan, a day before a three-judge bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar is scheduled to consider in-chamber on Wednesday his two petitions seeking review of the apex court’s orders by which he was convicted and sentenced in the contempt case.The top court had on August 14 held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his two contemptuous tweets against the judiciary, saying they cannot be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary made in the public interest.Later, the apex court had on August 31 sentenced him to either pay nominal fine of Re 1 or face a three-month jail term and debarment from law practice for three years in the case.Bhushan, who has already deposited Re 1 as fine with the apex court’s registry on September 14, has filed two separate review petitions in the case.After the apex court’s orders in the contempt case, Bhushan had filed a separate petition on September 12 seeking directions including that person convicted for criminal contempt by top court, including him, would have a right to an intra-court appeal to be heard by a larger and different bench.In his application filed through advocate Kamini Jaiswal on Tuesday, Bhushan said that prayers made in the September 12 petition have “a direct bearing” on the review petitions filed by him.He said despite the application seeking urgent listing was filed on September 14 in the petition, the matter has not been listed before the court “whereas instant and connected review petitions have been suddenly listed for hearing on December 16, 2020”.The application said it would be in the “interest of justice” if the top court would apply its mind to the review petitions after the separate plea filed by him is heard or adjudicated upon.In his separate petition filed on September 12, Bhushan has suggested procedural changes to reduce the chances of “arbitrary, vengeful and high-handed decisions” in criminal contempt cases saying that in such cases the top court is the aggrieved party, the “prosecutor, the witness and the judge” and hence they raise fear of inherent bias.The petition has said that right of appeal is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution and is also guaranteed under international law and this would act as a “vital safeguard against wrongful conviction and would truly enable the provision of truth as a defence”.The plea, to which the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Registrar of the apex court have been made parties, has also sought a direction for framing rules and guidelines “providing for intra-court appeal against conviction in original criminal contempt cases”.Under the present statutory scheme, a person convicted for the criminal contempt has the right to file review petition against the judgement and that plea is decided in chambers by the bench usually without hearing the contemnor.In his petition seeking review of the order holding him guilty for contempt of court for his two derogatory tweets against the judiciary, Bhushan has contended that it “suffers from multiple errors apparent on the face of the record of both law and of fact”.Later, he had filed another petition seeking review of the sentencing order which imposed fine on him in the contempt case and sought “an oral hearing in an open court” on the matter.The top court, in its verdict in the case, had analysed the two tweets of Bhushan posted on micro-blogging site Twitter on June 27 on the functioning of judiciary in past six years, and on July 22 with regard to Chief Justice of India S A Bobde.

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Possibility of adverse event after COVID vaccination can’t be ruled out; states, UTs should be prepared: Govt||The possibility of an adverse event after being vaccinated for COVID-19 cannot be ruled out, the government said on Tuesday and asked states and union territories to be prepared for this as part of the anti-coronavirus inoculation drive.At a press briefing, secretary in the Health Ministry Rajesh Bhushan said that adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) are critical aspect and states have been asked to identify at least one adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) management centre in each block.“Even during universal immunisation programmes, which have been going on for decades, some adverse effects are seen in children and pregnant women after they are administered shots.“So, we can’t deny the possibility of an adverse event when the COVID-19 vaccination begins. In countries where inoculation has already started, especially in the UK, adverse events took place on the very first day. So, it is essential that states and union territories prepare for this too,” Bhushan said.Detailed instructions on infection prevention and control practices during vaccination and management of minor, severe, serious AEFI have been issued to states by the Centre, he said.“States have been asked to identify at least one AEFI management centre in each block. PHCs, CHCs, district hospitals, private health facilities or any other fixed health facility with medical officers and para-medical staff can be identified as AEFI management centres,” he said.     Further, every session site has to be linked to a designated AEFI management centre and AEFI can also be reported through Co-WIN, — a digitalised platform, which will be used to track enlisted beneficiaries for the vaccination and anti-coronavirus vaccines on a real-time basis, he added.COVID-19 cases and deaths are declining in India which is very reassuring, the Centre said on Tuesday but cautioned against any laxity saying an overwhelming proportion of the country’s population is still “very, very susceptible” to the virus and the situation may escalate unexpectedly.While there is a continuous increasing trend in COVID-19 cases and deaths globally, particularly in America and Europe and the situation in the world is becoming worrisome, in contrast the scene in India is satisfying as the cases and deaths are declining, Dr V K Paul, member (health) at NITI Aayog, told a press conference here.“Mortality is declining and it is well below 400 per day. Cases have come down to almost 22,000. This is the kind of number we all experienced in July. So that is very reassuring. As a nation, we seem to be now doing very well.“We are saving lives. But remember, this cannot be taken for granted. An overwhelming proportion of our population is still very, very susceptible to the virus. And the situation can escalate unexpectedly,” Paul said while cautioning against any laxity.He further said the reassuring thing is that people are saying the R0 has come below one which means the pandemic is shrinking.“So we should be happy about that but cautiously happy,” he said.Noting Delhi has made progress, he said, “We congratulate the government of Delhi as also all the other governments who have done so well in contributing towards such a significant control (in cases) in recent times.”                 Paul, however, expressed concern over the COVID-19 situation in some states like Uttarakhand, Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh and stated all efforts to control the spread are being made in collaboration with these governments.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that more than 15.55 crore tests have been conducted so far for detection of coronavirus infection in the country, and the cumulative positivity rate has come down to 6.37 while the average daily positivity rate during last week was 3.00 per cent.India’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is also among the lowest in the world. At present, India’s CFR is 1.45 per cent, whereas globally it is 2.26 per cent, Bhushan said.Speaking about the preparation for the COVID-19 vaccination drive, Bhushan said guidelines for estimation of electrical and non-electrical cold chain equipment and their strengthening have been issued to states.Guidelines for management of cold chain at last cold chain points and session sites have been issued.At least 29,000 cold chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers and 300 solar refrigerators will be used for the COVID-19 vaccination drive.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/possibility-of-adverse-event-after-covid-vaccination-cant-be-ruled-out-states-uts-should-be-prepared-govt-184690

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Zuckerberg calls India very special country, looks to push WhatsApp payments services deeper||Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday said India is a very special and important country with a remarkable entrepreneurship culture, as he sought to push deeper the just-launched payments services that allow users to make payments over WhatsApp.Last month, Facebook-owned WhatsApp received approval from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) for rolling out its payments services in India. In 2018, WhatsApp started testing its UPI-based payments services in India—a global first—with about a million users."We just launched WhatsApp payments in India last month—now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp, as easily as sending a message. That was possible because of the UPI system that has been built in India," Zuckerberg said during a fireside chat with Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani.He said the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) makes it easy for anyone to instantly accept payments across different apps.Referring to late Dhirubhai Ambani's vision of affordable connectivity in the country, Zuckerberg said, "... today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard and that's what we've tried to do with messaging... and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI system, which I think is just great".Following the NPCI approval, WhatsApp has started its payments service in the country in a "graded" manner, starting with a maximum registered user base of 20 million in UPI. WhatsApp—which counts India as its biggest market with over 400 million users—will compete with players like Paytm, Google Pay, Walmart-owned PhonePe and Amazon Pay in the country.In April, Facebook announced an investment of USD 5.7 billion (Rs 43,574 crore) in Jio Platforms."I have no hesitation in going on record, that it is your investment that set the ball rolling. Not only for Jio, but for the Indian FDI which has been the largest-ever in its history," Mukesh Ambani said.He added that the partnership between Jio and Facebook will "actually demonstrate that it is great for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses"."And I believe Mark, that our actions will speak louder than our words in the coming months and years," Ambani said.Ambani stated that technology, with all the digitisation steps that India has taken, will democratise wealth and value creation for individuals and small businesses.Noting that WhatsApp and Jio have hundreds of millions of subscribers in India, Ambani said Jio Mart retail service aspires to "serve tens of millions of small shopkeepers in India, who are the bedrock of employment"."This means Jio brings digital connectivity, WhatsApp now with WhatsApp Pay brings digital interactivity, and the ability to move to close transactions and create value, and Jio Mart brings the unmatched online and offline retail opportunity, that gives our small shops which exist in villages and small towns in India, a chance to digitise and be at par with anybody else in the world," he added.Zuckerberg said India has introduced a lot of innovation in areas like education and financial inclusion, and that decisions taken here, shape global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people and businesses.He said India is an important country for the social media giant and many of the new features rolled out in its various products are tested here first."India is building local capabilities and tech capacity to power innovative new business models and provide Indian citizens access to digital and financial inclusion. So, the decisions that are made here, they shape global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people," he said.Zuckerberg also said that a lot of Indian organisations are leading the way in using technology to build safer communities, and more inclusive financial systems."Whether it's in social commerce or education or financial services, there is a lot of innovation that happens here. And we are proud to partner with some of the teams that are working on these important challenges... India is a very special and important country for us," he said.Saying that millions of Indians use its products (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp) every day to stay connected, Zuckerberg said millions of small businesses across the country are using WhatsApp Business and Messenger to reach customers manage orders and grow their businesses."... we are in the business of serving small businesses and nowhere is this more true than in India. This is especially important because small businesses here will be a key part of the global recovery going forward. And we're focused on making sure we build the best tools for them," he added.He also said the company is focussed on ensuring that technology "delivers for everyone" and that was one of the reasons for partnering Indian telecom major Reliance Jio that has "played such a key role in giving hundreds of millions of Indians access to the benefits of the internet" and fostering this entrepreneurial culture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/zuckerberg-calls-india-very-special-country-looks-to-push-whatsapp-payments-services-deeper-184686
15-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||PM Modi assures farmers, says govt there for them 24 hours||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 15Amid the ongoing farmer protests at Delhi borders against the Farm Acts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday again reiterated that the three farm laws have been rolled out keeping in mind farmers and their interests and slammed Opposition parties for misleading and instigating them.Meanwhile, firm on their stated stance, unions and ‘jathebandis’ accused the government of trying to drive a wedge in their unity using issues like SYL canal and called Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s meetings with “so-called famer leaders illusionary/diversionary tactics”.    Speaking in Gujarat, where he unveiled various projects, including a desalination plant, a hybrid renewable energy park and automated milk processing and packing plant, the Prime Minister questioned, “Can any dairy owner who enters into a contract with a dairy farmer for buying milk take away his buffalo.”Assuring that farmers’ lands will remain safe, the PM said the laws will benefit all, including small and marginal farmers who will also have the same freedom as dairy farmers to sell their produce to who they want. “Opposition leaders are misleading farmers for narrow political gains,” he said, adding that the government is there to resolve any “issues/doubts farmers might have 24 hours. The farm laws are for your benefit. Different parts of the country have given them their blessings. I am sure ‘jagrook’ (aware/progressive) farmers of the country will defeat those spreading lies and misleading them”. The PM said agriculture reforms are exactly what farmer bodies and even opposition parties have been asking for years. He also met members of farming community, including Sikh cultivators settled in areas near the Indo-Pak border. Union leaders slammed the government, saying that while on one side the PM is “assuring farmers on the other he is asking corporates to come invest in agriculture sector”.“How else will you interpret his speech in FICCI two days back,” questioned BKU leader Yudhvir Singh. “If the PM has ‘raj-hat’, we (farmers) also have ‘kisan-hat’, don’t underestimate us or try to drive a wedge in our unity. The power on the basis of which he (PM) is speaking, we have given him that power. There have been prime ministers in the past who have opened their doors to us whenever we had any issue, but he (PM Modi) has not met a single ‘kisan jathebandi’ in past six years. Farmers know they have made a wrong choice (by electing him),” Yudhvir Singh said, dismissing as “diversionary and illusionary” the talks between Tomar and union leaders demanding that laws not be repealed. “He (Tomar) should ask them to end this agitation then,” unions said.   Now that it is almost clear that the laws will not be repealed — several ministers have said it in as many words — it is also becoming increasingly evident that the government is constructing evidence in favour of the laws through the same section opposing the laws.Today, Tomar met members of BKU (Kisan) from Uttar Pradesh who “welcomed” the Farm Acts. They also submitted a memorandum with suggestions regarding the Farm Acts and MSP, according to an official statement. Tomar told them that “Acts have been welcomed in various States and that the Government is willing to continue dialogue with genuine farm unions find a solution with an open mind”.“MSP is an administrative decision and will continue as it is,” he said.BKU (Kisan) leaders suggested farmers be given the option of going to Civil Courts and suggested that the panchayat head be accorded same importance as the head of the ‘mandi’ to safeguard farmers and demanding reduction in electricity rates for irrigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-assures-farmers-says-govt-there-for-them-24-hours-184685

Saif who plays the antagonist had later apologised and withdrawn his statements.The plaintiff alleged that Saif Ali's interview is a negative portrayal of "faith" and "faith in Sanatan Dharma".Apart from the plaintiff, witnesses Vinod Srivastava, Ajit Singh, Brijesh Nishad, Nilesh Nishad, Surya Prakash Singh and Vivek Tiwari also saw and heard the interview through Internet media at 8 pm on December 9.This has hurt their religious sentiments, the petitioner claimed.

15-12-2020||---||UK PM Johnson to be chief guest at Republic Day celebrations||New Delhi, December 15UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has accepted India’s invitation to be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations on January 26, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said at a media conference after talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar here on Monday.A separate announcement from 10, Downing Street, had Johnson describing India as a key player in the Indo-Pacific region and an increasingly indispensable partner for the UK in economy, security and climate change.Johnson will be the second UK Prime Minister to attend the Republic Day celebrations after John Major in 1993.Raab said both sides had also agreed on key elements of a 10-year India-UK roadmap which may be unveiled during Johnson’s visit. He will discuss the roadmap on Wednesday when he calls on PM Modi. Raab will also discuss with Modi closer collaboration on an Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP) and working together to end the coronavirus crisis and tackle climate change. The UK Foreign Office described the ETP as a forerunner to a FTA. Bilateral trade stands at almost £ 24 billion and grew by 11 per cent in the last fiscal.At the media conference with Jaishankar, Raab said he had extended Johnson’s invitation to PM Modi to attend the next G-7 summit to be hosted by the UK next year.Jaishankar, hoped Raab’s visit would not only be a good augury for bilateral ties but an early return to life “as we know it’’.The four hours of discussions between the two Foreign Ministers focused on taking ties to a higher level and giving policy directions to broaden ties in five areas: connecting people, trade and prosperity, defence and security, climate and health, said Jaishankar.During the year, Jaishankar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla have been video conferencing with their counterparts from the UK and some western countries about the changes brought by Covid and their economic implications. “Today we exchanged notes and updated each other on the issue,” he added.All through the media interaction, Raab and Jaishankar did not mention China though they spoke of defence and security as one of the core areas of talks to tackle maritime piracy, emerging challenges like space and cyber security, and making 5G more secure.Though the UK will be sending the HMS Queen Elizabeth Carrier Strike Group to the Indian Ocean next year, Jaishankar pointed out that both countries cannot have an identical vision of the Asia Pacific.“India has its vision of Asia Pacific but a lot of other countries also do and there are big overlaps. It is a matter of satisfaction there is today a growing recognition and acceptance of the idea of Indo-Pacific,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-pm-johnson-to-be-chief-guest-at-republic-day-celebrations-184677

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Security agencies fear 'crazy' yaba may find ground in India||A sharp rise in the smuggling of yaba or 'crazy medicine' drug tablets -- almost double than the much-abused Phensedyl cough syrup -- along the country's eastern front with Bangladesh has alarmed security agencies prompting them to tweak their strategy for curbing the new menace, according to government reports and officials.A dossier prepared by a central security organisation notes that while India at present is a "transit" territory for the circular-shaped and red-coloured drug, its "increased inflow clearly indicates that it is just a matter of time for such an addictive drug to gain a foothold in India".It adds that Indian smugglers, involved in illegal Phensedyl transport, are "now shifting" to yaba due to high demand and profitability."The concern of the security, intelligence and anti-narcotics agencies against yaba transit for cross-border smuggling and use within our territory has specifically grown after witnessing the seizure figures of the last two years."The development is alarming but the agencies are prepared," a senior Union home ministry official told PTI.According to data compiled by the India-Bangladesh international border guarding force BSF, over 7.22 lakh yaba tablets were seized by its teams along the front last year as compared to over 3.08 lakh bottles of Phensedyl that used to be main drugs to be smuggled across to the neighbouring country.This year, uptil November, the Border Security Force seized over 6.65 lakh yaba tablets as compared to about 5 lakh Phensedyl bottles.In previous years, total Phensedyl (a codeine-based cough syrup abused as an intoxicant in Bangladesh) smuggling volumes were always much higher than yaba.Yaba has many aliases like Thai name 'crazy medicine', 'madness drug' or 'Nazi speed' and is a combination of stimulants, the most important being methamphetamine and caffeine.  It is stated to be manufactured in labs based in Myanmar using raw material sourced from China and is smuggled to Bangladesh from its border or through India.The dossier said Bangladesh and Myanmar share a 270-km border and a large part falls along the river Naf from where the smuggling of yaba is "mainly carried out".The drug is consumed in many ways like smoking it off tinfoil, 'chasing the dragon' technique of inhaling its fumes by heating on an aluminium foil, taken orally or crushed and snorted.Officials say the drug is especially targeted at the youth and its abuse leads to anxiety, aggression and prolonged exposure may lead to varying levels of damage to kidneys, heart, liver and the brain.Bangladesh has come down heavily on yaba peddlers and syndicates over the last few years by arresting and neutralising many such operatives and they seek active assistance of Indian authorities to curb the smuggling at every bilateral meeting forum, a senior anti-narcotics agency officer told PTI.The BSF, as per two senior officials, has issued fresh directives to its border patrols to check its smuggling along the 4,096-km long front after the drug was recovered in areas where it was "never seized" like West Bengal."Unfenced and riverine border areas are most vulnerable for yaba smuggling as it is easy to conceal the tablets on the body or in goods being taken across to Bangladesh."Drug mules bring yaba from various places in Myanmar through Champhai and Aizwal in Mizoram to Agartala and finally to Bangladesh. Some other routes are also being used," a BSF officer said.The border troops, he said, have been asked to increase manual frisking of suspects, re-work their intelligence gathering and interception techniques even as more women personnel are being deployed on routes to search ladies, children and their belongings."The BSF has assured its Bangladeshi counterpart that all steps will be taken to crush this menace," the officer added."The routes that were earlier infamous for Phensedyl, cattle and IMFL smuggling are now being used for yaba smuggling," a security officer said quoting the proceedings of a recent multi-agency intelligence sharing meeting said.He said the profit margin in the smuggling of this drug is high and hence couriers and narco networks are increasingly "shifting" to it against dealing in other drugs like Phensedyl.Yaba is sold anywhere from Rs 150-1000 per piece as per quality and demand, they said.

15-12-2020||Bengaluru||Prof. Roddam Narasimha - The man whose insight paved the way for India's successful rocket programme||When India's two successive Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) missions failed in the late 1980s, the then ISRO Chairman Prof. Satish Dhawan constituted internal and external committees to review the programme.The external panel was chaired by space and aeronautical expert Prof. Roddam Narasimha, whose key insights into the aerodynamics aspects paved the way for subsequent successful flights of the rocket."Today, when we talk of the success of PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) and GSLV Mk III (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle), we owe it to important inputs that the Prof.Narasimha committee gave", former ISRO Chairman K Kasturirangan told PTI on Tuesday.Narasimha, a Padma Vibhushan awardee and a former Director of the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) and the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), died at a private hospital here on Monday at the age of 87.Scientists and leaders recalled the pioneering contributions of the distinguished engineer-scientist, an authority on fluid mechanics and aerodynamics who had also served as a member of the Space Commission.Former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman G Madhavan Nair said Narasimha had supported India's space programme all through."He was very frank in his expression, very bold; he was down-to-earth in his approach to everything. Whenever we had problems (space-related), he used to rush to us (ISRO) to help" Nair told PTI.Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said the scientific community has lost a stalwart."His path-breaking work in aerospace and nurturing scientific institutions of national importance will be remembered", Yediyurappa said.Kasturirangan said as the NIAS Director, Prof. Narasimha created a very good academic, interdisciplinary atmosphere at the institute."He was so learned. He was so scholarly that he had an extraordinary breadth and a very deep understanding of many of the subjects like yogic science, Indian philosophy and history of mathematics", he said.Narasimha, who was born on July 20, 1933, served as Professor of aerospace engineering at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) here from 1962 to 1999.He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the country's second-highest civilian honour, in 2013.

All of them are being treated at the government-run King’s Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research here.Following the outbreak, the institute shut all its departments and classes were being held online.Allaying fears over further spread of the virus in the area, the official told reporters that IIT-M was only a localised cluster.“Earlier, similar localised outbreaks were witnessed elsewhere like in a large textile store and in a gathering for a feast and hence, people should wear masks always without fail and follow all other norms to help prevent the virus spread,” the Health Secretary said.Testing would be done for those associated with facilities like canteens in educational institutions and mansions for early identification of positive cases and treatment, he added.

15-12-2020||New Delhi||SC asks states to give Rs 2,000 per month for education of children from institutions now with their families||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed all states to provide Rs 2,000 a month for the education of each child who was in a child care institution (CCI) and now been restored to his or her family during the COVID-19 pandemic. The apex court also said state governments should provide necessary infrastructure, including books and stationery, to CCIs for the online classes of children living there on the basis of a recommendation from district child protection units within 30 days.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao said states should ensure that the required number of teachers are made available to teach children in CCIs.The bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi, was told that 2,27,518 children were in CCIs when the COVID-19 pandemic started and 1,45,788 have been restored with their families or guardians.It said states would pay Rs 2,000 per month for their education and this amount has to be given at the recommendation of the district child protection unit, keeping in mind the financial position of the children's families.Noting the importance and the need for providing education to those who have been restored with their families, the bench directed that district child protection units shall coordinate and oversee the progress made in the matter. The apex court also directed that child protection units would inform the district legal services authority about the progress made regarding the issue of facilities for children in CCIs. It observed that teachers should be permitted to teach the children as the pandemic had affected normal life since March this year and the children did not have the opportunity to attend classes.  The bench passed the order while hearing a suo moto case on the condition of children in protection, juvenile and foster or kinship homes across the country amid the coronavirus outbreak. It had earlier issued directions to state governments and various other authorities to protect them.  During the hearing conducted through video-conference, advocate Gaurav Agrawal, assisting the top court as an amicus curiae in the matter, apprised the bench about the number of children residing in CCIs and restored with their families or guardians during this pandemic period.He said CCIs should be assisted by Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) and teachers should be provided for students by following COVID-19 guidelines.“We want a direction from the Supreme Court that they should be provided educational facilities in children care homes,” Agrawal said, adding that state governments should make available necessary infrastructure and equipment for this. He said teachers may be assigned to take stock of academic progress of children in CCIs in the last five months.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the National Commission for Protection of Children Rights (NCPCR), said he has no objection to the suggestions given by the amicus.Referring to a provision of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, Mehta said, “We are making a mechanism to inspect the child care homes. We want a direction that states be asked to cooperate with the commission in inspecting the child care homes”.The bench asked Mehta, “Why don't you do all these things such as monitoring the development of children and their welfare in child care homes?”  “You can give the directions to the states on behalf of the commission,” the bench said, adding, “What do you want? Whether we should give the directions or you want to issue them?” Mehta said directions from the apex court would “carry weight” and the commission would do the needful and ensure the implementation.The bench observed that it is the duty of the child rights commission to ensure the implementation of the law.“We will accept the suggestions of the amicus and will issue directions which have to be followed up scrupulously by the states in child care homes,” the bench observed, adding that the directions will have to be implemented through the states, NCPCR and state commissions.

You take instruction and think over giving them some break. It must be very painful and might be affecting their mental health,” the bench told Mehta.The top court also expressed shock that the Gujarat government has levied around Rs 90 crore fine for not wearing face masks but has not been able to enforce the guidelines on COVID-19-appropriate behaviour.

Was the due process, of 29 members standing in favour of the notice on the floor of the House, followed?” he asked.He said the breach of privilege was to be used against those creating hurdles in functioning of the House.BJP MLA AtulBhatkalkar said “why use the Legislative Assembly when defamation laws are there to take action against certain individuals”.State Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the business listed on the agenda was only to grant extension to the privileges committee to submit its report.The privileges committee chairman, Deepak Kesarkar, said the notices were accepted by the Chair and forwarded to the committee.“Any discussion on this issue is encroachment of the speaker’s rights,” he said.State Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab said all legislators had special privileges, and “what is their use if they are not used”.Assembly Speaker Nana Patole said Uddhav Thackeray was the Chief Minister and head of the state. “It is not a matter of individuals but the post, and any insult of the post is insult of the state and the Legislature,” he said.

15-12-2020||New Delhi||AIIMS stabbed us in back, onus of patient care on them: Nurses||The nurses union of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said that the hospital administration betrayed them despite giving assurances to them regarding the abolishment of contractual appointments of nursing officers.They cited this "stab in the back" as the prime reason which prompted them to go on indefinite strike since Monday.Speaking to IANS, Harish Kumar, president of nurses union of AIIMS said that the hospital has stabbed us in the back with their decision to hire nursing officers on a contract-term basis."The hospital is playing with patients' safety and rights of the nurses with contractual hiring. We are totally against it and would not back down till the decision is rolled back," he said.The union clarified that their indefinite strike would continue till their demands were met.The strike has come at a time when the critical patients suffering from Covid-19 and other diseases are flocking to the hospital amid a cold wave descending on the city.The union said that the onus of loss to the patient's care rests on the hospital administration and the government."Since last year, we have been constantly approaching the hospital with our demands after the government assured us that they will be accepted shortly. We were also assured by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan last year that our major demands, which include correction of an anomaly in the fixation of the initial payment as per the Sixth Central Pay Commission (CPC), and the abolishment of contractual appointments of nursing officers, would be soon accepted. However, nothing moved in the last one year," Kumar said."If we had not gone on strike, the hospital would have jeopardized our future by throwing us at the mercy of contracting agencies," he asserted.The nurses claimed that no dialogue has happened between the officials from the hospital and the nurses since the strike started. "They are just acting stubborn and assuming that our agitation would die down," said one of the protesting nurses, Indumati Singh, while speaking to IANS.Around 5,000 nurses of the AIIMS are on the indefinite strike. Their demands also include redressal of issues such as the abolishment of gender-based reservation in the recruiting process of nursing officers and contractual appointments, enhancement of hospital accommodation and cadre restructuring.The emergency services at the premier hospital have taken a hit and critical care patients have been abandoned given an ongoing strike.To control the situation, the administration had asked all the junior, resident and senior doctors to double up for the nurses who are currently on agitation.The officials from AIIMS informed IANS that the hospital may have to curtail its emergency services given the absence of nursing staff in the facility.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aiims-stabbed-us-in-back-onus-of-patient-care-on-them-nurses-184650
15-12-2020||Washington||US court terminates $100-million lawsuit against Modi, Shah||A US court has dismissed a $100-million lawsuit filed against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah after the litigants — a separatist Kashmir Khalistan outfit and two associates — failed to appear before it at two scheduled hearings.The suit was filed on September 19, 2019, days before Modi’s historic “Howdy, Modi!” event in Houston, Texas. It challenged the Indian Parliament’s decision on Jammu and Kashmir that abrogated the special privileges of the state and carved out two Union Territories and sought a compensation of $100 million from Modi, Shah and Lt Gen Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillon.Dhillon is currently serving as the Director-General Defence Intelligence Agency and Deputy Chief of Integrated Defence Staff under the Chief of Defence Staff.“Other than that attempted service,” Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front “have done nothing to prosecute this case”, and have now failed to appear at two duly set Scheduling Conferences, US District Court Southern District of Texas Judge Frances H Stacy said in his order dated October 6, and recommended that the case be dismissed.The case was terminated by Judge Andrew S Hanen of the US District Court in Texas on October 22.Apart from the Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front, the other two complainants have not been identified, other than the acronyms ‘TFK’ and ‘SMS’. The suing party was represented by separatist lawyer Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.The Indian Parliament passed legislation last year changing the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, modifying provisions that have been an obstacle to economic development and promoted a sense of separatism.Prime Minister Modi, accompanied by US President Donald Trump, had addressed a crowd of over 50,000 Indian-Americans at the “Howdy, Modi!” event in Houston on September 22, 2019.As per court records, Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front was able to serve the summons to Modi, Shah and Dhillon at the Indian Consulate in Houston on February 18, 2020.A conference was set by the court for August 2. A second conference was scheduled on October 6.Judge Stacy said that representatives of the Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front failed to appear for the conference as such he recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed. Two weeks later, Judge Hanen terminated the case. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-court-terminates-100-million-lawsuit-against-modi-shah-184648

His portrayal as a rapist, corrupt and drug dealer has diminished the place saints hold for Hindus,” Khandelwal contended in his petition.Khandelwal had earlier complained to the police, seeking registration of an FIR against the duo, but with the police refusing to lodge any case over his complaint, he had moved the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate with the same plea.With the ACJMM too dismissing his plea, Khandelwal approached the Jodhpur district and session judge challenging the ACJJM’s decision.The second season of “Aashram Chapter 2-The Dark Side” had been released on November 11, but the series has attracted condemnation for the controversial portrayal of Hindu saints in it.A social media campaign had also been launched terming it to be a malicious portrayal of Hindu religious culture and ‘ashrams’.Karni Sena had also sent a legal notice to the producers of the film.

Concerned citizens are urban naxals. Migrant labourers are Covid carriers. Rape victims are nobody. Protesting farmers are Khalistani.

Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Central Government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

15-12-2020||United Nations||Collaboration, not confusion, is best response to Covid pandemic: India at UN||India has said its vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting the COVID-19 crisis, which has highlighted gaps in global cooperation and underlined the need for the international community to respond to the pandemic with collaboration and not confusion.Addressing the UN General Assembly special session on COVID-19, Secretary (West) in India’s Ministry of External Affairs Vikas Swarup said on Monday that the ongoing coronavirus crisis had “laid bare” the gaps that existed in global cooperation and governance structures of multilateral organisations.“It is important that we make reformed multilateralism our guiding principle. It is imperative that we must join hands to show leadership, solidarity and collaboration to deal with the pandemic. We can respond best by collaboration, not confusion; preparation, not panic and coming together, not growing apart,” he said.“As a responsible member of the international community, I want to reiterate that India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis. India will also help all the countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capabilities for the delivery of vaccines,” Swarup said at the resumed special session.World leaders, top UN leadership and vaccine developers addressed the high-level special session early this month on COVID-19 and discussed the impact of the pandemic, as well as the multifaceted, coordinated response required to address the crisis.Swarup told the UN session that to combat the pandemic, India had several vaccines, which were under different stages of development.Indian vaccine candidates COVAXIN and ZyCoV-D are under phase three and phase two trials while Indian vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India is already conducting final testing of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca COVISHIELD vaccine, he said.“India is recognised as a world leader in vaccines, as we produce 60 per cent of vaccines globally and have a record of supplying high quality, affordable vaccines to the developing world,” he said.“During the unprecedented crisis faced by the world, India emerged as a net provider of health security and successfully shouldered its responsibility as the pharmacy of the world, sending consignments of medicines and medical supplies to almost 150 partner countries,” he said.Swarup stressed that while it was heartwarming to note that efforts to combat the pandemic had yielded positive results, there was still a long way to go.“No one is safe till everyone is safe. This should be our mantra. In this context, the role of the United Nations becomes important towards coordinated and concerted efforts to deal with the multi-dimensional impacts of the pandemic,” he said.Highlighting India’s “timely and proactive” response to the pandemic, Swarup said calculated measures by the country were designed not just to protect its huge population from the pandemic but also to ensure that minimal damage was caused to the economy.He said the initial phases of the lockdown gave India the critically needed time to ramp up its healthcare system and equip it with sufficient hospital beds, isolation facilities, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), testing kits and other medical devices as well as with trained medical staff across the country.“Within two months of the pandemic, India expanded its diagnostic facilities from just one major facility for pan-India testing to more than 2,000 today. From having almost no domestic manufacturing of PPE kits, India today has become the second-largest manufacturer of PPEs,” he added.“More than 17,000 dedicated COVID-19 facilities were set up with 1.6 million isolation beds and digital tools such as the Aarogya Setu app were developed and are being effectively used for extensive contact tracing,” he said.Swarup said the government had also been doing its best to ensure that the economy and the livelihoods of the people were not adversely hampered.The Narendra Modi government announced a massive $266 billion stimulus package, amounting to almost 10 per cent of India’s GDP directed at helping low-income groups, marginal farmers, small businesses, migrants and those in the informal sector.

The SC issued a notice to the Centre asking it to respond to a petition filed by Veena Sarin, a 94-year-old woman who urged it to declare the Emergency unconstitutional and grant her a compensation of Rs 25 crores after senior advocate Harish Salve, representing the petitioner, said he felt very strongly about the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1975-emergency-unconstitutional-sc-to-examine-plea-184576

Eight states have reported a rise across all markers of child malnutrition compared to the 2015-16 data. These are HP, Kerala, Telangana, Bengal, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura.The highest percentage of stunted children in India is still in Bihar (42.9 pc), followed by Gujarat (39 pc) and Karnataka (35.4 pc). Some high-burden states like MP have not been covered in the NFHS phase-1 survey and will gradually be reviewed.Bihar has, however, managed to reduce stunting rates by a meagre 5.4 pc (down from 48.3 pc to 42.9 pc in five years). Karnataka has reduced stunting proportions by a marginal 0.8 pc (36.2 pc to 35.4 pc).

It was held three days after the proposal was mooted by Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev during a virtual summit with PM Narendra Modi on December 11.Uzbekistan’s interest in using Chabahar Port marks a flexing point in India’s efforts to carve out a communication route to Afghanistan and Central India that outflanks Pakistan.Iran and Uzbekistan welcomed India’s proposal to hold “Chabahar Day” on the sidelines of the International Maritime Summit scheduled to be hosted by India next month, said an MEA statement.In an effort to drain out any political meaning from use of Chabahar Port for trade and transit purposes and enhanced regional connectivity, the trilateral was co-chaired by secretary-level officers from the respective transport or shipping ministries.The Indian side was led by Shipping Secretary Sanjeev Ranjan while Uzbek Deputy Minister of Transport D Dehkanov and Iranian Deputy Transport Minister of Shahram Adamnejad led their respective delegations.In this respect, the trilateral noted the significant role played by Chabahar port for the region to deliver humanitarian assistance during the Covid pandemic. This included 50,000 tonnes of foodgrain via the shortest roué to western Pashtun, Hazara and Uzbek dominated areas of Afghanistan.Uzbekistan is Central Asia’s most populous nation and has ample reserves of uranium, gold, coal and oil. Some of them could be exported from Chabahar or value added at an adjacent upcoming special economic zone to ports along the Indian Ocean.The subsequent rounds of trilaterals may see Tashkent considering greater involvement in a transportation link to the warm water port of Chabahar.First trilateral meeting||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-discusses-chabahar-ports-joint-usage-with-iran-uzbekistan-184539

The recent reforms have been undertaken with the best interests of farmers in mind,” he said.The Defence Minister, meanwhile, blamed “unprovoked aggression” by China for the LAC standoff. “In these testing times, our forces have shown exemplary courage and fought the PLA with utmost bravery and forced them to go back,” he said.On import of military equipment, he said, “It is not a very comforting fact that despite having one of the largest armed forces, we are dependent on imports in critical areas.

Our fight is against the black central legislations. If raising voice for the farmers is anti-national, I won’t mind being called one,” says the 75-year-old soldier-turned-farmer and the president of BKU (Ugrahan), Punjab’s biggest farmer union.Edit: Stop the name-callingUgrahan and thousands of his supporters were labelled “Maoists” in social media posts after hoardings supporting the jailed activists surfaced at a protest recently.“It’s not the first time we have raised voice for these jailed activists. Posters seeking their release were installed at toll plazas too over the past two months. All the 32 farmer unions are supporting this demand… Punjab has a rich tradition of speaking against injustice. We protested against the NRC as well,” he maintains.Busy charting future course with other leaders at the ‘gaushala’, three rooms of which have been turned into his union’s headquarters, Ugrahan says, “We run our office from a ‘gaushala’. They may find some Maoist link in this (cowshed) too.”Pointing towards another union leader, Shingara Singh Maan, he claims all their actions in the past over three decades have been for the betterment of farmers.“It’s the easiest way to get rid of the protesters. Call them anti-national to change public discourse! How can ‘annadata’, who feeds the nation, go against the nation? The ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ slogan seems to have been long forgotten,” he says. Ugrahan says though their struggle is solely against the three laws, the government fears that the “struggle that started with the farmers may definitely not end only with the farmers”. The BKU (Ugrahan), meanwhile, has expressed willingness to join the ‘Sanjha Kisan Morcha’ that represents 32 farm outfits. “We are ready to join them unconditionally. We (various unions) may have differences on some issues, but these cannot be bigger than the common cause of farmers,” says Joginder Singh Ugrahan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-maoist-connection-strictly-a-farmers-agitation-ugrahan-184504
