02-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Police file 2 chargesheets, names suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain||Suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain allegedly spent around Rs 1.10 crore to fund anti-CAA protests and the subsequent communal violence that rocked northeast Delhi in February, the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police said in a 1,030-page charge sheet filed at Karkardooma court on Tuesday.The police filed another chargesheet in connection with the clashes between pro- and anti-CAA protesters in Jafrabad on the night of February 23.A case of rioting was registered at the Khajuri Khas Police Station in which 15 people, including Hussain, were arrested for their alleged role in the riots that occurred at about 2.15 pm on February 24 outside the suspended AAP councillor’s house in Delhi’s Chand Bagh area.The police said during investigation, it emerged that there was a “deep-rooted conspiracy” to cause riots in Northeast Delhi and Hussain, an Aam Aadmi Party leader and sitting councillor in East Delhi Municipal Corporation, played a pivotal role in the incident.The chargesheet stated that Hussain allegedly transferred around Rs 1.10 crore from the accounts of companies owned by him to alleged fake companies. He received the amount in cash in the second week of January, 2020 through a chain of transactions and thereafter, distributed the money to anti-CAA protesters.Police also obtained the bank details of two companies owned by Hussain—Show Effect Advertising Pvt Ltd and Essence Cellcom Pvt Ltd—from HDFC Bank.The details were analysed to verify the disclosure made by Hussain regarding organising and distributing cash for anti-CAA protests and the riots, it said.According to the chargesheet, the bank account details showed six suspicious transactions from Essence Cellcom Pvt Ltd. amounting to Rs 92 lakh to two other accounts.“His (Hussain’s) another company Show Effect Advertising Pvt Ltd showed a transfer of Rs 20 lakh on January 8... All these chain of transactions are being investigated,” it said.According to the chargesheet, during interrogation Hussain admitted his involvement in the riots and also confessed that he was present on the terrace of his house during as violence broke out in the area around his house.Hussain was in touch with other anti-CAA protestors and had met Khalid Saifi of United Against Hate and JNU student leader Umar Khalid at the Shaheen Bagh protest site on January 8, it said.Saifi told Hussain to be prepared for “something big” at the time of the visit of US President Donald Trump and also said that he and other PFI members will help him financially. Saifi gave him some money for the preparations, the chargesheet said.A day prior to the riots on February 22, Hussain got his pistol released from Khajuri Khas Police Station but during interrogation couldn’t give a satisfactory reply as to why he did so, the police said in the chargesheet.He was connected to Saifi and Khalid who were part of a larger group of people responsible for organising riots and protests in Delhi, the chargesheet said.Several CCTV cameras were found installed in his house-cum-office and four DVRs (digital video recorder) were also recovered from there. But according to the Forensic Science Laboratory, no recording from February 23 to February 28, 2020 could be found on any DVR, it further said.“It means there was no data recorded either because the CCTVs were switched off or they were not in working condition. There is no recording of persons visiting him in his office or house prior to the commencement of riots/during the riots, as if he did not wish the events to be recorded,” the chargesheet said.“Absence of any recording in the DVRs proves that he deliberately did it to hide his activities prior to and during the riots,” it added.The chargesheet further said photos and videos obtained from two separate DVDs were analysed and it showed the destruction done by rioters at the scene of the crime.It also showed that Hussain’s house was left untouched by the rioters which indicates that the accused was leading and instigating the mob, the chargesheet claimed.“Recovery of crates containing glass bottles having some liquid filled in them and their necks stuffed with pieces of cloth, which were used/ to be used as Molotov cocktails, large number of bricks and stone pieces and three catapults from the house of accused Tahir Hussain further point towards the conspiracy and the extent of preparation for causing riots in the area,” it said.As per his disclosure statement during police remand, one pistol with extra magazine and 24 live cartridges, one mobile phone were recovered from him on March 7.On March 11, 40 live cartridges and 22 empty cartridges were also recovered. However, he didn’t give any satisfactory explanation when asked about the empty cartridges, it stated.“He purchased 100 cartridges on his license but only 64 live cartridges and 22 empty cartridges were recovered. During interrogation, he was unable to give satisfactory reply for the remaining 14 live cartridges and use of 22 empty shells,” mentions the chargesheet.On the instance of Hussain, two brothers Liyakat Ali and Riyasat Ali were arrested and during interrogation they disclosed their involvement in the riots, the chargesheet said.The chargesheet further mentioned that Riyasat actively participated in looting and burning of the parking of one Pradeep, who lives adjacent to Hussain and the brothers divided the cash among themselves.The chargesheet further said, “Pradeep’s parking was inspected by the FSL and crime team. Out of 44 vehicles, 14 were burnt and 18 were damaged. The photos and videos were taken. It showed that Pradeep’s parking was being destroyed by the rioters but they left Hussain’s place untouched.”“During the course of investigation, Hussain’s step brother Shah Alam was arrested along with other accused - Mohd Shadab, Mohd Abid, Rashid Saifi. They all disclosed that they had actively participated in the riots on the directions of Hussain,” police said.Saifi was arrested on February 26 in another case of rioting at Jagatpuri, Shahdara District, police said.A total of three SITs have been constituted by the crime branch to investigate 59 cases which include murders and some important incidents of riots which occurred in February.Meanwhile, the second chargesheet filed was in connection with the Jafrabad rioting case which happened near Jafrabad Metro station.According to police, 12 people, including Pinjra Tod activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, were also arrested in this case. They were actively involved in hatching the conspiracy to cause riots near Jafrabad metro station, police said.They were also part of a larger conspiracy and were found to be connected to the ‘India Against Hate’ group and Umar Khalid, police said.One Aman had died due to the gunshot injury in the incident and a total of 35 empty cartridges were recovered from the spot, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-police-file-2-chargesheets-names-suspended-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain-93511

Earlier in the day, Trump phoned Russian President Valdimir Putin and Australian PM Scott Morrison to invite them for the summit. Putin gave no indication of accepting the invitation while both Modi and Morrison have agreed to attend the summit. Trump is yet to speak to South Korean President.While postponing the summit to September, Trump had called the G-7 outdated and suggested it be expanded to include four more countries – India, Australia, South Korea and Russia.In the conversation with Modi, he conveyed his desire to expand the grouping to include other important countries including India. “In this context, he extended an invitation to Prime Minister Modi to attend the next G-7 Summit to be held in the US,” stated an official news release.Trump’s plan to include the four countries has already run into problems both from his allies as well as China which it intends to isolate by expanding G-7. The UK and Canada are opposed to the inclusion of Russia while Germany and France are ambivalent. China had opposed the entire expansion move.“Targeting China and leaving Beijing out of important circles will not win trust. This is not in the interests of the countries,” said Chinese Foreign Office spokesperson Zhao Lijian.PM Modi commended Trump for his “creative and far-sighted approach” and acknowledged that an expanded forum would be in keeping with the emerging realities of the post-Covid world. “The PM said India would be happy to work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed Summit,” said the release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-accepts-trump-invite-for-g-7-summit-93504

In case, a student is presently staying in a district in which there is no CBSE-affiliated school, an exam centre in neighbouring district will be allotted. In the containment zone, no examination centre will be permitted,” the board said in an official order.“In case of schools falling in containment zones as on date, examination centre of the students of these schools will be allotted outside the containment zone,” it said.“Change of centre in the same district will not be allowed. Delhi will be considered as one district for this purpose hence change of examination centre from one district of Delhi to another district of Delhi will not be permitted,” it added.The board said it will accept requests of candidates for change of examination centre only through their schools.“It will be the responsibility of the school to contact their students to know whether they have shifted to some other district and would like to avail the facility of changing the examination centre to their present district of stay in India, and thereafter, to provide the information to CBSE.“Request in any other mode will not be entertained by the Board. Schools will process the genuine requests made by their students and will recommend to the CBSE for change of district for appearing in the examinations as per rule,” it said.While the Class 12 exams will be conducted across the country, the Class 10 exams are only pending in North East Delhi. The exams could not be conducted in the national capital’s district due to the law-and-order situation in the wake of protests against the amended citizenship law.The CBSE said candidates who were studying in India and have shifted to other countries can appear for the exams from any district of India.“These candidates will also make a request to their schools. No examination in other countries will be conducted by CBSE for such candidates. Their result will be declared as per the assessment scheme to be decided by the board,” it said.“Result in respect of the subjects whose examinations will not be conducted by the board will also be declared as per assessment scheme to be decided,” it said.The CBSE further said: “In case children with special needs availing the facility of scribe do not wish to appear in the forthcoming examination because of noncompliance of social distancing norms, their result will be declared as per the assessment scheme to be decided by the board”.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of a slew of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.A 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day.The board had announced last month that it will only conduct the pending exams in 29 subjects, which are crucial for promotion and admission to higher educational institutions.The modalities of assessment for the subjects for which the exams are not being conducted will soon be announced by the board.The schedule for the board exams has been decided in order to ensure that they are completed before competitive examinations. While engineering entrance exam JEE-Mains is scheduled to be held from July 18 to 23, medical entrance exam NEET is scheduled for July 26.

02-06-2020||New Delhi||Sabrina plans to start foundation in sister Jessica Lal’s memory||Sabrina Lal, who fought a long legal battle to bring her sister Jessica Lal’s killer to book, plans to start a foundation in the memory of her sister and help women in similar situations get justice.She says she has forgiven her sister’s killer, Manu Sharma, who walked out of jail on June 1 after the Delhi Sentence Review Board recommended his premature release. Siddharth Vashisht, better known as Manu Sharma, was serving life sentence in Tihar Jail here for the 1999 murder. “I really do not have anything to say. I am not feeling anything. I feel numb. The only thing I hope and pray to God is that he never thinks of repeating that mistake again,” Sabrina told PTI on Tuesday. She had in 2018 written to the jail authorities that she had no objection to Sharma’s release. “I wrote that I had no objection to his release. It was a long and arduous fight... It was very difficult. It is not easy to go back to a normal life.“After he (Sharma) was convicted, one started feeling better about oneself and there was a load lifted that at least justice had been served. It takes years… it does not happen quickly,” she says. But has she forgiven him?“You have to forgive. If you hold on to hate and revenge, you cannot move on. Forgiveness is something you have to feel. You can never forget, but you need to forgive at some point,” comes the reply. “This journey is now 21 years old. You cannot live in that situation for long. You just have to come to terms with the fact that you have to forgive someone who did something really horrible to your family,” she adds. Sabrina notes that it is crucial to get out of the rut and get back to normalcy.“You need to have the strength of mind and will power to do so,” she says.        Sabrina became a beacon of hope for many in their quest for justice when the circumstances looked hostile. She, however, says that she tries to run away from the spotlight as much as possible.For Sabrina, spirituality and her belief in God helped her forgive the killer of her beloved sister. Even though it has been long, Sabrina says, she remembers her sister every day and plans to start a foundation in her memory.“We are thinking of opening Jessica Lal Foundation where we want to help women, empower them and do something meaningful and help other people in the same situation,” she says. Calling Jessica her closest friend-cum-sister, Sabrina says she misses her sister’s presence in her life every day.“She was jovial and positive in life. It is not just birthdays and death anniversaries that I miss her, it is every day. I have lots of pictures of hers in my home and not that I need them to miss her, but they are there to remind me of her,” she adds.Manu Sharma, son of former Union minister Venod Sharma, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in December 2006 for killing Jessica Lal in 1999.A trial court had acquitted him, but the high court reversed the order. The Supreme Court later upheld his life sentence in April 2010. Jessica Lal was shot dead by Sharma after she refused to serve him liquor at the Tamarind Court restaurant owned by socialite Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi’s Mehrauli area on the night of April 30, 1999.

All these events overlap as a ‘compound event’ on a rising sea level in the background,” Koll said.“IMD has forecast a moderate cyclone strengthening up to 100 kmph. It’s not just the direct impact of the winds that we need to worry about. Forecasts indicate heavy rains up to 200 mm and INCOIS has forecast storm surges with waves of 3-6 meters as Nisarga approaches landfall,” he added.According to the scientist, the city’s natural defences like mangroves and rivers have been “squeezed out .... for expanding roads, buildings, and the airport.Hence when heavy rains lash over a city like Mumbai which has lost its flood plains and defences, the flooding gets prolonged...”Koll citing a recent assessment by scientists at Mumbai’s Indian Institute of Technology said the city’s floods were more of a management problem.“We need early warning systems that integrate the multiple climatic elements and human demographics and land use — and we need flood management policies to be implemented,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-coinciding-with-high-tide-will-devastate-mumbai-says-expert-93479

China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbours rather than resolve conflicts according to international law,” said Congressman Eliot Engel who is also the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.Not too long back, Engel was critical of the CAA and NRC as well as the lockdown in Kashmir.“Countries must all abide by the same set of rules so that we don’t live in a world where ‘might makes right’. I strongly urge China to respect norms and use diplomacy and existing mechanisms to resolve its border questions with India,” added the statement issued by Engel.Pompeo spoke on China’s all-round aggression for the second day in succession. “The recent Chinese actions be it on the India border, or Hong Kong or the South China Sea, have been part of the Chinese behaviour in the recent past. We’ve seen over the past number of years continued Chinese building of their military capabilities, and then more aggressive action. I mentioned India. You’ve mentioned the South China Sea,” he said in a podcast interview.Pompeo’s earlier comments on the same lines were made a day earlier in an interview to Fox TV.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bipartisan-us-support-for-india-over-lac-stand-off-with-china-93471

List after fifteen days,” the Bench said in its order.The Bench took note of the submission of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the high court order of May 27, seeking production of the records of trial court was patently without jurisdiction.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) in its plea alleged that the high court in its order erroneously continues to entertain the interim bail application of an accused, who is charged by an authority outside its territorial jurisdiction and is in judicial custody vide a valid jurisdictional remand order passed by special judge (NIA) Mumbai (which is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court).It sought setting aside of the May 27 order of the high court and claimed that the top court had already adjudicated the issue of medical health of Navlakha and declined him the relief by its order on April 8.The probe agency has also questioned the maintainability of the Navlakha’s bail plea before the high court and pointed out that the accused is being prosecuted for offences under IPC and UAPA and thus the bail application would lie before the special court under the NIA Act.It pointed out that the Delhi High Court also lacked the territorial jurisdiction to pass directions as the FIR by NIA pertaining to the Bhima Koregaon case was registered on January 24 at Mumbai.On May 27, the high court had pulled up the NIA for acting in “unseemly haste” in taking away Navlakha, from the national capital to Mumbai even when his interim bail plea was pending here.It said there was an evident haste shown by the NIA in moving pleas across Mumbai and Delhi over weekends and Gazetted holidays (Eid) and obtaining orders by e-mail, and “whisking away” Navlakha to Mumbai, which has rendered these proceedings infructuous.Navlakha, who had surrendered before the NIA on April 14 in pursuance to the apex court’s direction and was lodged in Tihar jail, was taken to Mumbai by train on May 26.“While ordinarily this court would not see too much cause for hurry in this case, in view of the inexplicable, frantic hurry shown by the NIA in moving the applicant from Delhi to Mumbai while this matter was pending and the NIA had itself sought time to file status report, this court does get a sense that all proceedings in this jurisdiction would be rendered utterly infructuous if an element of urgency is not brought to bear on the present proceedings,” the high court had said.The high court had noted that on the last date it had granted adequate time to the NIA to file its status report in response to the interim bail plea and the agency has filed an affidavit opposing the plea.It had earlier sought response of the NIA on a plea by 67-year-old Navlakha who had said that given his advanced age, he was vulnerable to catching coronavirus or other infections, especially in a crowded environment like prison. Navlakha had told the court that while the interim bail plea was pending, on May 23, NIA has requested the special judge (NIA) Delhi to extend his judicial custody till June 22 and on May 24, a Sunday, an application was filed by the agency before Special Judge (NIA), Mumbai seeking his production warrants.He had said warrants were issued for his production before the Special Judge (NIA), Mumbai and an application was also moved before concerned Jail Superintendent at Tihar Jail on May 25, being a Gazetted holiday for EID, seeking a transit order to shift Navlakha from Delhi to Mumbai.The high court directed the Investigating Officer (IO) to file before it an affidavit on the lines of response given by him and a copy of the proceedings relating to production warrants by the Mumbai court.Tihar Jail Superintendent was also directed to provide a copy of the last medical status report of Navlakha and listed the matter for June 3.In August 2018, Navlakha was arrested by the Pune Police from his Delhi residence following the violence at Koregaon Bhima village in Pune district on January 1, 2018. The transit remand order was, however, set aside by the Delhi High Court.

02-06-2020||---||Unemployment rate in India falls in May, but decent jobs a distant dream||New Delhi, June 2Although unemployment rate still remains above the 20 per cent mark, the total number of employed in India increased by 2.1 crore during the month of May, according to data released on Tuesday by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).The biggest addition of 1.44 crore jobs was in the categories of small traders and wage labourers. As many as 55 lakh businesspeople returned to their jobs in May.The month of June is likely to generate more jobs report because in the last week of May, the unemployment rate fell to 20.2 per cent – the lowest unemployment rate recorded since the imposition of the lockdown. However, most of the initial improvements will be of poor quality jobs.The sole segment that did not see any increase in jobs was that of the salaried employees which declined from 6.84 crore in April to 6.83 crore in May as compared to 8.6 crore in 2019-20.“Salaried jobs are relatively difficult to get. And, salaried jobs lost during a lockdown are far more difficult to recover. These are also the better jobs. The continued loss of good quality jobs is therefore worrisome,” noted CMIE.Another worrisome trend was that jobs were not generated for 25-29 year olds who principally seek better quality jobs. The partial lifting has so far brought back informal jobs of the self-employed. “Salaried jobs will increase in a meaningful sense only when investments increase. This is a distant dream,” said its analyst.Though the job market improved over the April situation when nearly 12.2 crore were unemployed, the figures for May show that over 10 crore people are still out of jobs. The employment market in April was 28.20 crore which has risen to 30.3 crore in May as the lockdown was being gradually eased.In comparison, employment in 2019-20 averaged 40.40 crore people.“While the main labour market metrics indicate an improvement in May compared to April, the labour market conditions still remain much weaker than they were before the lockdown,” said CMIE.The reason was that a number of people who had left the active labour markets in April returned back in May. Those who had left the labour market in April had parked themselves in the passive unemployed category – they were unemployed and willing to work but not actively looking for jobs.In May, many small traders were back as were some wage labourers. These segments account for about a third of the total employed population and 71 per cent of them had lost jobs in April. As the economy has been opening up gradually in parts of the country, these are back to their business. Since these are predominantly self-employed persons it was relatively easy for them to resume work when conditions permit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unemployment-rate-in-india-falls-in-may-but-decent-jobs-a-distant-dream-93467

Patients from the 200-bed hospital near Dharavi, too, have been relocated as these areas could get flooded,” a state government official said.“As per the Chief Minister’s directions, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is taking utmost care to protect the COVID facility created at the BKC. It can sustain wind velocity of 80 to 100 kmph only,” the MMRDA, which set up the facility, said in a post on Twitter.According to the agency, 150 patients were admitted at the facility.The MMRDA added that it was putting up sandbags to strengthen the pillars of the facility. In addition to it, electricity, AC and oxygen facility would be turned off during the cyclone to prevent fire, according to the agency.Residents of several fishing hamlets, known as ‘koliwadas’, which were declared containment zones, are being moved to higher ground.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s ward officers, who were busy setting up hospital facilities and enforcing containment in slum pockets norms, are now working on relocating people from the low-lying areas.Civic officials say they were worried about gusty winds tripping up power lines which may cause machines at hospitals to shut down.The civic-owned BEST, which supplies power to South Mumbai, said it had created a team of standby engineers to ensure that power supply was not disrupted to hospitals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-disrupts-war-against-covid-19-in-mumbai-93464

The incident took place after a detonator being placed to break a boulder burst at the state-owned Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) in Peddapalli district this morning.According sources, a group of workers, employed by a private contractor were placing detonators to break big boulders at the mine when the blast occurred. The blast killed four workers on the spot and three others suffered serious injuries. The mishap took place in open cast-1 mine."Four workers have died and three others seriously injured in the incident. Rescue operation is on, while the bodies of the dead have been shifted to the local hospital for post-mortem," the police said in a statement.Among the injured, one person is said to be serious.The Director General of Mines Safety will soon conduct an inquiry into the incident and ascertain whether the contractor had sufficiently trained the manpower to handle explosives.“It apparently appears to be (a case of) handling of explosives by people not trained to do so,” said the local police.Meanwhile, Hyderabad MP and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Asaduddin Owaisi expressed shock at the accident and extended condolences at the death of the labourers. He also appealed to the government to provide adequate compensation to the kin of the deceased and to the injured.Owaisi blames Centre for migrant crisisFurther commenting on the migrant issues he said the handling of the situation was "unplanned and hasty" by the Central Government.Owaisi said the BJP-led government at the Centre was responsible for the plight of migrant labourers and that the guest workers should have been sent back home in March last week when the COVID-19 cases were less in number and the virus was less virulent.About the lockdown he said, "I have been consistently criticising the lockdown because it is unconstitutional. If you read the Constitution, under the state's list, the states are responsible for law and order. The Government of India and the Modi government violated the seventh schedule of the Constitution. They cannot use the National Disaster Management Act to dictate to the state governments. It is very unfortunate why the chief ministers accept this unconstitutional diktat of the Modi government," Owaisi added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-killed-in-peddapalli-coal-mine-blast-93460

We have again found that in 73 per cent deaths there were co morbid conditions and pre-existing burden of diabetes, hypertension, respiratory illness and heart conditions,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said as India’s daily case load grew by 8,170 cases to touch 1.98 lakh.The government advised precautions of masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing and said India’s COVID mortality is among the lowest in the world.As against global case fatality rate of 6.9 per cent India’s rate is just 2.8 per cent. It has reduced from 3.30 per cent on April 15.Recovery rate has similarly improved from 11.42 per cent on April 15 to 48.07 per cent today.Out of total 1.98 lakh cases currently 97,581 are active and 95,526 have been discharged.The government also said India’s performance should be seen in terms of its population.Fourteen nations which have the population equal to India have 22.5 per cent more cases than us and 55.2 times more deaths, Agarwal said.ICMR said India was far from the disease peak due to the preventive measures that were taken.“You will know where we stand once the results of ICMR launched community survey is out next week,” said the council.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/half-of-indias-covid-deaths-in-10-pc-population-country-far-away-from-peak-govt-93458
02-06-2020||New Delhi||Govt likely to issue draft defence production and export promotion policy soon||A draft defence production and export promotion policy were likely to be issued within a month, the Centre said on Tuesday, noting that this would give a major push to the ‘Make in India’ programme.“We are currently in the process of drafting the defence production and export promotion policy and hopefully, within a month or so, we would like to put it in the public domain for seeking your feedback and comments which will be covering all aspects of what Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on May 16,” Defence Production Secretary Raj Kumar said during a webinar attended by various defence companies.On May 16, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a series of initiatives to promote indigenous defence production which included making separate budgetary outlay to procure Indian-made military hardware, increasing FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route and generating a year-wise negative list of weapons whose import won't be allowed.Kumar said: “In addition to indigenisation, to give a push to ‘Make in India’, to seek substitute of imported items, all those and number of those other similar things will be there as a part of the defence production and export promotion policy.”“The idea is that in the process of indigenisation, there is a possibility where the investment per se may not be justified. There may be a need for some kind of capital subsidy. We are looking into that aspect. Once the policy is put into the public domain, we will seek your feedback and views,” he further explained.Currently, the size of the domestic defence industry is of the order of $12 billion. Out of which, 80 per cent is the share of the defence public sector units (DPSUs) and 20 per cent is of the private sector.“We expect the turnover of the domestic defence industry to go up to USD 25 billion by 2025,” Kumar said during the webinar that was organised by PHD Chamber of Commerce.“This can only happen if we make conscious efforts to minimise imports beginning with the negative list of imports, realistic GSQRs (General Staff Service Quality Requirements), provide enough budgetary support for domestic procurement,” he said.There was a focus within the government on indigenisation of imported items, including materials, said the Secretary of the Department of Defence Production.A committee convened by PHD Chamber of Commerce and headed by Midhani CMD S K Jha on the matter of substitution of defence imports listed out various important issues for our consideration, he said.“They have pointed out that pre-qualification testing takes a lot of time and involves a substantial expenditure. They have mentioned that attention needs to be given on the issue of long-term supply contracts to indigenous manufacturers,” Kumar said.“The single biggest point that I saw in that committee’s report was related to the non-availability of the technical specifications (for defence materials and products) that becomes a bigger drawback,” he added.What we basically now needed was technology, volume, viability and certification capability in house, that was within the country, he said.“I would like to list out the steps that we need to take. The first and foremost step we need to take is to develop technical specifications in collaboration with research institutions and labs, followed by the development of manufacturing processes. In case of certain identified materials, we plan to adopt a mission mode approach led by the DRDO,” he said.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) works under the Ministry of Defence only.“Secondly, make one procedure under Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) to develop these identified materials with the support of the government,” Kumar noted.“Thirdly, we should develop testing and certification facilities. So, we will like to set up a task force under the Directorate of Standardisation for developing these testing and certification facilities in the country,” he said.Also, India should try for import of technology under ‘transfer of technology’ route or through inter-governmental agreements to FDI route, especially in those cases where we had got domestic manufacturing capability but the technology was not available at this point of time, he said.

It is also necessary to study as to how the virus jumped species and affected human population. The study of ground zero is also imperative to understand the cause of the spread of the virus and develop effective ways to prevent the spread of similar diseases in the future,” the petition submitted.It said considering the deadly nature of COVID19 for those with underlying medical conditions and the fact that it was likely to affect almost 70 per cent of the entire population in due course, assessing reports from ground zero (Wuhan) was important.While rest of the world has been hit badly by the pandemic, China successfully managed to control and restrict the virus to Wuhan, allowing the authorities to reopen the wet markets based on certain statistics and indicators, it said.The PIL said India should ask China to share information on epidemiology, evolution of the virus as also full clinical and other data with relevant indicators.Maintaining that it was not for blame game, the petitioner said diplomatic channels should be used to get information on the RNA sequence of various strains and mutations found by China in the vicinity of Wuhan—the place COVID-19 reportedly originated from.WHO should be probed and called out by India for delay in notifying the global community of the severity of COVID19 and declaring it as a pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctors-for-you-moves-sc-for-direction-to-centre-to-seek-full-covid19-data-from-china-93448

02-06-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown derails livelihood, porters seek work to put life back on track||Trains may be getting back on track but not the lives of rail porters, scrambling for work after the lockdown in March slammed the brakes on their livelihoods and derailed their already precarious existence.Imprinted in middle-class India’s institutional memory with their red shirts and copper armbands, the band of mostly men who carry heavy bags on their heads and shoulders as they nimbly navigate steep staircases and crowded stations is teetering on the brink of poverty and hunger.Their lives were once the stuff of tinsel romanticism — remember the 1983 Amitabh Bachchan film “Coolie” — but those days have faded away much like the trademark red of their uniforms now dulled to ash brick, said Sube Singh, who has been working as a porter for four decades.“We have been surviving on chutney-roti or sometimes salt and roti. The landlord did not waive the rent. I do not have a ration card and I am living on borrowed money but for how long?” a despairing Singh asked.“I have never seen such times in my entire 40 years as a coolie,” the 60-year-old, who lives in a rented room near the New Delhi Railway Station with a family of five, told PTI.Several porters outside the station said they had not earned a rupee since the trains stopped on March 24, a day before the lockdown to curtail the spread of COVID-19 started on March 25.They were the first to lose their livelihoods and have no hopes of earning enough even after the railways on Monday resumed services on key routes. The railways had started Shramik Special trains and a few other special trains last month.Though many porters have bought sanitisers and gloves with their own money, the fear of contracting COVID-19 is keeping people away, they said. And many passengers would rather just wheel their strollers and bags, making a porter’s job redundant.During the lockdown, several porters left the city, walking, cycling or bussing it to their homes, and some were stranded in Delhi without any help.Shabbir Ahmed, also 60-like Sube Singh, was one of those who left Delhi to go to Moradabad and returned from his home, hoping to make some money. But he now regrets his decision.“I returned with the hope of getting work as some trains are running again. I had to borrow money to feed my family. I come to the station in the morning and till evening can’t get a single customer,” he said.“People are scared of taking our service as they fear infection. We are taking full precautions though,” Ahmed added.Several porters complained that they got no monetary help from the government or from any NGO.There are over 20,000 licensed coolies across the country. In Delhi, 1,478 work at New Delhi Railway Station, around 1,000 at the Old Delhi station, 500 to 600 at Hazrat Nizamuddin and 97 at the Anand Vihar Terminal.About 25 to 30 porters returned to work at the New Delhi station after the Shramik Special trains were announced last month.Chandra Prakash, who has been working as a porter for 12 years at the New Delhi station, said they bought masks and sanitisers from their own money.“We had to do that because who will look after us if we fall ill. We don’t have any medical benefits or insurance,” he said.Several of those working at the New Delhi station live in rented accommodation in Paharganj nearby. About six to seven share a small room, paying about Rs 6,000 per month.“We are hardworking daily wagers and we can’t beg on roads. We want work,” said Prakash.Before the lockdown, their day would begin at 5 am and go on till late night after the last train left the station, giving them earnings of Rs 500 to 700 a day. Now, an entire day may yield Rs 100 or so for some lucky ones among them or nothing at all.“Everyone is talking about the plight of migrant labourers but nobody cares for us. We are also daily wagers,” said an angry Bhim Singh.“The railways had asked for our personal details, Aadhar card number and bank account number on April 15. I submitted details of around 900 porters online on April 27. One month has passed but we have not got any financial help,” he added.According to him, more than 20 per cent coolies at the New Delhi station are above 55.“How will they survive. They desperately need help,” Bhim Singh added.His co-worker Ramkesh agreed.“Almost all coolies are now debt-ridden... we urgently need some monetary help till we get normal work,” he said.Coolies are not railway employees. They get some concessions for travelling in trains and two sets of uniform but not a salary. Porters have to pay Rs 120 a year as licence fees to work at stations.The concessions include one complimentary travel pass as well as a privilege ticket order (PTO) for the porter and spouse in second or sleeper class once a year. The PTO enables the coolie to travel at one third the normal fare.Asked about the plight of the porters, a senior Northern Railways official said work would soon get normal with more trains running.“The Railways has been providing free food at many stations. Now more trains have resumed from June 1 so they will start getting normal work soon,” he said.The porters are waiting for his words to come true.

The entire system is likely to go out of hands of common advocates," BCI had alleged.Now CBI's grievance has found favour with SCAORA whose members alone can file a case in the top court on behalf of a litigant.Listing the difficulties encountered by advocates in effectively presenting their cases in virtual hearings, SCAORA urged the CJI to consider imposing various conditions, including limiting the number of lawyers for a particular case, for the safety of all concerned."Most lawyers (almost 95%) are not comfortable with the Virtual Court hearings. The common feedback seems to be that the lawyers are unable to present their cases effectively in the Virtual medium and the same is acting as a major deterrent for lawyers to consent for such virtual hearings," the letter read.“Many lawyers are not well equipped with knowledge on the use of computers and hence they are unable to participate in the process effectively...There are still several lawyers who are outside Delhi/NCR and in their respective hometowns, not having access to their files and thus unable to participate effectively in Virtual Court hearings, SCAORA said.   It also complained about problems with audio and video quality of hearings due to which lawyers were unable to effectively put forth their arguments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/most-lawyers-not-comfortable-with-virtual-court-hearings-says-scaora-93439

02-06-2020||New Delhi||Adesh Gupta replaces Manoj Tiwari as Delhi BJP president||Former North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Adesh Kumar Gupta was on Tuesday appointed as president of the Delhi State BJP unit by party chief JP Nadda.Gupta replaced actor-turned-politician Manoj Tiwari under whom the BJP unsuccessfully contested the high-profile Delhi Assembly elections earlier this year.Party leaders insisted Tiwari’s term was over long ago and that the change in guard should not be seen in connection with the BJP’s humiliating loss at the hands of AAP. Though the buzz is Tiwari offered to resign after the defeat and was asked to continue until an alternative was found.The appointment of Gupta, a relatively low-profile leader in comparison to Tiwari, who had been brought in keeping in mind the 'poorvanchali' voters, came as a surprise to many.Sources say top Delhi leaders, including Vijay Goel and Parvesh Verma, had been trying to get “their own person” for the top job. However, the central leadership was of the opinion that a “complete overhaul” is the only way to revive the party unit in Delhi, rife with factionalism and groupism.Originally belonging to Kannuj, UP, Gupta is someone who BJP Delhi cadres and supporters see as a "pure Delihite” unlike Tiwari. Plus, he belongs to the ‘bania’ community like the BJP’s chief rival in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party.BJP presidents in Delhi have mostly been either from the ‘bania’ community or ‘Punjabis’.Even though Gupta is a relatively unknown name, party supporters, especially those from the business community called his appointment a good move. The Municipal Corporation elections are due in Delhi in 2022, giving Gupta a good two years to strengthen the BJP's connect with the business community and Delhi voters.Being associated with the ABVP, Sangh's student wing, he is "someone from the organisation" and his appointment has the approval of former party president Amit Shah who led the Delhi campaign from the front and knows its situation well.Currently a councillor, Gupta's name was proposed by party's Delhi in charge and vice president Shyam Jaju. He fits the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah style of functioning “who believe in making a complete change” when things go as bad as they were in Delhi, a state that has been out of reach of the saffron party since more than two decades now, say the sources.For Chhattisgarh, Nadda has selected former Union Minister Vishnu Deo Sai. Sources say his name was approved after discussing with State leaders. Sai too is considered close to the central organisation and also former Chief Minister Raman Singh. Meanwhile, Prof S Tikendra Singh is the new chief of the BJP state unit in Manipur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/adesh-gupta-replaces-manoj-tiwari-as-delhi-bjp-president-93435

The local band with which I used to work also ran out of business and we faced losses. My son and I got fed up of just sitting at home and decided to dig a well to solve the water problem," he said.While Devake used to dig the ground, his teenage son Pankaj would go down in the pit to clear up the mud."I used to fill mud in a bucket and my father pulled it up. We went like this 16 feet down and now we have water here," the son said.Devake said both of them worked on the project for three to four days and were able to create a water source in their own residential premises."Now, my children can fetch water from the well whenever they need," he said happily.

After its passage, the farmers will have to pay a monthly power tariff of Rs five to six thousand, while subsidised domestic consumers will have to pay at least Rs eight to ten rupees per unit for consumption of up to 300 units per month.The Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 has been notified by the Ministry of Power at a time when all forms of meetings, interactions, discussions and protests are choked.VK Gupta spokesperson of All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) confirmed that the power sector employees and engineers exercised their democratic right by wearing black badges and holding gate meetings across the country.The bill notified on April 17 proposes some policy amendments and functional amendments to the Electricity Act of 2003.“The Central Government has violated the concurrent status of electricity to states by dictating on cross-subsidy, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to farmers and BPL consumers, setting up of ECEE (electricity Tribunal) and dictating on franchising of electricity distribution. Further, the government has moved one step ahead and issued orders to privatise the electricity systems of UTs,” said officials of the AIPEF.The policy of cross-subsidy was introduced to provide electricity to citizens and farmers at cheaper rates as compared to commercial and industrial consumers. Now to abolish the cross-subsidy in a time-bound manner and proposing a Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to such consumers, the state governments will take away the rights of access to electricity for them.“The Centre seeks to usurp this right of states which is totally unacceptable. It is unwise to bring legislation that would virtually finish the state sector and make the entire power supply sector dependent on private companies,” said power engineers who have been opposing the move.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/electricity-employees-and-engineers-protest-against-amendment-bill-93381
02-06-2020||Washington||Top US lawmaker slams 'Chinese aggression' against India, urges Beijing to 'respect norms'||Terming China a "bully", a top American lawmaker has voiced concern over the "Chinese aggression" against India, urging Beijing to "respect norms" and use diplomacy and existing mechanisms to resolve its border standoff with New Delhi."I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border," said Congressman Eliot Engel, Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.Also read: Chinese forces moved up to north of India along LAC, says Mike Pompeo"China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbours rather than resolve conflicts according to international law," he said.Engel's comments have come in the backdrop of the continuing standoff between the militaries of India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC)."Countries must all abide by the same set of rules so that we don't live in a world where 'might makes right'. I strongly urge China to respect norms and use diplomacy and existing mechanisms to resolve its border questions with India," Engel said in a statement.The statement comes a day after China said that the overall situation at the border with India was "stable and controllable", and both the countries have "unimpeded" communication channels to resolve the issues through dialogue and consultations."China has been implementing the consensus between the two countries' leaders. We have been committed to upholding our national sovereignty, security as well as stability along the border"."Now the overall situation in our border areas is stable and controllable. We have unimpeded communication channels and we hope and believe through dialogue and consultations we can properly resolve the relevant issue," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing.He was responding to a question on Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's remarks that India will not let its "pride be hurt" in its latest border flare-up with China but is determined to settle the dispute through talks between the giant neighbours."I want to assure the country that we will not let India's pride be hurt in any circumstances," Singh said in an interview to a news channel on Sunday.India on Wednesday said it was engaged with China to peacefully resolve the border row."We are engaged with the Chinese side to peacefully resolve it," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, replying to questions at an online media briefing.Both India and China have rejected US President Donald Trump's offer to mediate to settle the current standoff between the militaries of the two countries."The two sides have established mechanisms both at military and diplomatic levels to resolve situations which may arise in border areas peacefully through dialogue and continue to remain engaged through these channels," Srivastava said.Troops of India and China were engaged in a major standoff for over three weeks in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh, in what is turning out to be the biggest confrontation between the two countries after the Doklam episode in 2017.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.

02-06-2020||Washington||Chinese forces moved up to north of India along LAC, says Mike Pompeo||China has moved up its forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday, asserting that authoritarian regimes take these kinds of actions.Several areas along the LAC in Ladakh and North Sikkim have witnessed major military build-up by both the Indian and Chinese armies recently, in a clear signal of escalating tension and hardening of respective positions by the two sides even two weeks after they were engaged in two separate face-offs.Also read: Top US lawmaker slams 'Chinese aggression' against India, urges Beijing to 'respect norms'"We see even today increasing forces of China moved up to the north of India on the Line of Actual Control there on the Indian border," Pompeo told Marc Thiessen and Danielle Pletka of AEI's 'What The Hell Is Going On' Podcast.The Communist Party of China (CPC) continues to hide and obfuscate and delay the global response to the coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan. It has taken actions destroying the amazing freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, he said."Those are just two pieces of the behaviour of this regime of the Chinese Communist Party. The nature and the activity that they're undertaking, the continued efforts to steal intellectual property, to advance in the South China Sea," he said.Pompeo said that these are the kinds of actions that authoritarian regimes take, and they have a real impact not only on the Chinese people there in China and Hong Kongers in Hong Kong, but a real impact on people all around the world."The United States has a responsibility and the capability to push back against that, ensure that the American people are properly served by a foreign policy that recognises the threats that emanate from China today," he said.Responding to a question, Pompeo said that the recent Chinese actions be it on the India border, or Hong Kong or the South China Sea, have been part of the Chinese behaviour in the recent past."It's not just over the past six months. We've seen over the past number of years continued Chinese build out of their military capabilities, and then continually more aggressive action. I mentioned India. You've mentioned the South China Sea."We see this same kind of things with them attempting to build ports around the world as part of their Belt and Road Initiative, places where they can move the People's Liberation Army Navy. We've seen their continued efforts to expand militarily," Pompeo said.For the past 20 years, the US has not responded to these things in a real way, he said."We've viewed the 1.5 billion people in the Chinese market as so important to the American economy, and the risk that the Chinese would respond by closing us out for the favour of some other nation – I think people have just been too worried about that to actually take the responses that we take to every other country that behaves in the way that China has done," Pompeo said.President Donald Trump has not done that, he asserted."Trump's made it very clear whether it's the signature issue on trade... reciprocal trade... and now beginning to move to all the other elements of power that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to expand," he added.

02-06-2020||New Delhi||Reveal Covid test data: Experts to PM||Top public health experts across India have urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to place test data related to Covid in public domain for researchers to study disease trends and rued the government’s “over reliance on academic epidemiologists and bureaucracy” in driving India’s pandemic response.“The draconian lockdown India imposed was presumably in response to a modelling exercise from an influential institution that presented a worst-case simulation predicting an estimated 2.2 million deaths globally. Subsequent events proved these predictions wrong,” three health bodies, The Indian Public Health Association, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine and Indian Association of Epidemiologists, have said in their letter to the PM.The letter comes in the wake of a 314-time rise in Covid-19 cases between lockdowns 1 to 4 from March 24 to May 31. The cases rose exponentially from 606 to 190535.Noting that it was unrealistic at this stage to expect that the Covid-19 pandemic can be eliminated, the health bodies said community transmission was well-established across large sections or sub-populations in the country.They said the government was primarily advised on pandemic response by clinicians and academic epidemiologists with limited field training and skills.“Policy makers apparently relied overwhelmingly on general administrative bureaucrats. The engagement with expert technocrats in epidemiology, public health, preventive medicine and social scientists was limited. India is paying a heavy price, both in terms of humanitarian crisis and disease spread,” they said.Recommending quick solutions, they said the first step was immediate constitution of a panel of inter-disciplinary public health, preventive health experts and social scientists at the central, state and district levels to address the health and humanitarian crises.“All data including test results should be made available in public domain (unlinked anonymous) for the research community to access, analyse and provide real-time context-specific solutions to control the pandemic. A Public Health Commission with task-specific working groups may be urgently constituted to provide real-time technical inputs to the government. The opaqueness maintained by the government and states on data so has been a serious impediment to independent research,” they said, advocating lifting of lockdown with cluster restrictions and resumption of all routine health services.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reveal-covid-test-data-experts-to-pm-93258

02-06-2020||Wajid Khan October 7||His jalwa will be remembered||Nonika SinghBollywood woke up to yet another sad morning as the cruel jaws of death snatched one of its talented composer-singers Wajid Khan of the Sajid-Wajid fame. Gone too soon… the sentiment was unanimous, as the music director, younger brother of the famous jodi, passed away due to underlying medical conditions, including kidney ailments, exacerbated by Covid-19 infection.The brothers made their debut with Salman Khan’s “Pyaar Kiya to Darna Kya” in 1998 and have been a constant in most of Salman’s films, including super-hit franchise “Dabangg”.Salman’s eternal favourites, the duo played a key role even in the songs, which the superstar brought out during the quarantine. Working in several films such as “Wanted”, “Tere Naam” and “Partner”, Wajid was also a singer in his own right.He delivered numerable hit songs and gave playback not just for Salman, but also Akshay Kumar in song “Chinta Ta Ta Chita Chita” from “Rowdy Rathore”. In sync with the boisterousness and chutzpah of film’s lead actors, the duo’s music has always been bubbling with the right fervour and spunk.Despite belting out one super-hit after another, Wajid believed that each song decides your destiny. Even as guest composers in “Ek Tha Tiger”, they came out with foot-tapping “Mashallah”.Sons of tabla player Ustad Sharafat Ali Khan, music in a way runs in their blood. His last conversation with Punjabi singer Mika Singh, “Dua karein mere liye…” alas will forever ring in our ears. So would songs like “Baaki sab first class hai…” only there is nothing comforting as the jalwa of Wajid comes to a premature end.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/his-jalwa-will-be-remembered-93261

While a ‘yellow’ alert has been sounded for both Maharashtra and Gujarat coasts, the areas expected to be most affected are coastal parts of Maharashtra — Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts.If and when it intensifies into a ‘cyclone’, it will be named Nisarga as per the established protocol for tropical storms in the Indian Ocean region.“According to our assessment, it may make a landfall as severe cyclone around the afternoon of June 3. The effect is expected to be more on the Maharashtra coast, Mumbai, Thane, Raigarh, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts,” said IMD Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.Also read: 10 NDRF teams deployed as cyclonic storm approaches: Uddhav ThackerayCurrently positioned as ‘depression’, the tropical storm is “very likely to intensify into a deep depression during the next six hours and further into a cyclone during the subsequent 24 hours,” says the IMD.Notably, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea have witnessed “above normal” cyclogenesis in past two years. India and Bangladesh have already been hit by first major storm of the season, super cyclone Amphan.This particular system is likely to move nearly northwards initially till the morning of June 2 then re-curve north northeastwards and cross north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts between Harihareshwar (Raigad, Maharashtra) and Daman during the afternoon of June 3.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclone-nisarga-to-hit-maharashtra-gujarat-tomorrow-93250
02-06-2020||New Delhi||India renews dialogue offer to avert Nepal map revision||India is making a last-ditch effort to persuade Nepal not to push ahead with a Constitutional amendment that will formalise the inclusion of territory claimed by India in its political map.Nepal has already issued a revised political map but a Constitutional amendment, if passed by its Parliament, will give finality to the process and allow the new contours of the border to be incorporated in its coat of arms.Read also: Nepal’s map moveAbout the disputeNepal government has tabled a Bill to approve a new map which shows Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura-which also feature on India's map-as part of its territory. India has rejected the map, calling the revision "unilateral" and "not based on historical facts and evidences".Sources said India has attempted to convey to Nepal that it is ready for talks with the tactical aim of delaying the parliamentary procedure. The new offer, conveyed through former security and diplomatic officials, is a revision of the old offer to hold Foreign Secretary-level talks after the Covid epidemic is over. The old offer of holding talks after the epidemic had riled the Nepalese political class and led to hardening of stance. Kathmandu had argued that talks could also be held during the pandemic if Defence Minister Rajnath Singh could inaugurate a road running through disputed areas while Covid was raging.While the Indian side has not officially acknowledged the feelers sent out to Nepal, its Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali said Kathmandu is in constant touch with New Delhi. “The date and modality of informal talks are not fixed yet, but we are in constant touch with the Indian side… We want to resolve the issue through diplomatic means,’’ he was reported as having briefed Nepal’s parliamentary committee on foreign affairs.The last-minute Indian attempt is the same tactics of 2015 when S Jaishankar, then the Foreign Secretary, had landed in Kathmandu to block major legislative changes that had upset Madhesis living in the plains bordering India. By the time Jaishankar landed, the die had been cast and Nepal did not heed the Foreign Secretary’s call, leading to an unacknowledged economic blockade.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-renews-dialogue-offer-to-avert-nepal-map-revision-93251

As recommended by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), the rates of all 14 crops of the season, including oilseeds, pulses and cereals, have been raised.Rates of 14 crops raised on CACP suggestionstaple) raised by Rs260 per quintal to Rs5,515Cotton MSP (long staple) raised to Rs5,825 per quintal; return on cost highest for bajraThe Cabinet also extended the repayment date for short-term agriculture loans up to Rs 3 lakh due between March 1 and August 3. This will help farmers repay/renew such loans up to the extended repayment date at 4 per cent per annum interest without attracting penalty. They will not have to visit the banks for such renewal amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced after a Cabinet meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi.The government claimed big benefits with returns on cost as high as 83% for bajra and 50 per cent for paddy (both common and Grade A), but the farmers termed the increase ‘miniscule’. Tomar said the increase in the paddy support price would ensure 50% return on the cost.Manufacturing at historic low in MayNew Delhi: Manufacturing output stayed at historic low levels, as weak demand led to lower production in May.

Both India and China have said they are committed to safeguarding national security along the LAC.Sources said the Indian troops had been forward-deployed with food and sleeping bags to hold ground in the Galwan valley and the north of Pangong Tso.
