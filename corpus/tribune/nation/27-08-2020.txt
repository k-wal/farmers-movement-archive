27-08-2020||Islamabad||Not legally possible to allow Indian lawyer to represent Jadhav: Pak||Pakistan said on Thursday that it was not legally possible to allow a lawyer from India to represent Indian prisoner on death row Kulbhushan Jadhav in a court in this country.Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri was asked at the weekly press briefing about India’s demand to appoint a local counsel to plead Jadhav’s case in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) which announced that it would the case on September 3.“The Indian side has been also making incongruous demands of allowing an Indian lawyer to represent Commander Jadhav. We have repeatedly told them only those lawyers can represent Commander Jadhav in the court who have a licence to practise law in Pakistan. This is in accordance with legal practice in other jurisdictions also,” he said.The spokesman also said the Indian Supreme Court, in one of its judgments, also ruled that foreign lawyers cannot practise law within the country.Jadhav, the 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of “espionage and terrorism” in April 2017. Weeks later, India approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.“The ICJ judgment clearly says that the review and reconsideration process would be carried out in Pakistani courts as per the laws of Pakistan,” Chaudhri said.He said immediately after the ICJ’s verdict, Pakistan informed Jadhav of his rights; provided consular access; and put a stay on his execution.He said the provision of effective review and reconsideration is also under process.Chaudhri said Pakistan facilitated the meeting of Jadhav’s family on humanitarian grounds and also provided second consular access to him.Last month, Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav, days ahead of a deadline to file a review petition in a court here against his conviction by a military court.This was the second consular access to Jadhav. The first consular access was provided by Pakistan on September 2, 2019, the Foreign Office said in a statement          “However, the Indian consular officials abruptly left while the consular meeting with Commander Jadhav was underway,” the spokesman claimed.Chaudhri said that to give effect to the ICJ judgment, the Government of Pakistan has itself approached the Islamabad High Court and India must come forward and cooperate with the court in Pakistan to give effect to the judgment of the ICJ.Pakistan claims that its security forces arrested Jadhav from the restive Balochistan province on March 3, 2016 after he reportedly entered from Iran. India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-legally-possible-to-allow-indian-lawyer-to-represent-jadhav-pak-132297
27-08-2020||New Delhi||SC to pronounce verdict on pleas against UGC decision to hold final year exams by Sept 30||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on Friday on the pleas challenging the decision of UGC asking universities and colleges to conduct final year exams by September 30 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, which had reserved its verdict on the issue on August 18, will pronounce the judgement.The University Grants Commission (UGC) had told the top court that its July 6 directive, asking universities and colleges to conduct final year exams by September 30 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, is “not a diktat” but states cannot take decision to confer degrees without holding the examinations.It had told the court that the directive is for the “benefit of students” as the universities have to start admissions to postgraduate courses and state authorities cannot override the UGC’s guideline.The top court had observed that the issue is if the state disaster management authority has decided that the situation is not conducive for holding exams, can they overrule the UGC.It had said that another issue is whether the commission can override state authorities and ask the universities to hold examinations on given dates.The apex court was earlier told by one of the petitioners that nobody is against the university examinations in “normal times” and the students are challenging the UGC’s decision because of the pandemic.The UGC had said that final examination is a “crucial step” in the academic career of a student and the state government cannot say that its July 6 directive was “not binding”.Yuva Sena, the youth wing of Shiv Sena, is one of the petitioners in the apex court and has questioned the UGC’s directive to hold examinations during the pandemic times.            The UGC had earlier said that the July 6 guidelines are based on recommendations of experts and have been made after due deliberation and it is wrong to claim that it will not be possible to conduct the final examinations in terms of the guidelines.On August 10, the UGC had questioned the decisions of Delhi and Maharashtra governments to cancel final year exams of state universities amid the COVID-19 pandemic, saying they were against the rules.       The Solicitor General had earlier informed the Bench that out of over 800 universities in the country, 209 have completed the examinations while around 390 universities are in the process of conducting exams.The UGC had said that in June this year, considering the evolving situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it requested the expert committee to revisit the April 29 guidelines, by which it had asked the universities and institutions to hold final year examinations in July 2020.The expert committee submitted a report recommending that terminal semester/final year examinations should be conducted by universities/ institutions by the end of September, 2020 in offline (pen & paper)/ online/ blended (online + offline) mode, the UGC had said.It added that this report of the expert committee was deliberated and approved by the UGC in its emergent meeting held on July 6, since the conduct of the final year/terminal examination is a time-sensitive issue.Assailing the decisions of some states like Maharashtra and Delhi of cancelling the final year exams, the UGC had said such decisions directly affect the standards of higher education and will be an encroachment on the legislative field of coordinating and determining the standards of higher education that is exclusively reserved for Parliament under Schedule VII of the Constitution.

27-08-2020||New Delhi||Centre’s talk of make in India, atmanirbhar bharat hypocritical: Delhi HC||The change in eligibility criteria to participate in tenders for providing ground handling services in various regional airports was on Thursday criticised by the Delhi High Court which said the central government was being “hypocritical” with regard to promoting local entrepreneurs.The high court was critical of the political leadership and said it was “pained” that on one hand the government talks of ‘make in India’ and being ‘atmanirbhar’ and on the other it floats tenders which would oust small entities from participating in ground handling operations in regional airports.“What really irks is that if you really want to oust these people (small entities), then say so. Don’t be hypocritical in your speeches. Your political leadership speaks of make in India, they speak of atmanirbhar bharat, they speak about encouraging local industry, but your actions don’t match your words. You are being completely hypocritical,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar said.The bench asked Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Centre and Airport Authority of India, to speak to the political leadership that if they want to proceed in this manner then why are they making the speeches on make in India.“Are they (political leadership) even aware of this being done,” the bench asked.“We are saying stop importing from this country or that country and on the other hand we are also failing our own entrepreneurs,” the bench said.Referring to the tender eligibility criteria like having an annual turnover of over Rs 35 crore and experience of having worked with scheduled airlines, the high court said, “You want big players with big pockets, and maybe foreign tie-ups, to come in.”It also said the smaller players would have worked at regional airports where flights of scheduled airlines are few or not at all and therefore, their experience of ground handling with non-scheduled or chartered airlines was being ignored.“If you (Centre and AAI) want to oust them, then say so. Don’t be hypocritical about it. If this is your policy, then have the courage to say so.“Then don’t talk about indigenisation or make in India, provide in India. Don’t talk of all these things,” the bench said and added “we are pained that you are wanting to oust the smaller players”.The high court said if smaller players are not allowed to grow, then there will only be the established bigger players who due to their market dominance would start dictating terms to the government.“Today we are talking of this nationalistic feeling that we must produce in India, serve in India, that we must be atmanirbhar. What is happening to all that? Is this the way to approach the situation,” the bench told the government during the hearing via video conferencing.It added that the country was being “indifferent and insensitive” to promoting our own entrepreneurs and there were many instances where people have shut shop and moved out saying it was difficult to manufacture or run a business here.The observations were made by the bench while hearing a plea challenging the change in eligibility criteria to participate in the latest tenders floated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for providing ground handling services (GHS) at various regional airports in the country.It was hearing the plea by Centre for Aviation Policy, Safety and Research (CAPSR), an association representing agencies providing ground handling and various other services at airports in the country.The high court issued notice to the Centre and AAI seeking their stand on the plea by CAPSR, which was represented by advocate S S Mishra.The bench said the award of the tenders would be subject to the further orders in the petition.CAPSR in its plea has sought quashing of the tenders floated by AAI with regard to GHS at smaller airports in the country or directions to AAI to alter the eligibility criteria so that everyone, including the existing ground handling agencies, can participate. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-talk-of-make-in-india-atmanirbhar-bharat-hypocritical-delhi-hc-132295
27-08-2020||Lucknow||Special court rejects CBI’s closure report in IAS officer’s death, orders further probe||A special CBI court on Thursday rejected a plea by the central investigation agency to close a case of the suspicious death of a Karnataka cadre IAS officer in 2017 and directed a further probe into it.Special Judge Subrat Pathak quashed the CBI closure report into the suspicious death of IAS officer Anurag Tiwari on a protest application filed by late officer’s brother Mayank Tiwari.ASJ Pathak also asked the CBI to submit its report on the progress in probe on September 30.The court passed the order after hearing Tiwari’s counsel Nutan Thakur and the CBI counsel.The CBI had sought closure of the case saying that the allegations about the deceased going to expose a big scam or being pressurised by senior officers or his life being under threat have not been corroborated by any oral, documentary or technical evidence.Tiwari’s counsel Thakur, however, contended that before the court that the CBI has missed on many vital points and has undertaken the entire investigation with “a preconceived mind to fulfil a predetermined objective of declaring the case to be an accidental death”.She said there are huge lapses in the investigation ranging from the false interpretations of post mortem report to many important aspects of forensic evidence being ignored.Accepting Thaur’s argument, ASJ Pathak rejected the closure report of the CBI and asked it to further investigate the case.Tiwari, a 2007-batch IAS officer, who was staying at the state guest house here on Meerabai Marg was found dead near it on May 17, 2017.An FIR in the matter was registered by Anurag’s brother Mayank Tiwari at Hazratganj police station on May 25, 2017.In its closure report submitted to the special court, the central agency, which had taken over the case on June 16, 2017, on the recommendation of the state government, had claimed that Anurag died due to an accidental fall that led to asphyxia (suffocation).“It was neither suicide nor homicide,” the report said.

27-08-2020||New Delhi||17 lakh admit cards for NEET, JEE downloaded: Govt, says students want exams to be conducted||The government on Thursday defended its move to go ahead with NEET and JEE exams despite mounting pressure to defer them, saying over two-thirds of candidates have downloaded the admit cards which shows that students want these exams to be conducted at any cost, and asserted that it won’t let the Congress party “spoil” students’ future to find relevance.Noting that over 17 lakh out of nearly 25 lakh candidates have already downloaded admit cards for the medical and engineering entrance exams, Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said his ministry has been receiving e-mails from students and parents that these exams should not be further postponed.The minister’s remarks came a day after seven chief ministers of non-BJP ruled states agreed to the need for filing a review petition urging the Supreme Court to reconsider its recent order rejecting the postponement of the competitive exams.Congress and various opposition parties have demanded that NEET and JEE  examinations be deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and floods in parts of the country, even as the Union government has made it clear that they will be held as per schedule with due precautions.On Thursday, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik also spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the phone and requested him to postpone NEET and JEE exams, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and the flood situation in the state, a senior CMO official told reporters in Bhubaneswar.Two days ago, Patnaik had also written a letter in this regard to Nishank.During his conversation with the prime minister, the chief minister explained that Odisha is in the grip of a pandemic as well as flood, and students might face difficulties in appearing for the examinations, the official added.Amid the growing chorus for postponement of the exams, over 150 academicians wrote to the prime minister to assert that delaying the medical and engineering entrance exams any further will mean compromising the future of students.Directors of several Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) also said more delay in conducting these exams will lead to a ‘zero academic year’ and any quick alternative to the crucial exams will dilute the quality of education and have cascading effects.“National Testing Agency (NTA) officials told me that over 7 lakh candidates have downloaded JEE-Main admit cards while over 10 lakh aspirants have downloaded NEET admit cards. This shows that students want the exams be held at any cost,” Pokhriyal said.He also added that: “We have received mails from students and parents who are in favour of holding exams as they have been preparing for the exams from at least two three years. The Supreme Court too opined that full academic year can’t be wasted. After two deferments, exam dates have been finalised.”The issue, which has been a matter of intense public discourse for past few months, has evoked contrasting views with many backing the holding of the tests fearing that it may lead to a zero academic year for students, and the Opposition and activists demanding their postponement in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.Accusing the Congress of playing politics, BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav said the opposition party “believes students must lose a year so it doesn’t lose an opportunity for politics”.“Over 85 percent #JEENEET candidates don’t agree and have downloaded admit cards. The Modi government won’t let Congress spoil students’ future to find relevance,” he tweeted. While the NEET is slated to be held on September 13, engineering entrance exam JEE-Mains is scheduled between September 1-6. Around 8.58 lakh candidates have registered for JEE-Mains and 15.97 lakh students have registered for NEET.The group of over 150 academicians from various universities in India and abroad also said in the letter to Modi that “some are trying to play with future of students to propel their own political agenda”.Meanwhile, DMK president M K Stalin on Thursday urged the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Odisha to join seven other states and approach the Supreme Court to seek deferment of this year’s National-Eligibility-cum-Entrance-Test and the Joint Entrance Examination.The Left parties also opposed the Centre’s decision to hold the exams in September amid the COVID-19 pandemic and said it completely undermines the health concerns of students.However, heads of various IITs had a different opinion on the issue.Sarit Kumar Das, Director, IIT Ropar, who is also a member of the Joint Admission Board (JAB) of IITs, said the decision to conduct the exams in September has not been taken overnight but after due consideration.According to Virendra Tewari, Director, IIT Kharagpur, “The exams have a global reputation for seeking excellence and are considered one of the toughest and prestigious examinations in the world. A quick alternative to these tests will certainly not be as gratifying as competing for this examination by all fair means.”Tiwari also said an alternative could be misused as a precedent to dilute the entire admission process to the IIT system which may prove to be harmful for the quality of undergraduate education at the IITs.“I urge the aspirants to take it up as a challenge and show their mettle and sincerity to the world,” he added.These exams have already been deferred twice in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic. JEE-Main was originally supposed to be held from April 7-11, but postponed to July 18-23, NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3, then pushed to July 26.

27-08-2020||Mumbai||Stop 'media trial' in Sushant Singh Rajput case, petition urges High Court||A petition filed in the Bombay High Court has sought a direction to news channels and others to "postpone" the "media trial" in actor Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide, saying it could hamper the probe.The plea, filed on Wednesday, is yet to be taken up for hearing by the high court.Petitioners Nilesh Navlakha and two others demanded directions to news channels to limit their coverage of the case and the probe.The ongoing sensational reportage on the issue might hamper the probe being conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), it said.Since June 14, the day Rajput allegedly committed suicide, "several prominent media channels have been conducting media trials" and "parallel proceedings", the petition said.TV channels and other media outlets have "proceeded to already convict" the accused named in the FIR, it said.Such parallel investigation goes against the Supreme Court's past rulings and basic principles of law, the petition said.The high court should ask the media to "postpone reporting....debates, discussions of any kind tantamount to media trial...that will directly or indirectly hamper the investigation in the case", the plea said.The petitioners have made several news channels party to the litigation.They had filed complaints with the Union government authorities against some TV channels, but were yet to get a response, the petitioners said.The CBI is conducting a probe into a complaint of abetment of suicide filed by Rajput's father against actor Rhea Chakraborty, her family members, and others.

It may be noted that this note has made no mention whatsoever of any instruction of the MHA on the matter of increasing testing in Delhi.”The note has only proposed that the views of an expert committee headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul “may be taken on the proposed enhancement in testing in Delhi, for technical guidance on various issues such as mix of RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen, categories geographical areas and demographic etc.”In its rebuttal, the MHA further said, “In this context, it may be recalled that it was after the intervention of the Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the daily tests in Delhi, which were averaging around 4,000 per day till mid June 2020 have gone up to around 18-20 thousand per day in a calibrated manner.”The marked improvement in the COVID-19 situation in Delhi has been possible due to enhanced testing and other containment measures, the MHA asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-testing-mha-terms-delhi-health-ministers-allegation-baseless-132280
27-08-2020||New Delhi||SC says 2004 verdict on sub-classification of SCs/STs needs to be reconsidered||In a significant verdict, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that its 2004 verdict holding that states do not have the power to further sub-classify the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for grant of quotas needed to be revisited by a seven or more judges bench.The apex court said states should be allowed to provide preferential treatment to the “poorest of the poor” among SCs and STs and advocated that an “authoritative pronouncement” was needed with respect to the effect of Constitutional provisions and whether sub-classification is permissible only with respect to the socially and educationally backward classes and not with respect to SCs and STs.The top court observed that the benefit of quota by and large is not percolating down to the “neediest and poorest of the poor” and it was “crystal clear” that creamy layer concept for excluding affluent people “can be applied to” SCs and STs.A five-judge constitution bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said the 2004 verdict of a bench of same strength in the E V Chinnaiah case had held that states cannot give preference to certain Scheduled Castes as it would amount to “tinkering with” the Presidential list of SCs and STs under the Constitution and this required to be relooked.“Reservation was not contemplated for all the time by the framers of the Constitution. On the one hand, there is no exclusion of those who have come up, on the other hand, if sub­classification is denied, it would defeat right to equality by treating unequal as equal,” the top court said.It further said, “The State cannot be deprived of the power to take care of the qualitative and quantitative difference between different classes to take ameliorative measures.”         “We endorse the opinion of a Bench of three Judges that E V.Chinnaiah is required to be revisited by a larger Bench; more so, in view of further development and the amendment of the Constitution, which have taken place.“We cannot revisit E V Chinnaiah being Bench of coordinate strength. We request the Hon’ble Chief Justice to place the matters before a Bench comprising 7 Judges or more as considered appropriate,” said the bench which also included Justices Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, M R Shah and Aniruddha Bose.The top court was faced with the legal issues referred to it by a three-judge bench which was earlier hearing a batch of appeals, including the one filed by the Punjab government.The state government under Section 4(5) of the Punjab Scheduled Caste and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006 had provided that out of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes, fifty per cent of the vacancies would be offered to ‘Balmikis’and ‘Mazhabi Sikhs’ and this was set aside by the high court by placing reliance on the 2004 verdict.Dealing with apex court judgements in the Mandal and the Jarnail Singh cases (on quota for OBCs and exclusion of creamy layers from quota benefits in SCs and STs), it said, “The ‘inadequate representation’ is the fulcrum of the provisions of Article 16(4).“In our opinion, it would be open to the State to provide on a rational basis the preferential treatment by fixing reasonable quota out of reserved seats to ensure adequate representation in services. Reservation is a very effective tool for emancipation of the oppressed class. The benefit by and large is not percolating down to the neediest and poorest of the poor.”Justice Mishra, in the 78-page judgement, referred to the constitutional amendment made to grant quota to poor class of citizens and the Jarnail Singh judgements and said that it was “crystal clear” that creamy layer concept for excluding affluent people “can be applied to” SCs and STs.The bench also referred to the different strata among SCs as well and said that there have been reports to that effect.“There is cry, and caste struggle within the reserved class as benefit of reservation in services and education is being enjoyed, who are doing better hereditary occupation. The scavenger class given the name of ‘Balmikis’ remains more or less where it was, and so on, disparity within Scheduled Caste is writ large from various reports.“The sub classification was made under Section 4(5) of the Punjab Act to ensure that the benefit of the reservation percolates down to the deprived section and does not remain on paper and to provide benefit to all and give them equal treatment…”.Referring the vexatious issue to larger bench, the court said that as per its opinion, it would be “permissible on rational basis to make such sub­classification to provide benefit to all to bring equality, and it would not amount to exclusion from the list as no class (caste) is deprived of reservation in totality.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-says-2004-verdict-on-sub-classification-of-scs-sts-needs-to-be-reconsidered-132276

27-08-2020||London||Visas granted to Indian students to study in UK more than doubles||Visas granted to Indian nationals to study at universities in the UK have more than doubled over the past year, according to official statistics released here on Thursday.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that Indian nationals accounted for 17 per cent of the total 299,023 sponsored study visas granted by the UK Home Office in the year ending March 2020, with the number more than doubling from 2019 to hit a total of 49,844 grants – a continuous rise since 2016.The ONS data found that after China, which accounted for 40 per cent of all study visas, India has been driving up Britain's overseas student arrivals to reflect an increase in the country's migration statistics.However, the coronavirus lockdown post-March is yet to be accounted for in the figures, which could also impact numbers from India."After a period of stability, we were seeing migration levels begin to increase in the past 12 months leading up to the coronavirus pandemic. This was being driven by increases in non-EU student arrivals, mainly from China and India," said Jay Lindop, Director of the Centre for International Migration at the ONS."The IPS (International Passenger Service) data were collected up to March 2020 and do not take into account the significant impact the pandemic has had on international migration since then," said Lindop.The UK's new post-study work visa, or Graduate Route, comes in force from the 2020-21 academic year.It is expected to have a further positive impact on Indian student applications to UK universities, given the option of being able to apply for work at the end of a degree course.However, there is some concern among British universities that many overseas students may choose to defer their plans for study abroad amid the coronavirus lockdown travel restrictions.The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK) had conducted a survey of Indian students to assess the impact of the lockdown on the higher education sector and found that nearly half of Indian students with an admission offer to a UK university from September 2020 were unsure whether to accept.However, 45 per cent had accepted their offers and intended to carry on with their education in the UK as planned and only 5 per cent chose to defer their offers to the next academic year.The findings coincide with those of the UK's Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), which found that amid an overall spike in university applications for the year, most applicants from India were planning to start a course from the autumn semester, which begins next month.In the latest ONS migration data, Indian nationals also accounted for nearly half (48 per cent) of all skilled work visas granted in the year ending June 2020, but the number of grants decreased by a quarter (25 per cent) compared with the previous year.

27-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput spent Rs 70 lakh on Thailand trip, claims Rhea Chakraborty||Actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is accused of abetting Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide by his family, has opened up about her relationship with the late actor on Thursday, denying that she was “living off" his money.Chakraborty, along with her family members, is also accused of misappropriating Rajput's wealth by the actor's family, but she dismissed the allegations in a TV interview.After Mumbai Police, Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation are investigating various angles in the actor's death.Opening up about her much-talked-about Europe trip with the late Bollywood star, who died by suicide on June 14 in Mumbai, the young actor said in an interview to Aaj Tak that she was set to go to Paris on a professional assignment.She said it was Rajput's idea to make a “Europe trip” about it and he cancelled the tickets booked by the company that was sponsoring her trip. She said her brother joined them in Italy at the insistence of the late actor."He paid for the rest of the trip and the hotels. He wanted to and I didn't have a problem with that. I had a problem with how much he was spending. But Sushant lived king-size, he was like that," she said, adding that he once went on a trip to Thailand with his friends and spent “Rs 70 lakh” on that vacation.“These were his lifestyle choices. Who are we to say how Sushant should live his life? He lived like a star, he loved it. It was his choice to take those men on that trip, did they also force him? No, I was not living off Sushant Singh Rajput's money. We were living like a couple,” she told senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai.Asked about why her brother Showik joined them on their Europe trip, Chakraborty said all three of them had formed an artificial intelligence company called Rhealytix, which was named after her and invested Rs 33,000 each in the firm.The actor said she was not on the list for his funeral as “his family members don't like me”.Chakraborty said she wanted to attend the funeral but dropped the idea at the suggestion of her friends as the family did not want her there.The actor said her friends told her that “you will be ridiculed, you will be thrown out. You are already not in a sound mental state. Don't come here”.Chakraborty said two of her friends told her to see his body to get closure. She said she saw Rajput's body for three-four seconds “said sorry and touched his feet”.“Yes, I said 'Sorry babu'. When you see a dead person, what else will you say? I said sorry as he was no more. When you love someone and they die, you say sorry. Sorry that you aren't here. Sorry that a joke has been made out of your death,” she said.Asked about allegations that she was controlling Rajput's lifestyle and staff, Chakraborty rubbished them as “baseless” and most of the staff was either hired by Rajput and his sister Priyanka.Asked when she got to know about Rajput's mental condition or the fact that he was bipolar, Chakraborty said it was during their Europe trip.Rajput, she was told, used to get claustrophobic during flights and took medicines.“We landed in Paris first and he didn't come out of his room for the first three days. I wondered what the matter was. He was so excited that we will go to Paris so that no one recognises him. So that he could show me his real self which was his fun nature. That he could walk on the streets, something which he could not do in India.“But he didn't come out of his room. He was much better when we went to Switzerland next. He was high on energy and he had started getting out, he was happy,” she said.The actor said when they went to Italy, they stayed in a gothic hotel and had “a weird dome-like structure and strange photos”.Chakraborty talked about checking out “but he didn't listen to me”.“After that, his condition started getting worse little by little. He didn't want to come out of the room on the whole trip. I talked to him and he told me that he had an episode of depression in 2013,” he said.“Then he told me everything… that he was better after meeting the psychiatrist. He used to get anxiety attacks many times. But he had started feeling more depressed and worried. So we had to cut our trip short. If your partner is not feeling well, what else will you do? You'll come back,” she said.Chakraborty said her “media trial” was a “witch hunt”.“Loving someone has become the most wanted crime,” she said, adding that she now just wanted to take a “deep breath” and have a normal day with her family where someone is not facing an anxiety attack.“This is a conspiracy to break me, my family. Kangana Ranaut ji said ‘it was a systematic breakdown of a fragile mind', then what is it?” Chakraborty also claimed that Rajput did not share a good relationship with his father K K Singh.Referring to her July 16 post on Instagram where she had tagged Home Minister Amit Shah, requesting for a CBI inquiry, Chakraborty said she had cooperated with the Mumbai Police and was doing the same with the Enforcement Directorate and CBI.“Am I not allowed to prove my innocence?” Chakraborty asked, adding that all kinds of stories were being made about her.

27-08-2020||New Delhi/Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: NCB set to quiz 20 people on supply of drugs||A day after the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) registered a case against late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, the agency is all set to question 20 people in the coming days.According to senior NCB sources related to the probe, the agency has prepared the list of 20 suspects over supply of drugs in the case including Gaurav Arya, Suved Lohia, Kwan Entertainment partner Jaya Saha, ex-Big Boss contestant Ejaz Khan, Farookh Batata, and Bakul Chandani, among others.The development comes a day after the NCB registered a case under Sections 20 (b) 28, 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act against Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, Saha, Sushant's co-manager Shruti Modi, and Arya.The sources said that Arya is absconding with Akshit Shetty.They also said that on August 16, a rave party was raided in Goa in which Arya was involved in supplying drugs.According to NCB sources, Khan was arrested by Navi Mumbai Police for dealing in drugs in October 2018 while Chandani, owner of Sarvodaya video library in Mumbai's Khar, was arrested in December 2018 by the Anti Narcotics Cell of Mumbai Police with cocaine and LSD.After Rhea's nexus with the drug peddlers became public, the NCB was roped in on the request of the ED.Earlier in the day, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) made some sensational findings from the two confiscated mobile phones of Rhea which indicted several players including her in the case.The ED documents reveal the painstaking work by the probe agencies and Rhea's alleged bank fraud and suspicious nexus with the drug peddlers.Rhea allegedly stole Sushant's debit card passwords and for that she took the help of Samuel Miranda, the house manager of the late actor, sources said.The 34-year-old actor was found dead under mysterious circumstances in his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14, and Rhea was named the prime suspect by his family in a case registered at Patna police station on July 25.

But a day later, Pakistan Foreign Office clarified that the orders listing the terrorists and terrorist organisations did not mean admitting to their presence on its territory or that it would impose any new measures on these listed individuals.“Pakistan has never taken any credible and verifiable action against terror entities or listed individuals, including the most wanted ones. This subsequent denial calls into question their intentions and it would not mislead the world community in believing its propaganda,” said Srivastava.On the chargesheet filed on the Pulwama attacks, the MEA pointed out that it was the culmination of 18 months of investigations.“Our aim is not to simply issue statements or notifications. It has been filed to address the act of terrorism and to bring perpetrators of such a heinous crime to justice,” he said, while pointing out that Jaish-e-Mohammad, which had claimed the responsibility of the Pulwama attack, is Pakistan-based and its chief Masood Azhar, the first accused in the chargesheet, continues to find shelter in the country.“Enough evidence has been shared with Pakistan but it continues to evade responsibility. Pakistan has not yet taken any credible action against perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attack of 2008 which resulted in loss of 165 deaths including 25 foreigners,’’ he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-insincere-in-cracking-down-on-terrorists-mea-132260

Bipin Rawat had said India has “military options” to deal with Chinese aggression in Eastern Ladakh if talks at military and diplomatic levels are stalemated.Read also: India prepared to look at military options if no result from talks on border standoff with China: CDS RawatThe MEA also pointed out that Jaishankar had said when it comes to finding a solution, “this must be predicated on honouring all agreements and understandings. And not attempting to alter the status quo unilaterally”.The last meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) held a week back had seen New Delhi forcefully putting across the formulations expressed by Jaishankar.The MEA also indicated that the Chinese side was slow in implementing some of the discussions at military and diplomatic level talks. “It is important to bear in mind that achieving this (complete disengagement) requires agreed actions by both sides,” said the MEA spokesperson in this respect. “It is natural that this can be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-row-mea-rules-out-military-option-says-talks-only-way-to-resolve-border-issues-132253

27-08-2020||New Delhi||India’s self-reliance in defence sector to boost its global standing: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that his government’s resolve for ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ is not inward-looking, but aimed at boosting India’s capabilities and global peace, and also for helping the world economy become more stable.Speaking at a defence industry outreach seminar, Modi said India’s self-reliance on defence capabilities will boost its standing of being a net security provider in the Indian Ocean, make it a defence supplier for many friendly countries and deepen strategic ties.Wooing private players, he asserted that the import embargo on a number of defence equipment is not only aimed at curbing imports but also giving a boost to the domestic industry. He said more items will be added to this import embargo list later.He noted that India has long been one of the biggest defence importers in the world and rued that enough attention was not paid to augmenting domestic production in the past despite the country having inherited a capable ecosystem at the time of Independence.Asserting that a new mindset has emerged on his government’s watch, he said it is working to boost domestic manufacturing and developing new technologies with the maximum role for the private sector.His government has opened the way for 74 per cent FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in defence production through automatic route, he noted.Referring to recent labour reforms in a number of states, Modi said the reform exercise is not going to stop.The work on building defence corridor is also on at a rapid pace in states of Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, he said, while adding that Rs 20,000 crore investment would be made for this in the next five years.Modi said his government has always worked to remove red-tape and roll out red carpet for the private sector, while asserting that it is a win-win situation for everyone.

27-08-2020||Mumbai||10 years on, Rohtang Tunnel ready for opening||The Rs 4,000-crore Rohtang Tunnel, the world's longest motorable roadway at an altitude of over 3,000 metres, is ready for opening next month following the completion of civil works that began a decade ago.The tunnel will be opened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi by mid-September, said Satish Paretkar, Director of Hydro & Underground business unit at Afcons.A joint venture of Shapoorji Pallonji Group-run Afcons and Strabag of Austria won the Engineering Procurement & Construction (EPC) tender for Rs 1,458 crore from Border Road Organisation in 2009.The cost of the project has crossed Rs 2,500 crore now, he said. The civil works started in 2009 and was to be completed within 6.5 years.Paretkar said the exact date of opening of the tunnel was yet to be finalised.The 9.02 km-long Atal Tunnel, named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, passes under the Rohtang Pass in the eastern Pir Panjal range on the Leh-Manali highway at an altitude of 3,060 metres at the lowest and 3,078 metres at the peak.The tunnel is 10.5 metres wide and has a height of 5.52 metres and a car can zip through at 80 kmph.According to Paretkar, the horseshoe shaped single-tube, double-lane tunnel has many firsts.With a length of 9.02 km, it is the longest in the world at an altitude of over 3,000 metres or 10,000 feet mean sea level, he said.Further, it is also the country's first tunnel to have an escape tunnel within the main tunnel because of the topography.Globally, escape tunnels are built separately along the main tunnel.This is also the first tunnel to deploy the Rowa flyer technology, which allows engineers to work at inverted levels, he said.Paretkar said the delay in completion of the tunnel was mainly due to the 410-metre long Seri Nalla, a brook."Seri Nalla was emitting over 125 litres of water per second, making work really hard. In my entire engineering life, this was the toughest job to execute. It took us more than three years to drill 410 metres along the Nalla," he said.In the Seri Nalla zone in the South Portal, engineers faced regular collapse of the tunnel face due to extremely poor geological conditions.Afcons deployed over 1,000 workmen and 150 engineers. The engineering design was done by Australian Snowy Mountain Engineering Company.The tunnel has consumed 14,508 metric tonnes of steel and 2,37,596 metric tonnes of cement, and excavated out 14 lakh cubic metres soil and rocks, using the drill and blast technique for excavation and the New Austrian Tunnelling method for construction, Paretkar said.At the peak, the tunnel is 2.5 km deep in under mountain belly at the South Portal side and the lowest overburden is 1.5 km, Paretkar said. His team is also building the world's highest single-arch railway bridge across the Chenab in J&K.The terrain is so dangerous that there are 13 avalanche zones around the tunnel, yet there was not a single fatal accident in all these 10 years of the project life, he said, adding that each worker is given an electronic chip that will warn of any danger.The all-weather tunnel connects Manali to Lahaul and Spiti valley throughout the year reducing the distance on the Manali-Rohtang Pass-Sarchu-Leh road by 46 km, and drive-time by 4-5 hours between Manali and Lahaul-Spiti. It is along one of the only two routes into Ladakh and will become key to resupplying military garrisons.The tunnel was conceived way back in 1983 by the Indira Gandhi government to make the Manali-Leh road all-weather. But it was only in 2002, that the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government declared construction of the tunnel and laid the foundation for the approach road to the tunnel. The project began to move only in September 2009. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-years-on-rohtang-tunnel-ready-for-opening-132245

27-08-2020||London||Nirav Modi UK extradition judgment to be delivered after December 1||The judgment in the extradition trial of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case will be handed down in the UK after December 1.At a scheduled hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on Thursday, District Judge Samuel Goozee agreed the timetable for the second leg of Modi's extradition trial scheduled between September 7 and 11.The hearings next month will complete arguments on establishing a prima facie case against 49-year-old Modi and also deal with the additional extradition request, made by the Indian authorities and certified by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier this year, which add on the charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” against him.Additional hearings have also been scheduled for November 3, for the judge to rule on the admissibility of evidence presented before him, and December 1, when both sides will make their final submissions.Therefore, any judgment in the case is now expected only after the final hearing in December.During the course of Thursday's hearing, Modi's lawyers also raised concerns over allegations of “party political bias” against one of their expert witnesses from India.Modi's barrister Clare Montgomery told Justice Goozee that after Retired Justice Abhay Thipsay had given his witness statement on the concept of “criminal breach of trust” in Indian law during the first leg of the extradition trial in May, he came under attack and was accused of political bias.“We may have to put in an application for reporting restrictions around the reporting of his [Thipsay] evidence to avoid further public commentary on it,” said Montgomery, indicating that the retired Indian high court judge will be among the witnesses for the second leg of Modi's trial scheduled to begin from September 7.Asked by Goozee for the reason behind such an application, Modi's barrister said the “Indian ministry of justice” held a press conference “attacking" Thipsay for the evidence he had given in the UK court and accused him of “party political bias”.During the hearing in May, Retd Justice Thipsay appeared via videolink from India as a legal expert to back Modi's defence team's efforts to try and highlight legal flaws in the government of India's case."Unless a person is deceived there can be no cheating under Indian law," he said at the time.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, had countered his witness statement and later in India, Thipsay, a former judge of the high court in Mumbai and Allahabad, had been accused of acting on the behest of the Congress party.The retired judge had countered the allegations, saying he was not appearing in defence of Modi but as an expert witness to give his legal opinion, which the UK court may consider or disregard.The hearing in London on Thursday was scheduled as a case management hearing to set the timetable for evidence to be presented to compete Modi's extradition trial.Modi, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March last year, will remain remanded into custody until the start of the trial on September 7 – when he will appear via videolink.The hearings next month will again be held in part remote settings, given the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.His defence team also made a reference to his “deteriorating” mental health in Wandsworth, one of England's most overcrowded prisons, as among a number of “additional issues” it is likely to raise.The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by the Punjab National Bank (PNB), known as “letters of undertaking” (LoUs).Modi's team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems trade and that the LoUs were standard practice.The CPS sought to establish that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions. This resulted in a fraud amounting to nearly USD 2 billion. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nirav-modi-uk-extradition-judgment-to-be-delivered-after-december-1-132235

27-08-2020||New Delhi||Just 24 pc of Indian households have internet facility to access e-education: UNICEF||Just 24 per cent of Indian households have internet connections to access e-education, and there is a large rural-urban and gender divide that is likely to widen the learning gap across high, middle and low-income families, according to a new UNICEF report.The Remote Learning Reachability report, issued by UNICEF on Thursday, expressed concerns over children from economically disadvantaged families struggling with access to remote learning."Available data indicates that approximately a quarter of households (24 per cent) in India have access to the internet and there is a large rural-urban and gender divide. The learning gap is likely to widen across high, middle and low-income families, as children from economically disadvantaged families cannot access remote learning," it said.The report further said that students, especially girls, from most marginalised communities do not have easy access to smartphones, and even if they do, internet connectivity is poor, and quality education content is often not available in vernacular languages."In India, over 1.5 million (15 lakh) schools have been closed due to the pandemic affecting 286 million (28.6 crore) children from pre-primary to secondary levels, (of which 49 per cent girls) This adds to the 6 million (60 lakh) girls and boys who were already out of school prior to the COVID-19," the report said.Noting that the Centre and the state governments have put in place several initiatives through digital and non-digital platforms to facilitate continuity of learning at home, the UNICEF called for multiple pathways and outreach strategies to improve access and use of learning materials by children/students, especially in reaching the unreached because of the digital divide.UNICEF India Representative Yasmin Ali Haque called for blended approaches involving communities, parents and volunteers to reach children and support their learning in these times."We know that in any crisis, the young and the most vulnerable suffer disproportionately. Schools are closed, parents are out of work and families are under growing strain. An entire generation of children have seen their education and learning interrupted," Haque said."Access to digital education is limited and by itself cannot solve the learning gap. Blended approaches are needed involving communities, parents, volunteers to reach children and support their learning in these times," she said.At least a third of the world's schoolchildren – 46.3 crore children globally – were unable to access remote learning when COVID-19 shuttered their schools, according to the new UNICEF report released as countries across the world grapple with their 'back-to-school' plans.The report uses a globally representative analysis on the availability of home-based technology and tools needed for remote learning among pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary and upper-secondary schoolchildren, with data from 100 countries. The data include access to television, radio and internet, and the availability of curriculum delivered across these platforms during school closures.Although the numbers in the report present a concerning picture on the lack of remote learning during school closures, UNICEF warns that the situation is likely far worse."Even when children have the technology and tools at home, they may not be able to learn remotely through those platforms due to competing factors in the home, including pressure to do chores, being forced to work, a poor environment for learning and lack of support in using the online or broadcast curriculum," it said.The UNICEF urged governments to prioritise the safe re-opening of schools when they begin easing lockdown restrictions.When reopening is not possible, UNICEF urged governments to incorporate compensatory learning for lost instructional time into school continuity and reopening plans."School opening policies and practices must include expanding access to education, including remote learning, especially for marginalised groups. Education systems must also be adapted and built to withstand future crises," the report said.

Indian officials have since tried to protect their way of life while opening up the islands to the fruits of development such as access to healthcare.Dr Avijit Roy, who is leading the fight against the outbreak of COVID-19 in the islands, said they had run tests on the Great Andamanese living on one of the coral-reef islands in the archipelago and four of the men had turned out to be positive."They have been moved to hospital," he said. Officials believe the men may have travelled to the main Andaman islands and caught the disease.The London-based Survival International said authorities must work to prevent the virus reaching other remote tribes.“It is extremely alarming that members of the Great Andamanese tribe tested positive for Covid-19. They will be all too aware of the devastating impact of epidemics that have decimated their people," said Sophie Grig, senior researcher.On the Indian mainland, in the eastern state of Odisha, a member of a hill tribe had also tested positive, a state official said.Cases have been rising steadily across India with the total number of cases standing at 3.2 million behind the United States and Brazil.The world's second-most populous country has posted the highest single-day caseload in the world every day since August 7, a Reuters tally based on official reporting showed. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-hits-fast-dwindling-tribe-in-andaman-islands-132220
27-08-2020||New Delhi||No. of COVID recoveries go past 25 lakh in India: Health ministry||The number of COVID-19 recoveries has surpassed 25 lakh in the country while the case fatality rate has further declined to 1.83 per cent, the Union health ministry said on Thursday.Meanwhile, the cumulative number of COVID-19 tests conducted in the country has reached nearly 3.9 crore, it added.The strategic approach of the country as regards COVID-19 response and management—"test, track, treat"—emphasises the key principle of high level of testing on a sustained basis, leading to an early diagnosis, the ministry said.A timely diagnosis furnishes opportunities to isolate or hospitalise the positive cases adequately in advance for appropriate treatment, it said, adding, "This in turn facilitates lower mortality rates and speedy recovery."A record 75,760 cases were added to the country's COVID-19 tally in a day, taking it to 33,10,234. The death toll due to the disease climbed to 60,472, with 1,023 fatalities reported in the last 24 hours, health ministry data updated at 8 am showed.Besides, 9,24,998 lakh COVID-19 tests were conducted across the country in a span of 24 hours, taking the total number of such tests performed to 3,85,76,510."With more patients recovering and being discharged from hospitals and home isolation, India's total COVID-19 recoveries surpassed 2.5 million today," the ministry highlighted.The recovery of 25,23,771 patients was made possible because of an effective implementation of the Centre-led policies by the states and Union territories, it said.A total of 56,013 COVID-19 patients have recovered in the span of 24 hours, the ministry's data showed.The recovery rate among COVID-19 patients in the country stands at 76.24 per cent, the ministry said.The country has registered nearly 18 lakh (17,97,780) more recoveries than the number of active cases (7,25,991, which are under active medical care).The sustained high recoveries have ensured that the actual caseload of the country—the active cases—accounts for 21.93 per cent of the total cases, the ministry said.A focus on the standard of care protocol as described in the Clinical Management Protocol of the Ministry of Health, better skilled doctors in the ICUs and hospitals, improved ambulance services, use of non-invasive oxygen and investigational therapies have led to the national case fatality rate maintaining its downward slide, it added."It has further slumped to stand at 1.83 pe cent as on date," the ministry said.Ten states and UTs are faring better in terms of the recovery rate than the national average.Delhi has the highest recovery rate at 90 per cent, Tamil Nadu at 85 per cent, Bihar at 83.80 per cent, Gujarat at 80.20 per cent, Rajasthan at 79.30 per cent and both Assam and West Bengal at 79.10 per cent.In terms of the case fatality rate, Assam has recorded 0.27 per cent, Bihar 0.42 per cent, Telangana 0.70 per cent, Andhra Pradesh 0.93 per cent, Chhattisgarh 0.95 per cent and Jharkhand 1.09 per cent, according to the ministry's data.The exponential rise in countrywide testing has been made possible through a graded expansion of the laboratory network, the ministry said.The number of testing laboratories has risen to 1,550 in the country so far—993 in the government sector and 557 private ones, it added.

When I read the history of vaccination, I got inspired by pioneers Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner who performed the trials on themselves. They inspired me to volunteer," he told PTI.Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) was a French chemist who proved that germs cause disease, and developed vaccines for anthrax and rabies, while Edward Jenner (1749-1823) was an English doctor and discoverer of vaccination for smallpox.The volunteer said he had also volunteered 10 years ago for clinical trials for a vaccine against the H1N1 (swine flu) virus.The phase-II clinical trial of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and being manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, started at the Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and Hospital here on Wednesday, with two volunteers being administered the Covishield vaccine.Hospital authorities said the identity of the volunteers cannot be revealed.The doctor said his 21-year-old daughter had also volunteered herself during the trial of a vaccine on cervical cancer in 2014."My daughter, who is pursuing a B Tech degree, has volunteered and become eligible for the (Covishield) trial as her reports COVID-19 and antibody came negative," he said.He said he is feeling good that he and his daughter could become a small part in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by volunteering for the trial. This is a noble and global effort for mankind, he added."Since yesterday, my vital signs are normal and I have started my routine work," he said.He said he has worked as a teacher at the medical college and tried to create awareness among the medical students about the vaccination trials. "To lead by an example, I volunteered myself for the H1N1 vaccine trial," he said.The volunteer said as per the ICMR panel norms, he is entitled to get travelling allowance for the hospital visits."If the volunteer has some health issues during the trial period, the treatment is free," he said.The second volunteer, a 32-year-old man, who is a PhD holder in statistics and works in a private firm, said he was excited to become a part of the trial."When I came to know about the trials through social media, I approached the hospital and enrolled myself for the voluntary vaccination trial," said the person, who hails from Aurangabad in Maharashtra.

27-08-2020||New Delhi||SC declines permission to carry out Muharram procession across country||The Supreme Court on Thursday declined permission for carrying out Muharram procession across the country and asked the Lucknow-based petitioner to move before the Allahabad High Court with his plea.The Apex Court asked how could it pass a general order for the whole country.A bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said it would lead to chaos and targeting of a particular community.“You are asking for a general order and then if we allow this there will be chaos. A particular community will be targeted for spreading COVID-19. We don’t want that. We, as a court, cannot risk the health of all people,” the bench, which heard the matter through video conferencing, said.The bench allowed the petitioner to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the high court with limited prayer of holding procession in Lucknow.The Apex Court was hearing a PIL was filed by Shia leader Syed Kalbe Jawad.

27-08-2020||New Delhi||Tablighi case: SC for preliminary determination of complaints against media by NBA||The Supreme Court on Thursday said the complaints against a section of the media for allegedly spreading communal hatred over Tablighi Jamaat congregation here should first go to a body like the National Broadcasting Association (NBA) for “preliminary determination”.The top court had earlier sought reports from the NBA and the Press Council of India (PCI) on the pleas of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and the Peace Party alleging that a section of the media was spreading communal hatred over the congregation in Delhi.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian asked the counsel for the Muslim bodies as to why they were not going before the regulatory bodies like the NBA.“If there is one body which is dealing with the issue, then why cannot you go there. We are not opposing the action but there should be prior verification,” the bench observed during the hearing conducted through video conferencing.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the petitioner, did not agree with the suggestion and said that he wanted the government to take action under the requisite statute.The counsel for the NBA said it had received the complaints and had taken cognisance of several complaints against media houses.The NBA is not a company and is headed by Justice AK Sikri, a former Apex Court judge, the counsel for the regulatory body said.The court then deferred the hearing on the pleas.The court had earlier said it would call a report from these bodies — the NBA and the PCI — and on that basis, it would be giving directions.The bench was hearing a batch of petitions including the one filed by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, which has sought directions to the Centre to stop the dissemination of “fake news” and take strict action against those responsible for it.“We are not going to give any wrong decision because of the time. We would like a report from you (NBA) and the Press Council of India. Mr Dave’s client may also appear before them,” the bench had said.In its reply filed in the court, the Centre has said that the attempt to seek a blanket gag order against the entire media on the Tablighi Jamaat event at Markaz Nizamuddin Markaz here will effectively destroy the freedom of the citizen to know about the affairs of respective sections of the society in the nation as also the right of the journalist to ensure an informed society.It had said the relief sought in the petition is nothing but a relief akin to a blanket gag order against the entire media in respect of reporting of the Nizamuddin Markaz incident.“In the respectful submission of the deponent, prayers of such sweeping nature ought not to be entertained by this court, in as much as, the same will inevitably result in muzzling, stifling and choking of free speech as guaranteed to the media house/journalist under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution of India,” the Centre had said in its reply affidavit.On April 13, the top court had declined to pass any interim order on the plea of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind seeking to restrain a section of media from allegedly spreading bigotry and communal hatred by linking the spread of coronavirus with the recent Nizamuddin Markaz incident, saying it would “not gag the press”.The Apex Court had also asked the Muslim body, which has alleged that a section of media is spreading communal hatred over the Tablighi Jamaat event at the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi, to implead the PCI as a party to the case.The plea of the Jamaat has alleged that unfortunate incident of Tablighi Jamaat event was being used to “demonise” and blame the entire Muslim community.At least 9,000 people had participated in the religious gathering at Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in Nizamuddin West in March and the congregation became a key source for the spread of COVID-19 in India as many of the participants had travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works.The plea has sought directions to the Centre to stop the dissemination of fake news and take strict action against the section of the media spreading bigotry and communal hatred in relation to the Nizamuddin Markaz issue.“It is submitted that such reporting has triggered communal antagonism and has also perpetrated hatred, resulting in fissiparous tendencies gaining a foothold, undermining and affecting communal harmony,” the plea has said.The petition further stated that this “demonisation” of the community has led to serious “threat to life and liberty of Muslims”, and has thus led to the violation of their “right to life under Article 21” of the Constitution.

27-08-2020||New Delhi||From Nirbhaya case to ugly gang wars, CCTVs help crack cases||On the night of December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was brutalised by five men and a juvenile in such a horrific manner that the whole country flared up in anger and outrage, came out in protests and forced the government to change rape laws.Initially the police had nothing in their hands except the versions of the victims. So where did the first clue come from? It was when a team of investigators reached hotels at Mahipalpur, they got the first clue.It was the CCTV cameras that captured the moving white bus and provided the Delhi police its first lead. Later, all the accused were caught and justice done.CCTV cameras have been crucial in not just identifying the accused in heinous crimes but also bringing them to justice in the court of law. The CCTV provides a first clue to the investigators who follow the lead and adds momentum in solving the case. Recently, many cases were solved by the police in Delhi and NCR with the help of the 'third eye'.In a case of brutal assault on a 12-year-old girl in Delhi's Paschim Vihar this month, the police managed to arrest the accused only after scanning at least 100 CCTV footages.In July this year, the brutal murder of a 25-year-old man was caught on CCTV camera in West Delhi, where he was stabbed to death allegedly by a juvenile and his two friends after the victim warned them not to perform bike stunts in Raghubir Nagar. The accused were later identified and nabbed.Police also believe that many times the CCTV cameras act as a deterrent for criminals."CCTV has been very crucial in not just solving important cases but also acting as a deterrent for the criminals. From murders to burglaries, it has always aided the investigative agencies and helped the police to bring the criminals to justice," said senior police officers.Even the hit-and-run case of Delhi police Traffic ACP Sanket Kaushik in Delhi's Rajokri on July 25 was solved after the cops scanned at least 15 CCTV footages. The accused tempo driver was arrested later.Even in the most brutal gang wars in Delhi and NCR, much crucial evidence has been provided by CCTVs installed in the area.Security cameras are invaluable to law enforcement agencies when they are trying to determine the accuracy of other types of evidence. Sometimes the authenticity of the witness statement is cross verified with the help of CCTV cameras installed."There have been cases when people try to mislead the police by manipulative theories about a murder or robbery or even theft. Sometimes they even have self-inflicted injuries to derail investigation. The CCTV cameras then play a crucial role in unearthing lies and manipulations and reach the actual culprit," said a senior police officer.For police having both the security camera footage and other types of evidence including witness or victim statements builds a much stronger case, which means higher conviction rates and greater consequences for people who commit crimes.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/from-nirbhaya-case-to-ugly-gang-wars-cctvs-help-crack-cases-132198
27-08-2020||New Delhi||Ola, Uber drivers threaten to go on strike from Sept 1||Drivers working with mobility platforms Ola and Uber have threatened to go on strike in Delhi-NCR from September 1 in support of their various demands like fare hike and extension of the moratorium on repayment of loans.Around two lakh drivers working with cab aggregators would take part in the strike if the government fails to solve our problems, said Kamaljeet Singh Gill, president of Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi.The cab drivers have demanded extension of the moratorium on loan payments to December 31, fare hike, increase in commission by cab aggregators and withdrawal of e-challans issued against their vehicles for speeding, according to a pamphlet circulated by the drivers.The strike by drivers of cab aggregators may cause hardships to a large number of commuters as Metro train services are yet to resume and buses are running at reduced capacity amid the COVID-19 pandemic.No reaction was immediately available from Ola or Uber.“Our immediate fear is that most cabs have loans against them. The Central Government’s moratorium on EMI payment will end on August 31 and banks will start seizing vehicles for EMI payment defaults after that,” Gill said.He said cab drivers have been hit hard by the pandemic and the lockdown.“Most of the drivers are finding it difficult to feed their families at this time and have no means to fulfil their financial obligations. Unless government helps us, there is no way we can work without fear of losing our vehicles,” Gill said.There are “huge” financial liabilities on drivers. Besides the EMI, many drivers also have large amounts of penalties to pay due to e-challans for speeding, he said.The drivers have also demanded that cab aggregators raise their fare and commission and share taxes paid by them while travelling between Delhi and National Capital (Region) destinations namely Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurgaon.The road tax payment relaxation should also be extended till December 31, Gill added.Gill said several letters had been written by the associations to the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Road Transport Minister seeking help but action was yet to be taken.In such a situation there is no option before the drivers but to stop work from September 1, he said.

27-08-2020||New Delhi||CBI questions TMC’s Kunal Ghosh in Saradha chit fund scam case||The CBI has questioned Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Kunal Ghosh in connection with the Saradha chit fund scam nearly a month after he was appointed national spokesperson of the party, ending doubts about his association with the Mamata Banerjee-led political outfit.The agency questioned Ghosh on Wednesday, officials said.Ghosh was the CEO of Saradha Media, an arm of the Saradha Group which was busted in 2013 for its illegal operations and was arrested by Bidhannagar police in 2013 for his alleged involvement in the chit fund scam.The TMC had reportedly suspended him for anti-party activities months before his arrest but there had been no formal statement or communication from the party on his status as its leader.“I had read in the newspapers that the party had suspended me. But I have never received any communication from the party in this regard. I was always in touch with the party. I am thankful to our leader Mamata Banerjee for allowing me to serve as spokesperson,” Ghosh had told PTI after his appointment as the party’s national spokesperson last month.The CBI has pressed the paddle on its probe into the Saradha and other chit fund cases with its chief RK Shukla asking the officers to register all pending 102 FIRs before next year.West Bengal, where a majority of chit fund cases were reported, is scheduled to go for assembly elections in April-May next year when BJP and other parties will try their best to unseat Banerjee who will complete a decade as Chief Minister.

27-08-2020||Patna/Bhubaneswar||Hunger, hopelessness driving migrant workers back to cities||Millions of migrant workers had earlier this year rushed home to Bihar and Odisha from the metro and mega cities to escape the COVID-19 fury, but hunger and joblessness are now driving them back to their places of work, even as coronavirus cases continue to surge.It's been five months since the pandemic struck, forcing the government to impose a nationwide lockdown in phases, and triggering a wave of migration from Delhi, Mumbai Bengaluru, Hyderabad among other cities - with many labourers hoping to start their life afresh in their hometowns.The Centre had launched Rs 50,000-crore Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan for the migrants in June, and the state governments had also assured them jobs.Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had promised the over-20 lakh migrants who returned to the state that his government would create jobs for them so that they are not forced to venture outside out of "majboori" (compulsion).The wait for employment, however, only got longer.With flight services having now resumed and special trains made available for interstate travel, the migrant workers in the two eastern states are making a beeline for leaving their hometowns.The employers, many of whom had virtually abandoned the migrant labourers, are sending them train and even flight tickets to fetch them back as factories whir back to life, construction activities pick up and the sowing season sets in.Pappan Singh, a Delhi-based mushroom grower who had sent 10 of his workers back to Bihar in May, has now booked air tickets worth over Rs 1 lakh, for them to return.Singh said his business was taking a hit in the absence of the labourers.Bhupesh Negi, Director, Jayprakash Narayan Airport in Patna, told PTI, "Flights to Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru are running full. Almost 80 per cent of the passengers are migrant labourers. Our staff members are helping them complete the travel formalities." Mail and express trains to places like Ahmedabad, Amritsar and Bengaluru are also running to capacity. This is in sharp contrast to the scene a few months ago, when desperate migrant workers returned home from these cities -- many of them walking, some cycling and others in trucks.The average occupancy in Muzaffarpur-Ahmedabad special train is 184 per cent, Jaynagar-Amritsar special 160 per cent, Danapur-Bengaluru city special 176 per cent, Darbhanga- Ahmedabad special 164 per cent, Darbhanga-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus 182 per cent and Rajgir-New Delhi special 175 per cent, a chart released by East Central Railway revealed.Binod Paswan of Samastipur's Khanpur block flew back to Indore recently, courtesy his employer at a flour mill."How long could I have waited for an alternative source of income at home? So when the factory owner telephoned me, I agreed to return to Indore," he said.According to officials, the flight of migrants from Darbhanga, Araria and Bhagalpur, however, has slowed down due to floods wreaking havoc in these areas over the past month.Official figures in Bihar suggest that a total of 193.63 lakh job cards have been issued so far. The state has also created 259.6 lakh mandays under MGNREGA.Bihar Minister of Information and Public Relations Department, Neeraj Kumar, told PTI that the government has been working sincerely to employ the returnees."During the RJD rule, when there was no such public health crisis, mass exodus of people from Bihar had happened, and nobody wanted to return. Now people chose to return to their homes as they have full faith in the Nitish Kumar government. Many of them have also got jobs," he said.Viswanath Shah of Muzaffarpur district, who returned to Gujarat to rejoin work as a mason, has a different story to share. "It was difficult to get a job in my hometown ... My family was finding it difficult to make ends meet. I had no option but to return to work."In Odisha, where over seven lakh people had returned from different parts of the country due to the coronavirus- triggered lockdown, the situation is no different.More than four lakh migrant workers returned to Ganjam district alone  with the district shortly after turning into a COVID-19 hotspot.Lack of employment opportunities is now pushing the returnees to embark on a reverse journey to their workplaces in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.Special buses are being arranged by employers to transport the labourers to their workplaces, one of the returnees said.According to Harihar Pal, an Odia industrialist based in Surat, the migrant labourers are returning to the cities as they failed to secure jobs in their native places.Also, factories in Gujarat, where labourers from the eastern coastal state form a major chunk of the workforce, are finding it difficult to run without them, he said.Odisha Industries and MSME Minister Dibya Shankar Mishra claimed only a few labourers who returned to their native places in the state due to the lockdown have gone back."Those who chose to stay back will surely be provided employment," he added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hunger-hopelessness-driving-migrant-workers-back-to-cities-132193

27-08-2020||New Delhi||Rs 10 lakh was put in Pak bank accounts of JeM commander before Pulwama blast||Mohammed Umar Farooq, the nephew of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar, had received Rs 10 lakh in his bank accounts in Pakistan to execute the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed in February last year, the NIA has said in its chargesheet.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe has shown that Rs 10 lakh in Pakistani currency was credited into three accounts of Farooq, the main accused in the suicide attack case who was later killed in an encounter with security forces, in Allied Bank and Mezaan Bank in that country days before the incident, officials said.They said the money was deposited by top leadership of the terror group JeM between January and February 2019.The terrorists had spent around Rs six lakh on procurement of explosives and the Maruti Eeco car used in the attack, the NIA said in its chargesheet filed on Tuesday before a special court in Jammu.A major chunk of the fund, about Rs 2.80 lakh, was used to procure around 200 kilograms of explosives including ammonium nitrate to trigger a massive car-laden IED attack on the CRPF convoy moving from Jammu to Srinagar on February 14, 2019, they said.The 200 kilograms of explosives comprised of a lethal concoction of RDX brought from Pakistan, gelatin sticks procured by Mudasir Ahmad, four kilograms of Aluminium powder bought on Amazon by accused Wazi Ul Islam and Calcium Ammonium Nitrate. The IED was fitted into the Eeco car in two containers weighing 160 kilogram and 40 kilograms to trigger the blast, the NIA said.Charge sheeted accused Shakir Bashir allegedly collected the explosives -- RDX, Gelatin sticks, Aluminium power and Calcium-Ammonium Nitrate -- and stocked them at his house for making the IED, the agency said.The terrorists had spent another Rs 2.5 lakh on purchasing and modifying the car to be used in the attack which was also parked in the front-yard of Shakir Bashir's house, it said.Some money was spent on miscellaneous expenses too, which included purchase of containers for fabricating the Improvised Explosive Devices, officials said.     The NIA probe has shown three bank accounts of Farooq, the main perpetrator, who received the money from January 2019 till February of the same year.The agency had filed a 13,800-page chargesheet against 19 accused persons in an NIA Special Court at Jammu in connection with last year's terrorist attack on the CRPF convoy at Lethpura, Pulwama, they said.Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist Adil Ahmad Dar, who was driving the car laden with explosives, had rammed it into the convoy killing 40 CRPF personnel and grievously injuring eight others.   "The investigation has revealed that Pulwama attack was a result of well-planned criminal conspiracy hatched by Pakistan-based leadership of terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammad. The JeM leaders have been sending their cadres to the terrorist training camps of Al-Qaida-Taliban-JeM and Haqqani-JeM in Afghanistan for receiving training in explosives and other terrorist tactics," the NIA said in the chargesheet.         The agency said the main accused Umar Farooq was trained in Afghanistan for explosives. He visited Afghanistan in 2016-17 and had infiltrated into India through the International Border at Jammu-Samba Sector in April, 2018, it said.Farooq took over as the Jaish-e-Mohammad Commander of Pulwama. "Accused Shakir Bashir, Insha Jan, Peer Tariq Ahmad Shah and Bilal Ahmad Kuchey provided all logistics and harboured the JeM terrorists in their houses," the NIA has said.Bashir allegedly did reconnaissance of the movement and deployment of security forces on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway.    A propaganda video clip of Mohammad Umar Farooq, Sameer Dar and Adil Dar was allegedly prepared at Insha Jan's house, which was released immediately after the suicide attack, it said.The terrorists had prepared the car for the attack by fitting it with the IED on February 6, 2019 but suspended their nefarious plans because of heavy snowfall, which led to closing of the National Highway for vehicular movement, the agency said.They attacked the convoy on February 14, 2019, when the National Highway reopened, they said.Bashir drove Adil Ahmad Dar till the National Highway, after which Dar drove the car and carried out the blast, it alleged.Damage to the tune of Rs 32.90 lakh was caused to public property, the probe agency said.The NIA found that JeM leadership consisting of Masood Azhar, Rouf Asgar and Ammar Alvi alias Chacha alias Chota Masood handled the operation by continuously giving directions and guidance to the Pakistani JeM infiltrators before and after the attack.

27-08-2020||New Delhi||Further delay in conducting JEE, NEET will compromise students’ future: Over 150 academicians to PM||Over 150 academicians from various universities in India and abroad have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that delaying the medical and engineering entrance exams — JEE-Mains and NEET — any further will mean compromising the future of students.Referring to the growing chorus against conducting these exams in September in view of the rising COVID-19 cases, the academicians said in their letter: “Some are trying to play with future of students to propel their own political agenda.”“The youths and students are the future of the nation but in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, clouds of uncertainty have gathered over their careers too. There are a lot of apprehensions about admission and classes which need to be resolved at the earliest,” they have said in their letter.Like every year, this year, too, millions of students had passed their Class 12 exams and were now waiting at home to eagerly take the next step, the letter said.“The government has announced the dates for JEE-Mains and NEET…any further delay in conducting the exams will result in the waste of a precious year for students. The dreams and future of our youth and students cannot be compromised at any cost. However, some are trying to play with the future of our students simply to propel their own political agenda and oppose the government,” it said.The signatories include academicians from the Delhi University, IGNOU, Lucknow University, JNU, BHU, IIT Delhi and Indian academicians from foreign universities such as the University of London, University of California, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Ben Gurion University, Israel, among others.“We strongly believe that the Central Government will successfully conduct the JEE and NEET exams taking full precautions to ensure that the future of students is taken care of and the academic calendar for 2020-21 is rolled out,” it added.Over 14 lakh admit cards for the medical and engineering entrance exams — NEET and JEE — were downloaded after the National Testing Agency (NTA) released them on Wednesday, even as the issue was discussed extensively during a meeting of chief ministers of non-BJP ruled states who decided to jointly move the Supreme Court to seek deferment of these exams.The issue, which has been a matter of intense public discourse for the past few months, has evoked contrasting views with many backing the holding of the tests arguing that not doing so would result in a ‘zero academic year’ for students while the Opposition and a section of activists demanding their postponement in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.The issue also took political undertones on Wednesday with Opposition leaders attacking the Central Government.While the NEET is scheduled to be held on September 13, engineering entrance exam JEE Main has been planned from September 1 to 6. Around 9.53 lakh candidates have registered for JEE-Mains and 15.97 lakh students have registered for NEET.These exams have already been deferred twice in the wake of the pandemic.JEE-Main was originally supposed to be held from April 7 to 11 but postponed to July 18 to 23, NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3, then pushed to July 26.They were postponed again and are now scheduled in September.

27-08-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Borrow from market & pay dues, states to insist||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 26Battle lines are drawn for the special GST Council meeting tomorrow. Seven Opposition CMs will press the Centre to borrow from the market to pay four months of revenue collection dues. Representatives of Kerala and Delhi are likely to join forces with them at the meeting.The Opposition CMs attended a webinar with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and discussed plans to approach the Supreme Court as well as call on the President or PM to implement the Centre’s obligation to pay states the promised GST compensation.Sources indicate that the Centre may ask the states to borrow from the market as per their requirement while it would backstop the loan with sovereign guarantees. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to point out that revenue collection is a collective responsibility and while the Centre would do its best, states should also share the burden.This cooperative approach is a far cry from the early days of the pandemic when the Centre had sought to impose stiff conditionalities if the states wanted to borrow more. The Centre may point out that the impact of the pandemic was not anticipated when promising a 14 per cent increase in states’compensation. It may also suggest tweaking the GST to bring in additional revenue. But at the centre stage will be a discussion on who would shoulder the burden of borrowings to make up for the GST shortfall. Figuring it outRs95,444 crore cess collection for financial year 2019-20Rs1,65,302 crore transferred to states during the periodRs2 lakh crore shortfall expected this fiscal year||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/borrow-from-market-pay-dues-states-to-insist-131954
27-08-2020||New Delhi||Supreme Court to Centre: Can’t hide behind RBI on interest waiver during moratorium||The Supreme Court on Wednesday took note of the Centre’s alleged inaction and asked it to clarify its stand within a week on interest waiver for deferred loan installments during the moratorium period announced due to Covid-19 lockdown.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said the Centre had not made its stand clear on the issue despite the fact that ample powers were available with it under the Disaster Management Act and was “hiding behind the RBI”.The apex court granted time to the government after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought a week to file a response. “My lordships may not say that. We are working in coordination with the RBI,” Mehta said.The Bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah, asked the Solicitor General to clarify stand on the Act and whether additional interest on existing interest could be accrued. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioner, told the Bench that the loan moratorium deadline would end on August 31 and sought its extension.The apex court posted the matter for hearing on September 1.The top court had earlier said there was “no merit in charging interest on interest” for deferred loan instalments.The Bench was hearing a plea filed by Agra resident Gajendra Sharma, who has sought a direction to declare the portion of the RBI’s March 27 notification “as ultra vires to the extent it charges interest on the loan amount during the moratorium period, which creates hindrance and obstruction in ‘right to life’ guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution”. — PTI‘Clarify within 1 week’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-to-centre-cant-hide-behind-rbi-on-interest-waiver-during-moratorium-131971
27-08-2020||Special GST Council meeting today ||Sonia leads 7 CMs to take on govt over GST dues, exam row||Aditi TandonTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 26Two days after surviving a challenge to her leadership in the party, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi was back in action today as she got chief ministers of seven states ruled by non-NDA parties to pledge unity against the Centre on issues of GST dues and the conduct of JEE (Main) and NEET-UG.Refusal to pay dues amounts to betrayalCentre hasn’t paid the mandatory GST compensation of 14% to states. This refusal is nothing short of betrayal. — Sonia Gandhi, Congress ChiefIn stark contrast to Monday when she sat frigidly through a Congress Working Committee meeting that trashed a letter few leaders had earlier written seeking a “visible party chief”, Sonia wore an effortless look today. She allowed West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to conduct the virtual meeting even when the latter kept saying, “But you are the senior leader, you should conduct the meeting.”Punjab staring at Rs 25k crore deficitWe all must meet the Prime Minister. How will states run if the Centre does not pay us? — Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab CMIn the end, the CMs of Maharashtra (Uddhav Thackeray), Jharkhand (Hemant Soren) and four Congress-ruled states (Punjab’s Capt Amarinder Singh, Rajasthan’s Ashok Gehlot, Chhattisgarh’s Bhupesh Baghel and Puducherry’s V Narayanasamy) unanimously agreed to the need of filing a petition in the apex court for review of an earlier order rejecting the postponement of the JEE and NEET-UG.Distribute disaster funds to statesGive states money from disaster funds — Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal CMMamata and Capt Amarinder led the demand for urgent legal recourse on exams after Sonia said the Centre was dealing with the issue “very uncaringly”. Capt Amarinder cited the rising Covid infections in Punjab to argue that even UGC’s exams should be postponed.Sonia earlier slammed the Centre for not paying the mandatory GST compensation of 14 per cent for the current year to states, noting, “This refusal is nothing short of betrayal by the government.” All CMs at the meet agreed to jointly petition the President and the PM on the issue and vociferously demand payment of dues in tomorrow’s GST Council conference.The meeting today helped lay ground for opposition unity with Sonia explaining its timing, “Parliament is expected to meet in three weeks. I thought we should have this interaction so that we have a coordinated approach.”The meeting happened in a relaxed environment with Sonia mostly listening except to say “I agree”, when Mamata, Soren and Uddhav pressed for “opposition unity against the Centre and its agencies”.“We must meet more often and not just when there is a crisis. If we are united, even crisis will fear us. Let us decide whether we will fight the Centre or fear it,” said Uddhav while Mamata earlier said the government was using its agencies to intimidate the Opposition.Sonia earlier termed National Education Policy 2020 a “setback for progressive, secular and scientific values”, saying “it should worry us”.The Punjab and Chhattisgarh governments have formed committees to study the NEP and its financial and general impact on the states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-leads-7-cms-to-take-on-govt-over-gst-dues-exam-row-131997
