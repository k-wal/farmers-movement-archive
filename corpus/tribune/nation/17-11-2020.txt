17-11-2020||Noida (UP)||Random COVID-19 test for people coming from Delhi to Noida from Wednesday||People coming from Delhi to Noida will be randomly tested for COVID-19 from Wednesday, the administration of Gautam Buddh Nagar, adjoining the national capital, in Uttar Pradesh said.The decision for random sampling came during an online meeting of senior administration and health department officials with District Magistrate Suhas L Y on Tuesday amid a spike in COVID-19 cases in Delhi.There will be no restriction on free movement of people between Noida and Delhi, Suhas told PTI.“In view of the rising cases of coronavirus in Delhi, the district magistrate has directed officials to form teams that would be deployed at Noida-Delhi borders at DND and Chilla to randomly check people coming from the national capital for the infection,” he said.The district magistrate said the recent rise in cases in Gautam Buddh Nagar because of which the strategy to fight the pandemic is being “retuned”.“This rise has been due to cross-border infection from areas like Delhi and others. So, a random sampling of such people will be done and all institutions (here) will be issued advisory to look out for symptomatic people, track them early and provide them with whatever treatment is required,” Suhas told reporters.He said there was an increased cross-border movement of people during the recent days of festivals, hence the coming few days are going to be “crucial” and the health department has also been directed to make adequate preparations in hospitals.He also appealed to the people to follow all COVID-19 protocols like wearing masks or covers, practicing social distancing in public places and avoiding casual approach against the infection.The random sampling will be done by a rapid antigen-based test, the DM said. Gautam Buddh Nagar has recorded 20,566 cases of COVID-19 including 73 deaths, with 1,236 active cases, according to official data on Tuesday.However, Delhi has recorded over one lakh new coronavirus cases and around 1,200 deaths between November 1 and November 16 while nearly 94,000 patients recovered during the same period, according to official data.The national capital has witnessed a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases since October 28 when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11.

But then, if at all it has to be obtained, we are examining what we need to do...and will work out a strategy,” he said.As for both the vaccine candidates of Moderna and Pfizer, Paul said, “We are watching the developments. They have announced the preliminary results and have not got the regulatory approvals.” The official expressed hope on the success of the five vaccines that are under different phases of trial in the country. The doses of these vaccines will be available in sufficient numbers.Giving an update, he said the phase-3 trial of the Oxford vaccine of the Serum Institute is almost near completion, while the phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started.Another indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Zydus Cadila has completed the phase-2 clinical trial, Paul said.Dr Reddy’s Laboratories will soon start the combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India. Also, the Biological E Limited has started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE last week said their vaccine candidate was found to be more than 90 per cent effective in preventing COVID-19. Moderna on Monday said the independent National Institutes of Health-appointed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate against COVID-19, found it to have an efficacy of 94.5 per cent.Asked if the government is working on a draft scheme on COVID-19 vaccine distribution, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said one of the mandates of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 is to have a time-bound scheme to ensure the fulfilment of the commitment that the prime minister made to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, where he said the citizens will be inoculated as soon as the vaccine becomes available.“A document in this regard is in its final stages of preparation. We have shared it with the state governments and have taken their inputs. We are also in the process of finalising the database of the priority population groups, who will be administered the vaccine if and when it becomes available, and there also, we are in collaboration with the states and other central ministries,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/storage-of-pfizers-covid-vaccine-challenge-for-most-nations-india-examining-possibilities-govt-171727

17-11-2020||Kolkata||Shakib Al Hasan gets death threats for attending 'Kali Puja' in Kolkata; cricketer apologises||Abject surrender of Bangladeshi cricketer, Shakib Al Hasan, after allegedly receiving death threats from a fanatic Islamist has enraged the Taslima Nasreen, the Bangladeshi authoress, who was hounded out of her country for refusing to apologise for her criticisms against the religion.Hasan, an ace all-rounder, buckled under the threat after a young man from Sylhet, Mohsin Taklukdar, came on Facebook Live, and said, that he "would kill the cricketer for daring to inaugurate a Kali Puja in Kolkata".Swinging a Katana-like sword, Talukdar said, that how could the Bangladeshi cricketer associate himself with idol-worshipping despite being a Muslim.Rattled by this threat, the Bangladeshi southpaw shared a video on YouTube, which showed him promising to be a better Muslim, and never do anything in the future, that could hurt the sentiments of his co-religionists.Describing himself as a "proud Muslim", Hasan said, that he had only lit a lamp in the community Kali Puja in Kolkata after being requested by local Trinamool Congress MLA Paresh Paul."Being a Muslim, how can I inaugurate a Kali Puja", a meekly Hasan said.Hasan's capitulation prompted Taslima Nasreen to call him "selfish", and one who does not mind compromising with evil."It's not uncommon for Muslims to go to Puja fest in Bangladesh. Shakib didn't need to say, that he's a proud Muslim, he won't go to puja fest, his religion is above other religions. He is protected, the terrorist was arrested. Famous people are so selfish, they compromise with evil forces”, Nasreen took to the microblogging website.“Hundreds of thousands of Islamists took to the streets in Bangladesh for demanding my execution by hanging and set a price on my head for criticising Islam, govt filed a case against me for committing blasphemy. But I didn't apologise. A lone man threatened Sakib &Shakib apologised! Shame”, she wrote in a series of tweets.Shakib enraged Islamists in Bangladesh after he showed up at the Kali Puja of “Amra Shobai Club” at Kankurgachi in Kolkata.The paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion (RAB)—an anti-terror force of Bangladesh—arrested Talukdar on Tuesday morning from Sunamganj area of Sylhet district.Mohsin’s controversial video posted on Sunday has been shared by 400 users. While the video on Talukdar’s Facebook wall has been frozen, the shared videos could still be accessed.Bangladeshi man arrested for giving death threat to cricketer Shakib Bangladesh police on Tuesday arrested a man who allegedly issued death threats to cricket all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan for inaugurating a Kali puja pandal in Kolkata, even as the cricketer issued an apology and said he only joined the function briefly.A joint team of the elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police arrested 28-year-old Mohsin Talukdar from south-eastern Sunamganj district after 24 hours of a massive manhunt.“He is now in our custody awaiting subsequent legal procedures,” a police officer familiar with the development told PTI.After the cricketer’s picture at the programme in Kolkata’s “Amra Sobai Club” went viral, Talukdar went live on Facebook on Sunday night carrying a large machete in his hand and threatened to kill Shakib, saying he hurt his religious sentiments by inaugurating the Puja event in the West Bengal’s capital city.By early morning, Talkudar, however, withdrew the threat and apologised in another live video on social media and then went into hiding. He was later traced in neighbouring Sunamganj district. His wife was previously detained for questioning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shakib-al-hasan-gets-death-threats-for-attending-kali-puja-in-kolkata-cricketer-apologises-171708
17-11-2020||Moscow||Putin says Sputnik V vaccine could be produced in India and China||President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday called for a joint effort by the BRICS countries on the development of the coronavirus vaccines as he suggested that Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19 could be produced in China and India, which are members of the five-nation bloc.“We believe it is important to speed up the establishment of the centre for development and research of BRICS vaccines, which we agreed to do two years ago, upon the initiative of our South African friends,” Putin said while addressing the 12th BRICS summit via videoconferencing.The summit, hosted by President Putin, was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.Putin said that Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine that was registered in August could be produced in China and India, both members of the BRICS, Sputniknews reported.“The Russian Direct Investment Fund has reached agreements with its Brazilian and Indian partners on conducting clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine, it has also reached an agreement with pharmaceutical companies in China and India to launch production of the vaccine in these countries not just to cover their needs, but for third countries as well,” Putin said.On August 11, Russia became the world’s first country to register a coronavirus vaccine, dubbed Sputnik V. The vaccine was developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute, while the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is investing in the production and promotion of the vaccine abroad. Another Russian vaccine, EpiCoronaVac, produced by Vector Research Centre, was registered in October.President Putin at the time said the Sputnik V works “quite effectively” and forms a “stable immunity” against the deadly disease. He had disclosed that one of his daughters had tested a Russian COVID-19 vaccine on herself and that she is feeling well.Sputnik V vaccine has shown 92 per cent efficacy in preventing COVID-19, according to interim trial results announced by the country’s health ministry last week.The vaccine has been named Sputnik-V. The name is a reference to the surprise 1957 launch of the world’s first satellite by the Soviet Union.The 12th BRICS summit was originally scheduled to be held in Saint Petersburg in July but had to be postponed due to the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic.So far the coronavirus has infected more than 54 million people around the world and killed more than 1.3 million people even as governments implemented strict lockdowns and restrictions to slow the spread of the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.A second wave of infections is threatening to derail economies and impact lives again as countries have gradually begun to ease restrictions and open up.The BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) is known as an influential bloc that represents over 3.6 billion people, or half of the world’s population. The BRICS countries have a combined GDP of USD 16.6 trillion. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/putin-says-sputnik-v-vaccine-could-be-produced-in-india-and-china-171706
17-11-2020||New Delhi||Artist Anjum Singh passes away following battle with cancer||Eminent contemporary Indian artist Anjum Singh passed away on Tuesday after losing a prolonged battle with cancer, art collector Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, said. She was 53.“Anjum Singh was a wonderful artist who passed away after a long but brave and courageous battle with cancer,” she told PTI.Born to renowned artists Arpita and Paramjit Singh, art came naturally to Singh, but she started her professional journey as an artist with a Bachelors in Fine Arts from Kala Bhawan, Santiniketan, followed by a Masters degree in the subject from College of Art, New Delhi.Her last show “I Am Still Here” that was held last year at the Talwar Gallery here, documented through her own paintings her journey of living with cancer, which she was first diagnosed with in 2014. “Today Anjum left us after a six and a half year courageous battle with cancer. She leaves a void that will forever remain so, but her art, her smile and tenacity to fight will remain, in our hearts and more,” the Delhi-based gallery wrote on Instagram.The show, said curator Ranjit Hoskote, was “a poignant affirmation of presence, surprise, and the survivor’s determination”.“I am deeply saddened to learn of Anjum Singh’s passing at 53, no age to go. She fought cancer over six years; her last exhibition, held a year ago, was titled ‘I am still here’, a poignant affirmation of presence, surprise, the survivor’s determination. Rest in peace, Anjum,” he wrote on Twitter.Expressing her condolences, Nadar said Singh would continue to live on through her work which was “independently noteworthy”.“Her exhibition last year entitled ‘I am still here’ brought together a personal and passionate set of works that focused largely inwards as she grappled with her disease of the last few years. Our condolences go out to the whole family, she will remain alive through her work,” the KNMA founder said.Singh also trained at The Corcoran School of Art, Washington DC from 1992 to 1994, and was a recipient of the Charles Wallace Fellowship, which led her to work at Gasworks, London in 2002-2003.Her works are in the collections of Kiran Nadar Museum of Art and have been on view at Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai, and at The San Jose Museum of Art, California.Renowned Hindi writer and trustee of the Raza Foundation Ashok Vajpeyi remembered Singh as an artist with “an intense aesthetic vision and innovative zeal”.“The Raza Foundation deeply mourns the passing away of Anjum Singh. She emerged as a distinctive painter of the young generation, with an intense aesthetic vision and innovative zeal.“She struggled bravely with a killing disease. Her parents, the well known painters Arpita Singh and Paramjit Singh have suffered a grievous loss. The Raza Foundation is with them in this tragic moment,” the poet wrote on Facebook.Singh’s works were recognisable in her use of bright colours, which were recurrent in her works on the continued degradation of the environment.She was inspired by the “simple and mundane” element of the life that surrounded her, recalled curator Roobina Karode.“Simple and mundane forms engaged Anjum. With cheerful colours she articulated the apathy towards erosion of the environment. A quest on corporeal vulnerability occupied her works right from her student days in Santiniketan, until her long and painful battle with cancer that she fought so bravely.“Her solo exhibition, ‘I am still here’ showcased deeply sensitive works expressing fragility and delicacy,” the KNMA director said.Artist Jayasri Barman took to Instagram to remember the late artist’s “poignant and powerful” work.“Anjum’s art had the beautiful ability to portray pain into a collective experience. They were poignant, and powerful. Extremely saddened to use ‘had’ for her. It pains me to think of her wonderful parents...Praying for her soul,” she wrote.Khoj Studios, a not- for-profit, contemporary arts organisation of which Singh was a former member, also mourned her loss.“It is with a heavy heart that we bid farewell to our incredibly talented friend and artist Anjum Singh. Her association with Khoj began in the year 2000, when as a member of Khoj , she also attended the Khoj workshop at Modinagar. She was an integral part of the Khoj family in thought and spirit.Anjum, you will be thoroughly missed but your work, your courage and tenacity will remain with us. Rest in Peace,” the organisation said.Politician Derek O’Brien also expressed his condolences on Twitter.Gone too soon. One of the brightest from the Indian art world. Anjum Singh, 53. Her powerful and moving final exhibition of her work is titled ‘I am still here.’ Condolences to her parents, artists extraordinaire, Paramjit Singh and Arpita Singh. Travel well, Anjum. pic.twitter.com/iL32Cf41lX  “Gone too soon. One of the brightest from the Indian art world. Anjum Singh, 53.

17-11-2020||New Delhi||Niti Aayog proposes setting up oversight body for AI||Government think-tank Niti Aayog has proposed setting up an oversight body which will play an enabling role regarding technical, legal, policy and societal aspects of artificial intelligence (AI).In its draft ‘Working Document: Enforcement Mechanisms for Responsible #AIforAll’, Niti Aayog said the oversight body must have industry representatives as well as experts from legal, humanities and social science fields.“A flexible risk-based approach must be adopted. In this regard, the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence proposes an Oversight Body.“The oversight body must play an enabling role under the following broad areas: research, technical, legal, policy, societal issues of AI,” the draft document said.The oversight mechanism may serve in an advisory capacity and it must interface with existing regulators across sectors.“Technology easily blends across other technologies and must not be viewed in silo. Ethics should be seen as not just limited to AI but also other emerging technologies such as AR (augmented reality),VR (virtual reality) etc,” it said.The draft document also noted that the government may support research on the impact of AI in the Indian context and fundamental research to advance ‘Responsible AI’ by prioritising funding opportunities and fellowship programmes.“International alliances may be leveraged to facilitate exchange of multi-disciplinary talent, data, and consolidation of research efforts, especially in areas of social good,” it said.It also said an ethics committee may be constituted for the procurement, development, operations phase of AI systems and be made accountable for adherence to the Responsible AI principles.The Aayog has invited comments on the draft document by stakeholders by December 15.The Niti Aayog had in June 2020 released a draft paper titled ‘Towards Responsible#AIForAll’ and had said there is a potential of large scale adoption of AI in a variety of social sectors.“The government may fund specific research projects in responsible Artificial Intelligence and introduce ethics of AI into the university curriculum as the new-age technology is expected to boost India’s annual growth rate by 1.3 per cent by 2035,” the draft document had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/niti-aayog-proposes-setting-up-oversight-body-for-ai-171701

We have been hardcore Hindutvawadi, are so today and will be so tomorrow too... whenever the country needs it, the Shiv Sena will come to the fore with the sword of Hindutva,” Raut said.He was replying to a question on the BJP’s repeated claim that the Shiv Sena was diverting from the Hindutva that was championed by the late Sena patriarch.To a question on media reports about BJP leader CT Ravi seeking renaming of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi after Swami Vivekananda, Raut asked if anything would come out of such a move.“Swami Vivekananda has always been a role model for us. But what will happen by changing the name? Instead, another big university of international level must be set up in the name of Swami Vivekananda,” the MP said.He said India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had always been the “pride of the country” and it will “not be right” to change the university’s name due to hatred and political motive.

Don't hesitate, get yourself tested," he said.About the national capital, where cases have risen alarmingly and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sought the Centre's help, the Health Ministry said that in June, Delhi had carried out very few tests per day. But, this number rose to 50,000 in September and plateaued out.Expressing disappointment, the ministry said the implementation of the Central SOPs had become lax in spite of Delhi having more than 4,000 containment zones.It noted that now, an active case search, and house to house surveillance need to be stepped up in the national capital.Union Home Minister Amit Shah had held an emergency meeting on Sunday, where he had issued 12 point instructions, including on augmenting ICU beds and doctors, and cracking down on those not following Covid-appropriate behaviour.Niti Aayog member Dr V.K. Paul, who was also present at the media briefing, said that the ministry is ensuring that 16 people are being traced for every positive case in Delhi."We are attempting to increase the number of ICU beds in Delhi to over 6,000, against 3,500 right now. That will put us in a safe zone," he said.House to house surveys will also be conducted in containment zones."This will also be undertaken in other vulnerable areas. Total 7,000-8,000 teams will be put on this," he added.The Health Ministry also said that increased ICU beds, more RT-PCR testing and quarantine contacts are some of the efforts they are taking to ensure the situation in Delhi is contained.Bhushan said: "Since the month of October, the number of cases are at a record high. Though fewer cases have been detected in the last 48 hours, but we can not come to a conclusion now, right now." But the Health Ministry is preparing for a more serious situation in Delhi, should it arise.Paul said: "If cases go up, we will ramp up our capacity to monitor people in home isolation to 40,000 at any given time. We have kept a plan along with the Delhi government ready." About the progress of vaccines, Paul added that the one of the Serum Institute is in the third phase. Meanwhile, at least five vaccines are under trial in India, out of which two are in the third phase, he added..“In the last two days decision of urgent actions taken by the government included an increase in overall beds, including ICU beds, doubling testing to 1-1.2 lakh per day; right mix of RTPCR and antigen tests, strengthening and augmenting home care support, mobilising doctors and nurses, enforcing quarantine of contacts, containment zone SOPs and COVID appropriate behaviour,” he said. --- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/effect-of-polls-festivals-yet-to-play-in-full-warns-health-ministry-171692
17-11-2020||---||Countries supporting terrorists need to be held guilty: PM Modi at BRICS summit||New Delhi, November 17Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday sought the backing of other BRICS members for reforms in the UN Security Council and for the waiver of some Intellectual Property Regulations (IPR) norms for Covid-related development of vaccines, testing and treatment.Speaking at the BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) summit, PM Modi described the finalisation of the BRICS Counter-Terrorism Strategy as “important achievement” and assured that India will take this work forward during its Chairmanship of BRICS in 2021.“Terrorism is the biggest problem facing today. Countries that support and help terrorism are also held guilty and we need to fight this problem in a united manner,’’ he said.The Strategy proposes to work out common measures and more closely coordinate in the UN and other forums on counter-terrorism issues. It also seeks to implement the UN Global CT-Strategy as well as early adoption of the India-piloted Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT).While seeking reforms in the UNSC besides the WTO and WHO to correspond to present day realities, PM Modi assured that India as a founding member of the UN was fully committed to multilateralism. India had lost the highest number of peacekeepers on UN duty, he reminded other BRICS members.India as the Chair of BRICS in 2021 will intensify cooperation in digital health and traditional mission besides seeking to achieve closure on the Russian initiatives launched this year.The PM spoke on the Atmanirbhar Bharat policy whose twin-aims of self-reliance and resilient India can be a multiplier for the global economy and contribute significantly to global value chains. “We saw this in Covid. Due to the inherent production capacity of Indian pharma, India could send medicines to 150 countries,” he said while referring to the India-South Africa proposal for certain waivers in IPR to Covid 19 vaccine treatment and testing. Interestingly, Brazil is opposed to this proposal while China is backing it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/countries-supporting-terrorists-need-to-be-held-guilty-pm-modi-at-brics-summit-171690

17-11-2020||New Delhi||Second phase of Malabar exercise begins in northern Arabian Sea||The navies of India, the US, Australia and Japan on Tuesday began the second phase of the Malabar naval exercise in the northern Arabian Sea involving two aircraft carriers and a number of frontline warships, submarines and maritime reconnaissance aircraft, officials said.The major highlight of the four-day exercise is participation of Indian Navy's Vikramaditya carrier battle group and the Nimitz strike group of the US Navy. The USS Nimitz is the world's largest warship.The first phase of the Malabar exercise took place in the Bay of Bengal from November 3 to 6 and featured a number of complex drills including anti-submarine and anti-air warfare operations.The Australian Navy has deployed its HMAS Ballarat, an Anzac-class frigate while the Japanese Navy has sent its leading destroyer JS Murasame for the exercise.The mega exercise is taking place at a time India and China are locked in an over six-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh.This exercise is involving coordinated operations of increasing complexity among the navies of the four countries which are part of the Quad or Quadrilateral Coalition, officials said."The two carriers, along with other ships, submarines and aircraft of the participating navies, would be engaged in high-intensity naval operations over four days," the Indian Navy said on Monday.A carrier battle group or carrier strike group is a mega naval fleet comprising an aircraft carrier, accompanied by a large number of destroyers, frigates and other ships.The Navy said the exercise would include cross-deck flying operations and advanced air defence exercises by MIG 29K fighters of Vikramaditya and F-18 fighters and E2C Hawkeye from Nimitz.Apart from Vikramaditya and its fighter and helicopter air-wings, the Indian Navy is also deploying destroyers Kolkata and Chennai, stealth frigate Talwar and fleet support ship Deepak in the exercise.The Indian contingent is being led by Rear Admiral Krishna Swaminathan, Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet.Last month, India announced that Australia will be part of the Malabar exercise which effectively made it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad which is primarily focusing on containing China's military expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise came two weeks after foreign ministers of the 'Quad' member nations held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/second-phase-of-malabar-exercise-begins-in-northern-arabian-sea-171675

17-11-2020||New Delhi||Paulo Coelho's new book motivates to take risks||Best-selling author Paulo Coelho's latest book is a fable titled, "The Archer” that is aimed at motivating readers to take risks, build courage and embrace the unexpected journey fate has to offer, publishers Penguin said on Tuesday.The book, which comes with illustrations by Christoph Niemann, has been translated from Portuguese by Margaret Jull Costa.The story revolves around Tetsuya, a man once famous for his prodigious gift with a bow and arrow but who has since retired from public life, and the boy who comes searching for him.The boy has many questions, and in answering them Tetsuya illustrates his answers using the bow and arrow as a metaphor to explain the tenets of a meaningful life."In fact, life is simple. We complicate a lot. And a fable or allegory talks to the hidden parts of ourselves. You learn the essence of life by paying attention to the simple things that surround you.“This is basically the idea of 'The Archer'. I'm talking about everything from friendship and beyond: the importance of the bow, the importance of concentration. At the end of the day, it is life. You learn by living your life fully," said the Brazilian novelist, best known for his book "The Alchemist".In the book, he provides the framework for a rewarding life — "hard work, passion, purpose, thoughtfulness, the willingness to fail and the urge to make a difference".Coelho recently has also come out with two illustrated tales for children—"A,B,C,D…" and "The Meaning of Peace” that talk about—speaking of empathy, faith, trust and hope in the time of the coronavirus pandemic."Illustrating literature is difficult, especially since Coelho's words do not need embellishment. My idea was to create a visual layer in a parallel sphere, which would help enjoy the book even more," said Niemann on the book.Coelho was born in 1947 in the city of Rio De Janerio. He has been the United Nations Messenger of Peace since 2007 and it has allowed him to promote the intercultural dialogue and to focus on the needs of the children.His books "The Spy", "Adultery", "Inspirations" and "Hippie" have been published by Penguin. "The Archer" is presently available for sale on online and offline stores.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/paulo-coelhos-new-book-motivates-to-take-risks-171634

But each time the rank and file of the Congress Party has shown undivided and firm belief in the party leadership and that is why we came out of it stronger and united after every crisis.”“There was no need for Kapil Sibal to mention our internal issue in the media. This has hurt the sentiments of the party workers across the country,” he added.Gehlot said Congress was the only party which could keep this nation united and take it forward on the path of comprehensive development. “We have improved with each and every crisis and also formed the UPA government in 2004 under the able leadership of Sonia Gandhi. We shall overcome this time too,” he added.Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said Rahul Gandhi was fighting for an ideology, which was the centrist.Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who was one of the 23 leaders who wrote a letter seeking sweeping reforms in the party, has again questioned the functioning of the party leadership.Contending that he was “compelled to speak publicly” as there was “no forum in the party to discuss party issues”, he said the Congress needed efficient and senior leaders to manage the elections.His statements, which came in wake of the party’s dismal performance in the Bihar Assembly polls as well as the string of bypolls in various states, are being viewed as an apparent attack on team Rahul Gandhi whose handpicked team was involved in the election process.He also expressed unhappiness that no senior party leader had spoken on the Bihar results.Only a few Congress leaders have spoken out after the Bihar results in which the party was found to be the weakest link in the opposition combine. It won only 19 seats of the 70 it contested. It also lost the bypolls where it was in direct contest with the BJP.

17-11-2020||New Delhi||Tamil Nadu elections: Amid friction with ally AIADMK, possibility of BJP-Alagiri tie-up||Amid visible friction with the ruling AIADMK and reports of a possible tie-up with M K Alagiri for the 2021 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, all eyes are now on Home Minister Amit Shah's Chennai visit on November 21.Though both sides are playing close to the chest, there are talks of a "one-on-one" between Shah and Alagiri—the son of the late M Karunanidhi and brother of DMK president M K Stalin—in Chennai during the visit. While Alagiri has been looking for avenues to come on his own after being sidelined by Stalin, BJP, too, is looking for suitable partners to expand in the state. Reports suggest that Alagiri is planning to launch a political outfit, expectedly called ‘Kalaignar DMK’ or ‘KDMK.’Even though observers dismiss the "political advantage" of Alagiri, sources say for the BJP—which has no major political base in Tamil Nadu and had drawn big nought in its alliance with the AIADMK in 2019 Lok Sabha elections—any "help" will be welcome.Besides, superstar Rajinikanth continues to remain non-committal and friction with the ruling AIADMK party is widening over the saffron party’s ‘Vetrivel Yatra’. Though a recent meeting between RSS ideologue Gurumurthy and Rajinikanth had drawn much interest, the superstar said he had been advised against entering politics by doctors during the pandemic as he had undergone a kidney transplant.The Vel Yatra is seen as an attempt by BJP to consolidate Hindu votes in the state where its vote share dropped from 5.56 per cent in 2014 to 3,66 in 2019. Apart from actor Khusbu Sunder's entry induction into the party, BJP president JP Nadda also appointed state vice president Vanathi Srinivasan as Mahila Morcha national president with an eye on upcoming elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tamil-nadu-elections-amid-friction-with-ally-aiadmk-possibility-of-bjp-alagiri-tie-up-171631
17-11-2020||Pune||India not 'expansionist', believes in welfare of world: Gadkari||Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said India is not an "expansionist" country and it only believes in the welfare of the world.Addressing an event in Pune via video-conferencing, Gadkari said to achieve self-reliance, there is a need for knowledge, entrepreneurship, science, technology, research and successful practices."...while taking the country on the path of development, we need to emphasise on scientific advancement.We need to acquire the number one position on the basis of knowledge to make our country a world power," he said."But while doing this, we are not expansionist. There are some countries, which are driven by expansionist desires, but we believe in the welfare of the world. We believe in 'Vasudev Kutumbakam (the world is one family)," said Gadkari.He said the speech given by Swami Vivekanand in Chicago is our inspiration.Stressing the need to make education available for everyone, he said "it should reach the last man standing"."But, at the same time, we need to ensure that quality education is provided," he added.Gadkari said knowledge -as power- should not be the only goal and thrust should be given on imparting value-based education to create ideal citizens.To become "atmanirbhar" (self-reliant), there is a need to lower imports and increase exports, said Gadkari, who is also the minister for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)."In my department, I am collating the information about things that are imported. I appeal to everyone that we need to produce import-substitute things," he said.Speaking about self-reliance in education, Gadkari said universities should be upgraded in the country so that people will not need to go abroad for education."We have all the capabilities to create world-class universities and we can do that, the only thing needed is willpower and ambition," he said.The minister rued the fact that the pace of development of people working selflessly in elevating the standards of education is slow, but on the other hand, those who have done commercialisation of education, their pace of progress is faster."The pace of the progress of people who have done commercialisation is equal to (that of) bullet train, but those who are doing selfless work in education, they are moving at the pace of a passenger train," he said.The event was organised by the Maharashtra Education Society, which runs several educational institutions in Pune.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-not-expansionist-believes-in-welfare-of-world-gadkari-171630

The report is based on a survey of 1,000 adults over the age of 18 in India between October 9-19.McAfee Labs recently said that it observed 419 threats per minute in Q2 2020, an increase of almost 12 per cent over the previous quarter.In order to stay safe, online shoppers should employ multi-factor authentication to double check the authenticity of digital users and add an additional layer of security to protect personal data and information, McAfee advised.

Create a mechanism under the law if there is none at present,” the Bench told Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta after he submitted that there was no regime for content regulation of electronic media.It asked the government to inform it in three weeks about putting in place a proper regime to regulate TV channels.The CJI’s observations came during the hearing of PILs filed by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Peace Party seeking directions to the Centre to stop the dissemination of “fake news”.The petitioners demanded strict action against TV channels allegedly spreading communal hatred against Muslim by stating that Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi in March was responsible for the spread of COVID-19.The Centre refuted the petitioners’ allegations that media was largely communal in reporting the Tablighi Jamaat incident.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre said the IT Ministry had issued 743 orders of blocking fake or misleading content on social media related to COVID-19.But the Bench wasn’t happy with the Centre’s affidavit.“We had asked you to specify how the Cable TV Network Act can be used to control the content of the Cable TV network. Your affidavit is silent on it. Another issue is what steps you can take to deal with such complaints...the mechanism... Your affidavit is silent on it. Please put all these in your amended affidavit. The Centre has the power under the Act,” the Bench told Mehta.“If you have no mechanism evolve one or we will entrust it to an outside agency,” the CJI said.Noting that the NBA and the NBSA were self-regulatory bodies, Mehta said the Centre had ample powers to regulate the content of TV channels but it took a very cautious approach as it involved media’s fundamental right to free speech.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/self-regulation-by-tv-channels-not-good-enough-sc-tells-centre-171625

So I appeal to you, please, please, please wear face masks and follow social distancing," the chief minister said.The coronavirus does not differentiate between the rich and the poor and it can infect anyone, but some people think they may not contract the virus, he added.Delhi has witnessed a spurt in novel coronavirus cases since October 28 when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on Wednesday.On Thursday, 104 coronavirus-related deaths, the highest in over five months, were recorded in the city.On Monday, Delhi recorded 3,797 fresh COVID-19 cases, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.89 lakh, even as 99 new fatalities pushed the toll to 7,713.These relatively low number of fresh cases came out of the 29,871 tests conducted on Sunday.

17-11-2020||New Delhi||Rain, stronger winds help clean up Delhi’s air, AQI in ‘moderate’ category||The national capital’s air quality improved significantly to the ‘moderate’ category on Tuesday as rain and stronger winds helped bring down pollution levels, authorities said.According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s mobile application SAMEER, the city recorded an air quality index of 168, which falls in the ‘moderate’ category, much better than Monday’s AQI of 221, which falls in the ‘poor’ category.However, Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the improvement would be short-lived and the AQI was likely to slip back into the ‘poor’ category on Thursday.The city’s 24-hour average AQI was 435 on Sunday and 414 on Saturday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.According to SAFAR, the overall air quality of Delhi is in the ‘moderate’ category as of Tuesday morning.“Surface winds are west-southwesterly and energetic, very favourable for pollutant dispersion. Rainfall along with stronger winds under the influence of western disturbance helped clean the build-up of pollution in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,” it said.It also said effective stubble fire counts with sufficient potential estimated from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are significantly reduced to around 98.“Boundary layer wind direction is North north-westerly. However, since the fire-related emissions have significantly reduced, a significant impact is not expected. Stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi’s air is almost negligible and estimated marginal three per cent for today,” SAFAR said.It, however, said the significant AQI improvement would be short-lived.The AQI is likely to slip back into the ‘poor’ category on Thursday.“AQI is forecast to further deteriorate to the higher end of ‘poor’ to the lower end of ‘very poor’ category on November 19 and 20,” it said.

You should give a representation to the government... Dismissed," a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said dismissing NGO Social Jurist's petition against the September 28 order of the Delhi High Court.While refusing to issue directions to the Delhi Government and the CBSE, the High Court had asked the AAP government and the CBSE to treat the PIL as a representation and take a decision in three weeks "in accordance with law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the facts of the case".Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the income of parents has either disappeared or declined to such a level that it has become difficult for them to arrange even two meals for their families, the NGO contended.The High Court's order has resulted in denial of relief to 30 lakh students in the country and three lakh are in Delhi alone, it said, adding either the CBSE be asked to waive off the exams fee or the Centre should pay the money from the PM Cares Fund.For Delhi students, the AAP government should be asked to foot the bill, it said."In the current year 2020-21, CBSE has demanded examination fee of Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,800 from students of Class X and Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,400 from Class XII students depending upon number of subjects, practical, etc.," the plea stated.In the last academic year, the Delhi Government had paid examination fees to the CBSE for students of Class X and XII, but in 2020-21, it has refused to do so citing financial crunch, the NGO said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dismisses-plea-for-waiver-of-exam-fees-for-class-10-12-cbse-students-171608

17-11-2020||Washington||Gandhi's writings gave voice to some of my deepest instincts: Barack Obama||Former US President Barack Obama has said that his fascination with India largely revolved around Mahatma Gandhi, whose "successful non-violent campaign against the British rule became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups".However, the 44th US president, in his latest book, rues that the Indian icon was unable to successfully address the caste system or prevent the partition of the county based on religion.In his book "A Promised Land", Obama writes on his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. Also read: Barack Obama spent childhood years listening to Ramayana and Mahabharata"A Promised Land" is the first of two planned volumes. The first part hit bookstores globally on Tuesday."More than anything, though, my fascination with India had to do with Mahatma Gandhi. Along with (Abraham) Lincoln, (Martin Luther) King, and (Nelson) Mandela, Gandhi had profoundly influenced my thinking,” writes Obama, who had visited India twice as president."As a young man, I'd studied his writings and found him giving voice to some of my deepest instincts," the former US president said.Also read: In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, says Barack Obama“His notion of 'satyagraha', or devotion to truth, and the power of non-violent resistance to stir the conscience; his insistence on our common humanity and the essential oneness of all religions; and his belief in every society's obligation, through its political, economic, and social arrangements, to recognise the equal worth and dignity of all people -- each of these ideas resonated with me. Gandhi's actions had stirred me even more than his words; he'd put his beliefs to the test by risking his life, going to prison, and throwing himself fully into the struggles of his people,” Obama writes.Gandhi's non-violent campaign for Indian independence from Britain, which began in 1915 and continued for more than 30 years, hadn't just helped overcome an empire and liberate much of the subcontinent, it had set off a moral charge that pulsed around the globe, he writes."It became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups — including Black Americans in the Jim Crow South — intent on securing their freedom,” says Obama.Recollecting his first visit to India in November 2010, Obama said he and then First Lady, Michelle, had visited Mani Bhavan, the modest two-story building tucked into a quiet Mumbai neighbourhood that had been Gandhi's home for many years."Before the start of our tour, our guide, a gracious woman in a blue sari, showed us the guestbook Dr King had signed in 1959, when he'd travelled to India to draw international attention to the struggle for racial justice in the United States and pay homage to the man whose teachings had inspired him," he writes.“The guide then invited us upstairs to see Gandhi's private quarters. Taking off our shoes, we entered a simple room with a floor of smooth, patterned tile, its  terrace doors open to admit a slight breeze and a pale, hazy light,” he said.“I stared at the spartan floor bed and pillow, the collection of spinning wheels, the old-fashioned phone and low wooden writing desk, trying to imagine Gandhi present in the room, a slight, brown-skinned man in a plain cotton dhoti, his legs folded under him, composing a letter to the British viceroy or charting the next phase of the Salt March,” he said.“And in that moment, I had the strongest wish to sit beside him and talk. To ask him where he'd found the strength and imagination to do so much with so very little. To ask how he'd recovered from disappointment,” he wrote.Obama said Gandhi had had more than his share of struggle. “For all his extraordinary gifts, Gandhi hadn't been able to heal the subcontinent's deep religious schisms or prevent its partitioning into a predominantly Hindu India and an overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan, a seismic event in which untold numbers died in sectarian violence and millions of families were forced to pack up what they could carry and migrate across newly established borders,” he said.“Despite his labours, he hadn't undone India's stifling caste system. Somehow, though, he'd marched, fasted, and preached well into his seventies — until that final day in 1948, when on his way to prayer, he was shot at point-blank range by a young Hindu extremist who viewed his ecumenism as a betrayal of the faith,” Obama writes.

17-11-2020||Washington||In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, says Barack Obama||Former US President Barack Obama has said that modern-day India can be counted as a success story in many respects, despite bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and corruption scandals.Also read: Gandhi's writings gave voice to some of my deepest instincts: Barack ObamaThe 44th US president, in his latest book, says the transition to a more market-based economy in the 1990s unleashed the extraordinary entrepreneurial talents of Indians, leading to soaring growth rates, a thriving technology sector, and a steadily expanding middle class.In his book "A Promised Land", Obama writes on his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. "A Promised Land" is the first of two planned volumes. The first part hit bookstores globally on Tuesday.Also read: Barack Obama spent childhood years listening to Ramayana and Mahabharata“In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, having survived repeated changeovers in government, bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and all manner of corruption scandals,” Obama writes.As the chief architect of India's economic transformation, (former) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seemed like a fitting emblem of this progress: a member of the tiny, often persecuted Sikh religious minority who had risen to the highest office in the land, and a self-effacing technocrat who had won people's trust not by appealing to their passions but by bringing about higher living standards and maintaining a well-earned reputation for not being corrupt, says Obama, who had visited India twice as president in 2010 and 2015.Referring to his November 2010 India visit, Obama says he and Manmohan Singh had developed a warm and productive relationship.   “While he could be cautious in foreign policy, unwilling to get out too far ahead of an Indian bureaucracy that was historically suspicious of US intentions, our time together confirmed my initial impression of him as a man of uncommon wisdom and decency; and during my visit to the capital city of New Delhi, we reached agreements to strengthen US cooperation on counterterrorism, global health, nuclear security, and trade,” Obama writes.“What I couldn't tell was whether Singh's rise to power represented the future of India's democracy or merely an aberration,” he said.Obama writes that Singh at the time was worried about India's economy, cross border terrorism and the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments.During a conversation without aides and note-takers, Singh told him: "In uncertain times, Mr President, the call of religious and ethnic solidarity can be intoxicating. And it's not so hard for politicians to exploit that, in India or anywhere else." “I nodded, recalling the conversation I'd had with Václav Havel (Former President of Czechoslovakia) during my visit to Prague and his warning about the rising tide of illiberalism in Europe. If globalisation and a historic economic crisis were fueling these trends in relatively wealthy nations—if I was seeing it even in the United States with the Tea Party —how could India be immune?” he said.Across the country, millions continued to live in squalor, trapped in sunbaked villages or labyrinthine slums, even as the titans of Indian industry enjoyed lifestyles that the rajas and moguls of old would have envied, Obama writes.“Expressing hostility toward Pakistan was still the quickest route to national unity, with many Indians taking great pride in the knowledge that their country had developed a nuclear weapons program to match Pakistan's, untroubled by the fact that a single miscalculation by either side could risk regional annihilation,” he says.Obama writes Manmohan Singh's elevation as prime minister, sometimes heralded as a hallmark of the country's progress in overcoming sectarian divides, was somewhat deceiving.He hadn't originally become prime minister as a result of his own popularity.“In fact, he owed his position to Sonia Gandhi — the Italian-born widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and the head of the Congress Party, who'd declined to take the job herself after leading her party coalition to victory and had instead anointed Singh. More than one political observer believed that she'd chosen Singh precisely because as an elderly Sikh with no national political base, he posed no threat to her forty-year-old son, Rahul, whom she was grooming to take over the Congress Party,” he said.In his book, Obama, referring to his meeting with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi at the dinner table, said that the Congress president listened more than she spoke, careful to defer to Singh when policy matters came up and often steered the conversation toward her son.“It became clear to me, though, that her power was attributable to a shrewd and forceful intelligence. As for Rahul, he seemed smart and earnest, his good looks resembling his mother's. He offered up his thoughts on the future of progressive politics, occasionally pausing to probe me on the details of my 2008 campaign,” he wrote.“But there was a nervous, unformed quality about him as if he were a student who'd done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject,” Obama said.

17-11-2020||Washington||Barack Obama spent childhood years listening to Ramayana and Mahabharata||Former US President Barack Obama said that he has always held a special place for India due to his childhood years spent in Indonesia listening to the epic Hindu tales of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.“Maybe it was its (India's) sheer size, with one-sixth of the world's population, an estimated two thousand distinct ethnic groups, and more than seven hundred languages spoken,” Obama writes on his fascination of India in his latest book 'A Promised Land'.Obama says he had never been to India before his Presidential visit in 2010, but the country had "always held a special place in my imagination".Also read: Gandhi's writings gave voice to some of my deepest instincts: Barack Obama“Maybe it was because I'd spent a part of my childhood in Indonesia listening to the epic Hindu tales of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, or because of my interest in Eastern religions, or because of a group of Pakistani and Indian college friends who'd taught me to cook dahl and keema and turned me on to Bollywood movies,” Obama writes.In "A Promised Land", Obama gives an account of his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. Also read: In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, says Barack Obama"A Promised Land" is the first of two planned volumes.

This has hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country. The Congress has seen various crises in 1969, 1977, 1989 and 1996, but came out stronger due to its ideology, programmes, policies and firm belief in the party leadership. We improved with each crises and also formed the UPA government in 2004 under the leadership of Sonia. We will overcome this also. Even today, the Congress is the only party that can keep the nation united and take it forward on the path of comprehensive development,” Gehlot said of Sibal amid signals that Congress dissenters may be regrouping with a section hinting at a “big move in future”.On RJD’s criticism, AICC Bihar incharge Shakti Sinh Gohil ticked off RJD senior Shivanand Tiwari for accusing the Congress of trammelling the grand alliance in Bihar.“Tiwari ji is a former JDU MP and his loyalties still lie with CM Nitish Kumar. He is helping the JDU and BJP,” Gohil said after Tiwari yesterday accused Rahul Gandhi of non-seriousness in the election campaign having contested 70 seats and held only three rallies.“It is not surprising that Tiwari’s loyalties are still with the JDU. He is levelling baseless allegations on the Congress leadership to help the JDU and BJP government. The Congress heeded the advice of alliance partners and even agreed to fight on seats it had not won in 30 years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-cong-vs-cong-as-gehlot-slams-sibal-171479

He said the country was also moving in the same direction and added that a law against triple talaq was made while new sectors were opening up for women.“Women today are getting opportunities in the armed forces and the new education policy will create new opportunities for them,” he said.Modi said the Bhakti movement led by seers pushed and strengthened the freedom movement in the country and now it was time to push the “vocal for local” campaign.He said seers of India always showed the path of peace, non-violence and harmony to the world and humanity, and the world gets inspiration from these messages.“Therefore, the world is once again looking at India,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/support-local-economy-pm-171475

The elevation of Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi is aimed at infusing freshness in Bihar leadership and sending a clear message of change to the cadre. “The BJP was portrayed as a party of upper castes and Prasad and Renu Devi represent underprivileged sections. The move also indicates that things are not going to be like they used to be. There was too much proximity between Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi and obviously the central leadership wanted to change that. It is a new beginning for the Bihar BJP,” political observers say. Apart from Nitish Kumar, Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, five MLAs each from the BJP and the JD(U) and one each from HAM and VIP were also sworn in as ministers. The elevation of Renu Devi is being seen as an effort to enthuse women voters who are believed to have supported PM Narendra Modi majorly in these elections. So far as former Deputy CM Sushil Modi is concerned, he may be accommodated in the Union Cabinet via the Rajya Sabha route or sent to a Raj Bhavan.Induction of JD(U)’s Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, former Speaker, as a minister shows the BJP has managed the key post. The post is expected to go to BJP’s seven-time Patna Sahib MLA Nand Kishore Yadav.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/clout-shrunk-nitish-back-as-bihar-cm-171461

Spread over four days (November 17-20), this is the second phase of the exercise. The first phase was conducted in the Bay of Bengal from November 3-6.The mega exercise is taking place at a time when India and China are locked in an over six-month-long border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has majorly strained ties between the two countries.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region. As per the Indian authorities, the second phase “will involve coordinated operations of increasing complexity between the navies of the four nations”. Joint operations will be centered around Vikramaditya carrier battle group and Nimitz carrier strike group. The two carriers, along with other ships, submarines and aircraft of the participating navies, would be engaged in high-intensity operations over four days.These include cross-deck flying operations and advanced air defence exercises by MIG 29K fighters of Vikramaditya and F-18 fighters and E2C Hawkeye from Nimitz.
