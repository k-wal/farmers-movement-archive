Bloomsbury India strongly supports freedom of speech but also has a deep sense of responsibility towards society,” the statement said.The authors slammed “left liberals and intellectuals” for launching a social media campaign against the book, its writers and guests of the launch including senior BJP leader Bhupender Yadav, Mishra and Bollywood filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri.“The book very well reveals how the urban Naxals and jihadists are weakening the theory of Indianness that is based on democracy, the Constitution and elections in the country,” Yadav said.Reacting to Bloomsbury India’s decision to withdraw itself from publishing the book, Arora said, “If one publisher withdraws, ten will rise. The messiahs of freedom of speech are scared of this book. They mounted a frontal attack on its writers, publisher and guests of the launch even before the book was released and one could go through it.”Mishra asserted “no power in the world can stop this book from coming out and people want to read it” and the “contractors of freedom of speech are scared that the book will expose how training was given for the riots and the propaganda machinery was involved in it”.Yadav said those behind Shaheen Bagh protest against the citizenship law earlier this year did not raise the issues of rights of women but spread “poison” in the society.Arora said the Delhi riots need to be probed by the NIA, claiming it was “pre-planned”. She said the book has been divided into eight chapters and five annexures, all based on ground research in the riot-affected areas. The chapters of the book were about urban-Naxalism and jihadist theory in India, CAA, Shaheen Bagh Model, among others, she said.Malhotra said that the book was opposed by the “so-called leftist thinkers and intellectuals” who earlier “spread lies” that the citizenship law was against the Muslims.“The Delhi riots were an outcome of the urban Naxal and Islamic fanatics and the book exposes it,” she said.Chitalkar said the book was a result of “thorough ground research”.“We talked to everyone, including Muslims. We were not biased. This books takes stand against urban Naxals and Islamic jihadists, it is not an anti-Muslim book,” she claimed.Communal violence broke out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after citizenship law supporters and protesters clashed with each other in the area, leaving 53 people dead and nearly 200 injured. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bloomsbury-says-it-wont-publish-book-on-delhi-riots-after-social-media-backlash-129864
22-08-2020||New Delhi||Cong, govt in war of words after reports claimed CAG ‘dropped’ audit of Rafale offset deal||A fresh controversy broke out on Saturday involving the Rafale deal after source-based media reports claimed that the CAG has submitted its performance audit on defence offset contracts to the Centre with no mention of any offset deals related to the purchase of the fighter aircraft.Seizing on these report, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a fresh attack on the government over the fighter jet deal, prompting Union minister Piyush Goyal to hit back, saying he is welcome to fight the 2024 general elections on the issue.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also asserted that the CAG report on Defence Offset Performance will be tabled in the forthcoming session of Parliament and the contents will be known only after that.In a tweet, Gandhi tagged source-based news reports, which claimed that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has dropped audit of Rafale offset deal.One of the reports quoted “people involved with the audit” to claim that “the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has informed the federal auditor that Dassault Aviation, French manufacturer of Rafale, has said it will share any details of its offset partners only after three years of the contract.”“MoD has denied any information related to the Rafale offset deals to the audit,” the report said.“Money was stolen from the Indian exchequer in Rafale,” Gandhi alleged in his tweet without elaborating, and also quoted Mahatma Gandhi’s words: “Truth is one, paths are many”.In a sharp retort, Goyal, who is Railway Minister and a senior BJP leader, claimed that many in the Congress have confided that Gandhi’s obsession with Rafale is damaging the party.“Many of Rahul Gandhi’s Congress colleagues confide in private that Rahul’s obsession with Rafale to wash off his father’s sins is damaging the party. But if someone is wanting to self-destruct, who are we to complain? We invite him to fight the 2024 elections on Rafale,” Goyal tweeted.Reacting to the controversy, Sitharaman said the CAG report on Defence Offset Performance will be tabled in the forthcoming session of Parliament.“The C&AG Report...Defences Offset Performance was scheduled to be tabled in Parliament during the budget session (2020). The session ended, before date, due to COVID. Now the report will be placed in the next session. The contents will be known only after that,” Sitharaman said in a series of tweets.Observing that the first Rafale fighter jet was handed over to India in October 2019, she said, “There is a year-wise phasing of how much offset obligation the companies/OEMs (original equipment manufacturer) have to fulfil. MoD (Ministry of Defence) informs me that claims of such obligations being fulfilled are coming in.”Tagging the media report which was cited by Gandhi, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted, “Now the CAG! Can any Constitutional Authority remain independent under this Modi government? Rise in defence of the Indian Constitution.”  Several other Congress leaders, including spokesperson Pawan Khera, attacked the government over the media report.India last month received its first batch of new multi-role fighter aircraft in two decades with the arrival of five Rafale jets.The NDA government had inked a Rs 59,000-crore deal in 2016 to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation after a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify during the UPA regime.The Congress had alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal, claiming that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost higher than what was finalised by the UPA government during negotiations for the 126 jets.The government and aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation strongly refuted these allegations. In a verdict in 2018, the Supreme Court had given clean chit to the government on the deal.The political controversy relating to the deal peaked in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and during the campaign Gandhi had launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Congress had lost the polls with the BJP getting a massive mandate. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-govt-in-war-of-words-after-reports-claimed-cag-dropped-audit-of-rafale-offset-deal-129862
22-08-2020||New Delhi||India to wait for Pakistan to act on terrorists||India will wait and watch for further action after Pakistan reportedly released a consolidated list of terrorists and 88 terror groups whose bank accounts should be frozen and properties seized.Pakistan's intention seems to be to present a consolidated list of previously announced measures against the terrorists and their organisations before the meeting of the global anti-money laundering body FATFA so that the country can escape being put into a blacklist.While refraining from reacting, sources here pointed out that Pakistan has consistently claimed that many of these terrorist leaders are out of reach of its security agencies. These include leaders of the Emirates of Tanzim Qafqaz targeting Russia and Uyghurs of Islamic Freedom Movement aimed against China and India’s Dawood Ibrahim. As late as July last year, Pakistan Foreign Office had denied his presence while Islamabad’s last reply to FATFA in February did not include Dawood’s name.If the list includes Noor Wali Mehsud, chief of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan chief, which targets Pakistan, it also has militant leaders who are engaged in peace talks with the US and have fought with it across the Afghan-Pak border with ample assistance from the ISI in both instances. Some leaders in the notification such as Hafiz Saeed, Masood Azhar, Jalaluddin Haqqani and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi are established protégés of the Pakistan Army.The list also includes many militant organisations and their leaders who have conducted terrorist outrages against India including the 2008 Mumbai and 2019 Pulwama attacks. Cadres of any other groups in the past have provided logistical support to terrorists carrying out attacks in India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-wait-for-pakistan-to-act-on-terrorists-129860
22-08-2020||Mumbai||Foreign attendees of Tablighi event made scapegoat, says HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has said the foreign nationals, who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event held in Delhi in March this year, were made “scapegoats” and allegations were levelled that they were responsible for spreading COVID-19 in the country.A division bench of Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar made the observations on August 21 while quashing the FIRs filed against 29 foreigners, who had attended the event.The bench also noted that while the Maharashtra police acted mechanically in the case, the state government acted under “political compulsion”.The 29 foreign nationals were booked under various provisions of the IPC, the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and Foreigner’s Act for allegedly violating their tourist visa conditions by attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation held at Nizamuddin in the national capital.The bench in its order noted that there was a big propaganda against the foreigners who had come to the Markaz in Delhi.“A political government tries to find the scapegoat when there is pandemic or calamity and the circumstances show that there is probability that these foreigners were chosen to make them a scapegoat,” the court said in its order.“The propaganda against the so-called religious activity (Tablighi Jamaat) was unwarranted. The activity was going on for more than 50 years and it is there throughout the year,” it added.It said the circumstances and the latest figures of infection of COVID-19 in India show that such action against the petitioners should not have been taken.“It is now high time for the concerned to repent about this action taken against the foreigners and to take some positive steps to repair the damage done by such action,” the court said.In its order, the bench noted that many Muslims from across the world come to India and visit the Markaz Masjid in Delhi as they are attracted to the reform movement of Tablighi Jamat.“It is a continuous process and it appears that there are arrangements of stay also made by the Muslims at Markaz Delhi,” it said.The bench added that the visits of these foreigners to Masjids in India were not prohibited and there is nothing on record to show that this activity is prohibited permanently by the government.“The activity of Tablighi Jamat got stalled only after the declaration of lockdown in Delhi and till then it was going on,” the court said.The bench further questioned as to whether the people in India are really acting as per its great tradition and culture of welcoming guests.“During the situation created by COVID-19 pandemic, we need to show more tolerance and need to be more sensitive towards our guests, particularly like the present petitioners.“Instead of helping them, we lodged them in jails by making allegations that they were responsible for violation of travel documents and that they are responsible for spreading the coronavirus,” the court said.The bench noted that the Maharashtra police acted mechanically in the present matter and the state government acted under “political compulsion”.“The government cannot give different treatment to citizens of different religions of different countries,” the court said.Apart from the foreign nationals, police also booked six Indian nationals and trustees of the Masjids for giving shelter to the petitioners.The bench was hearing three separate petitions filed by the accused foreign nationals, who belong to the countries like Ghana, Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia.At the end of the judgement, Justice Sewlikar said while he agrees with the quashing part of the order, he has differing views on a few observations made by Justice Nalawade. However, he did not specify which observations.The petitioners claimed that they came to India on valid visa in February 2020 and before March 10, 2020 to experience Indian culture, tradition, hospitality and Indian food.They claimed that when they arrived in India, they were screened and were let to leave the airport only after they did not show any symptoms of COVID-19.The petitioners further claimed that they were visiting several places in India to observe the religious practices of Muslims.They claimed that due to lockdown imposed across the country in March, the petitioners, who were in Ahmednagar district at the time, were accommodated in masjids as most lodges and hotels were closed.They further claimed that while granting visa, there was no prohibition to visit religious places, like masjids.The police, while opposing the pleas, said that post- lockdown, announcements were made at public places, asking persons who had attended the Tablighi event to come forward voluntarily for testing, but the petitioners did not do so and created a threat of spreading the coronavirus.The prosecution further argued that the accused persons were propagating Islam religion among public.The court, however, refused to accept this and said there is nothing on record to show that the foreigners (accused persons) were spreading Islam religion by converting persons of other religions to Islam.The bench further held that no orders were issued by any authority preventing Indians from accommodating persons in masjids or supplying meals to persons, including foreigners. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foreign-attendees-of-tablighi-event-made-scapegoat-says-hc-129858

22-08-2020||New Delhi||States, UTs can use NRA’s CET scores for selecting candidates for govt jobs: Jitendra Singh||Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday said states and Union Territories can avail of scores on the Common Eligibility Test, to be conducted by the National Recruitment Agency (NRA), to shortlist candidates for government jobs.This would actually help the recruiting agencies, including the state and UT governments, to save the cost and time spent on recruitment, while at the same time also be convenient and cost-effective for the young job aspirants, he said.An arrangement in the form of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) could be put in place for using the CET score by them, said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel.“Eventually, this could prove a win-win arrangement both for the employer as well as employee,” he said.Singh said the CET score could be shared with the recruiting agencies in the state and Union Territory governments as well as public sector undertakings (PSUs) and also later on with the private sector, according to an official statement.“States and Union Territories can avail the Common Eligibility Test to be conducted by the National Recruitment Agency for job selection, the decision for which was passed at the Union Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday,” it said.The NRA is mandated to conduct the CET online for selecting candidates for a majority of central government jobs.Singh said the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and he himself are in touch with many state and Union Territory governments which have expressed their inclination to be a part of the sharing arrangement of CET score.Most of the chief ministers are also quite enthusiastic and favourable to adopt this reform, he said.Clearing apprehension in certain quarters, Singh said, for those who are appearing for the exam, relaxation in the upper age limit shall be given to candidates of SC/ST/OBC as other categories castes as per the government policy.He said the Common Eligibility Test will have no correlation or incompatibility with the rules of recruitment like domicile etc., followed by certain states or Union Territories, the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said.Contrary to misgiving in certain quarters, the CET will not be conducted only in Hindi and English language but will be conducted in 12 Indian languages to begin with, while gradually other languages in the 8th schedule of the Constitution will also be included, it said.Hailing Prime Minister Modi’s personal intervention and indulgence “without which this revolutionary decision could not have been possible”, Singh said, the move is going to prove to be a major reform to bring about ease of living for struggling youth and job aspirants.He said it is also a reflection of the sensitivity and thoughtfulness with which the government works under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-uts-can-use-nras-cet-scores-for-selecting-candidates-for-govt-jobs-jitendra-singh-129841
22-08-2020||New Delhi||Rajnath reviews security scenario in eastern Ladakh at high-level meeting||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday reviewed the overall security scenario in eastern Ladakh amid the ongoing talks between India and China on the disengagement process in the high-altitude region, people familiar with the developments said. The meeting was attended by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh and IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria.The sources said all important aspects of the border row with China in eastern Ladakh were discussed in great detail. The meeting also deliberated on the future course of approach in dealing with the situation, they added. The analysis comes in the wake of the assessment by the Army that the Chinese military is not serious about the resolution of the border conflict in eastern Ladakh.There has been a stalemate in the military talks as the Indian Army was strongly insisting that the Chinese side must restore the status quo ante of April this year to resolve the over three-month-old row. The Indian Army has clearly stated to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) that “shifting” of the Line of Actual Control is not acceptable to it, the sources said adding Chinese military is now desperately attempting to give “ex post facto strategic meaning” to its actions in eastern Ladakh.“Due to the strong response of the Indian Army, the PLA is faced with unanticipated and unintended consequences of his misadventure,” said a source, adding it is looking for a “face-saving exit strategy”. India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks in the last two-and-half months but no significant headway has been made in resolution of the border row in eastern Ladakh.On Thursday, the two sides held another round of diplomatic talks following which the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said they had agreed to resolve outstanding issues in an “expeditious manner” and in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols. However, the sources said the meeting could not produce any significant outcome.   The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area.  However, the process has not moved forward since mid-July.The Chinese military has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of troops has not moved forward in Pangong Tso, Depsang and a couple of other areas, sources said. In the five rounds of corps commander-level talks, the Indian side has been insisting on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest, and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April. Even as both sides have been engaged in diplomatic and military talks, the Indian Army is making elaborate preparation to maintain its current strength of troops in all key areas in eastern Ladakh in the harsh winter months. Army Chief Naravane has already conveyed to all the senior commanders of the Army, overseeing operation of the frontline formations along the LAC, to keep up a significantly high state of alertness and maintain the aggressive posturing to deal with any Chinese “misadventure”, the sources said. The Army is also in the process of procuring a number of weapons, ammunition and winter gears for the frontline troops, they added. The temperature in some of the high-altitude areas along the LAC drops to minus 25 degrees Celsius in the winter months. The tension between the two sides escalated manifold after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.  The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35. Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government gave the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC.The Army sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border following the deadly clashes. The IAF has also moved air defence systems as well as a sizeable number of its frontline combat jets and attack helicopters to several key air bases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-reviews-security-scenario-in-eastern-ladakh-at-high-level-meeting-129837

Three other high-profile accused, including VHP leader Ashok Singhal, died during the pendency of the case.Kalyan Singh, during whose tenure as UP Chief Minister the disputed structure was demolished, was initially not tried as the top court held that being a Governor of Rajasthan he was immune to prosecution. Charges were framed against him after he ceased to be the Governor.Special Judge Yadav has been recording evidence via video conferencing to speed up the process in an attempt to meet the deadline fixed by the top court. But after perusing his report, the court decided to extend the deadline by a month.In May, the court had given time till August 31 after Special Judge Yadav informed it that even the evidence was not yet completed.  But the court has been extending the time given to the judge from time to time. It had also extended the tenure of Special Judge Yadav who was to retire in September 2019."We are cognizant of the fact that Shri Yadav is making all efforts in order that the trial reaches a just conclusion," the Bench had noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/babri-masjid-demolition-sc-extends-deadline-till-sept-30-for-completing-trial-129836

With this, cumulative tests conducted so far for detection of COVID-19 rose to over 3.4 crore.“With a higher number of COVID-19 patients recovering and being discharged from hospitals and home isolation, the recovery rate has reached 74.69 per cent. This has also led to declining COVID-19 case fatality rate, which stands at a new low of 1.87 per cent as on date,” the ministry said.Early identification of cases through aggressive testing, comprehensive surveillance and contact tracing along with a focus on timely and efficient clinical treatment of patients have ensured speedy recovery. The higher number of recoveries and declining fatality have shown that India’s graded and pro-active strategies are delivering results on the field, the ministry underlined.Building on the continuum of care approach, the policy of testing aggressively, tracing comprehensively and treating efficiently, focused attention on effective surveillance and house-to-house contact tracing has led to early detection and identification of COVID-19 cases, it said.The ministry underscored that mild and moderate cases are treated under supervised home isolation.According to the standardised clinical management protocol based on a holistic standard of care approach, patients in critical and severe condition are hospitalised and provided the best medical care, it said.With a record single-day spike of 69,874 infections, India’s COVID-19 tally increased to 29,75,701, while the death toll climbed to 55,794 with 945 fatalities being reported in a span of 24 hours, the health ministry data updated at 8 am showed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-recovery-rate-reaches-74-69-pc-case-fatality-dips-to-1-87-pc-health-ministry-129833

It is reported that Ibrahim is based in the southern port city of Karachi.On grey listThe Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) put Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action by the end of 2019, but the deadline was extended later due to COVID-19 pandemic.The government issued two notifications on August 18 announcing sanctions on key figures of terror outfits such as 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Azhar, and underworld don Ibrahim.The Pakistan government has proscribed 88 leaders and members of terrorist groups, in compliance with the new list issued by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) recently, The News reported.The notifications announced sanctions on key figures of terror outfits such as the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), JeM, Taliban, Daesh, Haqqani Group, al-Qaeda, and others.The government ordered the seizure of all movable and immovable properties of these outfits and individuals, and freezing of their bank accounts, the report said.These terrorists have been barred from transferring money through financial institutions, purchasing of arms and travelling abroad, it said.The notifications ratified a complete ban on all leaders and members of defunct Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) hiding in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border areas.The paper reported that Saeed, Azhar, Mullah Fazlullah (alias Mullah Radio), Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Muhammad Yahya Mujahid, Abdul Hakeem Murad, wanted by Interpol, Noor Wali Mehsud, Fazal Raheem Shah of Uzbekistan Liberation Movement, Taliban leaders Jalaluddin Haqqani, Khalil Ahmad Haqqani, Yahya Haqqani, and Ibrahim and his associates were on the list.The notifications said that leadership of the defunct TTP, and other organisations, including Lashkar-e-Toiba, JeM, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Tariq Geedar group of TTP, Harkatul Mujahideen, Al Rasheed Trust, Al Akhtar Trust, Tanzim Jaish-al Mohajireen Ansar, Jamaat-ul Ahrar, Tanzim Khutba Imam Bukhari, Rabita Trust Lahore, Revival of Islamic Heritage Society of Pakistan, Al-Haramain Foundation Islamabad, Harkat Jihad Al Islami, Islami Jihad Group, Uzbekistan Islami Tehreek, Daesh of Iraq, Emirates of Tanzim Qafqaz working against Russia, and Abdul Haq of Uyghurs of Islamic Freedom Movement of China, have been banned.Though various sanctions were in place against almost all of those listed by the UNSC, the government through the new notifications consolidated and documented the previously announced measures, the report said.The UNSC Sanctions Committee deals with sanctions on entities and individuals declared as terrorists. All states, including Pakistan, are bound to implement the sanctions which include assets freeze, an arms embargo, and travel ban.It is believed that the latest move by the Pakistan government is part of its efforts to wriggle out of the grey list of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog FATF.On August 12, Pakistan Parliament’s lower house passed four bills related to the tough conditions set by the FATF  after the government and the Opposition reached a consensus.The legislation was part of the efforts by Pakistan to move from the FATF’s grey list to the white list.In its third and final plenary held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic in June, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan in the “grey list” as Islamabad failed to check the flow of money to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). The plenary was held under the Chinese Presidency of Xiangmin Liu.With Pakistan’s continuation in the ‘grey list’, it will be difficult for the country to get financial aid from the IMF, World Bank, ADB, and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.If Pakistan fails to comply with the FATF directive by October, there is every possibility that the global body may put the country in the ‘Black List’ along with North Korea and Iran.The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.The FATF currently has 39 members including two regional organisations - the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dawood-ibrahim-in-karachi-pak-govt-imposes-sanctions-on-him-129821

Previously, the largest case was in 2017 from Coimbatore where a lady was operated for a 34-kg tumour in her ovary”.     “Extraction of a 50-kg tumour was a challenge for the team. More so because the patient had exceptionally low haemoglobin and had to undergo in total six units of blood transfusion before, during and after the procedure,” he said.This procedure was a perfect example of how important it is to understand the traditional methods of surgery while evolving with new minimal access procedures, the doctor said.“Here, there was no space in the abdomen for insertion of equipment via laparoscopy or robot-assisted methods, hence we had to resort to traditional methods of surgery.“With the combined effort of experts from the gastroenterology, gynaecology and anesthesiology teams, the extraction was done successfully,” Dr Prasad explained.A key surgeon in the case Dr Abhishek Tewari said the patient was admitted with complaints of stomach ache, breathing stress and obvious weight gain.She was advised immediate surgery else the tumour would have grown exponentially and caused pressure on other organs leading to possible organ failure.“Fortunately, the tumour was benign and the patient had no co-morbidities, which enabled a faster recovery. Post-surgery her weight dropped to 56 kg,” Dr Tewari said.Dr Geeta Chadha, senior consultant, Gynecology and Obstetrics at the hospital said there is no proven reason for the emergence of a tumour in the ovary, but it can happen during the formation of the cells in a human body.As the first-ever case of a 50-kg tumour in the ovary, this was a challenging procedure. Due to the giant tumour, the intestinal tract was compressed and flattened which was putting pressure on the gut leading to a risk of rupture in the ovary, Dr Chadha said.“The surgery had to be done with utmost precision, keeping in mind seamless extraction of the tumour and simultaneously ensuring no harm is caused to the ovary or the gut. Post-surgery the patient showed tremendous recovery and is set to be discharged on Saturday evening,” she said.

Since June 1, the unlock process began with the opening up of industrial activities and offices across the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-pandemic-centre-asks-states-not-to-restrict-trans-border-movement-129818

The intruders were killed after they opened fire on being challenged by the BSF. There had been intelligence reports of increased smuggling activities along the border, sources said.The area of the incident is the responsibility of BSF’s 103 Battalion. Punjab Police personnel are also on the scene and the task of establishing the identity of the dead is under way.Also read: BSF shoots 5 intruders near Indo-Pak border in Punjab’s Tarn TaranDespite additional measures to plug gaps being proposed, especially after the terror attacks in Pathankot and Gurdaspur, the international border in Punjab and Jammu regions remain susceptible to smugglers and infiltrators as some of the projects are yet to take off.The BSF is responsible for peacetime management of the 2,308-km-long international border with Pakistan from the Chenab river near Akhnoor in Jammu and Kashmir to the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat. A few BSF battalions are also deployed along the Line of Control (LoC) from Akhnoor to Kargil, though guarding the LoC is the Army’s responsibility.Under the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System, the BSF had conceived the idea of erecting a “smart fence” along the border consisting of laser walls, thermal imagers and sensors to detect intrusions in places where a physical fence cannot come up due to the terrain.Riverine stretches along the courses of the Sutlej and Ravi in Punjab and nullahs in the Samba sector south of Jammu are difficult to guard because of the undulating terrain, waterlogging and thick growth of wild grass. The rivers criss-cross the international border at several places.The length of the international border in Punjab is 553 km, of which only 461 km is fenced.Two pilot projects for the smart fence, one in the Jammu sector and the other in Punjab were undertaken under the aegis of the Ministry of Home Affairs but no further headway has been made.“Field reports of the trials are still under process and further course of action will be decided only once these are finalised and appropriate recommendations are put up,” a source said. “Some changes in the structure and format of the fence as well as technological upgradation could be required,” he added.The procurement of drones for border surveillance as well as counter-drone technology is a major focus area for the BSF. “We are giving a high priority to the use of drones as they are tactically effective. A certain number have already been deployed and more are being acquired,” an officer said.Since drones are reported to have been used to smuggle weapons and drugs, the BSF has sought a comprehensive system that will have radars, radio frequency receivers, jammers and system controllers to neutralise different types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The BSF’s requirement is a ground or vehicle based stand-alone system capable of detecting a lone suspicious flying object or a group of UAVs from a long distance in a 360-degree environment.The BSF is also conducting trials of portable ground penetration radars to detect cross border tunnels running under the fence, pinpoint land mines and improvised explosive devices or sniff out buried contraband.“There have been several instances of such tunnels, some several hundred meters long, having been detected and the possibility of more such tunnels cannot be discounted,” an officer said. “The use of tunnels is not a new phenomenon and over the past years the force has carried out large scale operations along the border to uncover tunnels,” he added.Sources point out that with engineering support from the military establishment, boring long tunnels is not difficult. Their exit could be concealed inside a shack or a barn-like structure near the border or even under dense vegetation or crevice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stretches-along-border-with-pakistan-remain-vulnerable-bsf-moves-to-plug-gaps-129806

22-08-2020||New Delhi||Forced to travel 50 km for online classes, 200 Maharashtra kids reach out to child rights panel for Internet||Around 200 children were forced to travel 50 kilometres every day to reach an area with an Internet connection to attend online classes from their remote coastal villages in Maharashtra after they were hit first COVID-19 lockdown and then cyclone Nisarga.Hit by a pandemic and then a natural disaster, the children from remote villages in Maharashtra had to deal with Internet disruptions since early June when connectivity along the coastal area of Ratnagiri district became scratchy.But when even after a month the situation did not improve, one of the students finally reached out to the apex child rights body, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), for help.“The NCPCR, in turn, ensured that the connectivity was restored in the fastest possible manner by reaching out to cellular companies and the district magistrate of the area,” NCPCR Chairman Priyank Kanoongo said.In his letter to the district magistrate of the area, Kanoongo stressed that the authorities must ensure that the issue gets resolved at the earliest.“The commission has taken cognisance of a complaint received regarding poor and disrupted network connectivity along the coastal area of Ratnagiri District, Maharashtra, particularly in the area of PIN Code 415714, which was deadly hit by cyclone Nisarga on June 3, 2020, and since then, the residents of the area do not have mobile and data connectivity,” Kanoongo said in the letter to the district magistrate on July 25.“As a result, around 200 students are facing difficulties in online educational activities due to corona lockdown. Besides, the students are taking the pain to travel about 50 km a day to access data connectivity for their online education activities,” he said.He sought immediate intervention from the Ratnagiri district magistrate on the matter.“I, hereby, draw the kind attention of Ratnagiri DM to immediately intervene in the matter, make liaison and issue suitable directions to the concerned cellular service provider to get the Internet connectivity restored at the earliest so that no child becomes a victim of undue pressure or stress concerning their education,” Kanoongo said in the letter.Speaking to PTI, Kanoongo said the NCPCR continuously followed up with the authorities and finally the Internet connection in the area was restored by one of the cellular networks while the rest of them assured that they would resolve the issue at the earliest.“We intervened and wrote to the district magistrate and cellular companies and we dealt with it as a policy intervention in which the NCPCR has to play a role in helping children. As a result, the action was taken on a priority basis and internet connectivity of the village was restored,” he said.He further stressed that it was very important to ensure barrier-free Internet facility for the children in these times.“It is very important that if children are dependent upon the Internet for their education then it needs to be ensured that they get barrier-free Internet facility,” he said.The nationwide lockdown induced by COVID-19 in March prompted schools and colleges to move to the virtual world for teaching and learning activities. But a weak internet penetration has turned e-education into a distant dream for many children in rural areas.According to official statistics, there are over 35 crore students in the country.

Meanwhile, another woman has become a mother to five baby girls in the past nine months.The ‘good news’ which came multiple times for these women, sources said, could be because some women have taken “encouragement amount” multiple times for giving birth to female babies.Under the provision of the national health mission, a woman is entitled to claim an “encouragement amount” from the state health department for giving birth to a girl child.Leela Devi, 65, of Muzaffarpur’s Mushari block has collected her share of encouragement amount for delivering eight female babies in the past 14 months.Another woman Sonia Devi has given birth to five female children in the last 9 months.Interestingly, these women have become a mother only “on paper”. The encouragement amount of Rs 1,400 have been collected by them for each child.Muzaffarpur District Magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh has set up a high-level inquiry committee headed by an additional district magistrate to investigate this matter.“Prima facie, it looks like a scam. Government officials and touts may be involved in it. We have constituted a team to probe this scam,” Singh said.

22-08-2020||Mumbai||Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations begin on low-key note, COVID-19 dampens spirit||Amid the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions on public movement, the 10-day Ganesh festival started in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra on Saturday, although the usual pomp and glory was missing this year.The Maharashtra government has issued guidelines regarding Ganeshotsav celebrations, saying that processions should not be taken out before installing and immersing the idols of the deity.It also said the heights of Lord Ganesh idols installed by sarvajanik (community) mandals and at household- level should be limited to four feet and two feet, respectively, this year.As a result, the number of people coming out in the market to buy Ganpati idols for installation in their houses, housing societies and sarvajanik pandals, was limited. The usual spirit and fervour of the festival was relatively low this year.Due to the subdued celebrations, small businesses of that thrive during the festival, including flower vendors, sweet shops, outlets selling decoration items, imitation jewellery and transporters took a hit.The pandemic also affected several others, including artistes and transporters. However, in some popular market places such as Dadar in central Mumbai, people still came out in large numbers to purchase material required for decoration, puja rituals in the last couple of days.Lalbaugcha Raja, Mumbai’s best-known sarvajanik Ganeshotsav mandal, cancelled the festival this year in view of the pandemic, while Wadala’s GSB Sewa Samiti, considered one of the richest mandals in the metropolis, postponed the celebration to ‘Magh Shudh Chaturthi’ in February next year.The usual pandal decorations in the city are missing this year and cultural events have been replaced by public awareness programmes and health camps by the mandals.Mumbai and the neighbouring areas have been witnessing heavy rains from the past few days. The downpour continued on Saturday morning but people stepped out to bring home the idols of the deity amid chants ‘Ganpati bappa moraya’. In some areas, firecrackers were also burst to welcome the Lord.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray also welcomed Lord Ganesh at his official residence ‘Varsha’. Some celebrities and political leaders also installed the idols at their places.The installation of the deity was done as per the rituals in the morning.Meanwhile, security has been beefed up in the city for the festival.

Speaking at a webinar, the Indian envoy said restoration of cuts in H-1B and L-1 visas continues to be his mission’s top priority.Sandhu, who took over as the Indian envoy in January after the then incumbent, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, moved over to Delhi as Foreign Secretary, said he had written to all principals of top US universities to inform them about the Indian Government’s decision to allow them to set up campuses in the country.‘Removal of H-1B visa curbs priority’ Removal of restrctions on H-1B and L-1 visas continues to be the mission’s top priority. We have been raising it with the US and will continue to do that. —Taranjit Singh Sandhu, indian ambassador to the US“A mini trade deal is very important. It is one of the areas under discussion. We are very keen. It is a work in progress, perhaps in its final stages,” he said, while advising an Indian importer of sophisticated medical devices to put pressure on the US Trade Representative.The envoy said Indian diplomats had been approaching US Senators and Representatives to point out that Indians who had arrived on H-1B and L-1 visas had brought with them important skill sets and bridged technological gaps that made US companies globally competitive.“With innovation and technology leading the path to post-pandemic economic recovery, their role (in the US) becomes even more significant. We have been raising it with the US and will continue to do that. It is a developing situation,” he said while indicating the decision to clamp down on the visas was more of a political decision than one that had economic merit. “We are hopeful,” he said.He indicated that the US should shelve its reservations about India’s e-commerce policy because at the end of the exercise, New Delhi will attempt to address the concerns of all stakeholders.

Any failure could jeopardise financial stability. “As such, we expect government support will remain forthcoming,” Anbarasu said.Moody’s said asset quality would deteriorate, led by retail and small business loans, and economy would contract sharply in fiscal year ending March 2021 before returning to growth in the 2021 fiscal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/psbs-will-need-rs-2-1l-cr-over-next-2-yrs-moodys-129582
