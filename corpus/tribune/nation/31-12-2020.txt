31-12-2020||Kolkata||Prove majority in House: Left Front, Congress to TMC government in WB||The opposition Left Front and the Congress on Thursday demanded that the TMC government in West Bengal make arrangements to convene an Assembly session to prove its majority, amid the growing number of defections from the ruling party to the BJP.At a joint press meet of the Left and the Congress here, CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty stressed that the TMC dispensation should come out clear if it still enjoys the support of adequate number of legislators."Many ruling party MLAs have told me in private that the government is apparently scared to call an Assembly session. They also claimed that governance was getting affected due to the prevailing confusion," he claimed.Leader of the Opposition and senior Congress member Abdul Mannan, who was also present at the meet, said TMC boss Mamata Banerjee had been insisting that her party did not suffer any major loss, but people in the know have claimed that many more would be leaving her camp soon."If your (Mamata Banerjee's) claim is true, please appear for a floor test in Assembly," he said.Chakraborty further said that convening an Assembly session was necessary at this juncture for passing a resolution against the new agriculture laws, which had sparked nationwide protests by farmers.He also stated that civic polls were long overdue, but the government wasn't taking necessary measures as it was "afraid of its outcome"."The COVID-19 pandemic can no longer be a reason for the delay as hundreds of people are seen participating in rallies organised by the ruling party, with little regard for social distancing," he added.Making light of the demand made by the two parties, BJP leader Jaiprakash Majumdar said a floor test, just months before Assembly polls, was unnecessary."People have already made up their minds to dislodge the TMC government. What is the justification behind asking the CM to prove majority at this stage?" Majumdar asked.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||Cold wave sweeps north India, a frigid New Year’s Day awaits||Dense fog and numbing cold swept large swathes of north India with the mercury settling several notches below the freezing point in some parts on Thursday, bringing to a close a turbulent year that saw the country grapple with extreme weather ranging from floods to cyclones.Rajasthan in the west and Madhya Pradesh in central India also witnessed cold wave conditions.Tourist resort Gulmarg in Kashmir, currently under the grip of the 40-day harshest winter period of ‘Chillai-Kalan’, was the coldest place in the Union Territory on Wednesday night with a minimum temperature of minus 10.4 degrees Celsius, officials said.“In Delhi, where the mercury has been showing a declining trend over the past few days, the average minimum temperature in December was the second-lowest in 15 years,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Data released by the IMD on Thursday showed that the mean minimum temperature (MMT) in the city this December was 7.1 degrees Celsius.It said the MMT for December in the national capital dipped below 7 degrees Celsius only once in the last 15 years — in 2018 when it was 6.7 degrees Celsius.Delhi also recorded eight cold wave days this December. It had recorded an equal number of cold wave days in December 2018.In December 1965, the city had recorded nine cold wave days, the maximum so far, the IMD said.In the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature dips to 4 degrees Celsius. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or lower and at least 4.5 notches below normal.The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 3.3 degrees Celsius on Thursday, down from 3.5 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.The mercury had settled at 3.6 degrees Celsius in the city on Tuesday and 5.6 degrees Celsius on Monday.Dense fog blanketed Delhi this morning, reducing the visibility to just 50 meters.According to Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, clear skies over Delhi-NCR, multiple western disturbances affecting the Himalayan region and the global impact of La Nina were the major reasons behind such low minimum temperatures.The cold wave tightened its grip in Kashmir and the mercury settled several notches below the freezing point across the valley, officials said.Gulmarg was the coldest place in Kashmir on Wednesday night with a minimum temperature of minus 10.4 degrees Celsius, as against minus 11 degrees Celsius on Tuesday night.Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 5.9 degrees Celsius, over three notches lower than the previous night’s minus 2.2 degrees Celsius.Qazigund recorded a minimum temperature of minus 6.2 degrees Celsius, Kupwara minus 5.8 degrees Celsius and Kokernag minus 7.8 degrees Celsius, the officials said.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’. During this period, a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies and the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.The chances of snowfall are the maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall.Parts of Himachal Pradesh also shivered amid sub-zero temperatures on Thursday.Tribal district Lahaul-Spiti’s administrative centre Keylong remained the coldest place in the state at minus 12.2 degrees Celsius, Shimla Meteorological Centre Director Manmohan Singh said.Kalpa in Kinnaur district recorded a low of minus 3.8 degrees Celsius, he said.Manali and Solan recorded a low of minus 1.6 degrees Celsius and minus 0.7 degrees Celsius.The weatherman forecast rain in the plains, and rain and snowfall in the middle and higher hills in the state from January 3 to 6.In the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, too, there was no respite from the bone-chilling cold. Several parts of the two states witnessed dense fog and recorded the season’s coldest night on Wednesday.Hisar in Haryana recorded the season’s coldest night as the mercury dipped to minus 1.2 degrees Celsius, eight notches below normal, the Meteorological Department in Chandigarh said.Narnaul also recorded the coldest night of the season with a minimum temperature of minus 0.5 degrees Celsius, it said.In Punjab, Bathinda recorded a minimum temperature of zero degrees Celsius, also the season’s lowest, while the mercury settled at 1.6 degrees Celsius in Amritsar and 1.2 degrees Celsius in Faridkot.In Uttar Pradesh, dense to very dense fog and cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places on Thursday, the Meteorological Department in Lucknow said.“Day temperatures fell markedly in the Meerut division. They were appreciably below normal in Agra division, below normal in Allahabad, Bareilly and Jhansi divisions and normal in the rest,” it said.Night temperatures were appreciably below normal in Kanpur, Lucknow and Bareilly divisions, below normal in Ayodhya, Jhansi and Meerut divisions and normal in other parts of the state.The lowest temperature in the state was recorded in Najibabad at 3 degrees Celsius while the highest was in Gorakhpur at 23 degrees Celsius, the MeT department said.Over a dozen districts in Rajasthan also recorded freezing temperatures, according to the weather department in Jaipur.The mercury dipped to minus 4.4 degrees Celsius in Mount Abu.In the plains, Churu continued to be the coldest place with a minimum temperature of minus 1.3 degrees Celsius.Sikar, Pilani and Vanasthali recorded lows of zero degrees Celsius, 0.2 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degrees Celsius, respectively.The weather department has predicted light rains at isolated places in the state over the next three days.Large parts of Madhya Pradesh also felt the chill on Thursday, even as the Meteorological Department in Bhopal said no respite from the cold is likely for the next few days.“In the 24 hours that ended at 8.30 am on Thursday, minimum temperatures were recorded in the range of 3 to 10 degrees Celsius at the IMD’s 31 weather stations in the state,” said GD Mishra, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Department in Bhopal.“The state’s lowest minimum temperature of 2.8 degrees Celsius was recorded at Datia,” he said, adding this was also the lowest temperature registered in the state so far this season.The cold weather conditions were likely to continue in the state for the next two to three days, he said.

Singh, who will now have his base in Chandigarh, was the joint general secretary (organisation) earlier, and was mostly seen in action in Rajasthan.The BJP has also appointed the party veteran V Satish as a “Sangathak (organiser)”, with the responsibilities, including SC-ST Morcha coordination, as he will look after the Parliamentary office coordination. Additionally, the national joint general secretary of BJP Shiv Prakash, with base in Bhopal, will look after the party’s affairs in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal.  Saudan Singh’s task has been cut out as the ripple effect of the farmers’ agitation is also showing impact in Haryana where the saffron outfit is in power in an alliance with the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) led by the deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala.In Himachal Pradesh, the BJP will be bracing up for the Assembly elections in 2022 amid the recent trends of the incumbent governments voted out by the people.   Hathras gangrape incident in western Uttar Pradesh had for a while shown the BJP’s weakness in lacking credible Dalit leadership. The western UP has also been seen emerging as a laboratory of young Dalit leadership, which is seen in the rise of Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan.The BJP leadership will be counting upon the veteran Satish, who has vast experience in the RSS and the party, to work on the strategy to consolidate support base among the Dalit, which is seen electorally formidable in the western UP, while the state will go to the Assembly elections in 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-ropes-in-party-veteran-saudan-singh-to-look-after-punjab-haryana-affairs-191993

He is a national hero and not just Army’s hero, so it should be everyone’s duty to honour our heroes. Army has taken up to lend dignity to Brig Usman’s grave again and repair and restoration work is in progress,” an Army source told PTI.The damage came to light after a web portal shared photographs of the current condition of the grave, following which the Army took cognisance of the matter.“The grave falls within the territorial jurisdiction of Jamia Millia Islamia, so the administration should be responsible for the maintenance of the grave. And, if they cannot maintain it, Army is fully capable of taking care of the grave of the war hero,” an Army source had said on Monday.Also, there was no plan to shift his remains to the Delhi Cantonment area, the source had added.The graveyard located in the Batla House area is the final resting place of many other eminent people.“The Army unit responsible for maintaining the grave concerned sought formal permission from the university for repairing and maintaining the grave. They were granted the permission,” a representative of the university said.Brig Usman belonged to the Parachute Regiment.A plaque adjoining the grave bears a eulogy to the officer who was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra and honoured with the title of ‘Naushera ka Sher’ for his heroics before his martyrdom.“Here lies the mortal remains of the brave son of soil, Late Brig Mohammed Usman, MVC (Posthumous). Decades and generations have passed, but his tomb stands testimony to the gallant saga of a true son of the motherland. It has and will continue to inspire future generations to come,” reads the plaque.The Army source said there are so many war heroes whose final resting places are located across the country, from small towns to big cities.“The Army does everything to maintain these graves, but local people and any other agency involved should also do their bit, these are heroes of the country,” the source added.

Its only loss was to Japan in the early nineties.“Not a single thing has moved. Is this the type of process we want or can we collectively come to a slightly better process which will yield results,” asked T S Tirumurti, India Permanent Representative to the UN about India’s aspiration to become a permanent member.“We would like to have a more cooperative structure in which we genuinely look out and find solutions and go beyond the rhetoric,” he added. PM Narendra Modi’s plans to convert India’s non-permanent presence at UNSC from 2021 to 2022 into a permanent membership is in disarray due to hostilities with China and a quasi-estrangement with Russia.“India will promote fundamental values like human rights and development and reinforce multilateralism while underlining the need for greater cooperation in the UN Security Council, he said while outlining a platter of more achievable objectives in areas such as counter-terrorism, peacekeeping, maritime security, technology for the people and developmental issues“Broadly these are some of the messages which we will carry in various degrees…We will be a country which will reinforce multilateralism. That would be the biggest strength of India in many ways when it gets into the Security Council,” he said.“The current multilateralism is not factoring in multi-polarity. When you have a structure, which is able to accommodate the multi-polarity in a multilateral framework, then automatically (there is) a more responsive, more rule-bound and more inclusive process,” he added.Tirumurti also suggested that India would play a balancing role at a time when the five permanent members of UNSC (P-5) are badly divided. “UN is losing coherence and we hope to bring this back by focusing on issues of priority to all Member States,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-focus-on-achievables-in-eighth-two-year-stint-on-unsc-191974

Help came from the NDRF, the Indian Army and the Odisha Fire Services in restoring municipal services of the city, which was crippled for days in the aftermath of Amphan,” the New Year message by the Governor stated.Without mentioning her name, the Governor pulled up Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her frequent outbursts against “outsiders” to counter the challenge posed by BJP against her in West Bengal.“Pray uniqueness and rich legacy of Bharat permeates and flourishes in the state. The oneness of the nation reflected in the Preamble of our Constitution. ‘WE THE PEOPLE’ must guide all those who misguidedly engage in divisive refrain of outsider,” the message by Dhankhar said.Hinting at the electoral violence by the ruling TMC in the panchayat elections held in West Bengal in 2018, Dhankhar prayed for violence-free Assembly general elections in the state in 2021 “with politically neutral stance of police and administration”.In his tweets, correspondence with the state government that has been made public by him and in press interactions, the Governor has often expressed concern about the politicisation of police and administration in West Bengal.Dhankhar’s wish list for 2021 also included people enjoying human rights and freedom and the state administration becoming “transparent and accountable”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-guvs-wishlist-for-2021-designed-to-enrage-cm-191973

The interest on the senior citizens’ scheme is paid quarterly. Interest rate on savings deposits has been retained at 4 per cent annually.The girl child savings scheme Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana will offer 7.6 per cent rate during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal.The annual interest rate on Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP) has been retained at 6.9 per cent.Term deposits of one-five years will fetch interest rate in the range of 5.5-6.7 per cent, to be paid quarterly, while the interest rate on five-year recurring deposit is pegged at 5.8 per cent. The unchanged small savings rates for Q4 FY2021 should help the central government to garner additional resources from this avenue, ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said.This will aid in preventing a revision in its dated borrowing programme for Q4 FY2021, despite the expected sharp widening in the fiscal deficit for the current fiscal, she added.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||Gang stole 500 cars from Delhi-NCR, sold them in Naxal-hit areas||The Delhi police have busted a syndicate involved in the theft and sale of more than 500 high-end luxury cars from Delhi and NCR. Three key members of the syndicate have been arrested.The kingpin, Waseem, has been operating in Delhi and NCR, Jaunpur (Uttar Pradesh) and Raipur (Chhattisgarh) for the past five years and has been involved in the theft of more than 500 cars.Fifteen luxury stolen vehicles — Fortuner, Creta, Brezza, Skoda, Ertiga, with one Royal Enfield motorcycle — have been recovered. The gang sold the vehicles in the Naxal-hit areas to make it difficult for them to be recovered.It was revealed that Waseem and his close associate Riyaz, hailing from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, had formed a gang of auto-lifters about five to six years back. Their modus operandi included the purchase of damaged cars’ scrap from the portals of different insurance companies and websites along with the original documents.Thereafter, they stole cars of the same make, model and colour from Delhi and NCR and transferred the details of the scrapped cars to the stolen cars by tampering with the engine and chassis numbers.“These stolen cars would be sold later in small towns such as Jaunpur and Raipur through car dealers. They would change the details so skilfully that even the transport authorities and finance companies could not detect the tampering. The gang then established its base in the Naxal-hit areas for selling the stolen vehicles to make it difficult for such vehicles to be recovered,” said Deepak Yadav, DCP East Delhi.Accused Satish Kumar (38), resident of Nand Nagri in Delhi, is a car painter. In 2019, he came in contact with Waseem who persuaded him to join his syndicate and asked him to deliver the stolen cars to the receivers at various places.Another accused Kunal Yadav (33), resident of Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, came in contact with Waseem in 2018, who enticed him with the promise of easy money. Kunal bought scrapped cars from the web portals of various insurance companies and car dealers and turned them over to Waseem.Rajikullah Khan (33), resident of Raipur in Chhattisgarh, initially started working as a driver but was not satisfied with the money he made. In 2018, he became part of the gang. His role was to sell the stolen cars with tampered chassis and engine numbers in Raipur.Waseem is yet to be caught and several teams have been formed to arrest him.

31-12-2020||---||BJP leader holds webinar on ‘One India, One Vote’, panellists argue its advantages||New Delhi, December 31Under the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP has launched a series outreach programme on the possibility of holding simultaneous elections in the country, as party leaders are organising webinars on the issue one after another.In one such virtual meet on “One India, One Vote” hosted by national spokesperson of BJP Tom Vadakkan, panellists from various parts of the world discussed various aspects of its implementation.Prominent among the speakers were Vibhuti Jha, president, Human Potential Project USA, and senior advocate of Supreme Court Rakesh Gosain.Vadakkan, while opening the discussion, highlighted the advantages of simultaneous elections in terms of government expenditure and development activities besides effective check on black money and efficiency of governance.Gosain said: “The 2019 Lok Sabha elections saw a spending of Rs 55,000 crore, which was the most expensive in the world. The problem with India is the status-quo mind-set, which we need to overcome in the election process. Simultaneous or One Nation One Election is not a new thing and has been done during the Pakistan and China War periods. It is not against the Constitution and can be achieved with minor amendments.”Another panellist, Jha, highlighted the advantages of the concept by comparing it with the US elections process.“India already has well-structured election machinery including election id with photos for voters, which is not present even in the US. The election commission would continue to be operational the same way with minor changes in its operational plan and implementation,” he said, adding that a focused group of constitutional experts, think tanks, representatives of political parties could derive the feasibility of ‘One India, One Vote’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leader-holds-webinar-on-one-india-one-vote-panellists-argue-its-advantages-191964

He has also served in Directorate of the Military Operations (MO).The appointment is seen as Indian Army’s commitment toward human rights. The post of Additional Directorate General Human rights was created under reforms approved by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh as part of the re-organisation of Army Headquarters last year.The human rights unit was created with a motive to ensure the Army’s compliance with human rights conventions and values. It will be the nodal point to examine any human rights violation reports.“To enhance transparency and ensure the best of investigative expertise is available to the section, a police officer of SSP/SP rank will be taken on deputation,” the defence ministry had stated.The human right cell will also have an Indian Police Service officer who will facilitate necessary coordination with other organisations and the home ministry on the human rights issues at hand.The decision to have an Indian Police Service officer on board caused heartburn in a few sections of the Army and is being seen as inviting unnecessary interference by an outsider. Army headquarters stated that had having a police officer on board is critical when it comes to coordinating with different ministries and civil agencies, especially the police.For last several years, the force has often been charged with human right violations in Jammu and Kashmir and in the North East. But the Indian army has maintained that its human rights record is above board.  — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maj-gen-gautam-chauhan-becomes-first-to-head-armys-human-rights-cell-191963

31-12-2020||New Delhi||Probably we will have a very happy New Year: DCGI on COVID-19 vaccine||India is likely to have a COVID-19 vaccine in the New Year, Drug Controller General of India VG Somani hinted on Thursday.Speaking at a webinar organised by the Department of Biotechnology, Somani said the most important thing was that the industry and research organisations had stood the test of time.He talked about the efforts made by the Department of Biotechnology and said vaccine candidates have got funding.“...and probably we will have a very happy New Year with something in hand. That’s what I can hint at,” Somnai said.The Serum Institute of India (SII), Bharat Biotech and Pfizer have applied to the DCGI seeking emergency use authorisation for their COVID-19 vaccine candidates and are awaiting approval.Somani said the approval process was fast-tracked in view of the pandemic by quickly processing all applications, allowing parallel phase 1 and 2 trials without waiting for complete data.For restricted emergency use authorisation, he said: “There are certain parameters that if we get limited data or partial data of reasonable safety and efficacy, we will allow that vaccine to come into the immunisation programme into the market.”“As such, there is no compromise at all in the safety, efficacy and quality except for accepting the partial data for emergency use authorisation,” he added.An expert panel in the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) met on Wednesday to consider emergency use authorisation applications by SII for the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine and Bharat Biotech’s ‘Covaxin’, and it will reconvene on January 1 to further deliberate on the matter.The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on COVID-19 on Wednesday deliberated and analysed the additional data and information submitted by the SII and Bharat Biotech.Six vaccines are at various stages of clinical trials, of which four are being indigenously developed.The clinical trials by Bharat Biotech are in phase 3 while the one which is being developed by Zydus Cadila is in phase 2 clinical trial.SII is also conducting phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine.Similarly, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is conducting phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for Russian vaccine Sputnik V.Umesh Shaligram, director (R&D), SII said it had the strategy of working on several platforms to address the pandemic.“As of today, it has 75 million doses of Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine. By the first week of January, we (will) have something around 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine. On the global platform we are working with Astrazeneca. If all goes well, and if experts are true, we may have an emergency authorisation in the coming few days,” Shaligram said.He said the company had also collaborated with Novavax for another vaccine.V Krishna Mohan, executive director of Bharat Biotech, said the company was also working on a nasal vaccine.“This will not require syringes and various infrastructure that it requires for vaccine administration. Hopefully, that should be making it a lot easier from the immunisation perspective and make the whole programme smoother,” he said.He urged organisations such as the DBT and Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to bring up capacity to do large-scale efficacy trials in the country.

The meeting also decided to hold the next round of military dialogue at an early date.In the midst of the eastern Ladakh standoff, Chinese President Xi Jinping on December 19 appointed a new General as the Commander of the People’s Liberation Army’s Western Theatre Command which oversees the China-India border.Xi, who heads the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high-command of the two million-strong People’s Liberation Army (PLA), appointed Gen. Zhang Xudong as the Commander of the Western Theatre Command.Gen. Zhang succeeds 65-year-old Gen. Zhao Zongqi who headed the Western Theatre Command during the 2017 Doklam standoff where the Indian Army stood up against the PLA’s plan of laying a road close to the Indian border in an area claimed by Bhutan.The Ladakh standoff also happened under the watch of Gen Zhao.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||CBSE classes 10, 12 exams from May 4 to June 10 next year||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will conduct board exams for classes 10 and 12 physically from May 4 to June 10 next year, Union Minister of Education Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ announced on Thursday.Practical examinations will be conducted by schools from March 1. The results of the board exams will be announced by July 15, he added.Usually, practical exams are conducted in January and written exams begin in February and conclude in March. However, the exams are being delayed this session in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.“The board exams for classes 10 and 12 will be conducted from May 4 to June 10. Schools will be allowed to conduct practical exams from March 1. Date sheet for both the classes will be issued soon. The result will be declared by July 15,” Pokhriyal announced.“We are also working on a solution in this regard for CBSE schools in over 25 countries and will have an update soon,” he said, adding that the dates have been fixed after considering the suggestions given by students, teachers and parents.Several schools have already conducted pre-board exams online to keep the students prepared.The CBSE had earlier this month announced that board exams in 2021 will be conducted in written mode and not online.Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of COVID-19. They were partially reopened in some states from October 15.However, a few states have decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in the number of infections.The board exams this year had to be postponed mid-way in March. They were later cancelled and the results announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme.“Students, teachers and schools are facing an unprecedented and uncertain situation due to the COVID-19 epidemic but teachers have worked tirelessly to ensure that students do not face any difficulty in their studies,” Pokhriyal said.The Ministry of Education had also announced that JEE-Mains for admission to engineering colleges will be held four times a year starting 2021 to offer flexibility to students and a chance to improve their scores.The first edition of the Joint Entrance Examination-Mains (JEE-Mains) will be held from February 23 to 26, followed by rounds in March, April and May.The delay in board exams, however, may affect the conduct of all-India medical entrance exam—National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) -- which is usually conducted in May. There is no official communication on it yet. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-classes-10-12-exams-from-may-4-to-june-10-next-year-191951
31-12-2020||New Delhi||Nationwide average retail price of onion down 60% since last year: Govt||All-India average retail price of onions has dropped by 60 per cent this year to Rs 40 per kg on timely government interventions to boost the supply, Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan said on Thursday.Speaking to PTI, Nandan said there has been a sharp drop in onion prices across the country.“In one month alone, the all-India average retail price of onion has dropped by 33.33 per cent to Rs 40 per kg today from Rs 60 per kg on November 30 this year,” she said.Since December 31, 2019, when the nationwide average price was as high as Rs 100 per kg, it has fallen to Rs 40 per kg now, giving much relief to consumers, Nandan said.In the national capital, the average price is even lower at Rs 30 per kg as on Thursday, as compared to Rs 100 per kg on December 31, 2019, she said.In Mumbai, the average price was Rs 48 per kg on Thursday as against Rs 93 per kg a year ago, while it has fallen from Rs 90 to Rs 40 per kg in Kolkata and from Rs 85 to Rs 42 per kg in the said period, according to data maintained by the Consumer Affairs Ministry.However, private traders said retail prices of onions vary depending on the quality and locality when compared with the government price data.Nandan said the 60 per cent decline in the nationwide average price has been possible due to timely government interventions taken since September.Highlighting a series of measures taken to check onion prices, the secretary said the government first completely banned onion export on September 14.After that, stock limit was imposed for three months from October 23 to December 31 on wholesalers and retailers. In the very first instance, the government prescribed quantities that traders are allowed to stock and this had an immediate impact, she said.Further, the government facilitated the import of onions to improve the local supply and control price rise.“Lot of facilitation was done at Attari-Wagah border (Punjab) and at seaports for quick evacuation of imported onions. Good quantities of imported onions arrived,” she said.According to the secretary, the government took steps to facilitate import from Afghanistan and other countries, as also to directly import onions through cooperative Nafed.“Around Rs 70,000-75,000 tonnes of onions were imported through private trades in 2020. Nafed also imported around 3,000 tonnes of onions,” she said.Nafed imported red onions of a particular dimension. taking into account the last year’s experience, and immediately offloaded those in the local market that helped cool down the prices, she said.“All these steps taken together have resulted in a situation where figures speak for themselves,” she noted.Asked about the rise in onion prices at Lasalgaon wholesale market in Maharashtra after the government announced the lifting of the export ban from January 1, the Secretary said, “That is good. If good quantities are coming into the market, then there is no need to artificially constrain the exports. There is logic.”The measures to ban export earlier were taken with the purpose to control consumer prices which have an impact on consumer price inflation, she said.Nandan said retail onion prices cooled down with the arrival of fresh kharif crop supply in the markets.She also said that the country’s kharif onion production has been as per expectations.Going forward, the government has decided to enhance the buffer stock of onion from 1 lakh tonnes to 1.5 lakh tonnes for the rabi season of 2021, she added.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||No New Year celebrations until govt accepts our demands: Farmers protesting at Singhu border||Thousands of farmers protesting at the Singhu border for over a month now will ring in the New Year sans any celebrations.“There is no New Year for us until the government accepts our demands,” said Harjinder Singh from Punjab’s Ropar, who has been camping at the Delhi-Haryana border since November 25.In the last round of talks on Wednesday, the government addressed the farmers’ concerns over the increasing power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but that wasn’t good enough news to celebrate yet, said the farmers.Among the issues that continue to remain unresolved are the revocation of the new farm laws and a legal guarantee of the minimum support price for their crops.“the demands that they have agreed to were not laws yet. Their impact was yet to be felt. And we went to the government with the demands with clarity. They cannot pick and choose what suits them. They have to listen to all our demands,” said Harmesh Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Hoshiarpur.“If the government wants to see our strength, we will show them. People like us who are used to living in ‘kothis’ (bungalows) are now sleeping on the road. We have been protesting peacefully for a month, we can keep protesting for a year too,” added Bhupinder Singh, also from Hoshiarpur.Most farmers this year will be welcoming the New Year away from their families but they are not complaining.“Yes, we have a family back home and we are missing them, but this is also our family. All these farmers are our brothers, and uncles,” said Harjinder.Gurpreet Hayer from Jalandhar and Pratap Singh from Bhatinda have decided to do ‘sewa’ in the New Year as they had done in the past.Gurpreet said he will be working with Gursikh Sewa Society to put up a “turban langar” for all the farmers on Friday.“We will celebrate the New Year by doing sewa. There are many farmers who don’t know how to tie a turban, or don’t have a fresh turban. We will give them that,” he said.Pratap said he would pay a visit to the Bangla Sahib Gurudwara here on the first day of the year.“Every New Year we go to pay our respects at gurudwara and do sewa at langar. This year too, I will do the same here,” he said.Among the bare minimum celebrations, the Working People’s Charter has called upon people from across the country to usher in the New Year with the farmers.“These laws are not just anti-farmer but also anti-poor. And we want all the people who go out to celebrate New Year to come and celebrate with the farmers, with the aim of demanding social justice for them. There will be bonfire, good conversations and songs of revolution,” said Nirmal Agni from Working People’s Charter.Farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and Mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.

She was taken to a government hospital where she was declared brought dead, the police official said.Patil had been spotted roaming in the area around the same time, so the police suspected his involvement in the heinous crime.He has several cases registered against him and had secured bail in a rape case only 10 days ago, the official said.Police formed a special team to track him down.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||From record foodgrain production to farmer protests, eventful year for growing agri sector||Indian agriculture sector achieved record foodgrain production and registered positive growth despite the coronavirus pandemic but the massive farmers’ protest at the borders of the national capital against the new farm laws overshadowed its remarkable performance this year.Notwithstanding the cold weather and pandemic concerns, the protest by thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, started in late November and is continuing even as the government and around 40 farmer unions have so far held as many as six rounds of formal discussions to break the deadlock.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who is leading the negotiations with the unions, was hopeful of finding solutions before the year end, but it was not meant to be.Later, Tomar said he expects the New Year to herald new solutions to end the crisis.In the last meeting between the government and the unions on Wednesday, both sides reached at a consensus regarding concerns about the proposed electricity amendment bill and the ordinance on air pollution that penalises farmers for stubble burning.The government has promised to decriminalise stubble burning by farmers and also assured continuation of power subsidies.But the talks on the contentious issues and two main demands—repealing of three news laws enacted in September and legal guarantee for MSP (Minimum Support Price) procurement system—remained inconclusive. Now, both sides hope for a resolution in the New Year and the next round of talks is scheduled to be held on January 4.The country’s agriculture sector, which contributes around 15 per cent of the GDP and employs more than half of the population, saw good, bad and ugly moments in equal measure this year. Nevertheless, the sector remained the only bright spot in the Indian economy, which was battered by the pandemic.At a time when almost all the industries were severely impacted, the agriculture and allied sectors grew 3.4 per cent in both first and second quarters of this fiscal while the economy contracted 23.9 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, during the same period.The country had record foodgrain production of 296.65 million tonnes in 2019-20 crop year (July-June) and the output could cross 300 million tonnes in the current 2020-21 on good monsoon, which has led to higher sowing of kharif and rabi crops.Just before the outbreak of the pandemic in the country, the Union government in the Budget in February enhanced allocation for agriculture and allied sector by 30 per cent to Rs 1,42,761 crore for this fiscal. Besides, several new programmes were announced.As the government was busy preparing for roll out of the Budget decisions, including Kisan Rail and Kisan UDAN, the nationwide lockdown was imposed for little over two months from late March to curb spreading of coronavirus infections.The lockdown was imposed at a time when the rabi crops like wheat were ready for harvesting. The government eased lockdown restrictions for farm activities to ensure food security.While many farmers, especially those growing perishables items, suffered in the initial days of the lockdown and were forced to dump their crops, paddy and wheat growers were able to sell their crops. The government purchased a record 39 million tonnes of wheat at the MSP.Thanks to good southwest monsoon and relaxed lockdown norms that ensured timely supply of farm inputs, farmers sowed kharif crops like paddy on time and harvested the crop. Like wheat, the government has already procured record 45 million tonnes of paddy so far in this kharif marketing season.The government, which was sitting on huge buffer stocks of foodgrains because of bumper production and procurement in the last several years, provided free ration to whopping 80 crore poor from April till November, a major relief for people severely impacted by the pandemic.While wheat procurement was underway, the Centre saw farmers facing problems in marketing of other commodities during the pandemic as they were forced to sell their produce in regulated mandis without waiting for better rates in the absence of proper agri-infrastructure.This prompted the government to announce slew of incentives in May for the agriculture sector and allied activities, including setting up of a Rs 1 lakh crore agri-infrastructure fund. The announcement was part of the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore fiscal stimulus package to fight the COVID-19 crisis.The government also announced amendments to the Essential Commodities Act to deregulate food stuffs and a central law to provide adequate choices to the farmers to sell produce at an attractive price, barrier-free inter-state trade and framework for e-trading of agricultural produce.To ensure that farmers do not face problems in selling their kharif produce when harvesting begins from October, the government hurriedly in June came out with three ordinances to deregulate selected food commodities (cereals, edible oil, oilseeds, pulses, onions and potato), permit trading outside regulated mandis and encourage contract farming.There was not much opposition when these ordinances were brought during the lockdown but all hell broke loose when these were replaced with laws passed by Parliament in September as the Opposition voiced concerns that the bills were an attempt to bypass state laws on agriculture.Shiromani Akali Dal, which was part of the NDA, opposed the bills and Union food processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Cabinet. Later, Akali Dal walked out of the NDA as well.After the passage of the laws, farmers’ protest started in Congress-ruled Punjab.Initially, representatives of 31 farmers unions confined their protest to Punjab where they blocked trains for nearly two months. Later, with their clarion ‘Delhi chalo’ call, they moved to the borders of the national capital where other frontal organisations like All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) joined the protest and played a pivotal role in bringing together farmer unions from different parts of the country.In total, 40 farmer unions, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at Delhi borders for over a month now and the logjam continues. The Opposition parties, too, have lent their support to the protest.The unions have kept the government on tenterhooks with their demand for repeal of the three pro-market farm laws enacted in September. The government has been maintaining that these laws are for the benefits of farmers and launched a massive campaign to create awareness about these laws as well as share success stories after implementation of these legislations.The Centre blamed Opposition parties for misleading farmers and also accused them of taking U-turn on these reforms. Some ministers even alleged that anti-social elements and naxals have hijacked the farmers’ protest.It remains to be seen whether the Centre and the unions are able to find some common ground on January 4 meeting or the protest continues for a longer period of time.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||Health Ministry releases communication strategy to support COVID-19 vaccine rollout||The Union Health Ministry on Thursday released a communication strategy to support the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in India that seeks to disseminate accurate and transparent information by alleviating apprehensions and ensuring its acceptance.The 88-page document details information to guide national, state and district level communication activities to enable information about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination process reaches all people, across all states in the country.“The communication strategy that supports the COVID-19 vaccines rollout in India seeks to disseminate timely, accurate and transparent information about the vaccine(s) to alleviate apprehensions about the vaccine, ensure its acceptance and encourage uptake,” it said.According to the document, the strategy aims at managing and mitigating any potential disappointment expressed by unmet demand for the vaccine or ‘eagerness’ amongst people and addressing vaccine ‘hesitancy’ that could arise because of apprehensions around vaccine safety, efficacy apart from any other myths and misconceptions.It also aims to provide information on potential risks and mitigate unintended crisis during the introduction and rollout.“The strategy also seeks to build trust and enable greater confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine amongst all people by employing transparency in communication, while also managing any mis/disinformation and rumours around it,” it said.The Health Ministry intends to achieve this in three ways. Firstly, using the social influence or endorsements from experts and official voices to spell out the process of immunisation (where, how, who, when – date and time); emphasise on the safety and efficacy of vaccines and explain the decision to conduct the drive in a phased manner.Secondly, the ministry intends to establish a National Media Rapid Response Cell (NMRRC) under its ambit to ensure preparedness through media monitoring and social listening to respond in real time. It will also unfold media and public discourse through extensive monitoring of print, electronic and digital media.Thirdly, this will be achieved by involving community mobilisers and frontline workers to engage with the community at various levels through community consultations, faith leaders and religious meetings, engaging youth, civil-society organisations, self-help groups, panchayats and other community-based platforms.The four key areas that will be addressed as part of interventions under the strategy are—giving information on COVID-19 vaccines, addressing vaccine hesitancy, building vaccine eagerness along with maintaining and sustaining COVID appropriate behaviours.In case of any adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI), the strategy emphasises on supporting the mobilisers and health workforce in managing crisis situations by appealing to the community to stay calm while waiting for a proper diagnosis and prevent aggressive behaviour against health workers.

Long queues of vehicles not only on the highway but also on alternative routes were witnessed causing a great inconvenience to the commuters.“It was around 2 pm when a group of more than 100 farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan in over a dozen tractor-trailers suddenly started removing boulders and barricadings placed on the highway. The police lobbed tear gas shells but the farmers did not stop and broke the barricades from their tractors,” said Ashok Arya, a leader of All India Kisan Sabha, adding that two farmers also suffered injuries while breaking the barricades.Arya maintained Swaraj Abhiyan Chief Yogendra and other farmer leaders present on the spot also appealed to the farmers not to move ahead without getting any direction from the central leadership of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha but they did not stop.“We want to celebrate New Year in the national capital in order to give a message to the Centre Government that no power can stop the farmers from reaching Delhi. We will not end our stir without the repeal of three black laws,” said a protesting farmer, adding that they would join their other farmers staging dharna at Delhi borders.Rewari SP Abhishek Jorwal said they would not allow the farmers to go ahead.“Elaborate arrangements have been made to stop them from moving ahead,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-haryana-border-cops-use-water-cannon-tear-gas-as-farmers-break-through-barricades-191935

It was he who, following a secret expedition, had made a report on the strategic importance of Siachen which had prompted Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to okay Operation Meghdoot on April 13, 1984.The Glacier was captured as Indian troops raced to hold the ridgeline beating Pakistan Army to the top. The 109 km actual ground position line (AGPL) that separates India and Pakistan on the glacier is the result of Col Kumar’s mountaineering expedition. The Army had named the launch base of the expedition as ‘Kumar base’, a rare honour for a serving officer. Sometime in the mid 1970s Col Kumar was posted to High Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg, when a German  explorer showed him a US map of northern Kashmir that marked the Line of Control (LoC) showing Siachen in Pakistan.Siachen Glacier lies to the north of Point NJ 9842. The 1949 Karachi agreement between India and Pakistan had a vague demarcation of territories north of point NJ9842. However, on sensing Pakistan's intentions, India launched Operation Meghdoot and occupied the glacier. Earlier in 1965, he was part of the Capt MS Kohli-led expedition to Mount Everest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/siachen-explorer-colonel-narendra-bull-kumar-passes-away-at-87-191932

The families of the sailors, many of whom are based in Maharashtra, have been running from pillar to post with no help in sight," she said.Two cargo vessels—MV Anastasia and MV Jag Anand—with 39 Indians on board have been on anchorage in Chinese waters as they were not allowed to unload their cargo though some other ships have managed to do so."The impasse came due to a trade war that has forced the two vessels to drop anchor at Chinese ports. The ships were refused permission by the Chinese authorities to offload their cargo and were not even allowed to send other sailors to relieve the crew," Chaturvedi said in the letter.While MV Anastasia has been docked at China's Bohai sea, MV Jag Anand is anchored at Port of Jingtang, she said.Chaturvedi said that trade disputes between countries were not new and citizens cannot be made "sacrificial lambs" in such matters."This impasse needs to be resolved at the earliest and the sailors should be brought back home," she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bring-back-39-indian-sailors-stuck-in-china-sena-urges-centre-191925

31-12-2020||Peshawar||30 arrested over attack on Hindu temple in northwest Pakistan||Over 30 people, mostly members of a radical Islamist party, were arrested after a Hindu temple was vandalised and set on fire by a mob protesting against its expansion work in northwest Pakistan, officials said on Thursday.The attack on the temple in Terri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s (KP) Karak district on Wednesday drew strong condemnation from human rights activists and Hindu community leaders.On Thursday, the provincial government ordered authorities to reconstruct the damaged temple as it vowed to bring the culprits to justice.The temple was attacked by the mob after members of the Hindu community received permission from local authorities to renovate its decades-old building, according to witnesses.The mob, led by a local cleric and supporters of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party (Fazal ur Rehman group), demolished the newly constructed work alongside the old structure, they said.According to local police, they arrested more than 30 people, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam leader Rehmat Salam Khattak, in overnight raids. Over 350 people have been named in the FIR, Provincial Police Chief KPK Sanaullah Abbasi has said.Abbasi said all sections of law relating to terrorism have been included in the FIR against the accused. The police will ensure protection to worship places of minorities in the province, he added.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Thursday took notice of the attack and ordered the local authorities to appear before the court on January 5.According to a statement by the apex court, Hindu lawmaker and the Pakistan Hindu Council chief Ramesh Kumar Vankwani called on Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed in Karachi to discuss the issue.“The chief justice of Pakistan showed grave concern over the tragic incident and informed the member of parliament that he has already taken cognisance of the issue and has fixed the matter before court on January 5, at Islamabad,” according to the statement.The court has issued directions to one-man Commission on Minorities Rights, KP chief secretary and KP inspector general of police to visit the site and submit a report on January 4.Chief Minister’s Special Assistant for Information and spokesman for the KP government Kamran Bangash said on Thursday that the government would reconstruct the temple, which was damaged in the mob attack.Deputy Commissioner and District Police Officer Karak have been issued directives to take immediate steps for reconstructing the temple, Bangash said.The government is bound to give protection to the minorities and their worship places, he added.Pakistan’s Religious Affairs Minister Noorul Haq Qadri termed the destruction of the temple against the teaching of Islam. He said the constitution of the country ensured the protection of religious places of minorities.Federal Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari strongly condemned the attack and vowed to bring the culprits to justice. “Strongly condemn the burning of a Hindu temple by a mob in Karak, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa,” she said in a tweet.“(The) K-P government must ensure culprits brought to justice. MOHR also moving on this. We as a govt have a responsibility to ensure safety & security of all our citizens & their places of worship,” she added.Pakistan’s federal Parliamentary Secretary for Human Rights Lal Chand Malhi strongly condemned the attack on the temple.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan termed the attack on the temple as “an unfortunate incident”.He ordered immediate arrest of those involved in the incident.Khan vowed that his government would protect worship places from such incidents.Leader of Hindu Community Peshawar Haroon Sarab Diyal said a samadhi of a Hindu religious leader existed at the temple site and Hindu families from across the country visited the samadhi on every Thursday.The Samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj is considered sacred by the Hindu community. It was built where he died in 1919 in Teri village of Karak.The controversy over the samadhi erupted many decades ago.According to the details submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014 in a case about it, the Hindus had been visiting the shrine till 1997 when it was dismantled by the locals.The apex court in 2014 ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to restore and reconstruct the Hindu shrine.The order was issued over a petition of a Hindu lawmaker who had claimed that the shrine had been occupied by an influential cleric of the area.According to police officials, a meeting of clerics was held at Shanki Adda in Teri, Karak before the attack on Wednesday.The enraged people were raising slogans, vowing they would not permit any construction work at the shrine.The protesters were peaceful in the initial stage but on the provocation of some clerics, they turned violent and attacked the shrine, police said.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/30-arrested-over-attack-on-hindu-temple-in-northwest-pakistan-191920

On the other hand, the electrical propulsion system is much lighter, say 200-300 kg. When electrical propulsion is used, then the satellite's payload can be increased or the satellite can be put into orbit by a lightweight rocket," Sivan said.The ISRO chief said that the payload of six-tonne satellite with chemical fuel can be configured in a satellite weighing four tonnes when powered by electrical propulsion.Presently, ISRO can put into orbit communication satellites weighing up to four tonnes with its rockets and satellites over four tonnes are orbited using European space agency Arianespace's Ariane rocket."When the weight of the satellite goes down due to electric propulsion, we can use a normal geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) rocket instead of GSLV-Mk III rocket or the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) instead of the normal GSLV rocket," Sivan added."We will soon launch an electric propulsion technology demonstrator satellite," he added.ISRO has successfully demonstrated electric propulsion system for station-keeping operations in the South Asia Satellite, launched on May 5, 2017.In 2010, ISRO flew its communication satellite GSAT-4 with electrical propulsion and other new technologies. The satellite however did not reach its intended orbit owing to problems in the GSLV rocket's third stage. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-working-on-green-fuels-like-hydrogen-peroxide-for-rockets-191913

There were doubts everywhere. But 2021 is coming up with a ray of hope in terms of its treatment," Modi said."Preparations are in full swing for the vaccination drive in India. Efforts to make a 'Made in India' vaccine available to every eligible beneficiary are in its last stage. We are fully prepared to launch the world's biggest vaccination drive," Modi said.In comparison to other countries, India is in a better position in terms of infection and deaths due to coronavirus, as the country took "timely and effective steps", he said.Modi paid tributes to health care and frontline workers, scientists and good Samaritans for their sacrifices and services to society during the pandemic."We are working on mission mode to improve medical education in India. After the formation of National Medical Commission, the quality and quantity of health education will improve," he added.Over Rs 30,000 crore of poor people's money had been saved due to the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, Modi said."Jan Aushadhi Kendras are also a friend of poor people during illness.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||Several Delhi border points remain closed due to farmers' protest||Thousands of farmers stayed put at their protest venues near Delhi's border on Thursday as their talks with the government remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.The government and farm unions had reached some common ground on Wednesday to resolve protesting farmers' concerns over the rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning.After the sixth round of negotiations between three union ministers and a 41-member representative group of thousands of farmers protesting on Delhi borders, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said at least 50 per cent resolution has been reached with mutual agreement on two out of four items on the agenda and discussions would continue on the remaining two on January 4.Braving the winter chill, farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month against these three new laws.Security remained tight at the Delhi borders with hundreds of personnel deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri border points where the farmers have been camping.The protests have also led to traffic congestion forcing police to divert vehicular movement.Taking to Twitter on Thursday, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the routes that remained closed owing to the agitation and suggested them to take alternative roads.“Tikri, Dhansa Borders are closed for any Traffic Movement. Jhatikara Borders is open only for LMV (Cars/ Light Motor Vehicles), two-wheelers and pedestrian movement,” it tweeted.“The Chilla and Ghazipur Borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Apsara, Bhopra & Loni Borders.Also read:CM Pinarayi Vijayan moves resolution against central farm laws in Kerala AssemblyUndeterred by bitter cold, more farmers leave for DelhiHow the ice was broken during sixth round of talks between govt and farmers“Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli & Mangesh borders closed. Please take alternate route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and GTK road.

At 15.2 degrees Celsius, it recorded the season's lowest maximum temperature on December 18.Srivastava said "dense" fog accumulated over Delhi-NCR, Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh, lowering visibility to 50 metres at many places.Visibility levels at Safdarjung and Palam dropped to 100 metres and 50 metres, respectively, due to dense fog, he said.According to the IMD, "very dense" fog is when visibility is between 0 and 50 metres, 51 and 200 is "dense", 201 and 500 "moderate", and 501 and 1,000 "shallow".The cold wave is likely to continue on Friday as well. Thereafter, the minimum temperature will start rising under the influence of an "intense" Western Disturbance (WD) which will affect northwest India from January 2 to January 6, Srivastava said.The minimum temperature is predicted to rise to eight degrees Celsius by January 4-5.Light rain is also expected in the national capital under the influence of the WD from January 3 to January 5.The WD will lead to moderate snowfall in the western Himalayan region, the IMD said.In the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature dips to 4 degrees Celsius.

This is something which India as a country, as what it stands for, will take to the council.Tirumurti said India would "definitely" emphasise a greater need for cooperation in the council, which should not be a place where because of any paralysis of decision-making, urgent requirements do not get properly focused."We would like to have a more cooperative structure in which we genuinely look out and find solutions and go beyond the rhetoric," the envoy said.India will also underscore the importance of respect for rule of law and international law."The current multilateralism is not factoring in multi-polarity. When you have a structure, which is able to accommodate the multi-polarity in a multilateral framework, then automatically (there is) a more responsive, more rule-bound and more inclusive process," he said, adding that this will lead to reform in the multilateral system."Broadly these are some of the messages which we will carry in various degrees…We will be a country which will reinforce multilateralism. That would be the biggest strength of India in many ways when it gets into the Security Council," he said.Tirumurti has outlined counter-terrorism, peacekeeping, maritime security, reformed multilateralism, technology for the people, women and youth and developmental issues, especially in the context of peace building, as India's priorities for the UNSC tenure."I feel India's presence in the Security Council is needed at this juncture when there are deep fissures between P-5 themselves and also between other countries. UN is losing coherence and we hope to bring this back by focusing on issues of priority to all Member States," Tirumurti had said.India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council, saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the council, which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st century.On the long-delayed UNSC reforms, Tirumurti criticised the lack of progress and said that hardly anything has happened in the last decade."Not a single thing has moved. Is this the type of process we want or can we collectively come to a slightly better process which will yield results," he said.He underlined that it was time for a "genuine process" wherein Member States work with a single text for negotiations.Tirumurti also said that in the last few months, he has tried to define India's interests a "bit more sharply", including on the question of terrorism."We have said that let us pursue terrorism with a single-minded determination and not start giving excuses and justifications for these," the Indian envoy said.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||How the ice was broken during sixth round of talks between govt and farmers||The lunch diplomacy of Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has played an instrumental role in shaping up a positive development following the sixth round of talks between the government and the representatives of farmers' organisations.Unlike the previous five meetings that ended on an inconclusive note, the sixth round of talks held here at Vigyan Bhawan on Wednesday saw the government and farmers coming on the same page on two key issues out of four.The way the Wednesday meeting between the farmers and the government happened, the possibilities of solving the farmers' movement have increased.Farmer leaders are also hopeful that the way the government on Wednesday agreed to the demands like keeping farmers out of the purview of stubble burning and continuation of electricity subsidy, in the same way, the meeting on January 4 will also be positive.The agenda for the January 4 meeting has been set.This meeting is to be held on two issues like the three agricultural laws and the guarantee of MSP.Also read: CM Pinarayi Vijayan moves resolution against central farm laws in Kerala AssemblySeveral Delhi border points remain closed due to farmers' protestUndeterred by bitter cold, more farmers leave for DelhiDuring the lunch break at Vigyan Bhawan on Wednesday at 2.30 pm, two hours after the sixth round meeting, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Union Minister of State Som Prakash reached out to the farm leaders when they were getting ready to eat the 'langar' meal.Since the last two meetings, the farmer leaders have been eating the langar meal instead of the food being provided by the government during the meal breaks.Agriculture Minister Tomar, addressing a farmer leader, said: "O Paa ji ... you are eating alone?" Responding to this, the farmer leader said: "No... no Sir... let's arrange some meal plates for you." Soon, the three ministers of the Narendra Modi government also took a plate in their hands and started queuing up to eat the langar meal.According to sources, the ice was broken mainly during the lunch break. What could not be seen happening during the presentation of the officers in the meeting of Vigyan Bhawan happened during a casual conversation between the ministers and the farmer leaders.Eating lunch with the ministers and then later having tea break together also sent out a positive message among the farmer leaders.Tomar also agreed to continue the power subsidy, along with withdrawal of provisions for action against farmers for burning stubble in the ordinance brought to prevent air pollution in Delhi-NCR during lunch and tea break.At the same time, he tried to find a middle path by asking the farmer leaders to form a committee on MSP and all three agricultural laws. According to sources, this softening in the attitude of the government was appreciated by the farmer leaders due to which the representatives after resolving the issues related to stubble and electricity, willingly approved to attend the meeting on January 4 on Agriculture Law and MSP.What did farmer leaders say?Farmer leader Shivkumar Kakka told IANS: "A total of four issues were taken up in today's meeting, out of which the government has agreed to two demands from farmers. Now agriculture laws and MSP are to be discussed further." Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), told IANS that the conversation took place in a positive environment.Harpal Singh Bellary of the BKU told IANS: "The government has agreed to issue the order, agreeing on two issues related to electricity and stubble. The repeal of the three laws and the guarantee of the MSP could not be done yet. Now, these two issues will be discussed in the January 4 meeting.

The concerns of the farmers on the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill and the Air Quality Management Ordinance (containing penal provisions for stubble burning) had been addressed, he said.Tomar lauded the farm leaders for maintaining peace and discipline during their protest, but urged them to send the elderly, women and the children back home due to the extreme weather. He said the union leaders insisted on repealing the laws, but the government side tried to explain to them the benefits of the Acts and sought to know the specific points they feared. On legal guarantee for MSP (minimum support price), the minister said the government had already declared that it was ready to give a written assurance. Tomar was accompanied by Railways Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash.Farm union leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ruldu Singh and Gurnam Singh Charuni said after the meeting that they had decided to defer tomorrow’s tractor march from Singhu to Tikri via the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway. The farm leaders, however, said they had made it clear to the government that decision on repealing the laws would be key to ending the impasse.While the three ministers joined the farm leaders to share their ‘langar’ during the lunch break, the union representatives accepted the beverage offered by the government during the evening tea break. In the last five meetings, farmer leaders had refused to accept even water offered by the government.Also read:||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agreement-on-2-points-next-talks-on-january-4-191629

The missile was inducted in the IAF in 2014 and the Army in 2015. It is used largely in air defence roles, implying to bring down incoming aerial targets. The missile made by Public Sector giant Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) is over 96 per cent indigenous.After its induction in the Indian armed forces, interest was shown in Akash missile by many friendly countries during international exhibitions.So far, Indian defence exports included parts or components. The export of big platforms was minimal. This initiative of the Cabinet will help the country improve its defence products and make them globally competitive. The export version of Akash will be different from the system currently deployed with the armed forces. Besides Akash, there is interest coming in other major platforms like Coastal Surveillance System and Radars and Air platforms. To provide faster approval for export of such platforms, a committee comprising the Defence Minister, External Affairs Minister and National Security Adviser has been created. The committee will authorise subsequent exports of major indigenous platforms to various countries. It will also explore various available options, including the government-to-government route.The Government of India intends to focus on exporting high-value defence platforms to achieve the target of $5 billion of defence exports and improve strategic relations with friendly foreign countries.Nod to Indian missions in 3 countries||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-approves-sale-of-akash-missile-system-to-foreign-nations-191604
