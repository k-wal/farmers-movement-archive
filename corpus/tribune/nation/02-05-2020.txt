Such a right forms part of the right to practice one’s religion under Article 25 of the Constitution of India,” the plea said.The Muslim body said it was a common myth that persons who died of a communicable disease should be cremated, but this was not true and cremation was a matter of cultural choice and available resources.“It has further been clarified that to date there is no evidence of persons having become infected from exposure to the bodies of persons who died from COVID-19,” the plea said.The petition of Jamiat said the entire grievance of the petitioner was based on the apprehension that burial of those persons who were infected with COVID-19 would risk the spread of such infection in the neighbouring areas, which included the residence of the petitioner herein.“It is submitted that such a fear is completely unfounded and unsupported by advisories issued by the Government of India as well as by the World Health Organisation,” it said.The plea said it was evident from the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as well as by the WHO that burial did not pose any additional risk of COVID-19, and all precautions that have been prescribed were to prevent the contact of any bodily fluid of the dead person with those who are handling the body.“It is further relevant to note that even the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada and the Middle Eastern nations are burying those persons who have died due to COVID-19 and no such increased risk of spread of COVID-19 virus has been highlighted by these nations due to the act of burying the dead bodies,” the plea said.The Muslim body said the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, had on March 15, issued detailed guidelines regarding dead body management in the times of COVID-19, which categorically provided that the main driver of transmission of the said virus was through droplets and that there was unlikely to be an increased risk of COVID-19 infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling body.It said even the WHO had issued an interim guidance dated March 24, dealing with the issue of burial of bodies of those patients who died due to COVID-19.“It has been clarified in the said interim guidance that except in cases of haemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola, Marburg) and cholera, dead bodies are generally not infectious. Only the lungs of patients with pandemic influenza, if handled improperly during an autopsy, can be infectious. Otherwise, cadavers do not transmit disease,” the plea said.On April 27, the high court had refused to grant relief on a plea challenging Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) permission to use cemetery in Bandra to bury bodies of COVID-19 victims.The petition, filed by Gandhy and others, living near the Konkani Muslim Kabrastan in suburban Bandra, claimed that locals were afraid of community spread of the virus, if the burial was not done properly.

So we will continue to refer to Kerala Model as far as testing and containment strategies are concerned,”Gangakhedkar said.He said the country was now in a position to ramp up tests up to 1.25 lakh a day in the government sector.“We have expanded the criteria of testing as much as we could. After starting from scratch three months back, the last test we have done was 72,000 today. This is a significantly high number. We are in a position to ramp up testing up to 1.25 lakh a day,” he added.The interaction was an initiative by the state Health Department to explain the technical aspects of the widely-debated COVID-19 testing.A high-level team of the state led by Health Minister K K Shailaja, Health Secretary Rajan Khobragade, Dr B Ekbal, who heads the expert panel that advises the government on prevention of the coronavirus and National Health Mission state director, Dr Rathan U Kelkar among others participated.When asked about the certain test results coming up with false negative or positive, Ekbal said such results were “rare instances” of human error.“We have conducted as many as over 35,000 tests in Kerala. Only two or three went wrong. That kind of an average exists even in missions that are less pressing,” he said.Health Secretary Khobragade said the tests were being carried out in accordance with certain protocol.“Any minute variation in the process involving swab collection, its transportation and the manner of reception at the lab also may impact test,” he said, and explained how efficiently the government facilitates the flow of communication to the patient about the result of the test for COVID-19.Kerala on Saturday reported two positive cases of coronavirus taking the total number of cases in the state to 499.The state has till now cured 400 patients but lost three.There are 96 people under treatment in Kerala, as per the latest medical report. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-can-ramp-up-covid-tests-up-to-1-25-lakh-a-day-icmr-79467

I apologise to all whose sentiments were hurt,” Khan said in a statement.He said that his tweet on April 28, thanking Kuwait for taking note of the “persecution” of Indian Muslims, in the context of the northeast Delhi violence, has “pained” some people which was never his intention.The BJP has demanded that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lt Governor  remove Khan from the post of Delhi Minorities chairman.Delhi resident Manoranjan Kumar moved the high court seeking lodging of another FIR against Khan and also his removal from the post of chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission for his alleged “inflammatory” and “threatening” statements against the Hindu community.Meanwhile, a group of civil society members expressed solidarity with Khan.

02-05-2020||New Delhi||Rahul speaks ‘new lie’ daily, Aarogya has robust data security architecture: BJP||Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for calling ‘Aarogya Setu’ app a sophisticated surveillance system, the BJP, on Saturday, said the Congress leader spoke a “new lie” daily and retorted that those who indulged in surveillance all their lives won’t know how technology could be leveraged for good.Senior party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad, who is also Communications, Electronics and Information Technology Minister, rejected Gandhi’s charge that the app had been outsourced to a private operator and asserted that it had a robust data security architecture.“Mr Gandhi, really high time that you stop outsourcing your tweets to your cronies who do not understand India,” he tweeted, adding that the app, which the government says is a tool in fighting the coronavirus, is being appreciated globally.Attacking Gandhi, Prasad said, “Daily a new lie. Aarogya Setu is a powerful companion which protects people. It has a robust data security architecture. Those who indulged in surveillance all their lives, won’t know how tech can be leveraged for good!”The Congress leader had claimed that the app was a sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a private operator, and had no institutional oversight, raising serious data security and privacy concerns. Technology could help keep us safe; but fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent, he had said.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra took a swipe at Gandhi, saying he refuses to grow up. “He is not only ignorant about the Aarogya Setu App but is also being extremely irresponsible by trying to mislead the people through misinformation and falsities. The government, on multiple occasions, has allayed the fears of surveillance, and that too scientifically. The said app is technical personal bodyguard to each one to fight COVID-19,” Patra said.Gandhi refused to understand, he said, adding that the Congress’ only aim in the times of the pandemic appeared to spread confusion and derail the nation’s fight against the pandemic.“The Congress should refrain from using the pandemic as a political opportunity,” Patra added.

Several bridges have been repaired and the long-disused foot overbridge at Ludhiana has also been removed.In Ludhiana, the 100-year-old twin foot overbridges were closed to passenger use since 2014. However, dismantling of the bridge, which had overhead electric supply line running under it, meant the closure of 10 to 12 hours for several days, which was not feasible on the New Delhi- Amritsar route. Now, during the lockdown, the dismantling of these FOBs has been planned to complete traffic blocks of 8 to 10 hrs.Apart from ensuring supply chains of all essential commodities running through parcel trains and freight trains, the Indian Railways executed these long-pending maintenance works during the lockdown period when passenger services were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Railways said in a statement.The Indian Railways focused on several long-pending overdue maintenance works requiring traffic block of long durations. These works were pending for several years and were posing as severe bottlenecks.Indian Railways planned these works during the lockdown period considering it ‘once in a lifetime opportunity’ to wipe out these maintenance arrears and take up the execution of work without affecting the train service.Around 500 modern heavy-duty track maintenance machines along with the track, signal and overhead equipment (OHE), maintainers have worked regularly to complete overdue track maintenance of 12,270-km of the track.The health of the track has been monitored through periodic runs of Oscillation Monitoring System (OMS), cumulating 1.92 lakh km of the track at as many as 5,362 peak locations.Ultrasonic flaw detection (USFD) of 30,182 km of track and on more than 1.34 lakh welding joint has been carried out 1,34,443 rail welds has been carried out with USFD machine.

Two drivers and an attendant had returned from Punjab on April 28 and had tested positive,” said Prashant Shelke, deputy collector, Nanded.According to Shelke, three rounds of check-ups were conducted on the pilgrims living in the gurdwara before they were transported home.

02-05-2020||Mumbai||Parties should shun communal politics & work for economy: Shiv Sena||Expressing deep concern over the long-term economic repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis and the lockdown, the Shiv Sena, on Saturday, said all political parties should stop playing communal politics in future and instead work towards bringing the economy back on track.The party said the recently talks held between Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan over the impact of the COVID-19 shows how grave the crisis was for the economy. Time had now come to grow wiser, it added.“Congress leader Rahul Gandhi held talks with economist Raghuram Rajan through a digital medium. Rajan said the government needed to spend Rs 65,000 crore to help the poor facing hardships due to the COVID-19 lockdown. He said the entire country will have to face the economic consequences of the lockdown,” the Sena said.“Rajan said the government’s present definition of the poor will change after lockdown. Middle class and upper middle class will also become poor and start demanding certificate of economic backwardness. Even a developed nation like the US is staring at a grave problem of unemployment,” it added“In the US, there is system of unemployment allowance, which India doesn’t have. Rajan’s observation is that 10 crore people in India will become jobless, which is a matter of concern,” the party said.Through their talks, one thing became clear that continuing lockdown for indefinte period will prove costly for the economy. The government would have to work beyond the set norms. Power and authority to take decisions cannot remain limited with only a couple of people, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.As far as Maharashtra was concerned, the 2019-20 revenue income was Rs 3.15 lakh crore, while the expenditure was Rs 3.35 lakh crore. But due to the lockdown, the revenue deficit would grow and become difficult to run the state, it added.“The Central Government will have to take everyone along. It will have to take into account others’ views and chart out the road ahead,” it said.“In India, all political parties should work towards bringing the economy back on track, instead of playing politics of India-Pakistan, religion and caste. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take lead and the entire country will stand behind him,” it said.

02-05-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus lockdown is an exam we have to pass: Vice President Naidu||The "pressing need" to trigger resumption of economic activities has been addressed in 'lockdown 3.0' in a manner that fits with the prevailing situation on the ground, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said on Saturday.He also said the announcement of extension of coronavirus-induced lockdown by two more weeks from May 4, with attendant relaxations driven by economic concerns, "marks a landmark" in the nation's collective fight against COVID-19."In my view, this decision puts the onus of taking forward the fight against the virus more in the hands of stakeholders, including the people, state governments and concerned agencies, commercial and industrial establishments," Naidu said in a Facebook post.The way all of us conduct during lockdown 3.0, Naidu opined, will lay the ground for further course of action aimed at returning to total pre-corona normalcy."This window of two weeks will decide the time frame for it. This is a kind of preliminary examination and as a nation, we need to pass in it. I have reasons to believe that we would, as we don't have the option to fail," the Vice President asserted.So far, the Central government has been at the forefront of formulating the battle strategy in consultation with the states with focus on lives of the people, said Naidu. "It has yielded positive results...," he said.The modalities of 'lockdown 3.0', Naidu said, were a clear acknowledgment of the need to balance the twin concerns of lives and livelihoods by kick-starting the economy."The pressing need to trigger resumption of economic activities has been addressed in a manner that fits with the prevailing situation on the ground," wrote the Vice President. The green zones to a large extent and the orange zones to some degree should hopefully witness the start of much needed economic revival. This is where the people, state governments and other concerned stakeholders should put their best foot forward while seizing the opportunity, he opined.At the same time, Naidu asserted that people should not lower the guard in the ongoing efforts to contain the spread of the disease while taking the economy out of freeze."The remarkable behavioural changes brought in during the first two lockdowns shall be persisted with for a long time to come and till the virus is put to rest," he said.Wearing masks, maintaining social distance, avoiding gatherings will be the norm failing which the gains made so far may be brought to naught, he said.India, Naidu said, has been at the forefront of fighting 'COVID' through commonality of vision, Intent and determination. "Such a tool adopted by 130 crore people of our country living in diverse geographical, social and economic conditions, braving the hardships has surprised the world," said Naidu.The Central and state governments, the people and the frontline warriors like doctors, paramedics, police, sanitation workers and other frontline warriors like farmers deserve admiration, he said."But the battle is still to be won and we need to persist it as the COVID disease is forecast to live with the humans for a longer period," Naidu cautioned.

We have been stranded here for a long time now and need to be evacuated to our homes without any further delay," said Arijit Das (48), a resident of Nabapally Barasat in North 24 Parganas.Das, a private tutor, said two days have passed since the government made the announcement but "we do not know how to get shifted from here to our home state".He appreciated the residents of Jammu for their hospitality and philanthropic approach towards them. "They ensured that we stay alive!"        "We have exhausted all our money and are living on the contributions from various persons over the past one month," said Das.The family appealed to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to come to its rescue."The Jammu and Kashmir government has come out with detailed information about the evacuation of its citizens stranded in other parts of the country. We are also looking towards Didi (West Bengal Chief Minister) so that we can reach our homes," said Tapan Das, another member of the group.Tapan said they had planned the trip to cover various areas of Jammu and Kashmir with hopes of a memorable experience."The trip kicked off on a positive note with a visit to the Vaishno Devi Shrine, where we offered our prayers soon after our arrival in Jammu on March 15. After visiting various temples and other places of interest here, we started for Srinagar on March 17 and had a bad experience when we were left stranded on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway for two days due to a landslide," Tapan recalled.He said they reached Srinagar to experience curfew-like restrictions imposed by the local administration to prevent the spread of the coronavirus."The pandemic not only marred our trip but also left us high and dry with no immediate end to our miseries in sight. We had planned to visit the famous tourist resorts of Pahalgam, Gulmarg and Sonamarg in the Valley but were not allowed by police," said Arijit Das.Arijit, who is accompanied by his parents, sisters and brothers-in-law, said they enjoyed sightseeing at the Dal Lake and visited the Mughal Gardens in Srinagar before returning to Jammu on the night of March 22."We booked a hotel next to the historic Raghunath Mandir in Hari Market and all our money got exhausted by April 1 after getting caught in the lockdown. The hotel owner is a very nice person who handed over his kitchen to us to prepare our meals."After coming to know about us, the local residents came forward with rice, biscuits and tea and the NGOs, social groups, police and others helped fulfil our daily needs. We are thankful to the people for their gesture," he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dream-holiday-to-jk-turns-into-nightmare-for-west-bengal-family-79410

Spending over Rs 25,000 crore on grand buildings at a time of unprecedented national crisis will be a criminal waste of public money,” he said on Twitter.The deputy leader of Congress in Rajya Sabha said the country faces a severe resource crunch and is accepting loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.“India needs hospitals and commit the resources there,” Sharma said.Noting that all Indians are proud of the brave COVID-19 warriors — doctors, health care workers and security personnel, he said the nation stands together to salute them for their commitment to duty and courage.Sharma said the coronavirus pandemic has exposed glaring shortcomings in India’s public health care system and a “flawed” insurance-linked private hospital over-dependence.“Shocking that government hospitals have only 30% beds whereas private hospitals have 70% of ICU beds and 80% of ventilators,” he said.It is the less-equipped government hospitals that carry most the COVID patients’ burden, though short of resources, equipment and PPE gear for health workers, he noted.“It is time for PM to reflect and revisit public healthcare policy. In UK, the robust NHS is saving lives including PM Boris Johnson.“India must urgently invest public money in public healthcare and build well equipped public hospitals. Let the pandemic crisis become an opportunity for course correction. That will be truly celebrating the corona warriors,” he said in a series of tweets.His remarks came a day after the central government gave its go-ahead to the Central Vista project.

02-05-2020||New Delhi||Treat Vishal Yadav’s parole plea as representation and dispose it in 15 days: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court has directed the “competent authority”, which under the prison rules is the Lt Governor, to treat the parole plea of Vishal Yadav, who is serving life term for killing business executive Nitish Katara in 2002, as a representation and dispose it within 15 days.Yadav had petitioned the court for an eight-week parole on the ground that he was at an increased risk of contracting the coronavirus in jail as he has a history of tuberculosis illness.“In the considered view of the court, the subject matter requires to be considered by the competent authority in the first instance,” the court of Justice A K Chawla said, following which the convict’s lawyer suggested that the plea be treated as a representation and be disposed in a time-bound manner.The Delhi government, represented by its additional standing counsel (criminal) Rajesh Mahajan, assured the court that the representation would be considered on its merits and will be disposed within three weeks.Subsequently, the court directed the competent authority to treat the instant writ petition as a representation and dispose it within 15 days from May 1.“The decision taken shall be communicated to the petitioner forthwith. Writ petition stands disposed of in the foregoing terms,” it said.The government had told the court that there is no risk of coronavirus infection to the convict in the prison.It had also said the prison records indicated the convict’s medical condition to be stable and not suffering from TB.It had said under the prison rules grant of eight weeks ‘emergency’ parole amounts to a remission of sentence.While sending Yadav to jail in February 2015, the high court had said that he be not considered for any remission till he completes 25 years of actual imprisonment.“Consequently, he would not be entitled to grant of emergency parole as it amounts to grant of remission,” the Delhi government said.Yadav has contended in his plea that due to his prolonged TB infection, his immune system is weak and coupled with the poor sanitation facilities in prison, he would be vulnerable to the virus.On October 3, 2016, the Supreme Court awarded a 25-year jail term without any remission to Vishal and his cousin Vikas Yadav for kidnapping Katara from a marriage party in February 2002 and then killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, the sister of Vikas Yadav.Another convict in the sensational case, Sukhdev Pehalwan, was handed down a 20-year jail term.Bharti is the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav who is in jail in connection with another murder case.

02-05-2020||New Delhi||122 men from single CRPF battalion in Delhi test coronavirus positive||The number of COVID-19 personnel in a Delhi-based battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force, the country's largest paramilitary, has risen to 122, officials said on Saturday.The men belong to the 31st battalion of the paramilitary, based in Mayur Vihar Phase-III area of the national capital, that has been entirely sealed after the huge numbers of the COVID-19 infection started building up over the last few days."A total of 122 troopers of this battalion have tested positive for the virus. Results for over 100 more are awaited," a senior official said.The brighter side is that the maximum of these infected troopers are asymptomatic, he said.The personnel are admitted to an isolation facility of the Delhi government at Mandoli.Twelve troopers had tested positive on Friday and a 55-year-old Sub-Inspector of this unit had succumbed to the disease earlier this week.These huge numbers in a single battalion (of over 1,000 troopers) has rung alarm bells in the establishment after it was found that "dichotomous" orders were issued to check the spread of COVID-19.While the general order in the force was a mandatory quarantine of 14 days for personnel joining back the unit from leave or having suspected exposure to a coronavirus-infected person, CRPF officers said it recently came to light that the medical wing of the paramilitary issued a separate order in April stating that doctors and paramedics can be taken off the quarantine if they do not show any symptom after five days.Officials have indicated that the primary source of the COVID-19 infection in this unit could be a constable (nursing assistant) who joined this battalion after finishing his leave period at his home in the NCR.The jawan is posted in another CRPF battalion deployed in Kupwara of Jammu-Kashmir and it is not clear as to how he contracted the infection. The family members of this jawan had also tested negative. It could be possible that some other asymptomatic personnel from the 31st battalion was the primary source of infection for the unit, they said.The force is investigating all these angles apart from an instance where it was claimed that the nursing attendant was not kept under strict quarantine in the battalion camp leading to the spread of the infection.

02-05-2020||New Delhi||Owing to weather, sugar production, sale goes down||The sugar production in the country is less this year largely due to weather conditions, first drought and then floods, in two major cane producing states Maharashtra and Karnataka. While the Covid-19 lockdown does not appear to have had much effect on processing by mills, the offtake/bulk buying by manufacturers of ice creams, juices and beverages is down. The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) expects the sales and also the export to pick up as soon as the lockdown is over.Sugar mills across the country produced 258.01 lakh tonnes of sugar between October 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020, which is 63.70 lakh tonnes (LT) less than 321.71 LT produced in the same period last year. As compared to 90 sugar mills which were crushing sugarcane on April 30 2019, 112 sugar mills were crushing sugarcane on April 30 this year, says the ISMA. India’s annual consumption is around 260 LT but there are plenty of stocks available so that’s not really an issue, it adds.As compared to the last year’s sugar sales in the first five months of the season, the sugar dispatch from mills this year was higher by 10.24 LT till February, 2020. Due to the lockdown, the sugar sales in March and April this time was lower by about 10 LT than what was sold last year. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/owing-to-weather-sugar-production-sale-goes-down-79284
