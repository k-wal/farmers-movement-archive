Provision will be made if there is a need for additional funds,” the statement said.Similarly, the Panjabrao Deshmukh Hostel Maintenance Allowance Scheme meant for SEBC students will be applicable to the EWS students, the statement said.“Rs 80 crore fund has been approved for the same. More funds will be made available if need be,” it added.The government said substantial funds and manpower will be made available to the SARTHI institute.The Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI) is a non-profit government company for research, policy advocacy, training etc. for socio-economic and education development of Maratha, Kunbi communities and families dependent of agriculture.“SARTHI has demanded Rs 130 crore fund for the current financial year. Provision will be made if more funds are required,” the statement said.The statement said financial assistance is being provided to unemployed youth through the Annasaheb Patil Financially Backward Development Corporation, and the capital for its has been increased by Rs 400 crore.Speaking on the process of withdrawing cases against Maratha quota protesters, the state government said only 26 were pending and action on them will be taken in a month.Speaking to reporters after the cabinet meeting, PWD Minister Ashok Chavan said the government moved the vacation application before the Supreme Court’s larger bench after holding discussions with ministers, opposition leaders, representatives of Maratha outfits and legal experts.Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde, who accompanied Chavan during the press conference, said, “The chief minister and the cabinet has taken a decision that there will be no shortage of funds.

So far, 25 people have been killed in the crash, police said.The dead include 11 children aged between two to 11 years, an official said.Khan was one of the occupants of the ill-fated three- storey building. He was pulled out alive by a TDRF team after about 18 hours and given first aid at a hospital.After leaving the hospital, on Tuesday, much to surprise of people, he came to the crash site and was seen assisting the TDRF team in rescue and relief operation.Khan joined the TDRF team in clearing the debris and looking for survivors.Talking to the media, Khan said while trapped under the rubble, he heard the voice of a TDRF team member who was looking for survivors and calling out for them.The voice was of rescuer Akshay Patil.Khan said on hearing the voice, he got confidence that he will be saved.“It was as if God had sent him to save me. TDRF members were like ‘farishte’ (angels) sent by God,” Khan said, profusely praising rescuers for their dedication.A force like TDRF is the need of the hour and the Maharashtra government should create many more such units, he said.When TDRF members, who were the first to reach the scene, saved the life of a child, those present at the spot clapped and appreciated their work.The TDRF, which comes under the Thane Municipal Corporation’s Disaster Control Cell, was formed to deal with fallout of calamities.The TDRF was formed in 2018 with 12 jawans and the force now has 33 personnel. It was seen in action when the Mahalaxmi Express train had got stranded in floods on outskirts of Mumbai in July 2019.The force has also taken part in several relief and rescue operations during floods and in aftermath of building collapses in Thane district and nearby areas.

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Ex-judges hit out at critics of police probe into Delhi riots||Several former judges have hit out at the civil society members who criticised the police investigation into the Delhi riots, saying “national integration cannot be sacrificed at the altar of wishfully disintegrative romanticism of the misguided elements”.          The group of 13 former judges, including former chief justices of three high courts, specifically referred to the criticism of Umar Khalid’s arrest by a section of activists, asserting that the former JNU student leader was not an exception to the rule of law that must take its own course.The former judges said they were keenly noticing a “partisan agenda-based disruptive narrative” being consistently produced by a handful of persons who have held responsible constitutional positions.Retired judges BC Patel, KR Vyas, Permod Kohli and SM Soni are among those who have signed the statement, strongly condemning the efforts of anyone who tries to “glorify” crime against the State, block the due process of law in dealing with crimes affecting peace and tranquillity of the country’s citizens.This create a wedge in the social fabric of the nation and indirectly strike at the roots of national integration, they claimed.“A new premise is espoused wherein some allegedly disruptive elements are being put on a pedestal,” their statement said.This same set of people, “wrongly” claiming themselves as sole representatives of the civil society, are attempting to “scuttle” the normal process of administration of justice in the Umar Khalid case, the former judges said.Khalid has been arrested by the Delhi Police for his alleged involvement in the riots and has been slapped with stringent anti-terror Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.These people never miss any chance to denigrate the sacred institutions of Indian democracy, such as the Supreme Court, Election Commission and Parliament, according to the statement.They are now throwing spanners in the process of law regarding the Delhi riots, where layers after layers of “anti-national activities” are getting exposed, it said, attacking civil society groups, including former civil servants and even retired judges who have questioned the Delhi Police probe.“They seem to suffer from a wishful thinking that all the constitutional institutions as well as the executive authorities created by the law must function in accordance with their whims and fancy, which clearly portray their inherent lack of respect for India, and what it stands for,” the statement said.In the Umar Khalid case, critics need to understand that, ultimately, it is the judiciary before which allegations will have to be proved, it added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-judges-hit-out-at-critics-of-police-probe-into-delhi-riots-145076
22-09-2020||New Delhi||Lok Sabha passes labour codes; widen social security net for workers||The Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed three labour codes which seek to amalgamate 29 central legislations into one with the purposes of widening the social security net for workers and making it easy for companies to do business.Replying to the debate on the Codes – The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code 2020, The Industrial Relations Code 2020 and The Code on Social Security 2020, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said the new framework was necessary to align workers and industry to a world where work from home is the new normal.“The Codes provide for issuance of appointment letters to all workers to encourage formal employment, widens the definition of migrant worker for the purpose of their benefit, provides for re-skilling of retrenched workforce and lays down the role of trade unions in industrial dispute resolution. These codes will prove a milestone for worker welfare in India,” he said as the Bills were passed amid opposition boycott of proceedings.The government came up with four codes to create structures for easy compliance by industry and ensure social security for workers.The fourth code—Code on Wages—has already been passed by Parliament and has become a law. In all there were 44 central labour laws of which the government repealed some.The minister allayed concerns around the right of workers to strike being made difficult saying the codes do not take away this right. The Bills, however, made it mandatory for striking labour unions to give a 14 day prior notice for a strike and say the workers will not strike while negotiations are on. The Bills also make it mandatory for a valid trade union to show support of 75 per cent workers.The codes will cover 50 crore workers from the organised, unorganised and self employed sector for purposes of minimum wages, social security. They talk of pay parity to women workers as compared to male counterparts; 50 per cent penalty in cases of accidents to go to the workers along with other dues.The Codes also say that a National Occupational Safety and Health Board will be formed for providing international level safety environment while working journalists’ definition will be expanded to include Digital and Electronic Media.In respect of migrants, the codes clarify that all migrant workers will now be covered by law instead of just those brought by contactors.“Data base on migrant workers through law to help better targeting, skill mapping and utilisation of governments schemes will be created and migrant workers will get journey allowance from employer to visit home town once a year. A help line for migrants will be provided to redress grievances,” the Bills say.The codes will also cover gig and platform workers opening doors for social security to those in the self-employment sector.One concern around the Codes is – these allow employers of units with less than 300 workers to terminate employment without prior notice. The threshold limit earlier was 100 workers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-passes-labour-codes-widen-social-security-net-for-workers-145075
22-09-2020||Kolkata||Central schemes welcome but funding must be through state: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has written to the Centre, saying the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme and Ayushman Bharat schemes will be implemented in West Bengal if the funds are routed through the state government.In a letter to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Banerjee said the state government has already introduced the ‘Krishak Bandhu’ scheme for the farmers.“However, we will be happy to provide benefits to the farmers under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. In that case, the central government may transfer the requisite fund direct to the state government for further disbursement with full responsibility to the beneficiaries through the state government machinery,” she wrote.Under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, the central government provides Rs 6,000 annually in three equal instalments to farmers. The amount is directly transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode.Mamata wrote that under the Krishak Bandhu scheme every farmer/sharecropper receives Rs 5,000 from state government. Under the scheme the next of kin gets Rs 2 lakh if a farmer in the age group of 18-60 years passes away. More than 73 lakh farmers in the state are covered under the scheme, Banerjee wrote.In a separate letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Banerjee said that under the ‘Swasthya Sathi’ scheme the state government was providing free treatment to the people of the state.“Ayushman Bharat Scheme may be extended by the government of India with entire 100 per cent expenditure for the scheme in such a case, the entire funding for the scheme may be routed through the state government,” she said.Reputed as the world’s largest government healthcare programme, Ayushman Bharat is funded with 60 per cent contribution coming from the central government and the rest from the state.Mamata, however, wrote to the Union Health Minister that under the Swasthya Sathi scheme the state government not only provided free treatment at government hospitals but also free treatment, medicine and diagnostics at private facilities of up to Rs 5 lakh annually per family in critical illnesses like cancer, heart disease, kidney ailments, etc. More than 7.5 crore people in Bengal are covered under the scheme, she wrote.Both the letters were written on September 9 and released to the media on Tuesday evening.The letters were released after the BJP and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned Banerjee’s opposition to the farm bills when her government has not implemented the central scheme for the benefit of farmers.In the letter to Tomar, Banerjee said the state government introduced the Krishak Bandhu scheme much before the PM-Kishan Samman Nidhi scheme.'Cat is out of the bag' West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday hit out at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for writing to the Centre.Addressing the press at the Raj Bhavan soon after the two letters written by the chief minister were made public, Dhankhar asked why was this demand being raised instead of direct transfer of funds to beneficiaries as in other states.Stating that the "cat is out of the bag", Dhankhar noted that the chief minister's proposal will benefit "non- state actors" who are already in control of the corridors of power in the state."The heart of the scheme is a direct transfer without middlemen, without any cut, and the (state) government wants this money," the governor said.He also questioned why it has taken the chief minister so long to propose the implementation of the schemes in the state."Have we not seen what happened in Amphan relief distribution? Unimaginable corruption has happened, deserving ones have not got it, while the undeserving got it," he alleged.Large-scale corruption in Amphan relief has been put under the carpet with no case having been registered, Dhankhar claimed. He said that how could one, believing in transparency, accountability and in the interest of farmers ask for the routing instead of it reaching directly to the farmers."Each of our farmers has lost Rs 12,000 owing to non- implementation of the PM-Kisan," he said.The governor further said that he has written to the chief minister at least half a dozen times on the issue and even on August 15 the issue was raised by him during her visit to the Raj Bhavan."What is shocking and worrisome is the last part of her letter, where the chief minister says we are doing enough," Dhankhar said.The governor said that he was made to read in the Assembly that Rs 700 crore have been spent by the West Bengal government under its Krishak Bandhu scheme, which he said is not even 10 per cent of Rs 8,400 crore that the state's farmers could have got from the PM-Kisan scheme."You want to compromise the interest of the farmers by saying send the money to us. Corruption was 100 per cent plugged in PM-Kisan by direct transfer," he said.

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Session for freshers from Nov 1; winter, summer breaks to be curtailed: UGC||The delayed academic session for freshers in universities and colleges will begin from November 1, and the winter break this year, the summer vacation in 2021 and other holidays would be curtailed to compensate for the time lost, according to the University Grants Commission.The guidelines by an expert committee, set up for revising the academic calendar in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, have been accepted by the UGC and accordingly universities have been recommended a six-day teaching learning schedule every week.“In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commission has accepted the Report of the Committee and approved the UGC Guidelines on Academic Calendar for the First Year of Under-Graduate and Post-Graduate Students of the Universities for the Session 2020-21,” Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ tweeted.The UGC in April had released an alternative academic calendar for colleges to reopen, with guidelines on exams, mode of study and the schedule.At that time, the plan was to reopen colleges from September, but it could not materialise due to a continuing surge in coronavirus cases.As per the revised calendar, the admission process for first year students needs to be completed by October 31 and classes for the first semester should commence by November 1.In order to compensate for the loss of academic time, the UGC has asked colleges to teach six days a week and shorten the winter break this year and the summer break next year.“The universities are requested to compensate the delay in the start of academic session in the subsequent years by curtailing the breaks/vacations so that this batch of students would get their final results for award of degree timely,” the guidelines said.“The start of the first year of the academic session 2020-2021 is delayed due to the circumstances beyond control but efforts should be made to compensate for the loss of this period by curtailing the breaks (Summer, Winter, etc). This would ensure that these students would timely complete their 3 year UG/ PG programme,” the UGC guidelines said.“All the universities may follow a six-day week pattern for the academic session 2020-21 and 2021-2022 to compensate the loss for this batch of students,” it added.The UGC has said in order to avoid financial hardship being faced by the parents due to the lockdown and related factors, full refund of fees be made on account of all cancellation of admissions or migration of students, up to November 30, 2020, for this very session as a special case.“To be crystal clear, the entire fees, including all charges, be refunded in totality (zero Cancellation charges) on account of cancellation or migration up to November 30, 2020. Therefore, on cancellation or withdrawal of admissions up to December 31, the entire fee collected from a student will be refunded in full after deduction of not more than Rs 1,000 as processing fee,” the guidelines said.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/session-for-freshers-from-nov-1-winter-summer-breaks-to-be-curtailed-ugc-145064

We allow you to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a representation,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice India SA Bobde told the counsel for petitioner Barun Biswas during a virtual hearing.Interestingly, the counsel kept on arguing while being on mute. “Look at your problems in arguing before us in video-conferencing.

22-09-2020||Mumbai||Rajshri Deshpande pens open letter to Payal Ghosh over sexual harassment allegation against Kashyap||Actor Rajshri Deshpande on Tuesday wrote an open letter to Payal Ghosh, who has accused filmmaker Anurag Kashyap of sexual harassment, saying if the director is in the wrong he will be punished as per system but peddling lies in the garb of #MeToo will cause the movement to “crumble”.On Saturday, Ghosh took to Twitter, claiming that Kashyap was sexually inappropriate towards her, an allegation the “Gangs of Wasseypur” director called “baseless”.Deshpande, who has worked with Kashyap in “Sacred Games” and “Choked”, wrote in a series of tweets that she wants to understand and listen to Ghosh’s voice.“We all know that MeToo started across the globe to give voice to each of us from different backgrounds. I think we need such movements for each suppressed voice in the world.“If Anurag has done something wrong then we have a system to take action for it but if the acquisitions are false then MeToo mass movement will start crumbling and will lose its aim,” she tweeted.The actor said she feared that one false narrative can “damage so many other voices who have suffered”.In a video released to ABN Telugu, Ghosh had claimed that the incident happened in 2014-2015.Ghosh, who made her Hindi debut with Rishi Kapoor-Paresh Rawal starrer “Patel Ki Punjabi Shaadi”, also claimed that Kashyap boasted about his connection with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and flaunted that there were other female artistes who he got intimate with, including Huma Qureshi and Richa Chadha.Deshpande said she wants to hear Ghosh’s side not because the world is “judging” her video but because she wants to know her journey.She also said she wants to understand why Ghosh didn’t “hesitate” to use other women’s name to support her claim.“Don’t you think so it was derogatory and defamatory? I want to know how you cope up with this experience for six years and got strength to put it back and work. I know how difficult it is to go through harassment, it’s not easy to forget the extremely painful incident.”Deshpande said she hoped Ghosh is able to answer her questions, not immediately, “but maybe after few years when you will realise what had happened”.“I hope you will be able to reflect whether it was your truth, suffering or race to be part of current influential race,” she added.The actor concluded her letter saying she loves the Indian film industry and is aware of its flaws.“It’s up to us to clean those flaws, but we need to ensure we do that conscientiously. May God give us strength to be truthful and strong,” she added.Earlier in the day, Qureshi opened up about Ghosh’s claims and said she was angry about her name being “dragged” in the allegations.“I feel really angry at being dragged into this mess. I feel angry not just for myself but also every woman whose years of hard work and struggle get reduced to such baseless conjecture and allegations in their workplace. Please let’s refrain from this narrative,” Qureshi said in the statement shared on Twitter.Her response came a day after Chadha sent a legal notice to Ghosh through her lawyer Saveena Bedi Sachar for being “unnecessarily and falsely dragged in a defamatory manner”.“No woman can be allowed to misuse their liberties to harass other women with unsubstantiated or non-existent, false and baseless allegations,” Chadha’s lawyer said.Kashyap, too, shared a statement from his lawyer, Priyanka Khimani, that said the 48-year-old director has been “fully advised of his rights and remedies in law and intends to pursue them to the fullest extent”.Dismissing the allegations on Sunday, Kashyap called Ghosh’s claim an attempt to “silence” him for his outspoken views.The director found support in his industry friends, including Hansal Mehta, Taapsee Pannu, Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub as well as former wives, film editor Aarti Bajaj and actor Kalki Koechlin who credited him for creating safe work space for women.

22-09-2020||Washington||Recent developments in India spurred deep concern about status of minorities: US lawmakers told||India is an important pillar of global democratic order, especially at a time when an authoritarian China is seeking to expand its influence around the world, but recent developments in India have spurred deep concern about the country’s direction and the status of religious minorities, an Obama era diplomat has told US lawmakers.While India undoubtedly has many challenges of discrimination that at times overshadow its many accomplishments, its qualities and all of the checks and balances of a colossal and at times chaotic multiparty federal system have made India an important pillar of the global democratic order, said Alyssa Ayres, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.“Even more so at a time of rising authoritarianism around the world, and at a time an authoritarian China seeks to expand its influence. That is why recent developments in India, particularly over the course of the past year since the Bharatiya Janata Party’s re-election in May 2019, have spurred deep concern about the country’s direction and the status of religious minorities, especially Muslims,” she said.In her written testimony submitted to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation, which Tuesday has scheduled a hearing on “Stemming a Receding Tide: Human Rights and Democratic Values in Asia,” Ayres expressed concern over the December 2019 passage of an amendment to India’s Citizenship Act and National Register of Citizens.According to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship.The Indian government has been emphasising that the new law does not deny any citizenship rights, but has been brought to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and give them citizenship.India, she said, is an important global power, the world’s largest democracy, one of the world’s largest economies, and an increasingly important regional security provider and strategic partner of the United States.As an international actor, India has been a vocal defender of international rule of law and freedom of navigation as its own maritime interests have grown. Domestically, its size and federal system make for a complicated political environment.India’s federal structure provides substantial devolution of power to the state level, and its parliamentary system counts numerous parties—seven national parties, more than 50 state-level parties and more than two thousand other registered parties. Every national election in India is the world’s largest, and in May 2019, more than 600 million Indians (of more than 900 million eligible voters) cast ballots for their choice of representative, she said.India’s Constitution is a formidable foundational document, one that provides the framework for ample freedom and rights, and was modelled in many ways on the US Constitution, she said.For so long, India’s press has been a point of pride and important guardrail for human rights, and the country’s multilingual, multireligious secular pluralism has served as an inspiration.“Within the South Asian region, India is—by a wide margin—the country with the highest score on the Freedom House index, and the only country in the region ranked “free”,” Ayres added.India maintains that the Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens, including its minority communities.It is widely acknowledged that India is a vibrant democracy where the Constitution provides protection of religious freedom, and where democratic governance and rule of law further promote and protect fundamental rights, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Ola, Oyo watch China situation with caution||After the government’s strong-arm tactics against Tik-Tok, two Indian global startups with substantial Chinese funding—Ola and Oyo—are cautiously watching the geopolitical trends besides battling to overcome the challenges created by COVID-19.“Geopolitics is a big risk to global companies. Various countries are enacting policies that project companies as diplomatic enablers,” said Ritesh Agarwal of Oyo while speaking at the 47th National Management Convention of All India Management Association (AIMA).His strategy is to be local in branding, staffing and culture while keeping the tech global. Though confident that Indians see Oyo as a product developed in India, he said the company is nevertheless watching the situation closely. Oyo is funded by Chinese investors and has business in China.On the other hand, Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said the trend of digital companies getting embroiled in geopolitical tussles as an opportunity because Indian companies enjoy more trust and respect overseas.“Small is the new big after Covid,” predicts Agarwal as he sees people shunning large hotels and opting for boutique hotels and vacation homes. The smaller hotels need technology platforms like Oyo more than ever before, he felt.Both Ola and Oyo do not feel the need for additional funding because of Covid, as the founders claim that they have enough capital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ola-oyo-watch-china-situation-with-caution-145048
22-09-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||No exams for Class 1 to 8 students in Telangana||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, September 22 Telangana has done away with all exams for the current academic year for all school students from Class 1 to 8. The schools will follow continuous in-house assessment over the formal assessment through exams.However, exams for Class 9 to 12 students will be assessed online. The decision to this effect has been taken by a majority of the schools on their own despite the government giving a go ahead to schools to allow students to attend classes from this week. The prestigious Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet, has decided to conduct online exams for Classes 9 to 12, but the primary section will be absolved of any examination. They will be assessed through oral exams, according to Principal Skand Bali.  The trend is similar in other schools, keeping in mind the growing number of Covid-19 cases. Worksheets with objective type questions are being distributed to students to assess their learning abilities. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are among the worst affected states from novel coronavirus.There is a growing demand for announcing a “zero academic year”, but a majority of the schools have decided to use online testing for evaluating the students rather than allowing senior students come to school or turn this period into a long holiday for the junior classes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-exams-for-class-1-to-8-students-in-telangana-145044

22-09-2020||---||Agri reforms not to impact growth: Former Niti Ayog chief||New Delhi, September 22While agriculture reforms will redistribute agriculture income in the favour of farmers, they would do very little for economic growth, former NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya said here on Tuesday.With only 15 per cent share in GDP, agriculture, at its best performance, would contribute merely 0.6 per cent to the GDP growth. With average farm size being less than a hectare, doubling or even trebling farmer income will make little difference, he argued while speaking at the 47th National Management Convention of All India Management Association (AIMA).Panagariya was critical of the slogan of “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, observing that it was a rhetorical flourish aimed at the domestic audience, mainly farmers. It actually meant people looking after themselves instead of expecting handouts from the government. However, import substitution activity, now being underlined under Atmanirbhar Bharat, has been going on for three years, which is not helpful.“Keeping imports out protects the disability of domestic companies by making foreign competitors less able. Instead, India needs to raise its productivity and lower its costs,” he said.Meanwhile, the State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar said interest rate cuts had not led to increase in investment, despite the banks passing on the rate cuts to the customers.Credit growth had been slow this year as capital expenditure was not happening at the usual pace. During the last crisis in 2008, banks had increased lending by diluting norms for which the country had paid a high price. So banks were being prudent this time, he said while pointing out that infrastructure spending was the way to restore economic growth. India has a five-year pipeline of infrastructure projects worth Rs 100 lakh crore, which alone could boost the economy because construction creates jobs and demand.Panagariya also wanted the Modi government to quickly recapitalise banks and the RBI to relax its obsession with the inflation rate. The higher inflation rate in April-June was because of a supply shock and he expected the rate to drop when supply returns. RBI should instead work harder to prevent appreciation of the rupee in order to prevent erosion of the value of India’s exports.For him, the most critical step required to bring back growth in the Indian economy was to recapitalise banks. Economic growth has slid in the past couple of years because of the stress in the financial sector which has filtered into the general economy. “Restructuring loans will only delay NPAs and bankruptcies and not prevent those,” he said.The economy paid heavily for the delay in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, according to him, and a credit collapse will happen again if the problem is not addressed immediately.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agri-reforms-not-to-impact-growth-former-niti-ayog-chief-145039
22-09-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi visited 58 countries since 2015; expenditure of Rs 517 cr incurred||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited 58 countries since 2015 and a total expenditure of Rs 517 crore was incurred on them, the government said on Tuesday.Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan provided details of the prime minister’s visits abroad since 2015, including their outcome, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha.“The total expenditure on these visits was Rs 517.82 crore,” he said.According to the details provided by Muraleedharan, the prime minister made five visits each to the US, Russia and China, and multiple trips to some other countries like Singapore, Germany, France, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.Some of the visits the prime minister undertook were multi-nation trips while some were standalone bilateral visits.Modi’s last trip was to Brazil on November 13-14 in 2019 where he attended a summit of influential grouping BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa).Muraleedharan said Modi’s visits to the countries have enhanced their understanding of India’s perspectives on bilateral, regional and global issues.He said the visits helped in strengthening India’s relations with the countries in a wide range of sectors including trade and investment, technology, defence collaboration and people-to-people contact.“These, in turn, have contributed to India’s national development agenda to promote economic growth and well-being of our people,” the minister said.“India is now increasingly contributing to shaping the global agenda at the multilateral level including on climate change, trans-national crime and terrorism, cyber security and nuclear non-proliferation, and offering to the world its own unique initiatives for global issues like the International Solar Alliance,” he added.To a separate question on Nepal, Muraleedharan said India’s  age-old ties with the neighbouring country are “unique and special”, based on shared history, geography, culture, close people–to–people ties, mutual security and close economic linkages.Asked whether the government is aware that Nepal has signed a number of transit and transportation treaties with China in the past few years to shrug off its dependence on India, he said New Delhi’s ties with Kathmandu stand on their own merit.“Two–thirds of Nepal’s global trade is with India and over 90 per cent of Nepal’s third country import-export transit is through India. India’s ties with Nepal stand on their own merit, and are independent of Nepal’s relations with third countries,” he said.India’s ties with Nepal came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Uttarakhand as its territories.India maintains that these areas along the border with Nepal in Uttarakhand belong to it. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-visited-58-countries-since-2015-expenditure-of-rs-517-cr-incurred-145035
22-09-2020||New Delhi||China doubles air bases, air defence positions, heliports near LAC after 2017 Doklam standoff: Stratfor||China has started construction of at least 13 entirely new military positions, including three air bases, five permanent air defence positions and five heliports, near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the aftermath of the Doklam standoff in 2017, according to a report by global security consultancy Stratfor.The report also said construction on four of those new heliports started only after the current border standoff erupted in eastern Ladakh in early May.“The 2017 Doklam crisis appears to have shifted China’s strategic objectives, with China more than doubling its total number of air bases, air defense positions, and heliports near the Indian border over the past three years,” it said.The report authored by security expert Sim Tack and released on Tuesday said China’s construction drive projects a future military capability that will see long-term regional tensions with India sustained beyond the two countries’ recent standoffs.The report said the recent procurement of the Rafale fighter aircraft by India has started to provide it some relief, but more time will be required to see indigenous production and foreign acquisitions truly rebuild the strength of India’s air force.It observed that the ongoing escalation in the Ladakh region has started to formulate an Indian response to the broader strategic threat posed by China’s ongoing military infrastructure drive.The report titled ‘A Military Drive Spells Out China’s Intent Along the Indian Border’ analysed that the rapid expansion of permanent Chinese military infrastructure points to Beijing’s intentions that span a wider timeframe than current and recent border standoffs.“Indian and Chinese forces clashed in the Doklam region in June 2017. Since then, China has started constructing at least 13 entirely new military positions near its borders with India, including three air bases, five permanent air defense positions and five heliports,” the report said.It said China’s strategy aims to confront India with an “insurmountable” challenge in territorial disputes by leaning on broad support capabilities that provide Beijing with a tremendous ability to mobilise forces into disputed border areas.The report noted that such an approach is similar to China’s strategy in the South China Sea, where a buildup of permanent defense facilities supports Chinese localised military superiority and significantly raises the potential cost of military opposition to Beijing’s maritime claims.“In applying this same strategy on the Indian border, China aims to discourage Indian resistance or military action during future border disputes by ostentatiously demonstrating its ability and intent to engage in military confrontations.” The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Tensions were defused after several rounds of talks.The armies of the two countries have been locked in a fierce faceoff in eastern Ladakh since May 5 following a violent clash in Pangong Tso area.The current row is turning out to be the biggest military standoff between the two sides since the 1962 Sino-India war.A significant portion of Beijing’s recent infrastructure developments is aimed directly at strengthening its ability to project air power along the entire Indian border at a time when New Delhi itself is trying to rebuild its air power, the report said.“While these new developments are geographically focused on the region of current tensions, Chinese activity across India’s entire border will likely drive future expansions of Indian military infrastructure near disputed borders at Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh,” it said.The report said New Delhi will continue to upgrade its overall military capabilities, particularly in those fields where capability gaps exist vis-a-vis China, such as air power, ground-based air defence and missile forces. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-doubles-air-bases-air-defence-positions-heliports-near-lac-after-2017-doklam-standoff-stratfor-145030

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Daily recoveries from COVID-19 more than new infections reported per day for past four days: Govt||With India recording the highest number of COVID-19 recoveries in the world, the government on Tuesday said that for the past four consecutive days the number of daily recovered cases surpassed the new infections reported per day.Addressing a press briefing, Union Health Ministry Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said India had the highest number of recovered cases in the world at 44,97,867."India's COVID-19 cases share is 17.7 per cent of global infections, while those who have recuperated are 19.5 per cent of total recoveries in world. The daily recoveries from COVID-19 are more than number of new infections reported per day since past four consecutive days," he said.While the USA's COVID-19 cases share is 22.4 per cent of global infections, those who have recuperated are 18.6 per cent of total recoveries in world, the data presented by him showed.Brazil's COVID-19 cases share is 14.5 per cent of global infections, those who have recuperated are 16.8 per cent of total recoveries in world.Addressing the briefing, COVID-19 task force member VK Paul (NITI Aayog member) urged people to wear masks and follow all the social distancing norms, especially as the festival season was about to begin next month.Paul asked people to wear masks mandatorily and show no laxity on this aspect, stating 36-50 per cent of the COVID-19 cases can be reduced by wearing masks.  In view of festive season ahead, he also urged people to follow COVID protocols more diligently and responsibly, saying that even now 80 per cent people are susceptible."Masks can play an important role in preventing the transmission of the disease. Social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding large gatherings and hand hygiene will be the social vaccine against coronavirus infection till the time a vaccine comes," he added.Bhushan said that the number of active COVID-19 cases were less than one-fifth of the total 55,62,663 infections in India."We get swayed by the narrative that India has over 50 lakh cases, but we forget that nearly 45 lakh people have already recovered," said the Health Secretary."India's COVID-19 deaths per million population is also amongst the lowest in the world. India has 64 deaths per million population, whereas world's average stands at 123," he said.Bhushan further said that early detection, isolation and seamless hospitalisation of COVID-19 patients had been made possible due to an exponential increase in testing infrastructure in the country.

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Money laundering: ED attaches Rs 203-cr worth Dubai assets of Iqbal Mirchi’s family||The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday said it has attached Dubai-based assets worth over Rs 203 crore of late gangster Iqbal Mirchi’s family in connection with a money laundering case.The attached assets include 15 commercial and residential properties belonging to the “family members” of Mirchi.They include a hotel called Midwest Hotel Apartment, the ED said.They are valued at Rs 203.27 crore and have been provisionally attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the central probe agency said in a statement.Officials said these assets were transferred to the Mirchi family by a Dubai-based company owned by the Wadhawan brothers, Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan.The Wadhawans are the promoters of the Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL). They were arrested by the ED in another money laundering case linked to allegedly dubious loans given by Yes Bank.Kapil Wadhawan was also arrested by the agency in connection with the Mirchi PMLA case but he later obtained bail.With this action, the total attachment in this case by the ED stands at Rs 776 crore. Two similar attachment orders were issued by the ED in December last year.Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, was alleged to be the right-hand man of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim in drug trafficking and extortion crimes.“He (Mirchi) was an international drugs dealer and smuggler who had amassed huge wealth and acquired various immovable properties and businesses across the globe,” the ED had said earlier.The agency alleged Mirchi “indirectly owned various properties in and around Mumbai”.It has filed a criminal case against Mirchi, his family and others to probe the money laundering charges for alleged illegal dealings in the purchase and sale of costly real estate assets in Mumbai.This PMLA case is based on multiple FIRs lodged by the Mumbai police.The agency had filed a charge sheet in this case before a Mumbai court in December and the court had subsequently issued open-ended non-bailable warrants against Mirchi’s sons Asif Memon and Junaid Memon and his wife Hajra Memon.

This party says one thing in Parliament and does another thing outside. There are no farmers in the ongoing agitation. There are only Congress-sponsored people. The Congress can’t stomach the fact that the new bills are going to improve agriculture growth rate, financial status of farmers and connect the farmers to technologies. The farmers should not fall in for the myths being spread by Congress and its propaganda,” Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said when the house reassembled at 4 pm after an hour-long adjournment. Tomar also assured the farmers that the MSP regime will be protected.“In six years, the NDA government has given three times more money in the form of MSP than the Congress led UPA gave from 2009 to 2014. Also, we announced the Rabi MSP yesterday even before sowing has begun. This shows our government’s commitment to MSP. Even the Congress wanted to bring farm-related reforms but could not due to pressures from middlemen.

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Team led by Indian scientists finds X-ray signature of boundary around black holes||A team of international scientists, led by those from India, has found a distinctive signature of cosmic X-rays to identify the boundary around black holes, which "unmistakably separate them" from other objects in the cosmos such as neutron stars that are comparable in mass and size.According to the astrophysicists, including Sudip Bhattacharyya from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai, the current discovery is by far the strongest steady signature of the smaller, but more extreme stellar-mass black holes to date, from the cosmic X-rays observed with a satellite.Although black holes do not have a surface, it is confined within an invisible boundary, called an event horizon, from within which nothing, not even light, can escape, the scientists said.While definitive proof of the existence of such objects is a holy grail of modern physics and astronomy, they said only one supermassive black hole with the mass more than six billion times the mass of the Sun has so far been imaged using the surrounding radiation in radio wavelengths.But according to the study, accepted for publication in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, understanding stellar-mass black holes, which have masses about ten times that of the Sun, is indispensable to probe some of the extreme aspects of the cosmos.In order to prove the existence of these stellar-mass black holes, the researchers said these need to be distinguished from neutron stars which are the densest known objects in the universe with a hard surface.While the stable stellar-mass black holes shine mainly in X-rays by devouring material from a companion star, the study noted that neutron stars can also shine in X-rays by accreting matter from a companion star in a similar way.In the current study, the scientists analysed archival data from the now decommissioned astronomy satellite Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer, and have identified the effect of the lack of hard surface in black holes on their observed X-ray emission.From these analyses, they have found an extremely strong signature of accreting stellar-mass black holes."The study has found by far the strongest steady signature of smaller, but more extreme, black holes to date, from the cosmic X-rays observed with a satellite," Bhattacharyya told PTI in an email.

22-09-2020||New Delhi||ED gets custody of 3 accused in online betting case involving Chinese nationals||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Tuesday a special court in Hyderabad has granted eight days custody of three accused arrested in connection with a money laundering case relating to the online betting Apps run by Chinese nationals.Officials in the ED said the arrested suspects whose custody has been granted include Chinese national Yan Hao and two Indians---Dhiraj Sarkar and Ankit Kapoor. They were arrested by the agency on September 15, 2020, under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as part of its probe in the case relating to the online betting APPs run by Chinese nationals, they said, adding that the custodial interrogation of the three accused is underway to unearth the entire scam, which suspected to be more than Rs 1,000 crore.The officials said the ED initiated it probe under PMLA on the basis of FIRs lodged by Cyber Crime Station (CCS) of Hyderabad Police under various sections of IPC, Telangana State Gambling Act 2017 and Money Circulation Scheme Act against M/s Dokypay Technology Private Limited and M/s Linkyun Technolgy Private Limited and others involved in online betting scam.Suspects floated several websites to lure gullible people and place bets on various apps that  promised attractive rewards“Accused floated a large number of websites to attract gullible persons to become members and to place bets on various online Apps, which promised attractive rewards on simple games of chance. Paytm and Cashfree were used to collect money and pay commission to all these agent members,” said a senior ED official, while alleging that hundreds of websites were created to promote online betting under the garb of e-commerce.Earlier, searches were conducted by the ED officials at 15 locations in Delhi, Gurugram, Mumbai and Pune, which resulted in seizure of 17 hard disks, five laptops, phones and crucial incriminating documents.“The ED has also frozen Rs 46.96 crore held in four accounts in HSBC Bank,” the official said.The ED later in a statement said, the ongoing investigation under PMLA is to identify the major beneficiaries of the Payouts from Paytm and HSBC bank accounts.“Summons have also been issued to various persons including Chinese nationals, who are the directors of the company. It is suspected that these websites were also acted as payment aggregators for multiple Apps, which were banned by Google Play Store for lax technical security, data theft or betting activities,” it said, adding that these companies were also planning to set up a NBFC for micro credits but their license was declined by regulatory authorities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-gets-custody-of-3-accused-in-online-betting-case-involving-chinese-nationals-145005
22-09-2020||Mumbai||High court allows Kangana Ranaut to include Sanjay Raut in plea against BMC||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday permitted actor Kangana Ranaut to add Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut as a party in her plea against the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation over the demolition of a part of her bungalow in Mumbai.A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla also allowed Ranaut to add Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) H-ward's designated officer Bhagyavant Late as a party to let him respond to any personal allegations that the actress makes against him.Ranaut filed a plea in the high court on September 9, seeking that the court declare the demolition of a part of her bungalow in Pali Hill area here by the BMC as illegal.She subsequently amended her plea to demand Rs two crore as damages from the civic body and its officials for the demolition.While hearing her amended plea on Tuesday, the high court noted that Ranaut's counsel, senior advocate Birendra Saraf, had submitted a DVD containing a speech in which Sena leader Raut allegedly made a comment threatening the actress.Justice Kathawalla pointed out that if the actress was going to rely on the DVD, then Raut will have to be given a chance to respond."What if he (Raut) says that he has not made these statements or that this DVD is fabricated? You have to give him an opportunity to respond," the bench said.Saraf then said he also wanted to make Bhagyavant Late a party in the plea as the civic official had issued all communications related to the illegal construction notice and demolition.On September 9, the BMC demolished a part of Ranaut's bungalow, alleging she had made illegal structural changes and repairs to the structure breaching the civic body's sanction plan.The bench led by Justice Kathawalla on the same day stayed the demolition, saying it appeared to be malafide.Ranaut filed a rejoinder affidavit in the high court on Monday, stating that she didn't make any structural changes or repairs illegally.She also denied the BMC's allegation that her demand for the demolition to be declared illegal and that she be paid Rs 2 crore in damage by the civic body was an abuse of the process of law.The actress alleged that the BMC had acted out of personal vendetta against her after she made some comments against the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra.In her rejoinder affidavit, she claimed that on the day she had been served a notice by the BMC on the alleged illegal construction, several other property owners in the vicinity of her property, including fashion designer Manish Malhotra, were served similar notices.While Malhotra and the others were granted seven days to respond, she was given just 24 hours.Her reply was rejected and the demolition carried out.On Tuesday, the bench said the BMC must clarify when Malhotra and others named in Ranaut's affidavit were served with the illegal construction notices, and if any of those structures have been demolished yet.The bench also said on the next date, both parties will have to argue on the amount of time that should have been given to Ranaut to respond to the BMC's demolition notice issued under section 354 (A) of the Municipal Corporation Act.The court also directed the BMC to file its response to Ranaut's rejoinder affidavit by Thursday.The direction came after BMC's lawyer, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, said Ranaut had made some new statements in her affidavit.He said while earlier Ranaut maintained that the alleged structural changes had been made some years ago in consonance with the BMC's sanction plan, in her affidavit she had outrightly denied having made any structural changes to her bungalow.Ranaut in her rejoinder affidavit said, "I deny that I have carried out unlawful additions and alterations as alleged or at all."Last week, the BMC, through its counsel Joel Carlos, filed an affidavit responding to Ranaut's petition.It said the actress had made major structural changes to the building without the civic body's approvals. Therefore, its officials were merely following the rule of law in demolishing these alterations on September 9.The civic body had urged the high court to dismiss Ranaut's plea and impose a cost upon her for filing the petition, which it said was an "abuse" of the process of law.The high court is likely to further hear the matter on Wednesday.

Complete benefits of Kisan Samman Nidhi and Bima Yojana were given. More than Rs 27,000 crore were paid to farmers for food grains purchase. We will leave no stone unturned to double farmers’ income by 2022,” he said in another tweet.Earlier in the day, Chouhan, in a programme here, transferred loans worth Rs 800 crore to farmers’ accounts in the state at zero per cent interest.Under the PM-KISAN scheme, the Centre transfers an amount of Rs 6,000 per year, in three equal instalments, directly into the bank accounts of farmers, subject to certain exclusion criteria relating to higher income status.

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Farm bills: Cong steps up attack; Rahul accuses govt of working for development of crony capitalists||The Congress on Tuesday stepped up its attack on the government over the farm bills issue, with Rahul Gandhi accusing the Modi government of working for the development of crony capitalists and destroying farmers.The Congress and some other opposition parties have been protesting against the farm bills, alleging these would harm the interest of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government.The Centre has asserted that the bills would be beneficial for farmers and increase their income.“2014- Modi ji’s election promise of Swaminathan commission MSP (minimum support price) for farmers. 2015- Modi government said in court that this will not be possible. 2020- Black agriculture laws,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.Then, in a four-line verse in Hindi, the former Congress president sarcastically said: “Modi ji’s intention is ‘clear’” with his new “anti-agriculture experiment”.2014- मोदी जी का चुनावी वादा किसानों को स्वामीनाथन कमिशन वाला MSP2015- मोदी सरकार ने कोर्ट में कहा कि उनसे ये न हो पाएगा2020- काले किसान क़ानूनमोदी जी की नीयत ‘साफ़’कृषि-विरोधी नया प्रयासकिसानों को करके जड़ से साफ़पूँजीपति ‘मित्रों’ का ख़ूब विकास।  Development of crony capitalist “friends” at the cost of farmers, he said, according to a rough translation of his Hindi tweet.Senior Congress leader and former union finance minister P Chidambaram also attacked the government over the farm bills issue.“Government has released advertisements defending the farm bills. One line in the advertisement says that ‘One Nation One Market’ will give freedom to the farmers,” he said in a series of tweets.सरकार ने फार्म बिल का बचाव करते हुए विज्ञापन जारी किया है। विज्ञापन में एक पंक्ति कहती है कि 'वन नेशन वन मार्केट' किसानों को आजादी देगा।  “Eight-five per cent of farmers are small farmers with little surplus to sell. If they have to sell the few bags of paddy or wheat, they need ‘Many Thousand Markets’ all over the country, not ‘One Market’,” Chidambaram asserted.छोटे किसान लगभग 85% हैं, जिनके पास बेचने के लिए बहुत कम अधिशेष बचते हैं। अगर उन्हें धान या गेहूं के कुछ बैग बेचने पड़ें, तो उन्हें पूरे देश में हजारों बाजार की जरूरत है, एकल बाजार की नहीं।  “What do the Bills do to create thousands of farmers’ markets in large villages and small towns?” he asked.Asserting that thousands of markets will give freedom to farmers, he asked if the government’s intention was to guarantee MSP, why was there no clause in the bills that stipulate that the “price shall not be less than the MSP” for that produce.बड़े गांवों और छोटे शहरों में हजारों किसानों के बाजार बनाने के लिए बिल में क्या प्रावधान है? हजारों बाजार किसानों को आजादी देंगे।यदि सरकार की मंशा MSP की गारंटी देने की है, तो उस बिल ऐसा कोई खंड क्यों नहीं है,जो यह बताता है कि "उपज का मूल्य MSP से कम नहीं होगी"?  The Congress on Monday announced a massive people’s movement which would include protest marches, agitations and collecting two crore farmers’ signatures for a memorandum against the legislations to be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovind.This was decided at a meeting of Congress general secretaries and state in-charges, the first physical meeting held by the party at its 24 Akbar Road headquarters here since the outbreak of the coronavirus.A resolution hitting out at the three farm bills — the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 — was also passed at the meeting.

22-09-2020|| New Delhi||ABVP alleges signboard of road named after Swami Vivekananda vandalised in JNU||The JNU unit of the RSS-affiliated ABVP has filed a police complaint alleging that the signboard of a road named after Swami Vivekananda in the campus has been vandalised. Police said they have received a complaint and are looking into the matter.Calling the vandalism "a pre-planned attack on the ideologically diverse nature of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus", the ABVP claimed that a few student union leaders have given an open call for taking down the signboard. "We are witnessing continuous assaults on symbols of national significance inside the JNU campus. In yet another sequence of the recurring defacement of statues and signboards named on the personalities significant to our national identity and pride, the perpetrators seem to be persevering, without any respect for law and order. "... it is a clear violation of the Defacement of Public Property Act, 2007... We appeal to the police administration to identify the perpetrators and take strict action against them, to ensure peace and decorum in the campus," the complaint by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) said. JNU Students'' Union (JNUSU) vice-president Saket Moon said the ABVP was trying to divert attention from the real issues faced by the varsity."JNUSU has been demanding that the administration allow a phased return of students to campus and other issues like online registration for the upcoming semester. The ABVP is trying to divert attention from the real issues and is trying to shield the administration from being answerable on these issues," he said.  Objectionable messages, mostly directed towards right-wing outfits, were found written on the pedestal of a yet to be unveiled statue of Swami Vivekananda on the JNU campus last year in November following which the varsity administration had filed a police complaint. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abvp-alleges-signboard-of-road-named-after-swami-vivekananda-vandalised-in-jnu-144983
22-09-2020||Aditi Tandon||LS adjourned for hour after Ravneet Bittu alleges assault by Delhi Police on Punjab MPs||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 22The Lok Sabha was adjourned for an hour moments after it assembled on Tuesday at 3 pm, following a grave allegation of police assault by Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu.Speaking in the house, Bittu alleged that hundreds of Delhi police personnel “brutally assaulted” him and his three MP colleagues from Punjab Santokh Singh Choudhary, Jasbir Singh Gill and Gurjeet Sing Aujla, when they were all taking out a candle light march from Parliament House to Rashtrapati Bhavan on the issue of farm bills.“The police personnel perhaps thought that we were farmers and assaulted is brutally right outside the temple of democracy. We told them we are parliamentarians and sit with the Prime Minister but to no avail. The police didn’t know we were MPs. They thought we were farmers and beat us up badly. I had a bad left knee fracture, which has gone worse after the assault and other MPs have also suffered injuries. This is horrifying,” Bittu said in the Lok Sabha with Speaker Om Birla assuring him a full probe into the incident and protection both inside and outside Parliament.Speaker also said had Bittu come to the house which say past midnight on Monday and shared his experience, a probe could have been ordered right away.Bittu and Santokh Choudhary submitted written representations to the Speaker narrating the sequence of events starting 7 pm on Monday.“We were peacefully marching from Parliament towards Rashtrapati Bhavan when hundreds of policemen cane rushing towards us, pushing, shoving and physically assaulting us when there was no reason for us to be treated that way,” Bittu wrote to Speaker.The Ludhiana MP also said that he and other MPs sustained severe injuries in the process.“There may have been a conspiracy to kidnap us or endanger our lives through the assault and hence the matter warrants a detailed investigation,” Bittu’s letter to the Speaker says.Earlier today a DMK member also alleged that some IB sleuths visited him in Tamil Nadu Bhavan where he is staying and “interrogated” him on his party’s stand on Parliament agendas.The Speaker cautioned the DMK MP against making any unsubstantiated statements and said, “The safety of all MPs is my responsibility and I will get these issues examined but I need written complaints. I have received letters from Ravneet Bittu and Santokh Choudhary.”LS will reassemble at 4 pm after the first adjournment following opposition MPs raising slogans against the government and demanding protection from the Speaker.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ls-adjourned-for-hour-after-ravneet-bittu-alleges-assault-by-delhi-police-on-punjab-mps-144982

During the day, we used to conduct training on various survival techniques in the mountains," he said.They were also trained on survival tactics at altitudes above 10,000 feet, said the HMI principal, a recipient of the Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award -- the highest national recognition for outstanding achievements in the field of adventure on land, sea and air."We decided to hold these activities to keep them safe and mentally healthy," he said."They have completed their quarantine and returned to the Air Force station in Kurseong," he added.

RDIF will supply 100 million doses to Dr Reddy's.The RDIF has also reached agreements with Indian manufacturers to produce 300 million doses of the shot in India.Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine.Sputnik-V doses supplied in India will likely be a combination of Indian- and Russian-made doses, Sapra said, adding that RDIF and Dr Reddy's would soon identify potential manufacturers in India.The RDIF has said vaccine deliveries to India could begin in late 2020, but Sapra suggested it could take longer. "I think it's going to be several months before we accomplish all the steps in the process," he added.India, which has a population of more than 1.3 billion, is the world's second worst affected country by COVID-19 behind the United States. For weeks, it has reported the world's highest daily jump in infections, which reached a total of 5.6 million on Tuesday.

Punjab has witnessed an evasion of Rs 656.27 crore in the last three years while Himachal Pradesh (HP) has Rs 271.36 crore, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has Rs 256.27 crore and Chandigarh has Rs 39.90 crore.Ten people have so far been arrested for evasion in Haryana, while six in Punjab have been apprehended so far.

The quantum of GST evasion has been the highest in Maharashtra at Rs 20,056.05 crore followed by Rs 14,022.54 crore in Delhi and Rs 8,782.78 crore in Karnataka.No central tax officer is involved in the evasion, informed Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur, in a written reply to a question.The House was told that “GST evasion is being prevented/reduced by the use of data analytics, checking E-way bills, and developing specific intelligence”.Recently, the Tax Research Unit of the Excise and Taxation Department Haryana zeroed in on 138 newly registered taxpayers of the state under GST for their suspicious transactions. These taxpayers were identified by the data analytic capabilities of the Tax Research Unit. As many as 69 of the 138 cases were fake or non-existent. The verifications of the records of these entities revealed that these taxpayers had passed on credit amounting to Rs.1,182.23 crore.The Excise and Taxation Department is further digging out the beneficiaries to whom the credit was passed on by these fake taxpayers. These beneficiary entities would also be liable for recoveries arising from fake transactions, the spokesman said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-has-fourth-highest-number-of-gst-evasion-cases-in-india-in-last-3-years-144963

List the Special Leave Petitions for final disposal after four weeks,” said the bench also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph.The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by BMW challenging the NCDRC order.NCDRC on December 10, 2019 directed BMW to compensate a customer by replacing his vehicle with a new one of the same model after it got damaged in an accident.It asked Bajaj Allianz and BMW to compensate the loss incurred by a Delhi resident Mukul Aggarwal after the vehicle, which was insured under the BMW Secure policy, met with an accident.Under the BMW Secure policy, a damaged vehicle is replaced with a new one upon confirmation of total loss of vehicle by a survey report.The NCDRC also asked the company to pay Aggarwal all the expenses incurred, including the registration, road tax and logistics charges paid by him.The commission, while upholding the state commission's order, dismissed the review pleas filed by BMW and the insurance company, holding it guilty of deficient service for repudiating Aggarwal's claim, which was made after his vehicle got badly damaged in an accident in July 2012."Now, since it has been held that the repudiation of the claim by the insurance company (Bajaj Allianz) was wrong and amounted to deficiency in service, under the BMW secure policy, the complainants are entitled for a new car from the appellant," the NCDRC said in its order.

This is an exceptional year and you have to make some room. Academic career of two lakh students can't be hampered. If the CBSE declares results by end of October, then you can wrap up admissions by first week of November," said the Bench -- which also included Justice Sanjiv Khanna.On behalf of the petitioners, senior advocate Vivek Tankha submitted that it was a question of future of lakhs of students who might miss an entire academic year and the agencies involved should take the pandemic situation into account.The top court asked the CBSE to coordinate with the UGC to ensure that students clearing the Class 12 compartmental examination get college admission in current academic year. The CBSE's compartmental examinations are starting today and will go on till September 29.The UGC counsel told the court that cut-off date for admission in colleges was October end and if CBSE declared the compartmental examinations' results before that date then students will be able to take admission.The Bench wanted the CBSE and the UGC to work out an arrangement to avert a situation where a large number of students were forced to lose an entire academic year.The CBSE counsel told the court that the answer scripts would be checked at 16 regional centres and it would take three-fourt weeks to declare the results.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-cbse-to-declare-compartment-exam-results-at-the-earliest-144954

In addition to manpower in other arms and services, the infantry regiments of Garhwal Rifles, Kumaon Regiment, Dogra Regiment, Punjab Regiment, Jat Regiment, Sikh Regiment and the Sikh Light Infantry exclusively draw their troops from these states.There are a total of 33 Sainik Schools located in 24 states. Amongst them Uttar Pradesh is the only state to have three Sainik Schools, while seven other states, including Haryana, have two schools each. A second Sainik School in Punjab is in the process of being established near Amritsar. A few more Sainik Schools are also coming up in other states.Managed by the Sainik Schools Society under the aegis of the Ministry of Defence, the schools were conceived in 1961 to prepare students mentally and physically for entry into the National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla, and the Indian Naval Academy, Ezhimala.The central government as well as the state governments share the financial onus of running these schools, with provision of land and infrastructure being the responsibility of the states. Armed Forces officers are also deputed to these schools as principals.Funding for these schools has often been an issue and in many instances some state governments have been found to be wanting in this regard. A large chunk of their budget also comes from the Ministry of Defence.Official data shows that after a consistent increase over four years from Rs 74.94 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 84.22 crore in 2018-19, the allocations/utilisation fell drastically to Rs 40.40 crore in 2019-20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/regions-sainik-schools-top-the-list-in-sending-students-to-armed-forces-144952

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Newly passed farm bills profitable future for farming community: All India Farmer Associations||The newly passed farm bills will give farmers the freedom to trade across states and empower them to turn into traders of their own produce and be in control of the process, Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA) said on Tuesday.Welcoming the step taken by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, FAIFA which claims to represent farmers and farm workers of commercial crops across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Gujarat, said the new set of bills passed by the Parliament will go a long way in ensuring farmer prosperity and doubling of income.“These visionary bills will ensure a sustainable and profitable future for the farming community,” FAIFA said in a statement.Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by both the house of parliament, amid protests by opposition parties like the Congress, TMC, DMK and the Left, as well as some farmer groups.“The new regulation will create an ecosystem where the farmers and traders will enjoy the freedom of choice of sale and purchase of agri-produce and promote barrier-free inter and intra-state trade and commerce outside the physical premises of markets notified under State Agricultural Produce Marketing legislations,” FAIFA President BV Jaware Gowda said.These timely crucial steps taken by the government would serve as cornerstones for envisioning a fair market for farmers that lets them receive their fair price by letting them be in control of their incomes with the freedom to trade, he added.“These are cohesive decisions that will go a long way in fortifying an agri-led economic development agenda for India that values its farmers at every step of the way,” Gowda said.

22-09-2020||United Nations||UN faces ‘crisis of confidence’ without comprehensive reforms: Modi||The United Nations faces a "crisis of confidence" without comprehensive reforms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said, asserting that today's interconnected world needs a reformed multilateralism that gives voice to all stakeholders, addresses contemporary challenges and focuses on human welfare.Modi's call for reformed multilateralism assumes special significance as it comes ahead of India taking a seat at the powerful UN Security Council as an elected non-permanent member for a two-year term beginning January 1, 2021."We cannot fight today's challenges with outdated structures. Without comprehensive reforms, the UN faces a crisis of confidence,” Modi said on Monday in his video address to the high-level meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations.As the UN marks 75 years of its existence, the 193-member UN General Assembly adopted a forward-looking political declaration that gave a clarion call for strengthening mechanism to combat terrorism, reformed multilateralism, inclusive development and better preparedness to deal with challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.Noting that the declaration also acknowledges the need for reform of the United Nations itself, Modi said, "For today's interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today's realities, gives voice to all stakeholders, addresses contemporary challenges and focuses on human welfare.”He said India looks forward to working with all other nations towards this end.India has been spearheading decades-long efforts to reform the Security Council, saying a structure set up in 1945 does not reflect contemporary realities of the 21st century and is ill-equipped to handle current challenges.There is widespread support, including by four of the five permanent members of the Security Council – the US, the UK, France and Russia - for a permanent seat for India at the Council.Addressing the special virtual commemorative event, Modi said, “Seventy-five years ago, a new hope arose from the horrors of war. For the first time in human history, an institution was created for the entire world.”He said as a founding signatory of the UN Charter, India was part of that noble vision, which reflected India's own philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam', which sees all creation as a family."Our world today is a better place because of the United Nations,” the prime minister said.Modi stressed that while much had been achieved, the original mission remained incomplete.“The far-reaching Declaration that we are adopting today acknowledges that work still needs to be done in preventing conflict, in ensuring development, in addressing climate change, in reducing inequality and in leveraging digital technologies,” he said.In the Declaration, the Heads of State and Government vow to leave no one behind, protect the planet, promote peace and prevent conflicts, abide by international law and ensure justice, place women and girls at the centre, build trust, improve digital cooperation, upgrade the United Nations, ensure sustainable financing, boost partnerships, listen to and work with youth and be prepared.The prime minister, in his address, also paid tribute to all those who have advanced the cause of peace and development under the UN flag, including in UN peacekeeping missions, where India had been a leading contributor.India is among the largest troop contributors to UN Peacekeeping Missions, having provided over 200,000 troops in nearly 50 of the 71 peacekeeping missions mandated over the past six decades.India has lost more peacekeepers in the line of duty than any other UN member state and over the last 70 years, around 160 Indian military, police and civilian personnel have lost their lives while serving in UN peacekeeping missions around the world.India's priorities for its upcoming tenure on the Security Council find “resonance” in the Declaration that echoes New Delhi's call for strong mandate against terrorism, reformed multilateralism and inclusive development.India's overall objective during its tenure in the UN Security Council will be the achievement of NORMS—a New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System.In the Declaration, the Heads of State and Government categorically noted that the world of today is very different from what it was when the United Nations was created 75 years ago.“Our working methods need to keep pace and adapt. We support the ongoing reforms by the Secretary-General…We reiterate our call for reforms of three of the principal organs of the United Nations. We commit to instilling new life in the discussions on the reform of the Security Council and continue the work to revitalise the General Assembly and strengthen the Economic and Social Council.”This year's high-level UN General Assembly is being held in a largely virtual format as world leaders did not travel to New York for the annual gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.Heads of State and Government and Ministers sent in pre-recorded video statements for the high-level week, including the special commemoration of the UN's 75 years and the General Debate.India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti introduced Modi's pre-recorded statement from the UN General Assembly Hall.

I am with the sentiments of people of my home state, Bihar," Prasad said at a presser."The RJD and the Congress will have to give an explanation to the people of Bihar."The presser was convened in the backdrop of opposition parties raising the pitch against the Centre and the BJP following the suspension of eight of their Members from Rajya Sabha for the rest of the Monsoon Session for their unruly conduct at the time of passing of the farm-related Bills on Sunday.Singh was presiding the proceedings. The Opposition Members directed their ire towards him. He was protected by the Marshals of the House.Prasad said Singh is an intellectual of repute and has brought laurels to India at international forums.Prime Minister Narendra Modi showered praise on Harivansh on Tuesday after he offered tea to opposition MPs sitting on dharna in Parliament complex, saying his "inspiring" and "statesmanlike" conduct will make every democracy lover proud.To personally serve tea to those who "attacked and insulted" him a few days ago as well as those sitting on dharna, Modi tweeted, shows that Harivansh has been blessed with a humble mind and a big heart.  It shows his greatness, the prime minister said and added that he joins the people of India in congratulating Harivansh . "For centuries, the great land of Bihar has been teaching us the values of democracy. In line with that wonderful ethos, MP from Bihar and Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairperson Shri Harivansh Ji's inspiring and statesmanlike conduct this morning will make every democracy lover proud," he said. Launching an attack on the RJD and Congress who are allies in Bihar, Prasad said their leaders encouraged the "humiliation" heaped on Singh in Rajya Sabha.Singh has been a JD(U) leader.

Now we will take our fight for the rights of the farmers to every town and village in the country.”Meanwhile, the Congress hit back after Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman announced a day-long fast against the unfortunate turn of events in the House and wrote a letter conveying the same to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu.“After brazenly violating rules, procedures and practices for passing bills and making laws, the Deputy Chairman is shedding crocodile tears for parliamentary democracy. Token fast is nothing but a farce. Hypocrisy will not wash away the sin of doing injustice to India’s farmers,” said Anand Sharma, Congress deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha.Congress chief whip in the Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh said the Opposition was boycotting proceedings for seven reasons.“The manner in which the bills have been bulldozed by the government; the manner in which eight MPs were suspended without a division on suspension motion as is the practice; the manner in which the Leader of the Opposition has not been allowed to speak; the manner in which the government has simply failed to accommodate the views of the opposition; the manner in which crucial bills have not been referred to select or standing committees, the manner in which division was not allowed on two agriculture marketing bills, the manner in which MSP was not made part of the farm laws and not made applicable to private trade,” Jairam said, citing reasons for opposition boycott of the Rajya Sabha unless the government made amends.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suspended-opposition-mps-end-dharna-in-parliament-after-azad-announces-boycott-of-proceedings-144925

If there is an item that is unfinished on the agenda of the UN, it is that of tackling the scourge of terrorism,” Maitra said.As the UN member states marked 75 years of the United Nations in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during his address to the high-level meeting on the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the world organisation.Qureshi said Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine were the UN’s “most glaring and long-standing disputes” and the people of Jammu and Kashmir still await the fulfilment of the commitment made to them by the UN to grant them their “right to self-determination”.With Pakistan yet again raising the Kashmir issue at a UN platform, Maitra said India had hoped that during this solemn commemoration of a shared global milestone, the General Assembly would be “spared another repetition of the baseless falsehoods that have now become a trademark of Pakistan's interventions on such platforms”.“However, for a nation that is bereft of milestones, one can only expect a stonewalled and stymied approach to reason, diplomacy and dialogue. What we heard today is the never-ending fabricated narrative presented by the Pakistani representative about the internal affairs of India,” she said.Strongly rejecting the malicious reference made to Jammu and Kashmir, Maitra said Pakistan “will do well to turn its attention inwards to immediately addressing these pressing concerns instead of diverting attention from them by misusing the UN platforms”.

The court said: “All national law universities have to conduct themselves in a manner which fulfils the cause of education and maintain the trust reposed on them.”A Bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, directed the NLSIU to admit students to law courses as per the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) to be held on September 28.The Bench, which had allowed the university to hold NLAT, but restrained it from declaring results, said CLAT results should be declared at the earliest to enable law universities to commence the admission process as soon as possible and start the course by mid-October. The order came on petitions filed by former NLSIU Vice Chancellor Prof R Venkata Rao and some students and their parents, challenging the university’s decision to have its own entrance test. The petitioners had contended the decision to go for a separate test will make NLSIU an “island of exclusion” from an “island of excellence”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-cancels-bengaluru-law-entrance-exam-144898

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Can’t claim absolute right to protest: SC||Maintaining that people can’t claim an absolute right to protest, the Supreme Court on Monday reserved its order on petitions seeking certain guidelines to strike a balance between the right to protest and right to free movement and mobility.A Bench led by Justice SK Kaul — which was seized of PILs filed by Amit Sahni, Shashank Deo Sushi and others against the anti-CAA protesters blocking roads at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi — said it would pass an order on the larger issue even as the protesters were removed by the police following the imposition of Covid-19 lockdown.At the very outset, the Bench asked the petitioners: “Are you withdrawing it?” “No,” replied Sudhi. Sahni said the protest shouldn’t continue in future. “In the larger public interest, a decision may be taken,” he said, requesting the Bench to pass an elaborate order. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-claim-absolute-right-to-protest-sc-144794

Is dancing in the House, tearing papers and throwing rule book at the Deputy Chairman parliamentary conduct? — M Venkaiah Naidu, Rajya Sabha ChairmanDerek O’Brien and Dola Sen (TMC), Rajeev Satav, Ripun Bora and Syed Naseer Hussain (Congress), KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem (CPM) and Sanjay Singh (AAP) were suspended for their “unruly behaviour, especially with the Chair, and gross disorderly conduct”. The motion in this regard was moved by the government and approved by a voice vote.The suspended members, however, refused to leave the House, which witnessed multiple adjournments, leading to a washout of the day’s proceedings. They later launched an indefinite dharna near the Mahatma Gandhi’s statue, seeking revocation of their suspension. Resenting the decision, Opposition members said those penalised should have been given a chance to explain.House Chairman Venkaiah Naidu also rejected notices given by 46 members, including Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, to bring a no-confidence motion against the Deputy Chairman for “not following” the due procedure for the passage of farm Bills. Their grouse was that physical voting and division of votes were not allowed.Rejecting the notices, Naidu said he had checked the record and found no merit in grievances of the Opposition. The Deputy Chairman had said he would allow voting and division of votes, if they (the protesting MPs) went to their seats and allowed order in the House, he said.The House witnessed chaos after the suspension of eight Opposition MPs. Opposition members resorted to sloganeering in the Well and disrupted proceedings of the House.Before the motion for the suspension of MPs was introduced, House Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said, “I am pained at what happened yesterday. It defies logic.” He said members threw papers, wrenched mics away, “physically threatened” and abused the Deputy Chairman.“It is a bad day for Rajya Sabha... I am naming Mr Derek O’Brien. Please go out of the House,” Naidu said while naming the other suspended members.He asked members if dancing in the House, tearing papers and throwing rule book at the Deputy Chairman was parliamentary conduct. “Please introspect,” Naidu said.Leaders of 13 Opposition parties later held a meeting in the office of Leader of Opposition and prepared a common floor strategy for tomorrow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ruckus-as-eight-mps-suspended-144790

Announcing it in the Lok Sabha following a CCEA meeting headed by the PM, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the wheat MSP had been increased by Rs 50, taking it to Rs 1,975 a quintal.The highest hike was announced for lentil (Rs 300 per quintal), followed by gram, rapeseed and mustard (Rs 225 per quintal each), safflower (Rs 112 per quintal) and barley (Rs 75 per quintal). “The differential remuneration is aimed at encouraging crop diversification,” Tomar said.“While the Congress is telling the entire country that the MSP and APMC will go, the announcement is a proof that both will continue,” Tomar told the House amid sloganeering. “Tell this to farmers in Punjab,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Leader of the Congress in the House, remarked sarcastically.Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Gill (Congress) demanded an assurance that the government would continue to procure the grain in mandis. “The MSP hike is too little too late and for wheat, it is meagre,” Gill said.Taking on the Congress, Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said their “lies” had been exposed. “Even before rabi sowing, our MSP is ready. This is our commitment to the farmers,” he claimed.A cruel Joke: congThis is a cruel joke on the farmers and a mockery of their protest. — Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab CMMeaningless: SADIt’s meaningless in the absence of assured procurement of crops. — Sukhbir Badal, SAD chiefEnd protest: BJPA reply to those claiming MSP regime will end.
