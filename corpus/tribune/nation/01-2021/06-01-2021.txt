06-01-2021||Mumbai||After 25 years, Ent Tax waiver granted to Michael Jackson’s Mumbai concert||The Maharashtra Cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to grant entertainment tax waiver for the concert of Michael Jackson held in Mumbai in November 1996.The brainchild of Raj Thackeray, currently the President of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), the mega show was organised by the Shiv Sena’s employment wing, Shiv Udyog Sena (SUS) which he headed.With the Cabinet’s approval, the event management company, Wizcraft International, can reclaim Rs 3.36 crore it earned in ticket sales which it had deposited with the court treasury as per an order of the Bombay High Court.Sena’s Industry Minister Subhash Desai said that though the entertainment tax waiver was granted by the then Shiv Sena-led government in 1996 itself, the decision was challenged in the Bombay High Court and later in the Supreme Court, and returned for the government’s consideration.“Since 1974, the past governments have granted tax waivers to such concerts. The state government has today approved the entertainment tax waiver for the concert and the amount deposited by the company shall be returned to it,” Desai said.One of the biggest global musical events organised in India, it marked Michael Jackson’s first concert in the country and the maiden mega event organised by Raj Thackeray on November 1, 1996.The then Shiv Sena-led government had termed it as a ‘classical show’ and granted the duty waiver on grounds that the proceeds would be used for the SUS’s charitable initiatives for 27 lakh unemployed youth.The then Opposition parties had questioned the need for a concert featuring a western pop star and later the tax waiver was challenged in the courts by the NGO, Mumbai Grahak Panchayat.During his visit, the late pop legend had visited ‘Matoshri’ in Bandra and had interacted with the entire Thackeray clan, including the young grandchildren of then Sena chief late Bal Thackeray.Organised at the Andheri Sports Club amid tight security, the concert was a glittering, housefull event with the high and mighty of Indian business, Bollywood and politics gracing the show and jostling to meet the king of pop, who died in 2009, aged 50. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-25-years-ent-tax-waiver-granted-to-michael-jacksons-mumbai-concert-194636

Her body was found on the ground floor of the building in the early hours of January 1, police said.“Police will recreate the crime scene in the next few days with one of the accused using a dummy (for Kukreja). We are looking for evidence in this case,” the official said.As per preliminary investigation, Kukreja had suffered head injuries which could be accidental or otherwise, he said.The official said the police are exploring two possibilities, either Kukreja was dragged down the stairs from the second floor of the eight-storey building to the ground floor or was pushed off.Bloodstains and clumps of hair have been found on the stairs. There seems to have been an altercation between the three, officials had said.“We need to understand certain aspects and have sent samples of Kukreja’s nail, blood, hair, besides the blood sample of the accused duo, to the forensic sciences laboratory,” the official said.He said the case was being probed from various angles including drugs.“Police have recorded statements of 15 people so far,” he said, adding that the police are also investigating whether Kukreja was sexually assaulted.On Tuesday morning, family members of the deceased met Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and demanded justice for her. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/teen-death-case-mumbai-cops-to-recreate-crime-scene-194626
06-01-2021||New Delhi||Parliamentary panel examining Personal Data Protection Bill recommends 89 changes: Meenakshi Lekhi||A parliamentary committee examining the Personal Data Protection Bill has recommended 89 amendments to the proposed legislation, including changing its title and schedule, panel chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi said on Wednesday.The draft of the Bill, approved by the Cabinet in December 2019, proposes to put restriction on use of personal data without explicit consent of citizens.Proposing a penalty of up to Rs 15 crore and up to three-year jail term for company executives for violating privacy norms, the Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in February last year. Later, it was referred to the Joint Committee of Parliament headed by BJP MP Lekhi."The process of writing the report on the Bill has begun. Eighty-nine amendments have been suggested by the panel, including changing its title and schedule," Lekhi told PTI.The Bill was drafted following a Supreme Court judgement in August 2017 that declared 'Right to Privacy' a fundamental right.The need for a strong personal data protection regime was further highlighted by the apex court in its judgement in September 2018 in which it held Aadhaar as a constitutionally valid scheme but struck down some provisions in the Aadhaar Act.According to the provisions of the Bill, all Internet companies will have to mandatorily store critical data of individuals within the country. However, they can transfer sensitive data overseas after explicit consent of the data owner to process it only for purposes permissible under the proposed legislation.Critical data will be defined by the government from time to time. Data related to health, religious or political orientation, biometrics, genetic, sexual orientation, health, financial and others have been identified as sensitive data.A company's executive in-charge of conduct of the data business would face a jail term of up to three years if found guilty of knowingly matching anonymous data with publicly available information to find out the identity of an individual, called as 're-identify de-identified data' in technical parlance, under the proposed law.Social media companies will be required to come up with a mechanism to identify users on their platform who are willing to be identified on a voluntary basis. It will be voluntary for individuals if they want to get verified or not.The Bill had provisions to grant the right to be forgotten to data owners as well as the right to erase, correct and porting of data.

06-01-2021||New Delhi||Jaishankar for early decision on projects in Sri Lanka||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday pressed Sri Lanka for an early decision on several pending Indian proposals in infrastructure, energy, and connectivity.In a meeting with his counterpart Dinesh Gunawardane in Colombo, the external affairs minister also expressed the hope that 36 Tamil fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan security forces will soon be released.Jaishankar listed the reasons why India and Sri Lanka ought to have a closer trade and investment relationship but Gunawardane offered no specific commitments in public but agreed that Colombo required partnerships for enhanced investment in several sectors of the economy.India has its sights on the Colombo Port’s Eastern Container Terminal but is being opposed by trade unions and leftist parties.Gunawardane represents a left-of-centre party and had campaigned against the Vietnam War in his youth. His father, a former Cabinet minister, was Sri Lanka’s leading Trotskyite and an independence movement hero.Jaishanakar said the early implementation of many proposals under discussion would definitely accelerate Sri Lanka’s economic recovery. The Indian businesses too were strongly interested in investing in Sri Lanka.“We have discussed some important opportunities, in the course of yesterday and today, including in special zones for pharmaceutical manufacturing as also in tourism. I will ensure an early follow-up from the Indian side,” Jaishankar assured Gunawardane.The Sri Lankan foreign minister was highly appreciative of Indian support over the past several months to mitigate the adverse impact of Covid pandemic and felt India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy had made a very positive impact on the health sector and economy during the critical period. He also thanked India for extending assistance in repatriating Sri Lankan pilgrims, students and medical cases.“As close neighbours and littoral states, we discussed defence and security matters as well as maritime and fishery sectors. We agreed to continue the momentum brought about by close dialogue as also (agreed to) curb illegal activities,” added Gunawardane.Though Sri Lanka abuts further into the Indian Ocean than India and Colombo is a natural stopover for long haul ships, there was no mention of Indo-Pacific. Nor was there any mention on infrastructure projects that are debt traps.This may have been because Sri Lanka has preferred cooperating in a trilateral maritime domain awareness endeavour in partnership with India and the Maldives instead of being drawn into a military block kind of an arrangement.On the debt issue, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was told off in no uncertain terms that there was no “unsustainable debt burden” due to Chinese infrastructure projects when he visited Colombo last October.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-for-early-decision-on-projects-in-sri-lanka-194619
06-01-2021||New Delhi||SC acquits man facing death sentence||A man, who was awarded death sentence for his alleged involvement in a case in which four persons, including two minor children, were killed, has been acquitted by the Supreme Court which said it was not safe to rely on the version of a minor witness who was five-year-old at the time of incident.The apex court referred to certain “inconsistencies” from the record and said it is difficult to place reliance upon the testimony of minor child, who was the son of one of the victims, and his version cannot be made the basis of conviction of accused who was awarded capital punishment for the 2008 case.A bench headed by Justice U U Lalit also acquitted two other accused, who were facing life term in the case after their conviction by the trial court was upheld by the Allahabad High Court, giving them the benefit of doubt.The bench, also comprising justices Indu Malhotra and Krishna Murari, sets aside the orders convicting these three accused in the case for the alleged offence under section 396 (dacoity with murder) of the Indian Penal Code.A trial court had in July 2015 awarded death penalty to Hari Om after convicting him in the case. Later, the high court had affirmed his conviction and death sentence imposed upon him.The high court, in its judgement delivered in March 2017, had also affirmed the conviction and life term awarded by the trial court to two other accused.It, however, had acquitted the other three accused who were convicted by the trial court.While dealing with the appeal filed by Hari Om, the top court referred to the record and said the “glaring inconsistencies” on the issue of whether the minor child had witnessed the incident on the night of Diwali in October 2008 cannot be discarded.“In the circumstances, we do not find it safe to rely on the version given by the child witness in the instant case, who was about five years of age when the incident had occurred,” the bench said.“While setting aside the orders of conviction and sentence recorded against them, we acquit them of all the charges levelled against them. They be set at liberty, unless their custody is required in connection with any other offence,” the bench said in its judgement.

He will soon be presented before the anti-terrorism court in Lahore,” an official privy to the development told PTI.He said that Lakhvi is kept in a “detention centre”.“Lakhvi is accused of running a dispensary, using funds collected for terrorism financing. He and others also collected funds from this dispensary and used these funds for further terrorism financing. He also used these funds for personal expenses,” the CTD said.Police or any other law enforcement agency usually presents a suspect before the court a day after his arrest to obtain his physical remand for interrogation.“Lakhvi’s case seems to be rare in which he could not be produced before the court four days after his arrest seeking his physical remand,” the official said.The CTD said that in addition to belonging to proscribed organisation LeT, Lakhvi is also a UN designated individual.“His trial will be held before the Anti-Terrorism Court in Lahore,” it added.Lakhvi was designated as a global terrorist by the UN in December 2008 for being associated with LeT and al-Qaeda and for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf or in support of” both the entities.Proscribed terrorists and entities are subject to an assets freeze, wherein all states are required to freeze funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities, a travel ban that prevents the entry into or transit through nations’ territories by the designated individuals and an arms embargo.Last month, the UN Security Council’s 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee allowed for a monthly payment of Pakistani Rupee 1.5 lakh for Lakhvi to meet his personal expenses.The permission was granted 10 days before his arrest. Lakhvi has named his son Hafizur Rehman and brother Saadat Bashir Waheed who would send him Rs 90,000 and Rs 60,000 respectively in his bank account. He said that his son and brother both have the bank accounts in the same branch.The LeT, led by Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is instrumental in pushing Pakistan to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and using its territory to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere.The Paris-based FATF placed Pakistan on the Grey List in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to COVID-19 pandemic.ATC Lahore had sentenced Saeed for a collective imprisonment of 36 years in terror finance cases.He has been in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore since July 2019. There are reports that he is given a ‘VIP protocol’ in jail.The UN has named Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-attack-mastermind-and-let-operations-commander-lakhvi-being-interrogated-pak-official-194615

Prayer is allowed. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn with the liberty aforesaid,” ordered the bench, which also comprised justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The plea filed by Kanyakumari-based advocate C R Jaya Sukin, had said that several developed countries like the US, Japan, Germany, and others have rejected EVMs during elections, and have chosen the ballot system of voting and this should indicate that EVMs are not satisfactory instruments to be used for the electoral process of a country. EVMs can be hacked. But the ballot system is extremely safe, it had said. "EVM hacking is a threat that has been given not only in India but in many other countries, which is why several of them have banned it. EVMs, like all other machines, are prone to errors and malfunctioning. No machine ever made anywhere in the world is infallible," the lawyer had claimed. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-seeking-to-stop-use-of-evms-194606

The men were dressed in formal wear and had identity cards. The three brothers were subjected to interrogation before being taken away.They abducted Rao and his brothers and took them to a remote farmhouse, but once the police started looking for the national player, the “raiding party” left the three Rao brothers – Parveen, Sunil and Naveen – at Narsingi.One of the persons accompanying the “IT raiding team” was wearing police uniform and had a fake search warrant and an identity card, Kumar said. After the raiding party left, the relatives played the CCTV footage which showed that the brothers were taken away in three separate vehicles. Finding the activity to be suspicious the family immediately alerted the police.The Commissioner said that 15 police teams were sent in various directions to trace the brothers and Telangana Police were also contacted. The vehicles in which the three brothers were taken away were identified and since there was a large deployment of police on the highways, the abductors released the siblings at Narsingi around 3.30 am before fleeing. However, they were traced by the police from the tower locations of their mobile phones. After the Hyderabad Police unfolded the drama, the former Andhra Pradesh Tourism Minister Bhuma Akhila Priya was arrested from her residence in the Kukatpally area of the city.

As per received from the two States, control measures are being taken as per the guidelines of the National Action Plan of Avian Influenza. An advisory was also issued on January 5 to Himachal, advising it to take measures to avoid further spread of disease to poultry. Kerala has already initiated control and containment operations at epicentres and culling process is in operation, it said.Measures suggested to the affected States to contain the disease and prevent further spread as per the Action Plan on Avian Influenza include strengthening the biosecurity of poultry farms, disinfection of affected areas, proper disposal of dead birds/carcasses, timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation and further surveillance, intensification of surveillance plan as well as the general guidelines for prevention of disease spread from affected birds to poultry and human. Coordination with forest department for reporting any unusual mortality of birds has also been suggested. Avian Influenza viruses have been circulating worldwide for centuries with four known major outbreaks recorded in the last century. India notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006.  Infection in humans is not yet reported in India though the disease is zoonotic. There is no direct evidence that AI viruses can be transmitted to humans via the consumption of contaminated poultry products. Implementing management practices that incorporate bio security principles, personal hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection protocols, as well as cooking and processing standards, are effective means of controlling the spread of the AI viruses, as per officials.In India, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months i.e. from September – October to February – March. The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out, as per the statement.As per reports received from Haryana, 4,30,267 birds have died in Barwala, Panchkula, in past 25 days.The samples have been sent to the designated laboratory for testing, the results are still awaited. State has constituted 59 RRTs to control and contain the disease, according to the Centre.Unusual moralities found in 7,111 domestic birds in Haryana, 150 wild birds in Madhya Pradesh, 10 crows in Gujarat, 336 migratory birds in Himachal Pradesh today. Meanwhile in Kerala, 7,326 birds (9,066 in Pallipad, 8,260 in Karuvatta) have been culled and 1,570 kg feed has been destroyed in epicentres of district of Alappuzha. At epicentre in district of Kottayam 4,229 birds have been culled and 8 kg feed and 42 eggs destroyed as on date.Further, some samples of crow from Kale Hanumanji Forest Nakka, Jaipur, Rajasthan, have also been found positive for H5N8 Avian influenza virus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/keep-vigil-on-any-unusual-mortality-among-birds-states-told-194599

Some gangs have devised a modus operandi to befriend people online and later engage them in video calls where an adult clip is shown to them, police said on Wednesday. The gang records the video call which is later used to blackmail the victim and demand money, police said.The Delhi police cyber cell has unearthed a gang operating from Bharatpur in Rajasthan which lured the victims by attractive photos in their Facebook profile. The victims were engaged in a brief chat and guided to a video call over Messenger or WhatsApp. During the call the victims were shown an adult clip and their video call was simultaneously recorded.After sometime, they got extortion calls in the name of the offensive video made from the captured video chat. Amounts ranging from two to thirty thousand rupees were demanded. Some of the victims succumbed to those demands before reporting it to the police.Multiple complaints were received at the Cyber Crime Unit (CyPAD) in the last few weeks regarding an online extortion racket of blackmailing people with edited and morphed videos."Technical help was provided by the labs of CyPAD and the location of the accused was zeroed in to Bharatpur, Rajasthan. The accused were using SIMs and bank accounts obtained using fake and bogus IDs, hence pin-pointing them was a challenge. Our teams on the basis of technical investigation arrested six accused," said Anyesh Roy, DCP Cyber Crime.Those arrested on Monday were identified as Waris, Rayees, Annay Khan, Wahid, Mufeed and Akram. All the accused are in the age group of 20-30 years and operated from Ishnaka village, Nagar tehsil of Bharatpur district in Rajasthan.Seventeen mobile phones used to make extortion calls and sex chats and two ATM cards and documents of the bank accounts into which the extorted money had been transferred by various victims have been recovered from their possession.On preliminary scrutiny of their mobile phones, information about more than 40 victims has been found. It is being analyzed to link them with the complaints received by Delhi police."Do not engage in video chats with strangers. Videos can be easily manipulated to harass and blackmail. Do not succumb to their blackmail and never pay any money. Immediately report the matter to your local police station or on online portal and share screenshots etc with the complaint," the officer advised.---IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-an-extortionist-gang-morphed-video-calls-on-fb-to-blackmail-194598

In October, India had condoled the Paris knife attacks and had stood by the French President Emmanuel Macron when he came under criticism from some Islamic quarters including Pakistan.India and France have had long-standing and robust economic and strategic ties. India has remained a recipient of French defence platforms such as helicopters, fighters and submarines for several decades.French companies have been investing in renewable energy, defence, infrastructure and smart cities and pharmaceuticals and the Indian market offers them wide-ranging products for sourcing purposes. These can more than adequately fulfill supply chain requirements for French MNCs looking to diversify their import base.Currently, the total trade in 2019 was $ 13 billion with Indian enjoying a slight advantage. Of the $ 6 billion in French exports to India, 40 per cent is accounted by helicopters, aero-planes, satellites and spacecraft launch vehicles. India’s $ 7 billion of exports to France are more diversified with only petroleum oils occupying a large share of 17 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-france-strategic-dialogue-on-thursday-194597

One of the deceased was a homemaker.In a separate judgment, supplementing the main verdict penned by Justice Surya Kant, Justice Ramana sought to dispel the notion that homemakers don’t work or that they do not add economic value to the household.Terming it a “problematic idea” that has persisted for many years, Justice Ramana said it must be overcome.“A house maker often prepares food for the entire family, manages the procurement of groceries and other household shopping needs, cleans and manages the house and its surroundings, undertakes decoration, repairs and maintenance work, looks after the needs of the children and any aged member of the household, manages budgets and so much more. In rural households, they often also assist in the sowing, harvesting and transplanting activities in the eld, apart from tending cattle,” Justice Ramana noted."The issue of fixing notional income for a homemaker, therefore, serves extremely important functions. It is a recognition of the multitude of women who are engaged in this activity, whether by choice or as a result of social/cultural norms.“It signals to society at large that the law and the Courts of the land believe in the value of the labour, services and sacrifices of homemakers. It is an acceptance of the idea that these activities contribute in a very real way to the economic condition of the family, and the economy of the nation, regardless of the fact that it may have been traditionally excluded from economic analyses,” he noted.“Taking into account the gendered nature of housework, with an overwhelming percentage of women being engaged in the same as compared to men, the fixing of notional income of a homemaker attains special significance.“It becomes a recognition of the work, labour and sacrifices of homemakers and a reflection of changing attitudes. It is also in furtherance of our nation's international law obligations and our constitutional vision of social equality and ensuring dignity to all,” Justice Ramana said.The claimants had to move the SC after the HC reduced the Rs 40.71 lakh awarded to them by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal for both deceased to 22 lakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/notional-income-for-homemakers-in-claims-case-signals-law-believes-in-their-sacrifices-sc-194595

We are meeting them and also getting their letters and phone calls. We welcome and thank all of them.”Seven rounds of talks between the government and representatives of protesting farmers have failed to resolve a long-running agitation against the three laws enacted in September.While the government has presented these new laws as major reforms aimed at increasing farmers’ income and improving their lives, the protesting groups see these legislations as pro-corporate and against the current MSP and mandi systems.The next round of talks with protesting unions is scheduled for January 8, while the government has been also separately meeting various farm groups that have extended support to the laws.“I am confident that protesting unions will also understand the sentiments behind the farm reform laws and will focus on farmers’ interests and will surely help us reach a solution through a constructive dialogue,” Tomar said.Earlier in the day, the minister met the All India Farmers Association (AIFA), headed by former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s grandson Sanjay Nath Singh, which submitted a representation in support of the new farm laws.The group also some suggestions for the ongoing negotiations between the government and the protesting unions.The AIFA recommended setting of an independent regulatory body to monitor farm contracts, price regulatory authority to monitor purchase and sale price of farm produce, enforcement of a template of contract agreement among others.In the meeting, Tomar highlighted the benefits of the new laws for small and marginal farmers and steps being taken for setting up of farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and farm-gate infrastructure with Rs 1 lakh crore outlay.Protesting farmers have threatened to intensify their stir if their main demands—repeal of the three laws and legal backing to the MSP—are not met.In the meantime, the Supreme Court said it would hear on January 11 a batch of pleas challenging the new farm laws as also the ones raising issues related to the ongoing farmers’ protest at Delhi borders.

In view of the above discussions, the present revision petition stands dismissed,” the sessions judge said.                     In its order passed on December 27, the magisterial court had directed Delhi Police to preserve the video footage. Duty Magistrate Udhav Kumar Jain however, had not passed any order on whether to hand over a copy of the video to Pracha.The judge had directed its staff to preserve the entire video footage of the search and place it before the court concerned for necessary orders.The judge had said that at this stage, only directions for preserving the video footage was “deemed necessary and the concerned court can take a call on supplying the video footage to the applicant Pracha at an appropriate stage.”  The court concerned is scheduled to hear the matter further on January 12.The video footage was submitted by the Investigating Officer in response to court’s earlier order.Pracha had earlier submitted that a search was conducted at his office from 12 noon on December 24 and till 03:00 amon December 25 approximately and according to the law, the IO should have intimated forthwith the search and the seized articles to the Magistrate concerned.He submitted that, however, the same was not done and, therefore, he filed an application in that regard.He further submitted that the entire search was videographed as per the court order and that he was entitled to a copy of the video footage.Delhi police had alleged that Pracha forged documents and instigated a man to depose falsely in connection with a case related to the violence in north-east Delhi in February this year.The advocate has been representing various accused and complainants in the violence in north-east Delhi.Several cases were registered over the northeast Delhi violence, in which at least 53 people were killed and several others were injured.

06-01-2021||Mumbai||Found proof against Republic TV, Arnab in TRP case: Police to HC||The Mumbai Police on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court that “some evidence” was found against Republic TV and its editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in the Television Rating Points (TRP) scam case, and therefore, it did not want to continue granting them any protection from any coercive action.However, as the high court adjourned the matter without hearing any arguments during the day, the police agreed to continue its previous assurance of not taking any coercive action till January 15, the next date of hearing in the case.The alleged fake TRP scam was unearthed last year after the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint alleging that certain television channels were rigging their TRP numbers, apparently to generate more revenue from advertisements.On Wednesday, the HC adjourned the matter without hearing any arguments after a Republic TV counsel told the court that senior advocate Harish Salve was unable to appear while the second senior lawyer was stuck due to some medical emergency in family.At this point, Mumbai Police’s lawyer Kapil Sibal agreed to refrain from taking any coercive action against the accused till the next date of hearing.“We (Mumbai Police) have found evidence on record through investigation with BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) against Republic TV and Arnab Goswami. Milords may record my statement that I (police) do not wish to continue my statement. I (Police) have agreed (not to take any coercive action against the accused) because of this extreme emergency,” Sibal said referring to the adjournment.He also told the HC that the police will submit a status report of its probe in the case on the next date of hearing.On December 16 last year, Sibal had submitted in the HC that no coercive action would be taken against Goswami or any other employees of ARG Outlier Media (AOM), which runs Republic TV, till January 6.The AOM had approached the high court last year, seeking, among other things, that the police be restrained from taking coercive action against its employees.During the hearing in December last year, advocate Abad Ponda, who appeared for AOM, had read out from the chargesheet to point out that the police had mentioned in the chargesheet, the owners, managers, and related persons of Republic TV, as suspects in the case.Ponda had said that this could mean that the police could arrest anyone related to the channel and that the same constituted “gross illegality”.The HC bench had then asked the state’s counsel to take instructions from the police on no coercive action against the employees till further hearing.AOM had filed several pleas and interim applications in the HC urging it to transfer the probe in the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation or any other independent agency.It had also requested the HC to stay the ongoing investigation and restrain the police from taking any coercive action against the petitioners, their employees, or investors.

06-01-2021||New Delhi||We cannot be called upon to govern: SC||Refusing to set aside the clearances given to the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said it can’t venture into policy matters and areas reserved for the Executive without any legal basis.Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari – who delivered the majority verdict upholding the clearances given to the project – noted that “the petitioners enthusiastically called upon us to venture into territories that are way beyond the contemplated powers of a constitutional court.”Justice Sanjiv Khanna delivered a dissenting verdict.The majority said, “We are compelled to wonder if we, in the absence of a legal mandate, can dictate the government to desist from spending money on one project and instead use it for something else, or if we can ask the government to run their offices only from areas decided by this Court, or if we can question the wisdom of the government in focusing on a particular direction of development. “We are equally compelled to wonder if we can jump to put a full stop on the execution of policy matters in the first instance without a demonstration of irreparable loss or urgent necessity, or if we can guide the government on moral or ethical matters without any legal basis. In light of the settled law, we should be loath to venture into these areas.” Describing the right to development, as a “basic human right” the top court said, “no organ of the State is expected to become an impediment in the process of development as long as the government proceeds in accordance with law.”Noting that in recent past, the route of public interest litigation was being increasingly invoked to call upon the court to examine pure concerns of policy and sorts of generalised grievances against the system,” it said, “No doubt, the Courts are repositories of immense public trust and the fact that some public interest actions have generated commendable results is noteworthy, but it is equally important to realise that Courts operate within the boundaries defined by the Constitution.”  The top court said, “We cannot be called upon to govern. For, we have no wherewithal or prowess and expertise in that regard.”The majority verdict pointed out that the constitutionally envisaged system of “checks and balances” has been completely misconstrued and misapplied in this case. “The principle of “checks and balances” posits two concepts - “check” and “balance”. Whereas the former finds a manifestation in the concept of judicial review, the latter is derived from the well-enshrined principle of separation of powers.  “The political issues including regarding development policies of the Government of the day must be debated in the Parliament, to which it is accountable. The role of the Court is limited to examining the constitutionality including the legality of the policy and Government actions,” the majority verdict read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-cannot-be-called-upon-to-govern-sc-194543

We need to translate it to English and hence, we need some more time to do so," Mundargi said.The court accepted it and posted the petition for hearing on February 11.Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, appearing for accused Nitish Sarda, who has also filed a petition in the HC against the FIR, sought that the court hear his arguments.Aggarwal said the accused persons have been asked to appear before the magistrate's court on Thursday.To this, Justice Shinde said, "So appear there. What is going to happen? The trial is not going to start tomorrow."       The court posted Sarda's plea also for hearing on February 11.The three accused were arrested by the Alibaug police on November 4, 2020.It is the police's case that architect and interior designer Anvay Naik committed suicide in May 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by companies of the accused persons.Goswamiin November last year filed a petition in the HC seeking to quash the FIR, and also sought interim bail.The HC on November 9 refused to grant interim bail following whichGoswamiapproached the Supreme Court.The SC on November 11 granted interim bail to Goswami.The police filed the charge sheet in the case last month.

Earlier, the ITBP had signed an agreement with the KVIC in July for the supply of 1,200 quintals of mustard oil to the ITBP with a total financial implication of Rs 1.74 crore.It was decided during a meeting of the Directors General of CAPFs held at the Ministry of Home Affairs in October 2019 that use of terry-khadi uniform and other items of swadeshi origin should be made available to the CAPFs.During the visit of the Home Minister to the ITBP Force Headquarters in New Delhi last month, an exhibition stall was prepared to exhibit the KVIC products suitable for use by CAPFs.The ITBP had suggested that durrie, blankets, towel, mustard oil, yoga kit, hospital bedsheets, pickles, etc. can be purchased for jawans through KVIC. Many such items will be procured from the KVIC for promoting the local products in the CAPFs.The process of procuring khadi bedsheets and pillow covers from KVIC for all CAPF hospitals is also underway, and it is expected that it will be procured in this financial year itself.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-para-military-jawans-will-use-khadi-durries-made-by-cottage-industry-194533
06-01-2021||New Delhi||India suffered longest internet shutdowns in 2020 globally||India suffered the longest internet shutdowns in 2020 for the second year running globally, bearing the biggest economic impact of $2.8 billion and 8,927 hours lost, affecting 10.3 million users in total, a new report from the UK-based privacy and security research firm Top10VPN has revealed.As in previous years, India continued to restrict internet access more than any other country—over 75 times in 2020."The majority of these short blackouts were highly-targeted, affecting groups of villages or individual city districts and so were not included in this report, which focuses on larger region-wide shutdowns. The true economic cost is therefore likely to be even higher than the $2.8 billion we have calculated," the researchers informed.In Kashmir, authorities lifted restrictions in March 2020 after imposing in August 2019."However, after the restrictions were lifted authorities continued to severely throttle internet speeds, with citizens only able to access 2G connections," it mentioned.In India, internet blackouts lasted for 1,655 hours while bandwidth throttling resulted in 7,272 hours lost."India and Myanmar were responsible for the longest shutdowns for the second year running, with restrictions originally imposed in 2019 continuing throughout 2020," the report mentioned.Chad again restricted access to WhatsApp after they blocked the app for more than a year in 2018/19."Combined, these countries experienced a total 64 per cent increase in the number of hours of restrictions in 2020, despite the global public health emergency".Globally, the internet shutdowns cost the world economy, already devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic, a further $4 billion. This, however, represents a 50 per cent decrease in impact compared to $8.05 billion in 2019.Nearly 268 million people were affected by major disruptions in 2020 globally, up three per cent year-on-year.According to the report, 93 major shutdowns took place in 21 countries in 2020 and the total duration of major disruptions around the world was 27,165 hours, up 49 per cent from the previous year.Globally, internet blackouts resulted in 10,693 hours lost and internet throttling in 10,920 hours lost.Social media shutdowns resulted in 5,552 hours lost, the report said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-suffered-longest-internet-shutdowns-in-2020-globally-194531

06-01-2021||New Delhi||'Love Jihad': SC refuses to stay UP ordinance on religious conversion, inter-faith marriages||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to stay the provisions of an Uttar Pradesh Ordinance and a Uttarakhand law aimed at checking unlawful religious conversions for inter-faith marriages.A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, however, issued notice to the two states asking them to respond in four weeks to petitions filed by Vishal Thakre and others and NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace challenging the controversial UP Ordinance and the Uttarakhand law.At the outset, a disinclined CJI said, "The challenge is already pending in high courts. Why don't you go there? We are not saying you have a bad case. But you must approach the high courts in the first instance instead of coming to the Supreme Court directly."Later, the Bench agreed to issue notice after senior advocate CU Singh and lawyers for some other petitioners pointed out that the petitioners have challenged laws of two states and more BJP states were in the process of enacting similar laws.Terming the provisions as "oppressive" and "obnoxious" Singh alleged that several innocent persons had been arrested based on UP Ordinance against 'love jihad'.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Allahabad High Court was already seized of the matter.Singh wanted the top court to stay the operation of the laws that mandated prior permission for religious conversions for marriage."You are asking for a relief which we cannot entertain under Article 32. Whether a provision is arbitrary or oppressive needs to be seen. This is the problem when you come directly to the Supreme Court," said the CJI.The top court was hearing PILs against the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 and Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018 which criminalise fraudulent religious conversion for interfaith marriages.The Uttar Pradesh Vidhi Virudh Dharma Samparivartan Pratishedh Adhyadhesh, 2020 (Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020) – which was promulgated in November last– prescribes imprisonment from one year to 5 years, or Rs 15,000 fine (in normal cases) minimum three years and maximum 10 years, and fine of Rs 25,000, if the girl is a minor or from the SC/ST community.It prescribes a jail term of a minimum three years up to 10 years, and Rs 50,000 fine in cases involving mass religious conversion. The offence is cognizable and non-bailable.According to the Ordinance, no person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any other person from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.The petitioners have also challenged the validity of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018 which has similar provisions.They questioned the validity of the UP Ordinance and the Uttarakhand law on the ground of alleged violation of fundamental rights of citizens, contending their provisions went against public policy."This ordinance can become a potent tool in the hands of bad elements of the society to falsely implicate anyone and there are probabilities of falsely implicating persons who are not involved in any such acts and it will result in grave injustice," petitioners Vishal Thakre, Abhay Singh Yadav and Pranvesh submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/love-jihad-sc-refuses-to-stay-up-ordinance-on-religious-conversion-inter-faith-marriages-194526
06-01-2021||Satya Prakash||There is no improvement in situation: CJI on talks between govt and farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 6Noting that there was no improvement in talks between agitating farmers and the government, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would take up petitions against farm laws and those against farmers' protests on January 11."There is absolutely no improvement in the situation," Chief Justice SA Bobde said indicating that the petitions on the issue would be heard on Monday.The CJI's comments came during hearing of a PIL by advocate ML Sharma on the issue.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the government was discussing the issue with farmers.Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Bench, "There is a good chance that the parties may come to some conclusion in near future."The CJI - who had on December 17 indicated constituting a committee of independent and impartial persons, including agriculture experts, to end the stalemate between protesting farmers and the Centre - said, "We understand the situation. We want to encourage the talks. We will keep the matter on Monday and will adjourn if you say so."Mehta pointed out that since healthy talks were going on between farmers and the Centre, it would not be advisable to take up the matter immediately.The Attorney General, too, said filing of response by the Centre could foreclose avenues of the ongoing negotiations between the two sides.Agreeing with Venugopal and Mehta, the Bench said if it was told on Monday that discussions were still under way, it would adjourn the hearing.The Bench, however, issued notice to the Centre on Sharma challenging a 1954 amendment to the Constitution putting certain agriculture-related issues in the Concurrent List, allowing the Centre to enact farm laws.It asked Sharma to follow what's happening in the court and make his submissions when the matter comes up for hearing.Also read: Undeterred by cold weather and rain, farmers threaten to further intensify stirAt Tikri border, farmers gear up for Thursday’s ‘tractor march’"Mr Sharma always files startling petitions, and now he has challenged the constitutional amendment of 1954," the CJI commented.The Supreme Court had on December 17 refused to interfere with the ongoing agitation against farm laws by farmers from Punjab and some other states who have blocked certain entry points to the national capital for weeks, saying it was their fundamental right.“We are of the view at this stage that the farmers’ protest should be allowed to continue without impediment and without any breach of peace either by the protesters or the police,” a Bench headed by CJI Bobde had said during a hearing on petitions seeking removal of agitating farmers from Delhi roads.“We clarify that this court will not interfere with the protest in question. Indeed, the right to protest is part of a fundamental right and can as a matter of fact be exercised subject to public order,” it had said.“There can certainly be no impediment in the exercise of such rights as long as it is non-violent and does not result in damage to the lives and properties of other citizens and is in accordance with law,” the Bench had noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-is-no-improvement-in-situation-cji-on-talks-between-govt-and-farmers-194525
06-01-2021||Washington||Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker supports farmers' protests in India||Voicing his support for the farmers' protest in India, the Speaker of Wisconsin State Assembly has urged the Indian government to reconsider its decision on the three farm laws and listen to the concerns of the affected farmers.Robin J Vos expressed his support through a letter to India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu. He also wrote a similar letter to US Ambassador to India Ken Juster."One thing Wisconsin and India may have in common is our large agricultural economies. The farmers of our state are a very large part of our overall economy. It would be unfathomable to me that we would make law changes that affect them without taking their input into account, or by shutting them down as they exercised their right to peaceably assemble,” he wrote in his letters dated January 4.“Hopefully, the Modi government will reconsider its decision and sit down with the affected farmers to listen to their concerns,” Vos said.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as "ill-informed" and "unwarranted", asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country."We have seen some ill-informed comments…relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said last month.“Recently, I was made aware of three new laws that may have a great impact on the farmers of Punjab. It is my understanding that these three laws were implemented with little to no consultation with this large community of farmers, and have sparked massive protests in Delhi,” Vos said in his letter to Sandhu.“While my job does not usually call me to opine on relations between the United States and other countries, I write as a US citizen who represents Indians in Wisconsin. I ask that in your consultations with Prime Minister Modi you convey my concern for violations of human civil rights and the right to peaceably protest,” he said in his letter to the Indian ambassador.Wisconsin has a sizeable Sikh population.In his letter to Juster, Vos said he was writing as a US citizen who represents Indians in Wisconsin.“I ask that in your consultations with Prime Minister Modi and his government, that you convey a concern for violations of human civil rights and the right to peaceably protest. I trust you agree that these are fundamental bedrocks in American society and we should do all we can in our diplomatic relations to ensure that they are bedrocks in the countries with which we have diplomatic ties,” Vos wrote.Eminent Sikh American Darshan Singh Dhaliwal welcomed the letters written by Vos and said that farmers of entire India, not only Punjab, were suffering.“Repeal of the three farmers' laws is the right thing to do. Farmers do not want these laws,” said Dhaliwal who left for India on Tuesday to show solidarity with the protesting farmers.He said he was in talks with several US Congressmen for a visit to India to meet the protesting farmers and get a firsthand assessment of the situation on the ground.Meanwhile, the Indian embassy has increased its outreach to members of the US Congress briefing them about the various aspects of the farm bill, and the right of the farmers to protest and the several rounds of talks that the government has had with the leaders of the protesting farmers.During these briefings by senior officials of the Indian embassy, the lawmakers and their staffers are being given the historical perspective of the agricultural sector in India and the problems that this sector is facing, including the falling income of farmers.Ambassador Sindhu has spoken to a few eminent Congressmen. The Indian embassy is also reaching out to members of the Indian community.Members of US Congress and their staffers are told about the various misconceptions about the farm bills. They are told that farmers have the absolute right to protest and their ongoing protest is democracy in action.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as "anti-farmer", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislation would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the Indian government but the logjam continues.

06-01-2021||New Delhi||Don't panic, avoid undercooked meat & eggs: Experts on bird flu rise||Several states from North, West and South India are witnessing a sporadic rise in the cases of Avian Influenza (bird flu).States like Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala have reported close to 25,000 deaths predominantly of ducks, crows and migratory birds.The news has started to trigger panic among the public. The people, still fear-struck with the Covid-19 infection, are afraid that the bird flu, which is also a viral disease, may turn into an epidemic. However, the health experts have negated such a possibility and advised the public to take precaution and not panic.The doctors said that the risk of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus that causes the bird flu is very rare unless one works in proximity with the infected species of birds."People who work closely with poultry are at high risk of getting the infection. Otherwise, human to human transmission of the H5N1 virus is very rare. Hence, there is no need to panic," Dr Harshal R. Salve, Associate Professor at Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) told IANS."The bird flu is detected in sick birds and has the possibility to spread among humans only with those handling poultry or infected birds," said Dr Rajeev Gupta, Director- Internal Medicine, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Shalimar Bagh (Delhi).Dr Upali Nanda, Head, Preventive Health & Consultant-Medicine, Medeor Hospital Qutab Institutional Area (Delhi), also said that human-to-human transmission of the Avian Influenza is very unusual.Meanwhile, the public has started to ditch eggs and chicken meat in fear that it might carry the H5N1 virus and could infect the ones who would consume it. While there is no connection between the spread of Avian Influenza and consumption of eggs, the doctors suggested ditching undercooked poultry products and meat for a while to allay the fear."There is no evidence available that suggests the spread of bird flu through eating meat or eggs. Nonetheless, eating raw meat and eggs should be avoided in the affected region till the incidents come down," advised Dr Salve.He goes on to add that the public should not let their guards down and continue to follow the safe and hygienic practices adopted amid the pandemic to steer clear from any possibility of encountering the H5N1 virus.Dr Nanda said that it is anyway not advised to eat semi-cooked meat and eggs. "People can also take extra precaution besides properly cooking the meat and poultry," she added."Wash your hands with warm water and soap, especially before and after handling the raw poultry and eggs. Use different utensils for cooking raw meat and make sure meat is cooked properly until steaming hot. Avoid direct contact with live and poultry birds," Dr Nanda advised.She also suggested avoiding visiting live animal markets or poultry farms for now. "If need be, wear a mask and gloves all the time. Also, do not go near or touch bird droppings or sick and dead birds," Dr Nanda added.The bird flu is not yet detected in the poultry birds. The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, where samples of animals sent across India for detection of diseases, told IANS that it has not found the presence of the H5N1 virus in the poultry birds yet.The president of Ghazipur Mandi, biggest poultry market in the national capital, also informed IANS that no incidence of the bird flu among chicken meat has been reported in the market as yet.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-panic-avoid-undercooked-meat-eggs-experts-on-bird-flu-rise-194515

06-01-2021||New Delhi||Undeterred by cold weather and rain, farmers threaten to further intensify stir||Camping at protest venues near Delhi borders for around 40 days, braving severe cold and sporadic rain, farmers have asserted that their stir against the farm laws will intensify in the coming days, even as they deferred Wednesday's proposed tractor march over a bad weather forecast.The deadlock continues as the seventh round of talks with the Centre remained inconclusive, with the farmer groups sticking to their demand for the repeal of the three new laws, and the government listing out various benefits of the new Acts.The national capital, meanwhile, reels under a spell of harsh winter. The city woke up on Wednesday to the rumble of thunder and the sound of hailstones hitting rooftops and windows as it received rain for the fourth consecutive day.The rain, caused by a strong western disturbance, comes on the back of a "severe" cold wave that gripped Delhi in the run-up to New Year. On Friday, the mercury had plummeted to 1.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in 15 years for January.On Tuesday, the protesting farmers said they were deferring their proposed tractor march from January 6 to January 7 due to a bad weather forecast.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28, demanding repeal of the farm laws, a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops and other two issues.Last week, the government agreed to exclude farmers from penal provisions of the Air Quality Management ordinance and not to pursue the draft Electricity Bill.Also read: There is absolutely no improvement in situation: CJI on talks between govt and farmersSince the farmers arrived at the national capital's borders, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.In a series of tweets on Wednesday, it said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders were closed for traffic movement."Please take alternative route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders.

Kindly avoid the stretch," the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted.More rain and hailstorms are predicted during the day.Residents in neighbouring Gurgaon also shared video clips of hailstorm there.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded 6 mm rainfall between 8:30 am on Tuesday and 8:30 am on Wednesday.The weather stations at Palam, Lodhi Road, Ridge and Ayanagar gauged 4.2 mm and 10.4 mm, 5.1 mm and 8.4 mm rainfall, respectively, during the period.At Safdarjung, the minimum temperature settled at 13 degrees Celsius, six notches more than normal, as a result of the cloud cover over the city.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downwards, warming the ground.The rains, under the influence of a strong western disturbance, come on the back of a "severe" cold wave that gripped Delhi in the run-up to New Year.On Friday, the mercury had plummeted to 1.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in 15 years for January, and very dense fog lowered visibility to "zero" metres.The western disturbance is also causing widespread snowfall in the hills. Once it withdraws, the mercury will fall again to 4 to 5 degrees Celsius, officials said.Dense fog is likely in Delhi over the next two days, the IMD said.

06-01-2021||Washington||India home to 21 'unicorns' valued at USD 73.2 billion, says Ambassador Sandhu||India is currently the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world and is home to 21 unicorns valued at USD 73.2 billion, India's top envoy in the US has said, as he expressed hope that more than 50 startups might join the unicorn club as early as 2022.“Entrepreneurial activity has picked up in India. In 2020 India was among the top 50 innovative economies," India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said."Today India is the third-largest, startup ecosystem in the world and is home to 21 unicorns valued at USD 73.2 billion. By some estimates, more than 50 ‘soonicorn' startups might join the unicorn club as early as 2022,” he said.A unicorn is a term to indicate a privately held startup company valued at over USD 1 billion. Soonicorns are startup companies that are good candidates for late-stage investment and have a good possibility of becoming 'unicorns'.Sandhu was speaking at a mentoring programme for Indian National Startup Awards 2020 finalists that was co-hosted by the Embassy of India, in partnership with Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).Sandhu said according to a recent report, Indian startups raised USD 9.3 billion until mid-December this year.“A little below 2019 but definitely encouraging, considering the current pandemic. It is because people like you were not averse to taking risks and were not deterred by challenges. People like you continued to think out of the box. People like you put all your efforts in creating a better life around you,” he said.Rise of Indian IT companies, large talent pool, increased expendable income of Indian middle class and availability of capital have contributed to the growth of India's startup ecosystem.More recently increased usage of smartphones, access to the internet, and recent reforms to push digital finance have given further impetus. There has also been a significant push from the Government through initiatives like Startup India and Digital India, he said.“Indian startups are steadily evolving into global entities creating business products, and solutions for the global market,” he added.“The Bay Area- Silicon Valley is the world's topmost innovation hub accounting for, I am told, more than a fifth of global venture capital investment. Its success has been hard to replicate elsewhere even with sizeable investments,” he said, adding that the important ingredient that is often found missing elsewhere is the culture of Silicon Valley.Three cities- Bengaluru, Mumbai and NCR Delhi- have changed the face of modern India and find a place among the famous Global Startup hubs.Cities like Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Kolkata are counted amongst the emerging startup hubs.“We need to do more to be counted amongst the ‘superstar hubs',” he said.

06-01-2021||United Nations||India calls for global efforts against terrorists acquiring chemical weapons||India has expressed concern over the possibility of terrorists getting hold of chemical weapons and called for unrelenting global action against them.At a Security Council session at the UN on Tuesday on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, India's Permanent Representative TS Tirumurti said, "India remains concerned about the possibility of such weapons falling into the hands of terrorist organisations and individuals.""Terrorist groups have taken advantage of the decade-long conflict in Syria to entrench themselves posing a threat to the entire region. The world cannot afford to give these terrorists any sanctuary or dilute its fight against these terrorist groups," he said.Several terrorist organisations operate in Syria, notably the Islamic State, which is active in some areas even after it had been ousted from the large tracts it controlled.Tirumurti reiterated India's unequivocal condemnation of the use of chemical weapons."India has been firmly opposed to any use of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anybody, and under any circumstances. We strongly condemn the use of chemical weapons, and there can be no justification for their use," he said.The session, held virtually, was the Council's first open meeting and India made its first official statement after joining the body this month as a non-permanent member.The session tested the diplomatic finesse of New Delhi, which has amicable ties with Damascus, and was caught between the US and its allies opposed to Syria, and Russia and China, which are supportive of it."In our view, politicisation of the issue is neither helpful nor productive," Tiriumurti said."Any concerns should be addressed on the basis of consultation among all parties concerned," he added.

The NDRF has 12 operational battalions stationed at various locations in the country. “The first women rescuers’ team is already on ground. Recently, the UP government requisitioned an NDRF team and they (women) went there (Garh Mukteshwar). The team handled the rescue boats and related equipment,” NDRF director general SN Pradhan said. “These personnel have all the skills to be called complete rescuers,” he said.“We can deploy both components of an all-woman NDRF team or a mix squad of male and female personnel for responding to a situation. We prefer the second because if there is complement of women personnel it makes a great difference on the ground where women, children and old persons are being rescued," Pradhan said. "The skill sets of women are stronger in some aspects... so that can be leveraged especially in situations were women are victims," he said. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ndrf-inducts-its-first-womens-team-194326
06-01-2021||New Delhi||Vista a wasteful expenditure: Congress||The Congress and the BJP clashed on Tuesday over SC nod to Central Vista with the Opposition terming the project a “misplaced priority”.Soon as Congress leaders Anand Sharma and Randeep Surjewala questioned the project saying it was a “colossal waste of public money”, Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri accused the Opposition of “selective amnesia”.Puri tweeted a letter the office of Lok Sabha Speaker in 2012 wrote to the Urban Development Ministry flagging the need for a new Parliament building.Surjewala argued that the issue was not a legalistic one. “It is a case of misplaced priorities... It is ironical that in times of Covid and recession, the government has Rs 14,000 crore for Central Vista and Rs 8,000 crore to buy aircraft for the PM. The same government imposed cuts of Rs 37,530 crore in the allowances of central employees and pensioners,” he said.Puri, however, said the SC order would pave the way for Delhi becoming a world class capital city.

He looked forward to receiving Johnson in India at the earliest opportunity after normalisation of the situation, added the news release.US President Donald Trump had declined PM Modi’s invite to be the chief guest at the 2019 Republic Day celebrations, but made up for it by attending the “Namaste Trump” rally in Ahmedabad.However, Trump had conveyed his regrets nearly three months in advance, giving South Block enough time to invite South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/boris-dials-pm-says-will-visit-once-covid-over-194338
06-01-2021||New Delhi||Need to build guidelines for Indo-Pacific, says Juster||The outgoing US Ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, on Tuesday suggested that over the next five years India and the US should jointly draw redlines in the maritime domain. “Our mission over the next five years and beyond should be to give this (Quad) endeavour further form and substance — to develop guidelines and, if necessary, even redlines,” he observed while speaking at a webinar.The US envoy was not convinced that Indian economic reforms based on the Aatmanirbhar Bharat policy were enough to attract US firms from China. “It remains to be seen whether all of these policies are compatible and mutually reinforcing, or whether they will lead to higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade,” he said.Juster admitted to “frictions and frustrations” on the trade and investment front and the inability of both countries to conclude “even a small trade package”. Moreover, there were growing restrictions in India on market access for certain US goods and services, increasing tariffs, new limitations on the free flow of data, and a less-than-predictable regulatory environment for investors, complained the US Ambassador.Suggesting that India should not be fixated on the price of the imported military equipment, he suggested that defence procurement should be about quality and strategic interoperability across services and “perhaps even with other friendly forces”. Making a case for a deeper Indian involvement in the Indo-Pacific region, Juster said over 50 per cent of international trade passed through its waters, rich in natural resources and fast becoming the centre of gravity of the evolving international system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-build-guidelines-for-indo-pacific-says-juster-194332

06-01-2021||New Delhi||PM’s energy roadmap: Raising natural gas share from 6 to15%||The government is working to increase the share of natural gas in India’s energy basket by two and a half times from 6 per cent to 15 per cent.Inaugurating the 450-km Rs 3,000-crore Kochi-Mangaluru natural gas pipeline virtually, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the government was working on shifting to a natural gas-based economy through the ‘one nation, one gas grid’ project.Clean fuelNoting that a young India could not afford to move slowly, the Prime Minister said there were reasons why the country’s development pace was sluggish in the past century. “There would have been reasons why India moved slowly in the last century, but today’s young India is keen to capture the world’s imagination and cannot tread slowly,” the PM said.He listed facts to argue how the government had ensured speed, scale and scope in the sector of oil reforms in recent days. He said the first inter-state natural gas pipeline was commissioned in India in 1987 and until 2014, in 27 years, only 15,000 km of natural gas pipeline was laid.“Today, work is on for 16,000 km of pipeline and it will be completed in four to six years.

The last round was conducted on November 6. Troops of either side are within rifle-shot range of each other, while both sides have lined up tanks, artillery guns, rocket launchers, missiles and thousands of troops along the 826-km Line of Actual (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh.It was on December 18 that the 20th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) was conducted.

The Drug Controller gave the EUA to the vaccines on January 3. The final call on the date of the rollout will be taken by the government.”Also read: Logistics in placeThe 10-day period ends on January 13 with clear indications that the Health Ministry was geared to administer shots to 30 crore in priority groups, including one crore health workers, two crore frontline workers and 27 crore people aged 50 and above and those below 50 with comorbid conditions.71 UK returnees have mutant virusNew Delhi: India on Tuesday saw the lowest daily cases in more than six months even as the government said 71 UK returnees have been detected with the mutant virus. There were 16,375 new cases in the past 24 hours – the lowest in over six months – as the caseload mounted to 1,03,56,844.The logistics are in place, the government said, citing four national-level vaccine cold storage depots at Karnal, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata and 37 state-level storage sites. The national depots will store the vaccines for further distribution to state depots and later cover all 29,000 cold storage sites from where the vaccines will be transported in temperature-monitored equipment to primary health centres and the other sites where the shots will be administered.SII, Bharat Biotech pledge smooth runIn a show of solidarity, Adar Poonawalla and Krishna Ella, jointly on behalf of Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, on Tuesday communicated their intent to develop and supply the vaccines for India and the world. “Both our companies consider it our duty to the nation and world at large to ensure a smooth rollout,” they said.Health and frontline workers would not have to self-register on Co-WIN, the digital vaccine delivery platform, Bhushan said, adding that the vaccine dry runs were successful and vaccinators trained in handling adverse events following immunisation.In a major announcement today, the government also said India was open to exports of the newly approved vaccines – Serum Institute’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.“Vaccines are global public goods and the government has not initiated any ban on exports,” said Rajesh Bhushan as the SII and Bharat Biotech jointly communicated their pledge for a smooth rollout of vaccines to India and the world.“Vaccines have the power to save lives and accelerate the return of economic normalcy at the earliest. Now that two Covid vaccines have been issued the EUA in India, the focus is on manufacturing, supply and distribution, such that populations that need it the most receive high quality, safe and efficacious vaccines. Both our companies are fully engaged in this activity and consider it our duty to the nation and the world at large to ensure a smooth rollout of vaccines,” SII chief Adar Poonawala and Biotech chairman Krishna Ella said, adding that they were fully aware of the importance of vaccines for people and countries alike.The no-export-ban development comes when India is prioritising vaccine delivery to 30 crore most vulnerable people at home.“The Covid vaccination is at present a public health priority and the target is to vaccinate the most vulnerable and prevent deaths. We will come to individual issues of supplies later,” VK Paul, chairman, COVID vaccine task force, said today when asked when the vaccines will be available in the open market for people to buy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-rollout-by-january-13-194178

For, we have no wherewithal or prowess and expertise in that regard,” the majority verdict by Justice Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari said.However, it asked the Centre to get necessary prior permission of the heritage conservation committee “before actually starting any development/redevelopment work on the stated plots/structures/precincts governed by the heritage laws, including on plot number 118, if already not obtained”.2:1 judgmentA three-judge Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, by 2:1 majority, held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the Central Vista project was valid.The top court directed the project proponent to set up smog towers of adequate capacity as an integral part of the new Parliament building project and use smog guns at the construction site throughout the construction phase. It also asked the Ministry of Environment and Forests to instal smog towers in future projects.Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who delivered a dissenting verdict, held the change in land use and green clearances given to the project were bad in law, even as he said, “Our interference does not reflect on merits of the stands, but is on account of procedural illegalities and failure to abide the statutory provisions and mandate.”Last month, the Bench had expressed displeasure over the Centre going ahead with the project without waiting for its verdict. However, it had allowed the stone-laying on December 10. The SC noted, “The petitioners have not pointed out a single document which formed a part of the process and was not placed in public domain.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-infirmities-in-approvals-sc-go-ahead-to-central-vista-194179
