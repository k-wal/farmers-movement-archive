They have pitched the Khalistan flag,” she is heard saying.The MP was unavailable on phone for comment.Meena's statement drew criticism from the ruling Congress in the state, which said people in Rajasthan are “ashamed” that they voted for her.State Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra said the BJP's vision was limited to getting into power, alleging that its veterans did not even want to liberate India from the British."The BJP has always been an anti-farmer party,” he claimed.In an apparent reference to strikes against Pakistan after terror attacks in India, he said, "In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP leaders won due to the valour of the army.” “Now, people of Rajasthan are feeling ashamed that they voted for a leader with such a narrow mindset,” he added, apparently referring to Meena's victory.But state BJP spokesperson Ramlal Sharma justified her comment."MP Meena's feelings were not wrong. She wanted to say that the kind of flags and slogans being raised at the farmers protest is wrong. Some people have entered the protest in the name of farmers," he claimed.He said the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre is concerned about the welfare of farmers and is holding talks with them to resolve the issue.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi's border for weeks seeking the repeal of the central laws enacted last September.Farmer unions claim that the laws weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system. But the government says they provide more options for farmers to sell their crops.

20-01-2021||---||Resumption of physical hearings in SC under consideration||New Delhi, January 20The Supreme Court – which has been functioning in virtual mode since the middle of March last year – is pondering over resumption of physical hearings.During hearing of the issue of Maratha reservation, a Constitution Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan on Wednesday said resumption of physical hearings would be considered within two weeks.The court’s comments came after senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi sought an adjournment, saying due to the virtual nature of proceedings, advocates were to prepare themselves for the case.“We are lawyers scattered in different places and there are huge records. It is difficult to argue over virtual hearings. We are not entering into merits. Vaccination process has started and there is a six to eight weeks wait for the elderly,” Rohatgi submitted.Noting that it didn’t want the hearing to commence on January 25, Justice Bhushan said, “We will keep the matter to pass directions after 2 weeks so that we know from when we start the physical hearing. We can fix a date then.”The top court – which has stayed the implementation of the Maratha reservation law—deferred the hearing to February 5.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said the court was eager to “go back to action” but it would be done only after taking into account the opinion of health experts.“We also want to get back to the action. But, we want to ask health authorities before that. We are not going to take the opinion of advocates on a health issue,” the CJI said during hearing on petitions challenging the Delhi High Court’s decision to resume large-scale physical hearing in the high court and subordinate courts in the capital from January 18, without giving a choice to lawyers to appear via video conferencing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/resumption-of-physical-hearings-in-sc-under-consideration-201237
20-01-2021||New Delhi||Parliamentary panel on Home meeting: BJP, TMC MPs spar over political violence in West Bengal||The meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee headed by Congress MP Anand Sharma witnessed heated exchanges between BJP and TMC members on Wednesday as the two sides accused each other of unleashing political violence in West Bengal.The meeting of the Parliamentary panel was called today to discuss ‘Atrocities and Crimes against Women & Children’ in Haryana and West Bengal, where senior officials of the two states gave presentations relating to the issue. Sources privy to the deliberations said TMC MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar responded to allegations that were leveled by BJP member Anil Jain on the rising political violence in West Bengal by engaging him in an argument with counter-accusations.Without explicitly naming the BJP, the TMC MP retorted saying that the youth wing of a political outfit in West Bengal has been targeting women in the state, especially TMC workers.On this, the other BJP members on the panel countered Dastidar by accusing the TMC of carrying out political violence in the State and claimed that many of their party workers have been killed in the last few months.The state is scheduled to go for assembly elections in April-May this year and the BJP is seen as a key political challenger to the two-term TMC government in the state.Meanwhile, Sharma intervened to calm the nerves of the members and asked them to look into the specifics and stick to the agenda.It is learnt from sources that the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police of West Bengal were present at the meeting, who in their presentation claimed that the number of cases of crime against women have reported a sharp decline and credited it to the State government’s schemes like “Kanyashree” (which incentivises families to keep their daughters in school and not to marry them off before the legal age of 18) for the drop in the number of cases.However, sources said BJP members put the officials through probing questions and asked them to explain why the State continued to be the nerve centre of human trafficking. The officials told the panel that they would submit a reply on the issue in a few days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-on-home-meeting-bjp-tmc-mps-spar-over-political-violence-in-west-bengal-201235

If allegations are true then it becomes our responsibility to take action, he said when asked if the NCP is contemplating any action against Munde.“But it is not fair to take action unless allegations are proved, said Pawar, whose party is a key constituent in the Shiv Sena-led MVA government in Maharashtra.Munde, 45, the social justice minister, has refuted the rape charges and dubbed them as a blackmail attempt. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-action-against-munde-till-rape-charges-proved-says-pawar-201226
20-01-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain plea for actions against fake ‘baba’, ‘ashrams‘||The Supreme Court Wednesday refused to entertain a plea seeking action against illegal ashrams run by fake ‘babas’ across the country, saying the issue does not fall under its realm.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde asked senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for a petitioner, as to how the court would ascertain that a person is a fake ‘baba’ (godman).“Menaka Guruswamy, senior counsel appearing for petitioner (Dumpala Ramreddy) seeks permission to withdraw this petition. Permission, as sought for, is granted. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn,” said the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, in its order.During brief hearing, the lawyer said ‘Akhil Bharatiya Akahara Parishad’ has prepared a list of ‘fake baba.“How can we rely on that list. We do not know if the list was prepared after hearing them,” the bench said Guruswamy then said that the list of Akhara contained names like convict Ram Rahim Singh.This provided all the more reason for people not to go to them, the bench said and asked, “Why do you want the Supreme Court to say that”.“We do not have disrespect for anybody or Akhara Parishad. But we do not know what Akhara Parishad thinks of them. We do not know know how the list was prepared. How can the Supreme Court enter into this realm. Court cannot look into it,” the bench said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta the told bench that the petitioner has already filed a habeas corpus petition in the Delhi High Court seeking custody of his daughter who has allegedly been kept in illegal confinement by an alleged godman.Earlier in last July, the top court had asked the Solicitor General to look into a plea seeking action against illegal ashrams run by bogus ‘Babas’ across the country and rescuing women from jail-like conditions in ‘Adhyatimik Vidyalaya’ at Rohini here.“Look into this, what can be done. This gives a bad name to everyone,” the top court had told Mehta.Dumpala Ramreddy had claimed in his petition that his daughter, a post-doctoral scholar from Iowa State University, USA, has been living in a jail-like condition from July 2015 in ‘Adhyatmika Vidyalaya’, founded allegedly by a rape accused.He had said the founder of the ashram has been declared as absconding for about three years and a Joint Committee formed by the Delhi High Court had submitted a report giving details of the pathetic conditions prevailing in the ashram run by Veerendar Dev Dixit.The plea said the apex body of sages—‘Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad’—has declared a list of 17 fake ‘babas’ in the country which include the name of Veerendar Dev Dixit.Ramreddy, apperaring in person, sought rescuing of his daughter along with about 170 women inmates from Adhyatmika Vidyalaya as it was done in the case of inmates of jails across the country.“Take stringent action on 17 illegal Ashrams in India run by 'bogus Babas'”, his plea said, adding, that hundreds/thousands of disciples are residing in 17 fake ashrams in the country and national capital and his daughter is one among such persons trapped by these fake ‘babas’.     “That due to inaction of the Respondents and government authorities, fake ‘Babas’ are running the ashrams and trapping the innocent people particularly women.“Thousands of women have been forced to stay in the ashrams and they were given drugs and narcotics so that they will not leave the place,” he alleged in his plea. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-for-actions-against-fake-baba-ashrams-201225

The transactions have largely been made from the UK, the US and Canada, but in a few cases it is from Malaysia and the Philippines, they said, adding that coincidentally, the timing of transactions match with the farmers’ protest and the quantum also is quite higher than they were done on earlier occasions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/questioning-witnesses-in-sfj-case-around-fiu-report-on-suspicious-transactions-say-sources-201223

The victim entered the lift when it arrived, and Kota followed her. When the woman tried to escape, Kota blocked her several times with his body and hands.The lift doors closed and the victim was trapped in the lift with Kota, who hugged her and put his face very close to her.The victim gave him her number after Kota cornered her inside the lift and repeatedly blocked her attempts to flee.The victim struggled, but Kota pressed his body against her until the lift stopped on the 11th floor. The woman screamed for help, but there was no one else around, and Kota pressed the lift buttons to close the elevator.When the victim tried to escape again after the doors opened, Kota held her back and pressed his face close to her. Thinking he was trying to kiss her, the victim pushed him away, before telling him that she was pregnant.Kota reached out and rubbed her stomach a few times, but eventually left the elevator.When he got home, he sent the victim multiple messages and called her repeatedly until midnight. The victim ignored him and contacted her husband, who rushed home and called the police.Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En asked for 10 months’ jail and caning, saying that Kota had used “quite a degree of wrongful restraint”, and followed the victim for some time. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-man-jailed-for-nine-months-in-singapore-for-molesting-pregnant-woman-201216

20-01-2021|| Hyderabad||Committee set up to investigate the death of health worker||After a 42-year-old health worker died within hours of being vaccinated, the Telangana Government has set up a committee to look into the death. The government issued a statement saying that the health worker was vaccinated on Tuesday at Kuntala Primary Healthcare Centre, Nirmal District and he died on Wednesday.  Director of Public Health (DPH) G Srinivasa Rao, through a press release, said that preliminary findings revealed that death was unrelated to the vaccination.  Sources said that the health worker developed chest pain today and was rushed to the District Hospital in Nirmal District headquarters. But the doctors declared him brought dead at 5:30 am on Wednesday.  “Preliminary findings suggest that death seems to be unrelated to vaccination. As per the guidelines post-mortem will be conducted by a team of doctors. The district Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) committee is examining the matter and will submit its report to the state AEFI committee. The state AEFI committee will, in turn, furnish its report to the central AEFI committee for taking a view,” Dr Rao said. Sources in the Telangana Health Department said that out of 69,625 people vaccinated so far, only 51 had shown some mild to adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine. This is in contrast to the Union Government figures that put the number of people having a reaction to the vaccine at 0.18 per cent. Telangana is using the Serum Institute of India produced Covishield along with the Hyderabad’s Bharat Biotech produced Covaxin. It has not been disclosed which of these two vaccines was given to the deceased health worker. The details will be clear after the committee submits its report. Bharat Biotech has asked people not to take the vaccine if they have any history of allergies; fever; a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner; if they are immuno-compromised or are on a medicine that affects their immune system; if they are pregnant or breastfeeding; or if they have received another COVID-19 vaccine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/committee-set-up-to-investigate-the-death-of-health-worker-201208
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Scenes snipped from ‘Tandav', but trouble continues with more complaints||At least two scenes were removed from the controversial web series “Tandav”, which found itself in more trouble on Wednesday with an FIR against its makers, this time in Madhya Pradesh, and threats of another in Maharashtra.A scene of a play and a conversation between two key characters were snipped from the first episode “Tanashah”, a day after the cast and crew of the nine-part starry political saga on Amazon Prime Video once again apologised and said they had decided to implement changes to address the concerns raised.At the centre of the row over the show, which has hit the national headlines with calls for boycotts, FIRs and protests over its alleged depiction of Hindu deities, was a scene with Zeeshan Ayyub in the role of college student Shiva playing the Hindu god Mahadeva (another name for Lord Shiva) in a play. A conversation between Lord Shiva and Narad Muni in the theatre production raised hackles.That scene has gone. Viewers now see Zeeshan's entry on stage as Mahadev amid cheers from the audience and the scene then abruptly shifts to police entering the campus to arrest a student.Also gone is a conversation depicting prime minister Devki Nandan Singh, played by Tigmanshu Dhulia, insulting Dalit leader Kailash Kumar, enacted by Anup Soni. There have been other changes in the series as well. A dialogue referencing caste between Soni's character and Sandhya Mridul's Sandhya has been shortened.Notwithstanding the cuts, the show, directed by Ali Abbas Zafar and starring Bollywood A-listers Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, sank into more trouble.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said police in the state had received a complaint and formal action would be taken in accordance with the law. Demanding a law from the Centre to regulate content on the over the top (OTT) platforms to ensure there is no caste-based discrimination or communal divide, Deshmukh told reporters, "We have received a complaint. We will register an FIR and take action formally." He did not specify who had lodged the complaint.A four-member team of Uttar Pradesh Police, where three FIRs have been filed, also arrived in Mumbai in the morning to conduct a probe into a case registered in Lucknow. The team is likely to record statements of the makers and cast and crew of the show, which has been accused of hurting religious sentiments for its depiction of Hindu deities.While some members visited the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detection-1) in suburban Andheri, two members went to the Mumbai Police headquarters in south Mumbai, officials said.Keeping up the tempo, an FIR against the makers and cast was registered in the Madhya Pradesh town of Jabalpur on a complaint from a functionary of a little known Hindutva outfit."The process to verify the facts mentioned in the FIR filed against the director of web series 'Tandav' and others for allegedly promoting enmity in different religious groups and hurting religious feelings is on," Jabalpur's Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Amit Kumar told reporters.In a related development, Madhya Pradesh Assembly protem Speaker Rameshwar Sharma wrote to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding an FIR on the complaint filed by BJP MLA from Mumbai Ram Kadam and asking him "to take forward the legacy of" Bal Thackeray.In Uttar Pradesh, FIRs against the show have been filed in Lucknow, Greater Noida and Shahjahanpur. The complainants have alleged inappropriate depiction of UP Police personnel, Hindu deities, and adverse portrayal of a character playing prime minister in the political drama.On Monday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's media advisor Shalabhmani Tripathi said the makers of "Tandav" will have to pay the price for hurting religious sentiments.In a statement on behalf of the cast and crew of the series, the makers on Monday had apologised if they had "unintentionally" hurt anyone's sentiments with their fictional show. They followed it up on Tuesday with another apology statement, thanking the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for its "guidance & support" in the matter."The cast & crew of Tandav have made the decision to implement changes to the web series to address the concerns raised towards the same," the team said.The makers said they had "utmost respect" for the sentiments of the people and did not intend to hurt or offend the sentiments of "any individual, caste, community, race, religion or religious beliefs or insult or outrage any institution, political party or person, living or dead…" While many political leaders, particularly from the BJP, have spoken out, mainstream showbiz personalities have largely been silent, barring director Hansal Mehta and actor Swara Bhasker."I'm a Hindu and I'm not offended by any scene in #Tandav .. Why #banTandavSeries #BanTandavNow ???" Bhasker tweeted on Tuesday. "Tandav", which premiered on the streaming platform last Friday,  is not the first and certainly not the last show on streaming platforms, a booming market in India, to land in soup for one reason or another. Most recently, Netflix show “A Suitable Boy”, based on Vikram Seth's bestselling novel, attracted the ire of the right wing for a scene showing a Muslim man and a Hindu girl kissing in the backdrop of a temple.Before that was Amazon's “Pataal Lok” that got into trouble for its depiction of communal issues, and “Leila”, which was called "anti-Hindu" for depicting the dystopian future of Aryavarta where purity of blood is enforced.The government recently brought OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar, besides other online news and current affairs content, under the ambit of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, giving it powers to regulate policies and rules for the digital space. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scenes-snipped-from-tandav-but-trouble-continues-with-more-complaints-201205

The case is a result of strict vigil and action on any input which indicates involvement of our officials in corrupt practice,” an official said after the FIR.Dhankad allegedly received at least Rs 10 lakh each from his superiors Sangwan and Rishi who were soliciting favours for Shree Shyam Pulp and Board Mills and Frost International respectively.                DSP Rishi received Rs 15 lakh twice through advocates Malik and Gupta (having office in Defence Colony) to extend favours to a Chandigarh-based company against which a corruption case was being investigated by the CBI, the FIR alleged.       It alleged Dhankad twice received Rs 2.5 lakh from Gupta for having brokered the deal through Rishi.“It has also been reliably learnt that the details of the investigation of many other cases including confidential notes and directions have been communicated by Sameer Kumar Singh. Steno, to Sangwan and Rishi on pecuniary considerations to protect interests of the accused,” the FIR alleged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-arrests-its-dsp-inspector-in-bribery-scam-within-agency-201197
20-01-2021||New Delhi||Nasal COVID-19 vaccine will be easy to give to children: AIIMS director||A nasal COVID-19 vaccine will be easy to give to school-going children who bear a "very mild" load of the disease, but they are infectious, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said on Wednesday.The noted pulmonologist, who was interacting with the personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) during their 16th Raising Day celebrations here, also said that people who have contracted coronavirus should also get the jab about 4-6 weeks after recovery."It (coronavirus infection) is very mild in children, but they are infectious. They can spread the disease.""The vaccines that have come are not approved for children because there have been no studies conducted on children but this (vaccination) is a very important step and trials are being done," he said.Once children start going to the school regularly, and they contract the COVID-19 infection, they will not have much problem but if they bring it home they can spread it to their parents or grandparents, the chief of the premier Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said."Vaccines for children may come later... Bharat Biotech is trying to get approved a nasal vaccine. Such a vaccine will be very easy to be given to children as it is a spray and not a jab and hence compliance is more." "In half-an-hour you can vaccinate an entire class. So, if that (nasal vaccine) is approved it will be even easier to give the vaccine (for COVID-19)," Guleria said in reply to a question.He was also asked by the NDRF personnel if a person who has recovered from COVID-19 should get vaccinated with India commissioning two vaccines last week."A vaccine jab is essential for them (recovered from coronavirus) due to two reasons." "One is you are not sure how strong is your post COVID-19 immunity, and it has been seen quite a few times that those who had a mild to moderate infection their anti-body response has been less, and we also don't know how long will it be," he said.A vaccine will be "beneficial" for such an individual as it will act as a "booster" and if anti-bodies are depleting, with the vaccine it will be back to a high level, he said."So, you should get the vaccine if you have been infected with COVID-19 but if it has happened recently say like 7-10 days then one should wait and take the jab after may be 4-6 weeks," he said.Before replying to queries, Guleria also gave a PowerPoint presentation on the topic "Infectious Diseases: Emergencies and Challenges Ahead" and said "bio-terrorism" is an upcoming challenge.He said densely populated countries like India "provide an opportunity" for the outbreak of infectious disease emergencies as it is coupled with the phenomenon of crowding and urbanisation.He batted for having a "very good surveillance system" to better combat coronavirus like diseases and epidemics.He said the country did "aggressive" work with a strong political will in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak and said the need of the hour was to have lab-based surveillance and more and more trained public health officials."We need to enhance our research capacity, and we should not forget what we learnt during the coronavirus outbreak," Guleria said.World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan also addressed the personnel of the central force through an online link and said a good digital surveillance system should be in place to better deal with public health emergencies.  She said a resilient health workforce was required as it was seen during COVID-19 outbreak that regular health services were "disrupted" as the manpower had to be "diverted" to combat the raging pandemic.Swaminathan said a robust infection prevention and control system was required, especially for healthcare workers, for battling medical emergencies as it was seen that a major brunt is borne by these professionals during disease outbreaks like COVID-19 as they bear the "highest risk of exposure".NDRF chief S N Pradhan, while speaking during the event, said his rescuers faced the "double whammy or double challenge" of combating a disaster within a disaster last year.He was implying the deployment of the force during rescue operations like battling cyclones, a gas leak incident in Vishakhapatnam, floods in various states and other calamities even as COVID-19 continued to spread.The National Disaster Response Force was raised on January 19, 2006 as a federal contingency combat wing to undertake specific tasks of relief and rescue during natural and man-made disasters or life-threatening situations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nasal-covid-19-vaccine-will-be-easy-to-give-to-children-aiims-director-201190

20-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court grants bail to two persons||A Delhi court has granted bail to two persons in a case related to the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February last year.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat granted the relief to Shanu and Zarif on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount each in the case of burning of a local person's house in Jafrabad area during the riots.The court allowed the bail pleas considering the period of incarceration of both the accused and on the ground of parity.“The accused (Shanu and Zarif) is in judicial custody since April 8, 2020, in the present case. The ground of parity is relevant as co-­accused persons namely Aatir and Gulfam were granted bail earlier in this case."“Considering the period of incarceration of accused and in the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, the bail application is allowed,” it said in its similar order passed on January 19 in both matters.It directed the accused not to tamper with evidence or leave Delhi without its permission.During the hearing, advocate Abdul Gaffar, appearing for both the accused, claimed they have been falsely implicated in the matter.Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, opposed the bail pleas saying they were allegedly part of the unlawful assembly that burned down the house.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-two-persons-201185
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Action on complaint against ‘Tandav’ to be as per law: Deshmukh||Maharashtra Police have received a complaint about controversial web series 'Tandav' and formal action will taken in the case as per law, state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said on Wednesday.Talking to reporters here, Deshmukh also demanded the Centre to come up with a law to regulate content on the over the top (OTT) platforms.After several FIRs were filed in some states against the Amazon Prime Video’s political drama “Tandav” for alleged inappropriate depiction of Hindu deities and calls for its ban, its makers on Tuesday agreed to implement changes to the controversial web series.Deshmukh said, “We have received a complaint. We will register an FIR and take action formally.” He did not specify who has lodged the complaint.Deshmukh also said the Centre should come up with a law to regulate content on the OTT platforms to ensure no “caste-based discrimination or communal divide” is caused due to any content available there.The minister downplayed questions about the Uttar Pradesh Police visiting Mumbai in connection with an FIR against the web series.He said the Maharashtra Police personnel also go outside the state to conduct probes.“They (UP police) had informed us that an FIR has been registered there and they will be coming here for an investigation,” he added.In Uttar Pradesh, three FIRs have been lodged against the makers and artists of “Tandav”—in Lucknow, Greater Noida and Shahjahanpur.The complainants have alleged inappropriate depiction of UP Police personnel, Hindu deities, and adverse portrayal of a character playing prime minister in the political drama.Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra on Tuesday condemned the way “Tandav” actor Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, Saif Ali Khan Khan and its director Ali Abbas Zafar “reacted to our religion and hurt sentiments”.“The Madhya Pradesh government will register a case in this regard,” he said in Bhopal.MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also reacted to the controversy, saying “no one has the right to hurt our faith and insult our deities.”He said “obscenity being served on OTT platforms is not good for our teenagers” and called for close monitoring of these platforms.Earlier, BJP MP Manoj Kotak from Mumbai North-East and Madhya Pradesh minister Vishvas Sarang were among the politicians who appealed to the Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar to ban the series.BJP MLA from Mumbai Ram Kadam recently approached the Ghatkopar police here against the web series, alleging that it ridicules Hindu deities.The cast and crew of Amazon Prime Video’s glossy political show “Tandav” on Tuesday said they had decided to implement changes to “address concerns”.In their second apology statement in as many days, the show’s team also thanked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for its “guidance & support” in the matter.“Tandav”, a nine-episode political thriller starring Bollywood A-listers Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, started streaming last week. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/action-on-complaint-against-tandav-to-be-as-per-law-deshmukh-201184
20-01-2021||London||Being obese may up mental health issues in teens||If you are obese, there are chances that it may lead to some mental health issues, as a new study suggests that half of all young people treated for severe obesity have a neuropsychiatric problem.The study, published in the journal Acta Paediatrica, indicated that over half of the parents estimated that their obese teenagers had difficulties resembling ADHD and/or autism, despite only a few of them having been previously diagnosed with these conditions."Symptoms of ADHD mean that the person has difficulty with impulse control. This increases the risk of eating without being hungry and the tendency to opt for quick solutions such as fast food," said researcher Kajsa Jarvholm from Lund University in Sweden.For the study, the team involved 48 teenagers (73 per cent girls), with an average age of 15 and an average BMI of 42, which is severe obesity. Half of the participants received medical treatment for obesity, while the other half underwent surgery. The teenagers' parents completed questionnaires to measure their children's symptoms of ADHD and autism. The adolescents themselves responded to questions about binge eating and symptoms of depression."People on the autism spectrum are sometimes more selective in their eating than others. They only accept certain dishes but may eat more of them as a result," she said. One-fifth of the adolescents reported suffering symptoms of depression. One-third of them reported problems with binge eating, which is a loss of control resulting in the person eating large quantities of food in a short time."Contrary to our expectations, the adolescents with neuropsychiatric difficulties did not have more problems with binge eating and depression than the other adolescents in the group," said Jarvholm.Altogether, the information provided by the parents and adolescents revealed that two-thirds of the patients in the study had difficulties arising from neuropsychiatric problems, binge eating and/or depression. The researchers believe that the findings reveal a need to personalise treatments for adolescents with severe obesity as the majority also reported mental illness.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/being-obese-may-up-mental-health-issues-in-teens-201178

He was rushed to Civil Hospital in Bahadurgarh where he was declared brought dead.Jai Bhagwan had consumed poison near the main dharna spot at Tikri border and was taken to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Delhi. A suicide note was also recovered from him.In the note, Jai Bhagwan said he was a small farmer and many peasants have taken to the streets to protest against the Centre’s new farm laws. “The government says it is a matter of only two to three states, but farmers from all over the country are protesting against the laws. Sadly, it is not a movement now, but a fight of issues.

20-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police may allow tractor rally on Jan 26, but under strict supervision: Sources||Delhi Police may allow protesting farmers to hold their planned tractor rally in the National Capital on January 26, but on the “pre-identified and sanitised” routes with a limited number of participants and under “strict police supervision”, said sources.  Sources in the Delhi Police said the officials are in talks with the protesting farmers and trying to convince them with the plan given the sensitivity of the day (January 26). But in case the farmers do not adhere to the plan and try to breach the blockade at the borders, the police will use all its might to push them back, they added.The sources further said that the permission for the proposed rally could only be granted if there is a “mutual consensus” on the route, number of persons and number of tractors. “We would like to have in advance details of participating farmers including vehicle number, RC details, names of drivers, and co-passengers,” said a senior police officer. As the Delhi Police had approached Supreme Court to seek instructions against the proposed rally or any other kind of protest by farmers, the top court had said the Delhi Police is competent and should decide on its own on the entry of protesting farmers into the national capital on Republic Day.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police has made an elaborate arrangement to guard the national capital in the run-up and on the Republic Day this year. Nearly 75 per cent (more than 65,000) of the city’s 87,000 police personnel could continue to be on duty, supported by heavy barricading at many intersections and checkpoints on arterial roads, said a senior official.“The iron barricading at the borders is being strengthened, and a number of large vehicles, water cannons and cranes will also be stationed there on Republic Day. The police have identified non-functional CCTV cameras in order to replace them,” he said, adding that recently an order has also been issued to ban the operation of “sub-conventional aerial platforms”, including UAVs, paragliders and hot air balloons, in the national capital for 27 days beginning January 20.The Delhi Police has also asked the MHA for additional manpower in terms of CAPFs reinforcement, as work on the listing of deployment is being undertaken at Police headquarters to bring about a surprise for protesting farmers, the official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-may-allow-tractor-rally-on-jan-26-but-under-strict-supervision-sources-201164
20-01-2021||Satya Prakash||SC refuses to entertain Delhi Police plea against tractor rally on Republic Day||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 20The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain the Centre's plea filed through the Delhi Police seeking directions to stop a tractor rally by farmers agitating against farm laws on Republic Day."We have told that it is for the police to decide. We won't pass the orders. We will allow you to withdraw this application. You are the authority. You decide," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Attorney General KK Venugopal.Also read: Farmers’ protest: SC takes exception to aspersions cast on 4-member panelAs the Bench made it clear that it was not inclined to entertain the plea, Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta requested that the matter can be kept pending and considered on January 25."For what?" asked the Bench."To see how the situation develops," Mehta replied.But the CJI -- who had described it as a "law and order problem" on Monday -- refused to change his views on the tractor rally proposed on January 26 and accordingly allowed the Delhi police to withdraw its application seeking directions to stop it. Earlier, Venugopal told the court that 5000 tractors were going to enter Delhi and it's likely to create problems."No, no... This is not a matter for the court to decide. You have the powers under law," said the CJI who had earlier said the Delhi Police were the first authority to deal with the issue."It's highly inappropriate for the court to act as the first authority to allow or disallow protesters. We can allow you to withdraw the application. You are the Executive and you have the power to look into this. It's an issue of law and order and of the police," the top court noted.Asserting that farmers were law abiding citizens, BKU Lokshakti counsel AP Singh raised the issue of appointment of four-member committee by the court, saying principles of natural justice were violated."We are not on this. We allow AG to withdraw his application," the court said.The Delhi Police had filed a plea seeking direction to stop farmers' proposed tractor rally on Republic Day. "Right to protest is always subject to the countervailing public order and the public interest. The right to protest can never include maligning the nation globally,” Delhi Police had submitted.Pointing out that such a rally could cause law and order problems and prove to be embarrassing for the nation, they had sought an injunction against the tractor rally.However, noting that it's intervention to resolve the deadlock over farmers' protests against farm laws has been misunderstood, the Supreme Court had on Monday made it clear that it was for the Delhi Police to take a call if farmers' tractor rally proposed on Republic Day should be allowed to enter the national capital."Our intervention has been misunderstood... Who will come in the city and who will be allowed will not be seen by us," a Bench headed by CJI Bobde had said terming the proposed tractor rally a “law and order” issue.“You are at liberty to invoke all powers under the law," the CJI – who earlier maintained that farmers have a fundamental right to peacefully protest -- had told the Attorney General.The top court -- which stayed the implementation of the three farm laws on January 12 – said, "We said this last time that entry to Delhi has to be seen by Delhi police. Invoke all your powers to see whether farmers can be allowed in the city.""Who can be allowed or not are matters of law and order will be dealt by police. We cannot be the first authority here. Does the Union of India need the Supreme Court to tell it what powers it has under the Police Act?" CJI had told Venugopal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-delhi-police-plea-against-tractor-rally-on-republic-day-201163

Wherever feasible, the commencement and termination of the two minutes’ silence period should be indicated by the sound of a siren or Army guns.”Adding specifics, the Ministry went on to add: “Sirens should be sounded from 10.59 hours till 11.00 hours and after two minutes, all clear sirens should again be sounded from 11.02 hours till 11.03 hours. This procedure may be adopted where sirens exist.”At places, where no signal systems are available, the MHA has asked to give suitable instructions to all concerned for observing the silence for two minutes at 11 AM.The MHA has noted in the letter that in the past, it has been observed that while two minutes’ silence is observed in some offices, the general public goes about its occupation in the ordinary course, “unmindful of the solemnity” of the occasion. “The State/UT Governments are requested to ensure that the Martyrs’ Day is observed with due solemnity. They may issue instructions to all educational institutions and Public Sector Enterprises under their control for the observance of the Martyrs’ Day accordingly. Talks, speeches on freedom struggle, national integration may be organised in hybrid mode,” the letter read, while insisting that the guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) issued from time to time regarding COVID-19 need to be strictly adhered to while observing the silence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-asks-states-to-strictly-adhere-to-2-minute-silence-on-martyrs-day-201159

20-01-2021||New Delhi||Protesting farmers start facility for ironing clothes at Singhu border||Protesting farmers at the Singhu border here have started a facility for ironing washed garments to dry them faster as the natural process now takes longer than usual amid the cold weather in and around Delhi.Sarvan Singh, whose livelihood as an auto-rickshaw driver in Amritsar took a hit as he is helping run the service for the protesting farmers, said it was necessary to be part of the movement even though his children want him back home."After the rains we realised that while the clothes were getting washed, they were taking really long to dry. So we thought getting a couple of irons would solve the problem," he said.Singh arrived at the Singhu border protest site a week ago."This protest is for everybody, and I wanted to help in whatever way we can, so when we realised that there was a need for ironing facility, we decided to fill the gap," he added.The service is being run from a stall at the protest site with three-four men working for over 10 hours daily in four-hour shifts.Currently, they have two irons and as many ironing tables, but they are hoping to get more.

Even though we do other jobs to make some income, we work on our fields too, and right now protecting that is our main objective."Right now, my brothers are taking care of the shop at home, while I am here," he said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting on Delhi borders for almost two months against the Centre's three new farm laws enacted in September last year. The farmers have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.The three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protesting-farmers-start-facility-for-ironing-clothes-at-singhu-border-201153
20-01-2021||New Delhi||Maratha quota: SC to hear schedule of hearing pleas on February 5||The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would decide on February 5 the schedule of hearing on the pleas pertaining to the 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs after the state government said a case of this nature be heard once the physical hearing commences.The apex court is presently hearing matters through video-conferencing since March last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.A five-judge constitution bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan was told by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who was appearing for Maharashtra, that the state is requesting for an adjournment and the matter be heard in March.“Physical meetings are dangerous today,” Rohatgi told the bench, also comprising justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat.During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing, Rohatgi said there is an interim order against the state and “it may be appropriate for a case of this nature to be heard once physical hearing commence.”        Requesting the bench that the matter may be posted for hearing in March, he said that vaccination for COVID-19 has started in the country and it may take six to eight weeks for the judges and lawyers, who are above the age of 60, to get vaccinated.“We will take a call after two weeks on what is to be done,” the bench said, adding, “We will fix date for directions after two weeks. Then, we will finalise the schedule for hearing”.The bench has posted the matter for February 5 and said it would decide the schedule of hearing.On December 9 last year, the apex court had said that issues pertaining to the 2018 Maharashtra law, granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs, requires “urgent hearing” as the legislation has been stayed and the “fruits accrued” are not reaching to the people.The top court had also issued notice to Attorney General K K Venugopal seeking his assistance in the matter.The apex court on September 9, while referring to a larger bench the batch of pleas challenging the validity of the law, had stayed the implementation of the legislation but made it clear that status of those who have availed of the benefits would not be disturbed.The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 was enacted to grant reservation to people of Maratha community in Maharashtra in jobs and admissions.The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June 2019, had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and said that quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions.According to the 102nd amendment to the Constitution, reservation can be granted only if a particular community is named in the list prepared by the President.On July 27, the Maharashtra government had assured the top court that it would not proceed with the recruitment process to fill up the vacancies on the basis of 12 per cent Maratha reservation till September 15, except for departments, Public Health and Medical Education and Research.The high court, in its June 27 last year order, had said that 50 per cent cap on total reservations imposed by the Supreme Court could be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. It had also accepted the Maharashtra government’s argument that the Maratha community was socially and educationally backwards and it was duty-bound to take steps for its progress. The high court had said though the reservation was valid, its quantum—16 per cent—was not justifiable and it should be reduced to 12 per cent and 13 per cent, as recommended by the State Backward Classes Commission.One of the pleas filed in the apex court had claimed that the SEBC Act breached the 50 per cent ceiling on reservation fixed by the top court in its landmark judgment in the Indira Sahwney case, also known as the ‘Mandal verdict’.On November 30, 2018, the Maharashtra legislature had passed a bill granting 16 per cent reservation to Marathas. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maratha-quota-sc-to-hear-schedule-of-hearing-pleas-on-february-5-201151

20-01-2021||Washington||Biden Admin plans to continue elevating defence partnership with India, says Gen Austin (retd)||The objective of the incoming Biden Administration is to continue elevating the US’ defence partnership with India, the Defense Secretary nominee told lawmakers.“If confirmed, my overarching objective for our defence relationship with India would be to continue elevating the partnership,” retired Gen. Lloyd Austin told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. President-elect Joe Biden has nominated him as his Defense Secretary.“I would further operationalise India’s ‘Major Defense Partner’ status and continue to build upon existing strong defence cooperation to ensure the US and Indian militaries can collaborate to address shared interests,” Austin said in response to a question submitted before his confirmation hearing.He said he would also seek to deepen and broaden the defence cooperation between India and the US through the Quad security dialogue and other regional multilateral engagements.Austin said his understanding is that Pakistan has taken constructive steps to meet US requests in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Pakistan has also taken steps against anti-Indian groups, such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, although this progress is incomplete, he said.“Many factors in addition to the security assistance suspension may impact Pakistan’s cooperation, including Afghanistan negotiations and the dangerous escalation following the Pulwama terrorist attack,” Austin said. President Donald Trump had suspended all the financial and security aid to Pakistan in 2018 citing lack of cooperation from Islamabad in the fight against terrorism.If confirmed, Austin said he will press Pakistan to prevent its territory from being used as a sanctuary for militants and violent extremist organizations.“Continuing to build relationships with Pakistan’s military will provide openings for the United States and Pakistan to cooperate on key issues,” he said.Austin said he will focus on the shared interests which include training future Pakistan military leaders through the use of International Military Education and Training funds. Pakistan will play an important role in any political settlement in Afghanistan. “We also need to work with Pakistan to defeat al-Qaeda and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) and to enhance regional stability,” he said.Observing that Pakistan is an essential partner in any peace process in Afghanistan, Austin said that if confirmed, he will encourage a regional approach that garners support from neighbours like Pakistan, while also deterring regional actors from serving as spoilers to the Afghanistan peace process.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-admin-plans-to-continue-elevating-defence-partnership-with-india-says-gen-austin-retd-201128

The relatives of martyrs have been asked to submit documents to ascertain their antecedents. Today, 11 persons submitted relevant documents, claiming to be the descendants of the martyrs.Confusion over exact numberA state-level function has been scheduled to honour the martyrs’ kin on January 25 at Anand Park in Ranjit Avenue where a separate memorial would be unveiled.The administration has appealed to the public to approach the Deputy Commissioner’s office by January 22 if they have information about the martyrs’ kin. Besides, all MLAs, councillors and sarpanches have been approached with the list.DC Gurpreet Singh Khaira said efforts were being made to ascertain the list’s genuineness. “We are trying to reach out to the kin of the martyrs. It was quite a cumbersome process to identify all, given the fact that the list didn’t have proper contacts and addresses,” he said.However, confusion over the number of deaths and the uncertainty over their names remains with multiple lists projecting different figures. Historian VN Datta, who authored the pioneering work on Jallianwala Bagh (1969), has mentioned that around 700 persons were killed.His daughter and associate professor Nonica Dutta, Department of Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, said her father had zeroed in on this estimate on the basis of local police records. Quoting Dutta’s research, she said at the meeting of the Imperial Legislative Council held on September 12, 1919, Congrerss leader Madan Mohan Malaviya had stated 1,000 persons had been killed in the massacre. “My father had also questioned both the official and Congress estimates. There is no clarity on the number of martyrs to date,” she said.The list of the dead and injured prepared by the British then for the purpose of awarding compensation has several discrepancies. Lying at the DC’s office, the list has 501 individuals with many marked as “unidentified”. The list was pruned to 492, as several serial numbers were left blank.A recent study by the Partition Museum Trust put the number at 547 with the names of 45 not known. A board in the precincts of the Jallianwala Bagh earlier put the death toll at 379 and around 1,500 injured. This was published by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust. Also, it was inscripted at the martyrs’ well from where 120 bodies were recovered later on.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/101-yrs-on-official-list-of-492-jallianwala-martyrs-out-200778

They also sought details on how many protesters and tractors would be part of the January 26 march.A joint team of the Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh Police met the leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 40 unions, at a private resort in Singhu.The development came a day after the Supreme Court refused to halt the tractor rally saying it was up to the Delhi Police to decide who would enter the Capital. BKU (Dakaunda) leader Jagmohan Singh Patiala said they would not compromise on the route.“We assured the police team of cooperation in organising a peaceful ‘tractor parade’,” he maintained.The Delhi Police, meanwhile, moved to fortify the Capital by deploying over 65,000 of its personnel and seeking additional reinforcements of the Central Armed Police Forces. Union Home Minister Amit Shah took stock of the situation at a meeting with the Delhi Police brass.As the Delhi Police comes under the MHA, Shah visited the police headquarters here and held a high-level review meeting with Minister of State (Home) G Kishan Reddy, Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, IB Director Arvind Kumar, Commissioner of Police SN Srivastava and other senior officials.Heavy barricading at several intersections and checkpoints on arterial roads were part of the plan, said a senior police official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-alter-r-day-rally-route-unions-tell-cops-200773

Just because a person has expressed his views on the matter is no ground for disqualification from the committee. Generally, there is peculiar lack of comprehension about the constitution of a committee. They are not judges,” the CJI said. “We are talking of a general misunderstanding. Committee members are not judges. They can change their views,” he said.NGT panel report on Yamuna pollution soughtThe SC on Tuesday asked for a report from a National Green Tribunal committee on improving the water quality of the Yamuna and the action taken on its recommendations. A Bench asked for the report after amicus curiae and senior advocate Meenakshi Arora said the NGT-appointed panel had been monitoring the cleaning of the river.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-prior-expression-of-views-no-bar-on-panel-appointments-200775

It must stop. We appeal to health workers to accept the vaccines and help make the health system Covid-proof,” NITI Aayog member VK Paul said as India had vaccinated 6.31 lakh health workers by Tuesday, day three of the drive, with nine more adverse events reported.Punjab with 27.9 per cent vaccine beneficiary coverage has emerged as the worst alongside Tamil Nadu with 34.9 per cent and Puducherry with 34.6 per cent coverage. “We are in touch with these states to encourage them to pick up speed,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, noting that India’s vaccine coverage on the first three days was the best in the world in comparative terms but lower than the country’s own expectations.The best performing states on vaccination coverage include Lakshadweep (89.3 pc), Sikkim (85.7 pc) and Odisha (82.6 pc).Assuring that Covishield and Covaxin were safe, Paul said, “I took Covaxin at AIIMS and I have zero side-effects.” The government also said that among the vaccinated, adverse events were seen in just 0.18 pc cases as against 0.6 pc reported for the Pfizer vaccine abroad.“The percentage of hospitalisation after immunisation in India is just 0.002 pc,” said Bhushan.Export to 6 nationsThe first vax batch will be airlifted to six countries — Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal & Seychelles — on Thursday.Cases at 7-month low||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-28-vax-coverage-lowest-in-punjab-shun-hesitancy-centre-200776

Even pilots get such information at the last moment. Only the top five people (PM, Defence Minister, Home Minister, IAF Chief and NSA) knew. Someone from them gave it to him. This is criminal. The process of probe must begin but it will not because the PM must have given the information,” alleged Gandhi.He also attacked Goswami’s alleged chats where after the Pulwama terror attack he says “it is good”.“This is a reflection of the PM’s thought process that 40 persons have died and we will now win the elections,” said Gandhi as the Congress prepared to mount an all-out offensive on the issue.A detailed comment on Arnab leaks will come tomorrow in a joint press conference planned by former defence minister AK Antony, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, former home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and former Law Minister Salman Khurshid.Rahul meanwhile said, “People in the government call themselves patriotic, but there is nothing patriotic about giving out official secrets about our Air Force striking Pakistan. If Goswami knew, I believe Pakistan also knew.”Goswami’s leaked chats with former BARC chief Partho Dasgupta have triggered an intense debate on journalistic propriety and the government-media relations.Asked to respond to remarks about him by BJP president JP Nadda today, Rahul said, “Who is JP Nadda? Is he a professor? Who is he?”Congress trying to scuttle talks with farmers: BJPNew Delhi: Hitting back at Rahul Gandhi over his attack on the Narendra Modi government over farm laws and national security, the ruling BJP on Tuesday accused him and the Congress of trying to scuttle the ongoing talks between the government and farmer unions. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said the Congress did not want the talks to succeed and had resorted to “obstructive tactics”. TNS'Repeal of farm laws only option'Noting that repeal of farm laws is the only way out of the current deadlock, Rahul said farmers were wiser than the PM and would not get tired out or fooled by the government.‘China needs to be given tough message’Rahul Gandhi said a dangerous situation was developing with respect to China, adding that India must respond with a strategic vision. “China is watching the weakness of India. Unless India gives it a clear message with a strategy, China won’t sit silent. They will exploit the situation,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-top-shots-had-balakot-info-must-probe-who-leaked-it-rahul-gandhi-200777

Each tablet is arranged in a circular pattern on one of the 16 walls of the memorial. The pattern symbolises ancient Indian war formation “Chakravyuh”.A panel of the three services had cleared the names of the soldiers who died in various operations from October 2019 to September 2020 for inscription on the memorial wall.A functionary questioned the annual update of names instead of a quarterly update.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/galwan-martyrs-names-put-up-at-war-memorial-200873

Currently in jail after being convicted in the disproportionate assets case, Sasikala is expected to be released later this month.Though according to some BJP leaders and observers, if the NDA wants to defeat rival DMK, then Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dinakaran should be brought on board. After being expelled from the AIADMK, Dinakaran floated a new party called AMMK and is said to be holding considerable influence in many parts of central and southern Tamil Nadu. “If you really want to defeat DMK, all anti-DMK parties need to come together as full force,” they say.Palaniswami, who is believed to have discussed prospects of the NDA alliance in the state in his meetings with the PM and Home Minister Shah during his Delhi visit, insisted that politics was not discussed.

Today the members discussed the road-map of activities for the Committee for two months to prepare recommendations. Members said they will hold discussions with farmers and farmer organisations, both pro and against the farm laws.The committee will send invitations to farmers unions and associations to discuss their views. Individual farmer can also submit his/her views on the portal to be notified soon. It will also hold discussions with State Governments, State Marketing Boards and other stakeholders like Farmer Producer Organisations, and Cooperatives, etc. Those who cannot meet personally can post suggestions on the website.The committee is keen to understand the opinion on the subject of all concerned so that it can give suggestions which will definitely be in the interests of the farmers of India. “It will be a ‘nishpaksh’ (unbiased) committee. We have not been asked to give our views. Our responsibility is to present the views of farmers and stakeholders which we will do with complete impartiality,” they said.Meanwhile, farmers also made it clear that they will hold a peaceful tractor rally on January 26 “inside Delhi” and that there is no scope of compromise on the issue.

20-01-2021||New Delhi||Only 5 people had Balakot info, must probe who leaked it to Arnab: Rahul||In the first official reaction to the explosive Arnab Goswami chats, the Congress on Tuesday demanded a probe into the leakage of sensitive Balakot strike information to the Republic TV editor and said both the source and recipient of the official secret must be booked.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi led the offensive on the issue and said only five people knew of the strike and one of them shared it with Goswami.“Both the person who gave the secret information and the one who received it must be booked. Sensitive defence information before Balakot was given to a journalist. Even the pilots get such information at the last moment. Top five people (the prime minister, the defence minister, the home minister, the IAF chief and the NSA) had this information. Someone out of them gave him this information. This is criminal. We must find out who gave and the process of the probe should begin but it will not because the PM must have given the information,” alleged Gandhi.He also attacked Goswami for saying after the Pulwama attack that “it is good for us.”“I do not like that language. It is the reflection of the PM’s thought process that 40 people have died and we will now win the elections,” said the former Congress chief.Addressing a press conference here, Gandhi said, "The law will take its own course, but I have an observation. This was top-secret information, this was not provided to anybody else."              "Giving official secret information to a journalist is a criminal act, both on the part of the person who accepted it and on the part of the person who gave it," he said.Adding that the law would take its course, Gandhi said: “People in the government call themselves patriotic but there is nothing patriotic about giving out official secret information about our Air Force striking Pakistan. If Arnab Goswami knew, I believe Pakistan also knew.”Referring to the contents of the purported chats, Gandhi said the distressing thing is that after the 2019 Pulwama attack, the journalist said that "this is good for us"."This is a reflection of the mind of the prime minister that it is good that 40 of our people have been killed and we will win the elections," he alleged. Gandhi’s remarks can trigger a massive political backlash from the BJP that is yet to react to leaked Goswami’s chats with the ex BARC chief Partho Dasgupta.On February 26, 2019, India had launched airstrikes on what was said to be JeM's training camp in Pakistan's Balakot.
