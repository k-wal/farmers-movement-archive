11-01-2021||New Delhi||Envoy pushes for strengthening economic leg by more connectivity||Indonesia, a prominent player in the Asia-Pacific, on Monday indicated its preference to expand military ties with India but remained wary of joining an expanded version of Quad, a four-country alliance that aims to check China."I think countries would establish their layers of diplomacy based on how they look at their environment and each country’s perspective of the environment would be different,’’ said outgoing Ambassador of Indonesia to India Sidharto Reza Suryodipuro in his address to the Ananta Aspen Centre on being asked about Jakarta’s view on talk about the Quad 's interest in expanding its alliance of four democracies."In terms of military cooperation, we have strengthened from coordinated patrol in the Andaman Sea, that has been going on at least for the past 17 years. We have army-to-army exercises, navy-to-navy, and soon we will start air force to air force,’’ he said.Indonesia has signed on 28 projects worth $ 91 billion to be financed under the BRI China’s Belt and Road Initiative, according to Indonesia Vice President Jusuf Kalla. These include a $ 1.6bn dam in Sumatra and a $ 6 bn high-speed rail project between Jakarta and Bandung.The Ambassador felt the economic leg of the bilateral ties needed to be strengthened. Two-way trade had reached $20 billion of which about $ 10 billion was palm oil and coal exports from Indonesia to India and the remaining $10 billion is what is traded on both sides."We are punching far below our weight in terms of the size of our countries. Indonesia is India’s largest neighbour after China. We need to build closer business-to-business relationships, universities-to-universities, think-thanks to think-tanks, people-to-people, we need to build this by setting up direct connectivity,’’ he said.On connectivity through the Malacca channel, the envoy advocated smaller ships instead of huge container vessels. "It can be direct between the coasts of India with the ports in Sumatra, Java, it does not have to be super cargo ships," he observed."Now the situation in the region calls for greater Indian and Indonesian partnership, collaboration and will provide the basis for the region’s stability and prosperity, after all we are the largest and second-largest countries of the Indo-Pacific. So we’ll set the tone for that as well," observed the envoy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/envoy-pushes-for-strengthening-economic-leg-by-more-connectivity-197021
11-01-2021||New Delhi||Construction of new parliament building to start soon as heritage panel gives its nod||A 14-member heritage panel on Monday gave its approval for construction of a new parliament building under the government’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan, paving the way for the work to start in the next few days.The nod by the Heritage Conservation Committee came nearly a week after the Supreme Court asked the Centre to seek prior approval from the panel and other relevant authorities before starting construction of the new parliament building.Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said construction of the new parliament building would not affect the existing structure, which is a heritage one.At a press conference here, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said the committee, headed by the ministry’s additional secretary, granted approval to the construction of the new parliament building after examining and discussing the proposal.Asked whether public hearing was mandatory before granting approval, he answered, “No”.The panel has officers from different organisations and experts as members.Mishra said the committee’s members look into what is provided under unified building bylaws based on which they accept or reject a proposal or suggest modifications.Work on redevelopment of Rajpath will start soon after this year’s Republic Day parade. The work is expected to be completed in the next 10 months and the 2022 Republic Day parade will be held on a redeveloped Rajpath, the housing secretary said.On January 5, the Supreme Court cleared the decks for the ambitious Central Vista Project by upholding the environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use.In the majority verdict, the apex court said prior permission shall be taken from heritage conservation committee and other relevant authorities before start of construction at new sites.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista—the nation’s power corridor—envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.Amid criticism that there was not much consultation on the project, Puri said the government has held talks with many people, including consultants, experts, editors and others, on it.He said the government will soon put in public domain all the consultations it had, adding a website will also be launched that will have all the details pertaining to the Central Vista project.“Consultation is inherent in what we do. If the suggestion is that some parts are not being consulted widely enough, we are quite happy to correct that,” the minister said.Responding to the critics of the project, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said that most of the criticism are on fundamentals like why the government needs a Parliament building.He also said after the consultation process was over, those opposing the project began to say that the government does not need a new parliament building.An elected government has to determine whether the time has come for a new Parliament building and that is the executive responsibility, Puri said.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building where the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while the Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members. The National Emblem will crown the new Parliament building.The new Parliament will have six committee rooms to conduct business.The government has identified around four locations—in Gole Market, K G Marg near Africa Avenue, and near Talkatora Stadium—in central Delhi for temporary shifting of offices of various ministries.

11-01-2021||New Delhi||Legislations cannot be stayed by SC unless prima facie unconstitutional, say experts||Parliamentary legislations cannot be stayed by the Supreme Court unless it is satisfied prima facie that they are unconstitutional and illegal, legal experts said on Monday.They largely concurred with the views of Attorney General KK Venugopal who on Monday opposed the apex court observation on stay of implementation of controversial farm laws.Venugopal said such an order can only be passed when there were prima facie materials to show that they violated fundamental rights of citizens or constitutional schemes and have been formed without the legislative competence of Parliament.Chief Justice S A Bobde observed during hearing on Monday that a committee needs to be appointed to resolve the deadlock between the Centre and the farmers and said, “Staying the implementation of laws and staying the law are different. We can always stay executive action under a law.”     Senior advocate and constitutional law expert Rakesh Dwivedi said Parliamentary legislations cannot be stayed unless there is a very strong ground for holding at the very inception that prima facie it is unconstitutional.“This is very tall order, without hearing the government you jump the gun. Large number of farmers are agitating cannot be a ground for the court to stay the laws. It is only in the wisdom of the lawmakers and is beyond the domain of the court,” Dwivedi told PTI.“Courts cannot say people are agitating so we will stay the law. I agree with the Attorney General that the farm laws cannot be stayed unless it is constitutionally invalid,” he said.Senior advocate Mohan Katarki said however that the top court is vested with the jurisdiction to stay the operation of the Act of Parliament if it is satisfied that prima facie Parliament lacks legislative competence.Katariki said: “The Supreme Court is vested with jurisdiction to stay the operation of the Act of Parliament pending final decision, if the Supreme Court is satisfied that prima facie Parliament lacks legislative competence in enacting the Act and the Act is inconsistent with any constitutional provision and balance of convenience are in favour of granting stay.“While considering the balance of convenience, the Supreme Court may have regard to long and peaceful protest of farmers in biting cold”.Dwivedi also said that by hinting at staying the farm laws, the apex court is acting more like an administrator than the court.“The Supreme Court can stay the law. But I don’t agree with the judges that they would stay and constitute a committee. It can do but it does mean that it is legal. It is illegal. It is only a way to come out of the impasse. By doing so it is acting more like an administrator than a Supreme Court. The real issue is that can the Central government pass a law which bypasses state law,” he said.Senior advocate Ajit Kumar Sinha said however that the top court observed it may stay the implementation of the farm laws and keep them in abeyance.“It was more on implementation till the matter is resolved. That is a possibility. That they can do it because negotiations are on and public interest is also involved. People are put to problems and they are threatening,” Sinha said.“Till the time you a reach a consensus and form a committee till then you don’t implement. So the implementation is sought to be stayed. Not the law as such. To keep in abeyance for a fruitful and public purpose they can do it. They have the power under Article 142 to do complete justice,” he said.Supreme Court lawyer Ashwani Kumar Dubey said the top court can stay the execution of the farm laws as it has done in the case of Maratha reservation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/legislations-cannot-be-stayed-by-sc-unless-prima-facie-unconstitutional-say-experts-197011

11-01-2021||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to come out with concrete steps to deal with stubble burning||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to file an affidavit detailing “concrete steps” to deal in future with the situation of stubble burning, which is a major cause of air pollution in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR) during the winters.The order by a bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, came after it was submitted that the pollution caused due to stubble burning will again come to fore in future.“Mr Tushar Mehta (Solicitor General), you come back with some concrete steps on stubble burning,” the bench said.The top court was hearing a petition which has raised the issue of pollution caused due to stubble burning in neighbouring states of Delhi.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioner, told the bench, “The issue will arise again. For this year, the issue of stubble burning is over and it will start again next time. The Centre has said nothing on this”.The bench asked solicitor general to file an affidavit on the issue.The apex court had last month said it was “not satisfied” with the work done by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, which has been constituted by the Centre to tackle air pollution.“We don’t know what your commission is doing. People in Delhi are not satisfied with your work. We are also not satisfied,” the bench had said.Mehta had earlier told the bench that the commission is working on “war footing” and several steps have been taken to deal with pollution.On November 6, the apex court had asked the Centre to ensure there is no smog in Delhi as it was informed that the Commission has started functioning from that day.It had said that pollution problem has to be dealt with by the executive as it has the power, money and resources for this.The Centre, which has appointed former Chief Secretary of Delhi M M Kutty as the chairperson of the Commission, had apprised the court that there were experts from the field besides members from NGOs in the newly created Commission.On October 29, the top court was informed by the Centre that it has come out with an ordinance on curbing pollution and it has been promulgated already.The top court is also hearing a separate plea on air pollution and had last year even taken a suo motu note of alarming rise in air pollution in Delhi-NCR where several directions have been passed with regard to stubble burning.

11-01-2021||Hyderabad||Former AP minister denied bail in high-profile kidnapping case||A Secunderabad court rejected bail petition of a former Andhra Pradesh Tourism Minister who faces charges of having arrested for kidnapping a former hockey player and his two brothers on Monday.Bhuma Akhila Priya and her husband were prime suspects in the high-profile abduction case that happened on January 5. She will remain in police custody until January 13. Eight other people have been arrested in the case.The petitioner told the court through her lawyer that she was pregnant, and also that the arrest was politically motivated.The state has argued that she could potentially influence witnesses and tamper with evidence if release on bail.The court had previously turned down the politician’s request of being moved to a hospital.  Praveen Rao, Sunil Rao and Naveen Rao, who are stated to be close to the Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), were abducted on January 5 this year.Their abductors are believed to have posed as Income Tax conducting raids to gain entry into their house.The abductors let their hostages go within hours of the incident.Investigators say the abduction was over a dispute involving a 25-acre land in Hafeezpet in Ranga Reddy district that is estimated to be valued at Rs 200 crore.Praveen Rao is believed to have bought the land in 2016 from a suspect in the case, AV Subba Reddy, for an undisclosed sum.When the land’s price shot up Reddy, along with Akhila Priya and her husband, allegedly claimed ownership over the land, police said.Investigators claim that hostages were also made to sign some documents before being allowed to go.Akhila Priya is a member of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), a party whose leader Chandrababu Naidu’s rivalry with TRS’s chief KCR dates back to the Telangana statehood movement. Police claim that they have not ruled political angles to the story.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-ap-minister-denied-bail-in-high-profile-kidnapping-case-197003

The bench on Monday heard a clutch of pleas challenging the new farm laws as well as the ones raising issues of citizens' right to move freely during the ongoing farmers' stir.It pulled up the Centre for its handling of the farmers' protest against the new farm laws saying it is “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations between them were going.It also indicated amply that it may go to the extent of staying the implementation of the contentious farm laws and refused to grant extra time to the Centre to explore the possibility of amicable solution saying it has already granted the government a “long rope”. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-pronounce-orders-on-tuesday-on-farm-laws-farmers-protests-197001

11-01-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19 impact: Govt not to print Budget documents this year||The voluminous Budget documents will not be printed this year following the COVID-19 protocol and will instead be distributed electronically to the Members of Parliament (MPs).This will be the first time since the presentation of independent India’s first budget on November 26, 1947, that the documents containing income and expenditure statement of the Union government along with finance bill, detailing new tax and other measures for the new financial year, will not be physically printed.Due to COVID-19, it has been decided not to print documents related to the Union Budget for the fiscal beginning April (FY 2021-22), sources said.All MPs will get soft copies of the budget and Economic Survey that contains an account of the state of the economy.The printing of documents requires staff to be locked up in the basement printing press of the finance ministry couple of weeks ahead of the presentation of the Budget. The printing all these years began with a ‘Halwa’ ceremony that marked the staff going into the basement press only to emerge after the budget is presented.This will be the first time since independence that physical copies of Budget documents will not be shared with MPs to avoid the risk of COVID-19 infection, the sources said, adding all MPs will get soft copies of the Budget and Economic Survey.The familiar sight of trucks loaded with budget papers in Parliament on the budget day and scanning of these by security guard will also be given a miss.The Budget for FY22 will come on the backdrop of an economic contraction of 7.7 per cent, the first time in the history of independent India. So, all stakeholders have great expectation from the upcoming Budget, which could provide a healing touch to the pandemic-battered economy and push growth.Even Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month promised a “never before” like Union Budget to the people of India.While investment in health, medical Research and Development (R&D) and developing greater skills to handle telemedicine is going to be critical, livelihood challenges will have to be seen in a newer canvas with the latest perspective on vocational training and skill development.“Send me your inputs so that we can see a Budget which is a Budget like never before, in a way. 100 years of India wouldn’t have seen a Budget being made post-pandemic like this.“And that is not going to be possible unless I get your inputs and wish list, clear observation of what has put you through the challenge... Without that, it is impossible for me to draft something which is going to be that Budget like never before, a Budget which is being made after a pandemic,” Sitharaman had said.The Union Budget for 2021-22, the eighth Budget of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, is scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1, 2021.Sitharaman will be presenting her third full-time Budget.The Modi-led government scrapped a colonial-era tradition of presenting the Budget at the end of February. Then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had for the first time presented the annual accounts on February 1, 2017.With the advancement of the Budget, the ministries are now allocated their budgeted funds from the start of the financial year beginning April.This gives government departments more leeway to spend as well as allow companies time to adapt to business and taxation plans.Yashwant Sinha, as a Finance Minister of the BJP-led government in 1999, also made a departure from the tradition of presenting the Budget at 11 am from the colonial set practice of 5 pm.Sinha, however, retained the Budget date of February 28 or the last working day of February. The concept of the 5 pm Budget was followed by the British regime as the members of Britain’s parliaments ‘House of Commons’ and ‘House of Lords’ used to listen to India’s budget before independence.This so happened because there was a time-zone gap between New Delhi (+5.30 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and Westminster, UK. The Indian time zone was 4.5 hours ahead of BST (British Summer Time). PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-impact-govt-not-to-print-budget-documents-this-year-196994

11-01-2021||New Delhi||‘Galwan heroes’ likely to be honoured posthumously on Republic Day||Colonel B Santosh Babu and some of the other Indian Army personnel, who were killed while valiantly fighting Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in June last year, are expected to be honoured with gallantry awards on Republic Day, sources said on Monday.Col Babu, the commanding officer of the 16 Bihar regiment, was among 20 Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in the Galwan Valley, an incident that marked one of the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.China is yet to disclose the number of its soldiers killed and injured in the clash though it officially admitted to having suffered casualties. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.The Galwan Valley clash had escalated the border row in eastern Ladakh and resulted in a large deployment of troops and heavy weaponry by both the armies in the friction points.“Some of the Army personnel including Col Babu who displayed extreme courage during the Galwan clash are expected to be honoured on Republic Day,” said a source.The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs in carrying out brutal attacks on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China around patrolling point 14 in the Galwan Valley.The Indian Army has already built a memorial for the ‘Gallants of Galwan’ at Post 120 in eastern Ladakh.The memorial mentioned their heroics under operation ‘Snow Leopard’ and the way they evicted the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops from the area while inflicting “heavy casualties” on them.Separately, the Department of Military Affairs is in process of inscribing the names of Colonel Babu and the 19 other soldiers at the National War Memorial in Delhi.During a visit to Lukung forward post in eastern Ladakh on July 17, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh personally conveyed his appreciation and compliments to the troops from the Bihar regiment for displaying exemplary grit and courage in fighting the Chinese troops.India and China are locked in a bitter military standoff in eastern Ladakh for the last eight months.Nearly 50,000 troops of the Indian Army are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in the mountainous region in sub-zero temperatures as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded concrete outcome to resolve the standoff.China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials.Last month, India and China had held another round of diplomatic talks under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs.The eighth and last round of military talks between the two sides had taken place on November 6 during which both sides broadly discussed disengagement of troops from specific friction points.India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region.

They are ideologically opposed to the BJP. A good number of them are Left-leaning.Responding to the invitation for the meeting, the Joint Platform of these unions in a letter to Gangwar said the virtual meeting was an effort to avoid substantive discussion on the issue.These unions had boycotted one such meeting last month regarding the other two Codes: on Wage and Industrial Relations.After their objection, the government had changed tack and held physical meeting, but these unions skipped it. It was attended by four Unions, including the BMS.The protesting Unions are, in effect, against the Codes which were passed by the Parliament.“We have been critical of adoption of labour codes by flouting all Parliamentary norms without discussion in absence of the entire opposition from the Parliament and without Tripartite consultations,” their Joint Platform stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trade-unions-write-to-labour-minister-call-meeting-to-discuss-labour-codes-farce-196967

11-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay High Court extends relief to Sonu Sood in 'illegal' construction case||The Bombay High Court on Monday extended till January 13 a civil court order granting interim protection to actor Sonu Sood from coercive action by the BMC against the alleged illegal structural changes made by him in a residential building in suburban Juhu without permission.Sood last week approached the HC, challenging a notice issued against him by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in October last year and an order passed by a civil court in December dismissing his suit against the BMC's action.The civil court, while dismissing the suit, had granted three weeks’ time to Sood to file an appeal and stayed its order, thus granting relief to the actor.On Monday, BMC's counsel Anik Sakhare sought time to respond to the actor's petition.Sood's advocate Amogh Singh then sought interim protection and a direction to the civic body not to take any coercive action.Justice Prithviraj Chavan, while adjourning the petition till January 13, said, "The order passed by the lower court shall continue till then."Sood's advocate Singh told the High Court that the actor had not carried out any illegal or unauthorised construction in the six-storey Shakti Sagar building."The petitioner (Sood) has not made any changes in the building that warrant permission from the BMC. Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done," Singh said.BMC's counsel Sakhare, however, argued that the petitioner was illegally converting the residential building into a hotel without procuring a licence."A hotel with 24 rooms is being run in the six-storey residential building. The BMC has taken demolition action on the property twice...once in 2018 and then in February 2020. But, still the illegal construction is on," Sakhare said.A police complaint had now been filed by the corporation, he added.Justice Chavan then asked Sood's lawyer if the actor was operating a hotel in the building without a licence."Are you conducting hotel business without a licence? You should come to the court with clean hands. If not, then you will have to face consequences," Justice Chavan said.To this, Singh said Sood is not conducting a hotel business, but is running "a residential hotel in which flats are rented out to people".Sood's petition has sought the court to quash and set aside the notice issued by the BMC and an interim relief of no coercive action to be initiated against him.Sood, who is known for his roles in films like ‘Dabangg’, ‘Jodha Akbar’ and ‘Simmba’, came into spotlight last year for his philanthropy work in helping migrants reach their homes during the Covid lockdown.

11-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay High Court extends relief to Kangana Ranaut in sedition case||The Bombay High Court on Monday extended the interim relief of no coercive action against actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel till January 25 in connection with an FIR registered against them under sedition and other charges.The HC also directed the city police not to summon the duo for questioning till then.Ranaut and her sister appeared before Bandra police in Mumbai on January 8 for recording their statement in the case, pursuant to an assurance given to HC in November last year.The FIR, under sedition charges and for allegedly “trying to create hatred and communal tension” through their posts on social media, was registered pursuant to orders passed by the Bandra magistrate’s court, directing the police to carry out an inquiry against Ranaut and her sister following a complaint lodged against them.A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale was hearing a petition filed by the sisters, seeking to quash the FIR and the order passed by the magistrate on October 17 last year.Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare informed the court on Monday that the petitioners appeared before the police on January 8 from 1 pm to 3 pm.“She (Ranaut) left even before we could complete the interrogation, claiming she has professional commitments. We will call her again for interrogation. What is wrong in cooperating,” Thakare said.To this, Justice Pitale said: “She (Ranaut) was there for two hours. Is this not enough? How many more hours do you (police) need for cooperation?”Thakare then said the police want to question her for three more days.Advocate Rizwan Merchant, appearing for complainant Sahil Ashraf Ali Sayyed, sought time to file an affidavit in response to the petition.The court then adjourned the matter till January 25.“The interim relief, by way of no coercive action against the petitioners, shall continue till then. The police shall not call the petitioners till that day,” the court said.Justice Shinde then said this is not the only case the Bandra police have.“The police can investigate other cases until then,” he said.The court also reiterated its remarks made on the last hearing over the police’s action of invoking Indian Penal Code Section 124(A) for sedition in the case.“We anyways have serious reservations about invoking section 124(A) in this case,” Justice Shinde said.Merchant and Thakare told the court that despite an assurance given by the petitioner (Ranaut) that she would not post anything on her social media pertaining to this case, Ranaut posted several messages on Twitter, including one on the day she went to the police station.“She went to the extent of saying that she is being tortured,” Merchant said.The court said it would consider all these issues on January 25.The sisters in their plea have termed the magistrate’s order as “arbitrary and perverse”. Their petition said the magistrate passed the order without “proper application of mind”.The petition sought that the HC quash the magistrate’s order and the FIR lodged by the Bandra police.The plea also sought interim orders to the police to not take any coercive steps against the sisters and stay the summons issued to them.

11-01-2021||New Delhi||HC allows termination of 28-week pregnancy based on AIIMS board report||The Delhi High Court Monday allowed a woman’s plea to terminate her 28-week pregnancy after a medical board constituted by AIIMS said her fetus can be aborted as it suffered from anencephaly, a condition where the skull bone is not formed, and was therefore, incompatible with life.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh permitted the medical termination of the woman’s pregnancy based on the board’s report and disposed of her plea.The court said a detailed order would be issued soon.The bench on January 7 had asked the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to constitute a medical board to examine the woman and give a report by January 11 on the feasibility of terminating her pregnancy.According to the woman’s plea, “an ultra-sonography at the gestational age of 27 weeks 5 days found that the fetus suffered from anencephaly (skull bone not formed) thereby making it incompatible with life”.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971 prohibits abortion of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation. The woman had, therefore, also challenged the provisions of the statute which restrict abortions after 20 weeks.She had contended that with advances in technology it was perfectly safe for a woman to abort a fetus at any point during her pregnancy.She had also contended that determination of fetal abnormality in many cases can only be done after the 20th week and “by keeping the ceiling artificially low, women who obtain reports of serious fetal abnormality after the 20th week have to suffer excruciating pain and agony because of the deliveries that they are forced to go through”.“The ceiling of 20 weeks is therefore arbitrary, harsh, discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.” the petition had claimed.

The maximum temperature on Sunday was 16.2 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.Delhi has registered above-normal minimum temperatures since January 3 as a cloud cover persisted over the city under the influence of successive western disturbances.Delhi’s minimum temperature had settled at 7.8 degrees Celsius on Sunday, 10.8 degrees Celsius on Saturday, 9.6 degrees Celsius on Friday and 14.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday, the highest in January in four years, according to the IMD.The cloud cover over the national capital has prevented a steep decline in the minimum temperature so far, the official said.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.However, the minimum temperature has started declining with the commencement of northwesterly winds from snow-capped mountains towards the plains starting Saturday, the official said.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-minimum-temperature-dips-to-7-degrees-celsius-196913
11-01-2021||New York||Renowned writer Ved Mehta, who took India to Americans, dies at 86||Celebrated Indian-American novelist Ved Mehta, who overcame blindness and became widely known as the 20th-century writer most responsible for introducing American readers to India, has died at his home here at the age of 86.The New Yorker magazine, where he had been a staff writer for 33 years, reported that Mehta died on Saturday.“Mehta, a writer for The New Yorker for more than thirty years, died at the age of eighty-six, on Saturday morning,” it said on Sunday.Born in pre-partition Lahore to a well-off Punjabi family in 1934, Mehta lost his eyesight when he was three years old to meningitis. He, however, did not let his impairment get in the way of a flourishing career or stop him from showcasing his literary prowess to the world.He was determined to apprehend the world around him with maximal accuracy and to describe it as best he could.“I felt that blindness was a terrible impediment, and that if only I exerted myself, and did everything my big sisters and big brother did, I could somehow become exactly like them,” he wrote.Best known for his 12-volume memoir, which focused on the troubled modern history of India and his early struggles with blindness, Mehta’s 24 books included volumes of reportage on India, among them “Walking the Indian Streets” (1960), “Portrait of India” (1970) and “Mahatma Gandhi and His Apostles” (1977), as well as explorations of philosophy, theology and linguistics.“Daddyji” was the first installment in what was to become a 12-volume series of autobiographical works, known collectively as “Continents of Exile.”       “Ved Mehta has established himself as one of the magazine’s most imposing figures,” The New Yorker’s storied editor William Shawn, who hired him as a staff writer in 1961, told The New York Times in 1982.“He writes about serious matters without solemnity, about scholarly matters without pedantry, about abstruse matters without obscurity,” Shawn had said.The recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” in 1982, Mehta was long praised by critics for his forthright, luminous prose — with its “informal elegance, diamond clarity and hypnotic power,” as The Sunday Herald of Glasgow put it in a 2005 profile, the New York Times reported on Sunday.Mehta composed all of his work orally, dictating long swaths to an assistant, who read them back again and again for him to polish until the work shone like a mirror. He could rework a single article more than a hundred times, he often said, the report said.One of the most striking hallmarks of Mehta’s prose was its profusion of visual description: of the rich and varied landscapes he encountered, of the people he interviewed, of the cities he visited, the NYT report said.Mehta walked the streets of the city without a cane or a seeing-eye dog, and he bristled when someone dared try to assist him.Mehta came to the United States when he was 15 years old, and attended the Arkansas School for the Blind, in Little Rock. After studying at Pomona College and Oxford University, he began to flourish in his working life as a writer.He joined the magazine when he was 26 and, for more than three decades, wrote a stream of pieces, many of them appearing in multipart series. He wrote about Oxford dons, theology, Indian politics, and many other subjects.Madhur Jaffrey, the Indian-born actress and cookbook author, once told Maureen Dowd, of the New York Times, that when she first met Mehta, “I tried to take his arm” to help. “He gave me a shove, and we’ve been friends ever since”, the New Yorker reported.Some of his most fascinating work includes “A Battle Against the Bewitchment of Our Intelligence” (1961), a portrait of British intellectual life and the philosophical debates of the time; “John Is Easy to Please” (1971), a piece about the young linguist Noam Chomsky and the critics of his theory of transformational grammar; and, in 1976, a three-part Profile of Mahatma Gandhi, the report said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/renowned-writer-ved-mehta-who-took-india-to-americans-dies-at-86-196909

11-01-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court mustn’t mediate, won’t give in: Unions||Farm unions today resolved to continue their agitation for the repeal of farm laws and urged the Supreme Court not to become a “mediator” in the policy issue concerning farmers’ welfare.The unions chalked out an agitation plan in the run-up to Republic Day and said they would not use disruption and violence to make their point and never do anything to undermine the Tricolour.Terming the anti-farmer protest petition in the Supreme Court as “motivated”, the unions said they would seek its dismissal in the court.“Farmer unions have not petitioned the Supreme Court, nor has the government. Some persons have gone to the Supreme Court seeking removal of farmers from protest sites alleging the agitators are inconveniencing people, but that is not true. The petitions are clearly backed by the government and should be dismissed,” Yogendra Yadav, chief of Swaraj Abhiyan, which is part of the 'Samyukt Kisan Morcha', said.While they had no problems if the apex court decided to look into the constitutionality of farm laws, the Supreme Court should not get into mediation on a policy issue around whether the laws are good or bad for the farmers, Yadav said.“The Supreme Court, in two earlier petitions that sought a law to prevent farmers’ suicides and another to change drought-related policies, had refused to intervene. We hope the anti-farmer protest petition is also dismissed similarly. The Supreme Court should not try to get into a compromise-building exercise between us and the Centre,” Farmer leaders said.“Agitation is the only way forward. The farmers know this is their last fight and if they don’t struggle until victory there will be no farmers’ agitation in India for a long time to come. Farmers know this is a fight for dignity now, and the agitation will only end when we win,” they added.The unions’ resolution on Sunday night said there’s no going back from the path of agitation and this is a “fight to the finish”. It was decided to celebrate Lohri on January 13 even in states where the festival is not marked and burn copies of farm laws; serve food to commoners and build a public connect on Makar Sankranti on January 14; mark Mahila Kisan Divas on January 17 and 18 to mobilise women farmers across the country; take a pledge of struggle until victory on January 20; Guru Gobind Singh’s Parkash Utsav; and to mark Subhas Chandra Bose’s birthday on January 23.Yadav said farmer unions would unveil the Republic Day plan later. It would be peaceful and one that celebrates, rather than undermining Indian democracy, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-mustnt-mediate-wont-give-in-unions-196866

Kanta Katoch, wife of late Major KC Katoch, was refused special family pension after her husband’s death in 1989 while he was in service. Her petition for grant of pension was finally allowed in 2018 when the Armed Forces Tribunal finally directed the Central government to release the requisite pension. The Government of India thereafter implemented the decision and directed the office of Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (PCDA) at Allahabad to issue the Pension Payment Order (PPO) and release the entitled amount. The PPO was incorrectly sent to the Punjab National Bank in Ludhiana by the PCDA instead of the Defence Pension Disbursing Officer (DPDO) at Chandigarh, which was the designated pension disbursing authority for Kanta. The bank refused to acknowledge the PPO receipt and it was only after a contempt petition was filed that the bank leapt into motion and coordinated with the PCDA to send the PPO to the DPDO at Chandigarh. The DPDO, despite receiving the PPO thereafter, did not release pension. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/30-yrs-after-army-officers-death-wife-awaits-pension-196716

The CBDT frames policy for the Income Tax department.“The FAIUs have been created to bring focus on cases of undisclosed assets held abroad by Indians and black money stashed abroad. India is now getting voluminous data in this context by way of various fresh treaties signed and some of those, which have been re-negotiated in the recent past,” he said.The taxmen now have huge data coming in from various international and domestic sources to check possible illegal foreign assets holding of an individual and hence, a dedicated wing was required to analyse this information and sift through this mountain of data, the official said, adding that the new units would also be assigned to probe cases of Indian entities named in global tax document leaks like the Panama Papers.To focus on black money stashed abroad||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/special-units-in-i-t-dept-to-probe-undisclosed-foreign-assets-196718

In fact with the latest arrests by the Sri Lankan Navy on Sunday, the number of Indian fishermen in custody has crossed 50 as against 36 when Jaishankar had left for Colombo amid hopes that he would secure their release. A meeting of the India-Sri Lanka joint working group on fisheries had met in the run-up to Jaishankar’s Colombo visit, but it has apparently failed to resolve the issue. Fishermen from Tamil Nadu, who plan to go on strike, say the Sri Lankan Navy has also been seizing mechanised boats and damaging fishing nets as well besides not allowing them to be in the vicinity of Katchatheevu Island. The Katchatheevu Island along with the fishermens’ harassment has become a testing stone of India-Sri Lankan bilateral ties under the Modi government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/days-after-eam-visit-sri-lanka-arrests-more-fishermen-196720

There is no preliminary scientific evidence to show the death is linked to the vaccine trial. In-depth assessment is also underway,” Dr Samiran Panda, head of ICMR’s Epidemiology and Communicable Disease Division and chief ICMR scientist on the Covaxin project told The Tribune today.The scientist lamented that the “propensity to prejudge unfortunate events and link them to vaccine trials without scientific basis is growing.”“It bothers us that no one is asking scientific questions about whether the death had any causal link with the trial. We need to go by science. I for my part can say that Covaxin is absolutely and totally safe for anyone to use. I am also keenly awaiting a call to be administered the Covid vaccine shots,” Panda said.He made it clear that Covaxin was no back-up vaccine and was, like Covishield, safe to use in the inoculation drive. “The selection of vaccines in the national programme will depend on supplies and the government’s decision on which one to use and where,” he said.His remarks come days after AIIMS, New Delhi, chief Randeep Guleria called Covaxin a back-up shot and acclaimed vaccine researcher Gagandeep Kang said she would not take Covaxin until phase 3 efficacy data was available.Stages of vaccine trial||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-safe-no-standby-shot-top-icmr-scientist-196723

The Punjab Government had strongly protested when various Khasi interest groups — ranging from the insurgent group HNLC to the state government run by a coalition that includes BJP — tried to arm-twist the Dalit Sikhs living in Harijan Colony to vacate the area. The stand taken by Punjab Government to defend the hapless residents of Harijan Colony has not gone down well with the HYC and other Khasi parochial organisations which proliferate in Meghalaya.

The first set of PILs is by Congress MP from Trissur in Kerala TN Prathapan, DMK MP Tiruchi Siva, RJD MP Manoj Jha, Bhartiya Kisan Party and advocate ML Sharma.They have challenged the validity of the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They contended the farm laws were “discriminatory” and will expose marginal farmers to exploitation by big companies.Read also: Farmers ransack Khattar’s Kisan Mahapanchayat venueThe second set of petitions is by Rishabh Sharma and others highlighting the plight of commuters entering the national capital due to continued blockade by agitating farmers. On Saturday, he filed an affidavit in the top court complaining that the farmers have blocked Noida Chilla Border, Tikri Border, Sindhu Border, Gazipur Border, Delhi-Rohtak National Highway, causing hardships to those entering Delhi from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.Citing the top court’s verdict on Shaheen Bagh protests that said public places can’t be blocked and occupied indefinitely, he said the protesters must be removed as they violated the court’s verdict.The third set of plea is by the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA) -- a Hyderabad-based farmers’ organization – which contended that the reforms were beneficial for growth of agriculture in India.“We wish (to) submit that farm reforms are beneficial to enable increased income to farmers and growth of agriculture,” the consortium’s plea filed through CIFA advisor P Chengal Reddy said, demanding to be heard before any decision was taken.Noting that there was no improvement in talks between agitating farmers and the government, the Supreme Court on January 6 said it would take up petitions against farm laws and those against farmers’ protests on January 11. “There is absolutely no improvement in the situation,” CJI Bobde had said.A day later, the CJI had expressed concern over the possible spread of COVID-19 among the agitating farmers and asked the Centre if they were taking precautionary measures against the pandemic. “We are trying to ensure that COVID-19 doesn’t spread.

Experts fear that pandemic-driven online classes and limited access to internet and technology could be factors adding to dropout rates. --- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-impact-door-to-door-survey-to-enroll-students-relaxing-detention-norms-recommended-by-education-ministry-196533
