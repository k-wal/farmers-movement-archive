The disease is zoonotic.Releasing latest update on bird flu situation, the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying said bird flu cases have been confirmed in poultry in Latur, Parbhani, Nanded, Pune, Solapur, Yavatmal, Ahmednagar, Beed and Raigad districts of Maharashtra till Saturday.Unusual mortality of poultry has been found in a farm as per the report received from the Mumbai-based Central Poultry Development Organisation. The samples have been sent to the designated laboratory for testing, it said.Besides, bird flu in crow has been confirmed in Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh, in Surat, Navsari and Narmada districts of Gujarat as well as in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand and Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.Additionally in Delhi, Pigeon and brown fish owl in Najafgarh and Heron in Rohini have tested positive for avian influenza, the statement said.On culling operation in poultry, the ministry said it is underway in epicentres of Balod district, Chhattisgarh.Further in Madhya Pradesh also rapid response teams have been deployed. Culling operation of poultry is underway in the epicentre of Harda district, it added.According to the ministry, the central teams formed for monitoring the situation in the affected areas of the country are visiting the affected sites and conducting epistemological studies.On poultry sale and consumption, the ministry asked states to rethink their decisions to impose a ban on sale of poultry and poultry products and allow selling of poultry and poultry products sourced from the non-infected areas/states.“It is reiterated that consumption of well cooked chicken and eggs is safe for humans. Consumers should not heed to baseless rumours that are unscientific and often lead to confusion,” it said.These adversely affect poultry and egg markets and thereby poultry and maize farmers, who are already affected by the COVID 19 pandemic lockdown, it noted.Following the central government’s advisories, states are undertaking awareness generation activities through newspaper advertisements and social media platforms.Also, continued efforts to generate awareness about bird flu and how to deal with the situation are being shared among the general public through various media platforms, including social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook handles, the ministry added.

16-01-2021||New Delhi||Vaccination drive: Jab and job go hand in hand for doctors||Spending barely half-an-hour under mandatory observation after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine shot, Dr Sunny Kalra lost no time in going back to attending patients at BLK Super Speciality Hospital, this time with renewed confidence.Although happy to be vaccinated on the very first day of the world’s largest vaccination programme on Saturday, what really broadened Dr Kalra’s smile was the sense of relief that he saw on the faces of his patients.“My doctor is vaccinated. Hurray!’. It was that kind of sense of security and relief they had when I told them that I have just got inoculated and they are in safe hands. That is what made me realise how important it was for them as well,” said Dr Kalra, consultant Chest and Respiratory Diseases, BLK Super Speciality Hospital at Rajendra Place.“I am very confident that this assurance that we now have after getting the vaccine will motivate all health workers further to do their best for the patients,” he added.BLK Super Speciality, Max Hospital, Fortis Hospital, Apollo Hospital and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital are among the private hospitals chosen as the vaccination sites by the administration.Messages of congratulations, doctors posing with a victory sign for the media with their infectious smiles—visible even under the cover of mask—and the many ‘just got jabbed’ selfie by the health workers, it was a rare and happy day at the BLK hospital, which has witnessed many dreary days in the past due to the ongoing pandemic.“I was already motivated enough, and then the PM’s speech on TV which I saw just moments before I was getting inoculated also helped. I had a good sleep last night when they (the hospital administration) told me that I will be inoculated today.“I had a good breakfast and now I look forward to a fulfilling day,” said Dr Sandeep Nayar, senior director and head of department, Chest and Respiratory Diseases, who was the first one to be vaccinated at the hospital.“There is no local or systemic reaction. I am as healthy as before. Also, I am happy that as an HOD I could lead by example and hope there won’t be any doubts in the mind of others regarding the vaccine now,” said a visibly calm and relieved Dr Nayar.Though there was no apprehension whatsoever in the mind of doctors and healthcare workers, the same can’t be said for the families waiting back home with bated breath.Dr Kalra, whose phone kept buzzing with messages from his family members asking ‘if he is doing fine’, said it only stopped after he sent his photo on the family whatsapp group telling “it (vaccine) is done and I am doing absolutely fine”.“There will always be those two or three members in your family who are worried about things. It was the same in my case as well. I, as a doctor, was always confident.“Now, when they know I am doing fine, they are also feeling relaxed. It will help them to prepare for themselves when the time comes—which I am sure will be sooner enough,” said the 39-year-old.According to the hospital, the whole staff, which consists of approximately 3,000 people, will be vaccinated in another 10-12 days. The hospital administered Oxford’s Covishield for the vaccination drive on Saturday.The Delhi government has received 2.74 lakh doses of the vaccine so far from the Centre which would be sufficient for 1.2 lakh health workers.There are a total of 2.4 lakh health workers in the national capital and more vaccine doses are expected to arrive soon, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Wednesday.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive and asserted that the made-in-India vaccines being rolled out will ensure a “decisive victory” for the country over the coronavirus pandemic.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also urged people not to believe in rumours and listen to experts who say COVID-19 vaccines are safe.“I have interacted with those vaccinated. No one has any problem. All are happy that they will get rid of coronavirus,” the chief minister said at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital where he inspected the vaccination drive.The vaccination exercise was conducted at 81 sites across all 11 districts in Delhi. Six central government hospitals—AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital, Kalawati Saran Children Hospital and two ESI hospitals—are also part of the drive.

16-01-2021||New Delhi||Nepal never accepts interference in domestic politics: Foreign Minister Gyawali||Nepal does not accept interference in its domestic politics as it is capable of handling its internal problems, Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said on Saturday, in comments that came against the backdrop of China wading into the political turmoil in the Himalayan nation following the dissolution of its parliament.Gyawali’s assertion came at a media interaction when asked about China’s attempt to play a role in the aftermath of fast-paced political developments in Nepal last month.“We never accept interference in our domestic politics. We are able to settle our own problems. As a close neighbour, there may be some concerns or questions but we never accept interference,” the Nepalese foreign minister said.Nepal plunged into a political turmoil following Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli’s sudden decision to dissolve parliament and call for fresh elections in view of internal feud in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).As the crisis deepened, China rushed a high-level team headed by Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou to Kathmandu to hold talks with the rival factions within the NCP after the Chinese ambassador in the country failed to sort out differences.The team held talks with almost all top Nepalese leaders but had to return empty handed. The Chinese meddling in Nepalese political developments triggered strong criticism within Nepal.Gyawali said Nepal’s relations with both India and China are excellent and that it never compares ties with each other.Asked about the political crisis and role of NCP leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal who is popularly known as Prachanda, Gyawali refused to make any direct comment and said as foreign minister of the country, he represents everyone in Nepal.At the same time, the Nepalese foreign minister justified Oli’s decision to dissolve parliament saying he followed the democratic principle of seeking fresh mandate from the people whose decisions are supreme in a democracy.“In democracy, people are the final authority to decide about who will govern. I think dissolution of the parliament is a reflection of the internal issue. It is not wise to blame anybody,” Gyawali said.“Prime Minister Oli thought that time has come to seek a fresh mandate in line with universally accepted practice of seeking people’s views,” the Nepalese foreign minister said.Asked about the boundary row between Nepal and India, Gyawali said both the countries have common commitment to resolve the issue.“We have the common commitment to resolve it. The sanctity and security of the border is extremely important for expanding the overall developmental cooperation... We both have realised the urgency (to resolve the border issue),” he said.Ties between India and Nepal came under severe strain after Nepal last year published a new political map that showed three Indian territories - Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh - as part of Nepal.When asked about India’s assertion that the areas were its part, Gyawali said that “historical documents speak the reality”, in an indication that they belonged to Nepal.“We can sit together with mutual trust to find a solution,” he said. Gyawali, accompanied by Nepalese Foreign Secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal, arrived here on Thursday on a three-day visit.On Friday, Gyawali held wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar covering the entire expanse of bilateral ties.In the interaction, he also batted for an early review of the Indo-Nepal Peace and Friendship treaty of 1950 and flagged concerns over his country’s increasing trade deficit with India.Asked whether Nepal was looking to procure coronavirus vaccine from both India and China, Gyawali said the supply of vaccines should be viewed as global public good and that scientific aspects should determine decision making and not political judgement.He said affordability, availability and promptness in supply as well as compatible infrastructure to store the vaccines in Nepal will determine its decisions on their procurement.In their talks on Friday, Jaishankar and Gyawali held a comprehensive review of all aspects of bilateral ties including border management, connectivity, trade, power, oil and gas, water resources, capacity building and tourism among others.It was the first high-level engagement between the two sides after relations nosedived following the boundary row.

Both the purpose for which it has been created as well as the way it has been administered have left a number of questions unanswered," they said in the letter."It is essential that the position and stature of the Prime Minister is kept intact by ensuring total transparency in all dealings the Prime Minister is associated with," they said.The letter was signed by former IAS officers Anita Agnihotri, S P Ambrose, Sharad Behar, Sajjad Hassan, Harsh Mander, P Joy Oommen, Aruna Roy, former diplomats Madhu Bhaduri, K P Fabian, Deb Mukharji, Sujatha Singh and former IPS officers A S Dulat, P G J Nampoothiri and Julio Ribeiro among others.In March last year, the Centre set up the Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) Fund with the primary objective to deal with any kind of emergency situation like the one currently posed by the COVID-19 outbreak and provide relief to those affected. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/100-former-civil-servants-raise-questions-over-transparency-in-pm-cares-fund-199398

Due to this updated policy, the users will now have to compulsorily share all the information that WhatsApp collects, which includes information about the user’s activity on their services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, it pointed out.WhatsApp has already announced delaying by three months the implementation of its new privacy policy that has caused concerns among millions of its users, many of whom started to move to its rivals such as Signal and Telegram. It was originally scheduled to come into effect on February 8.The petitioner accused the Centre of failing to discharge its constitutional duty of protecting the privacy rights of citizens. Citizen’s personal data is being collected by a foreign entity and is being transferred outside the country, it alleged.“Centre failed to impose necessary and restrictive conditions in the instant case, though on the proposed policy of WhatsApp, European Union’s Antitrust Authority had imposed serious restrictions and fines of 110 million euros in 2017,” read the CAIT petition.In 20 16, Germany, the UK and the entire European Union had prohibited similar action of Facebook which was also asked to delete all the data relating to Whatsapp users, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-seeks-protection-of-citizens-right-to-privacy-from-whatsapp-facebook-199392
16-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmer union in SC: Remove remaining members of panel on agri laws, select new people||A farmer union requested the Supreme Court on Saturday to remove the remaining three members of the committee it had set up to resolve the impasse over the three contentious farm laws, and select people who can do the job “on the basis of mutual harmony”.The Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti said the principle of natural justice is going to be violated as those appointed to the four-member committee “have already supported these laws”.In an affidavit, it also sought dismissal of a plea of the central government, filed though the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor march or any other kind of protest by farmers which seeks to disrupt the gathering and celebrations of Republic Day on January 26.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde had agreed to hear on January 18 the Centre’s application against the proposed tractor march.The Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti is one of the 40-odd farmer unions spearheading the agitation on various border points of Delhi for about 50 days now, demanding repeal of the farm laws.In an “extraordinary” interim order, the top court had stayed the implementation of the new farm laws till further orders and had constituted the four-member committee to listen to the grievances and make recommendations to resolve the impasse.The committee comprised Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union; Dr Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana.However, on January 14, Mann recused himself from the committee.The Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti, in its reply filed through lawyer A P Singh, urged the top court “to remove all these three members from the committee and appoint those persons who make the report on the basis of mutual harmony....”“It is important to mention here with great regret that the principle of natural justice is going to be violated by making these persons as members of the committee.... how they will hear all farmers on equal parameters when they have already supported these laws,” it said.On the issue of the Delhi Police seeking injunction against the tractor rally, it said prohibitory orders under CrPC Section 144 were already in place in the New Delhi area.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws—the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.Enacted in September 2020, the government has presented these laws as major farm reforms aimed at increasing farmers’ income, but the protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the minimum support price (MSP) and “mandi” (wholesale market) systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and has ruled out a repeal of the laws.

Covid ke viruddh humey pratirodhak shamta deti hai (Vaccines developed in India are safe and effective. They will provide immunity against COVID-19),” it said.The caller tune also urges people to trust the vaccine and not believe in rumours.“Bhartiya vaccine par bharosa Karen. Apni baari aane par vaccine zarur lagwayein. Afawaon par bharosa na kare (Have trust in the vaccines made in India and do get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Do not believe in rumours),” the new caller tune added.The new caller tune talks about the vaccination drive, asking people to continue to follow COVID-19-appropriate behaviours such as wearing mask, maintaining social distance and washing hands, even after taking the vaccine.The earlier caller tune, in the voice of Bachchan, began with a coughing sound, followed by a cautionary note on COVID-19-appropriate behaviours.“Covid-19 se pura desh hi nahi pura vishwa ladd raha hai (Not just India, but the entire world is battling against Covid-19),” the voice said.After this, Bachchan would further elaborate on the importance of Covid-appropriate behaviour like frequently washing hands, wearing mask and maintaining social distancing to avoid spread of the deadly virus.Recently, a PIL was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the Centre to remove megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s voice from the caller tune on precautions against the coronavirus on the grounds that he himself, along with some family members, had been infected with the virus.Healthcare workers at the frontline of India’s COVID-19 battle got their first jabs on Saturday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching the world’s largest vaccination drive against the pandemic.

On the basis of the complaint, another FIR was lodged against Rathore on Friday evening, he said.Some other boys have also come forward alleging that they were sexually assaulted by the accused. Efforts are being made to seek Rathore's police remand for the recovery of more videos, he added.Earlier, the police had found 15 to 20 videos on Rathore's laptop, DVD and hard disc in which he is seen sexually exploiting children. Nine more victims---seven minors and two women---were identified on the basis of these videos.The SP said the stringent National Security Act (NSA) could also be invoked against Rathore, the former vice-president of the BJP's Konch unit.Directives in this regard have already been received from the state government, he said.Under the NSA, a person can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that he or she is a threat to national security or law and order.Imran Khan, Station House Officer (SHO) of Konch police station, said during interrogation, Rathore admitted to having sexually exploited two women, who have been contacted.Though the women have spoken to the police about what happened, they have refused to record a statement citing their married life. The police are in touch with them, he said.The police said efforts are on to record statements of six-seven other children who were identified on the basis of the recovered videos.On Thursday, Khan had said Rathore would lure young children by giving them money and made their obscene videos which he used to blackmail them.Meanwhile, district BJP president Ramendra Singh said the party is trying to ascertain how Rathore was appointed as the Konch unit vice president.Rathore was expelled from the primary membership of the party soon after his arrest, Ramendra Singh said.Now the senior leadership is trying to ascertain why or on whose recommendation he was appointed as the vice president of the Konch unit, he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-fresh-fir-against-ex-bjp-functionary-after-another-boy-comes-forward-to-report-sexual-abuse-199365

However, the clinical efficacy of the vaccine was yet to be established and it was still being studied in phase 3 clinical trials, the vaccine maker said.“Hence it is important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to COVID-19 need not be followed,” the consent form said.According to an industry expert, the company is liable to pay compensation to people in case of serious side effects as the vaccine is being administered while in the clinical trial mode.The central licensing authority has granted permission for the sale or distribution of Covaxin for restricted use in emergency situations in public interest as an abundant caution, in clinical trial mode.Meanwhile, Suchitra Ella, joint managing director, Bharat Biotech International Limited, on her Twitter account said: “Covaxin & Bharat Biotech is truly humbled & honoured to be of service to the nation & the fraternity of all first responders of covid who have served public health.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-biotech-to-pay-compensation-if-covaxin-causes-side-effects-199362

Pandemic No one had thought that with the onset of the pandemic, celebrating festivals such as Holi, Eid and Diwali will be without much fanfare (dhoomdhaam). No one had imagined that trains will come to a halt, and schools and markets will remain closed. However, the good thing was that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, efforts to deal with the crisis started with courage and understanding (of the issue)," he said.He added that the biggest challenge at the time of the pandemic was testing."There were barely two laboratories, but today there are over 1,000 laboratories. There was a shortage of masks, ventilators and PPE kits. But the swiftness and understanding of the issue which India displayed, masks, PPE kits and ventilators are now being exported. This has been done in 4-6 months," Singh said.Hailing the doctors and healthcare workers, he said, "Had our doctors, para-medical staff, whom we know as warriors, not take the risk, we could not have fought the challenge. It is for this reason that doctors are considered as the second God on earth. The threat of COVID-19 was on doctors, para-medical staff, sanitation workers. They stayed away from their families, ate food outside their homes, and then left for the hospital. These warriors have rendered charismatic performance. The doctors, para-medical staff, sanitation workers have worked as frontline soldiers and I salute their commitment and dedication."He also informed that besides the two indigenous anti-COVID vaccines used in the nationwide vaccination drive that began on Saturday, four more vaccines are coming soon."These vaccines will not only be administered to people in India, but will also be exported to other countries. Because, India does not think about itself alone, but is also concerned about the entire world. Seers here gave the message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam—the whole world is a family. Since the Vedic era, the medical treatment system here has not only thought about human beings, but also of other creatures. During the reign of Ashoka, there were provisions for treatment of cows, buffaloes, cats and bats."Army chief General MM Naravane and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were also present at the programme. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-army-has-boosted-countrys-morale-during-border-standoff-with-china-rajnath-199361

Our term has already come to an end,” Dave had written to SCBA members, without elaborating on the events he was referring to.The current crisis in the SCBA got further complicated on Saturday after all the three members of its Election Committee---senior advocate Jaideep Gupta and the other two members Harin P Raval and Nakul Dewan---resigned.The SCBA Executive Committee had on December 4 last constituted the election committee headed by Gupta to hold the polls in the second week of January.In a letter to SCBA Acting Secretary Rohit Pandey, however, the poll panel members said they had decided to hold the election on a digital platform and entered into discussions with NSDL---a digital firm---to hold elections.The draft agreement with NSDL and the estimated expenses for holding the polls digitally was sent to the Executive Committee of the SCBA on January 14."We have received a resolution, taking certain decisions, passed by the executive committee on January 14. We consider these events as a 'REFUSAL' by the executive committee of the SCBA to carry out our directions which in terms of Rule 17A of the Rules of the SCBA are final and binding," the panel members said, adding it was not possible for them to continue to discharge their duties and hold the elections.Singh said the decision to hold elections virtually through NSDL had already been approved by the SCBA. Alleging that there was an attempt to defer the SCBA elections, he sought the CJI’s intervention through his letter to the SC Secretary General.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/constitute-bench-to-resolve-scba-stalemate-senior-advocate-requests-cji-199360

Covaxin manufactured by Bharat Biotech is being preferred in our hospital over Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute,” the letter stated.Also read: Bharat Biotech to pay compensation if Covaxin causes side effects“The residents are a bit apprehensive about the lack of complete trial in case of Covaxin and might not participate in huge numbers, thus defeating the purpose of vaccination. We request you to vaccinate us with Covishield, which has completed all stages of trial before its rollout,” the letter further stated.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive and asserted that the made-in-India vaccines being rolled out would ensure a “decisive victory” for the country over the coronavirus pandemic.In the national capital, the vaccination exercise will be carried out at 81 sites across all its 11 districts.At the RML hospital, a security guard was the first one to receive the shot.Six Central Government hospitals — AIIMS, Safdarjung, RML, Kalawati Saran Children Hospital and two ESI hospitals — have been chosen as sites for the drive. Besides these, Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, Delhi-government run GTB Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, DDU Hospital, BSA Hospital, Delhi State Cancer Institute, ILBS Hospital are among the vaccination sites.Private facilities — Max Hospital, Fortis Hospital, Apollo Hospital and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital — have also been chosen as sites for the exercise.According to the government, the shots will be offered first to an estimated one crore health-care workers and around two crore frontline workers, and then to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities.The cost of vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers will be borne by the Central Government.

16-01-2021||New Delhi||All you need to know about India's 2 Covid vaccines||Amid the rollout of the world's largest Covid-19 vaccination programme by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, here are a few things that you need to know about the two vaccines—'Covaxin' and 'Covishield'—selected by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).So far, the government has procured 1.1 crore Covishield and 55 lakh Covaxin vaccines at a cost of Rs 200 and Rs 206 per dose, respectively.Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, is the country's first indigenous vaccine against the virus, and it has been developed with the help of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology.Covaxin uses an inactivated form of the coronavirus. It destroys the ability of the virus to multiply in the human body and increases the immunity system to fight the virus.The adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) of Covaxin include injection site pain, swelling, headache, fatigue, fever, body ache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, among others.On the other hand, the Oxford University and AstraZeneca have developed Covishield, which has been manufactured by Serum Institute of India in Pune.Covishield is stored and transported at a refrigeration temperature of 2-8 degree Celsius. The vaccine has shown an average efficacy of 70.4 per cent in a pooled analysis of interim data from late-stage trials published in The Lancet.The vaccine is made by taking a common cold virus called an adenovirus from chimpanzees and deleting about 20 per cent of the virus's instructions. It also follows the genetic instructions programmed into it by its developers to successfully provoke a strong immune response.For Covishield, possible adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) are injection site tenderness, headache, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, pyrexia, chills and arthralgia, and nausea.Currently, India is banking on two vaccines and four more in the pipeline to be rolled out in the country, according to Prime Minister Modi. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-you-need-to-know-about-indias-2-covid-vaccines-199348

16-01-2021||Nagpur||Army officer develops first indigenous 9 mm 'machine pistol'||Nagpur-based Indian Army officer Lt Col Prasad Bansod has developed the country's first indigenous 9 mm 'Machine Pistol', an official said here on Saturday.Working with the Infantry School, Mhow (Madhya Pradesh), Bansod, 39, developed the pistol in a record four months with assistance from ARDE, Pune.Named 'ASMI'—symbolising pride and self-respect—the machine pistol's empty weight is less than 2 kgs, and it costs less than Rs 50,000.Unlike the conventional pistols which can fire only one round at a time, 'ASMI' can also fire in a machine-mode its entire load of 33 rounds in one shot, almost like a mini-machine gun, explained the official.Sporting an upper receiver made from aircraft-grade aluminium and lower receiver of carbon fibre, the pistol has been manufactured through 3D printing process including trigger components made by 3D metal printing.The barrel is 8 inches long with 33 rounds of high-capacity magazine and the weapon fires the in-service 9 mm ammunition."The weapon has a huge potential in the armed forces as a personal weapon for commanders, tank and aircraft crew, radio-radar operators, other categories of security workers, besides VVIP protection and policing duties and in the civilian domain," said the official.Officials are optimistic that Bansod's 'ASMI' is likely to find huge employability within the central and state police organisations, besides a huge export potential as the production cost would be well under Rs 50,000 per weapon. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-officer-develops-first-indigenous-9-mm-machine-pistol-199337

I had asked her if she would be associated with the book for forward, there was no talk of the film then. But we didn't receive any reply from her."Whatever she is saying about the story is available only in my book only. She could have asked me if she wants to do a film based on my book, but she didn't approach me," Kaul told PTI.When he took the matter with Ranaut and the film's producer, they denied that they are using his story for the movie, he said, adding that he will be seeking legal counsel to "protect my rights"."I will do whatever it takes to protect my rights and consult legal experts in coming days," he said.When contacted, Ranaut and Jain were not available for a comment."Manikarnika Returns: The Legend of Didda" is scheduled to go on floors in January 2022. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/author-of-diddas-biography-accuses-kangana-ranaut-of-copyright-violation-over-new-film-199323
16-01-2021||New Delhi||All 3 members of poll panel for Supreme Court bar association’s election resign||All three members of the election committee, set up to conduct the polls for the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) this year, have resigned.The chairman of the Election Committee for the SCBA Elections 2020-2021 was senior advocate Jaideep Gupta and the other two members were Harin P Raval and Nakul Dewan.In a joint letter to SCBA Acting Secretary Rohit Pandey, the election committee members said they had decided to hold the election on a digital platform and entered into discussions with NSDL, a digital firm, to conduct the polls.The letter stated that the draft agreement entered with NSDL and the estimated cost of expenses for holding the polls digitally was sent to the executive committee of the SCBA on January 14."We have received a resolution, taking certain decisions, passed by the executive committee on January 14. We consider these events as a 'REFUSAL' by the executive committee of the SCBA to carry out our directions which in terms of Rule 17A of the Rules of the SCBA are final and binding," the panel members stated.They said it was not possible for them to continue to discharge their duties as members of the panel to hold elections.The Executive Committee of SCBA on December 4 last year had decided to constitute the election committee headed by senior advocate Jaideep Gupta to hold the polls in the second week of January.Some of the bar association leaders were opposed to virtual election and want a hybrid system where lawyers are allowed to cast votes through both physical and virtual modes.SCBA president Dushyant Dave had resigned from his post with immediate effect on Thursday saying he had forfeited his right to continue.The SCBA holds elections annually for selecting its members to the executive committee.

We risked our lives and were pained to see so many deaths every day. It is a relief that we have a vaccine against coronavirus now,” Tomy told PTI.As she stepped out 30 minutes after being administered the vaccine, her colleagues greeted her with loud cheers and applause.The hospital staff cheered other beneficiaries too.In Delhi, every person will be kept under observation for 30 minutes after the immunisation to watch for any side-effects of the vaccine, according to authorities.Central District Programme Officer Puneet Jaitley was the second person to get the shot at LNJP.“It’s been 30 minutes since I was administered the vaccine and I feel absolutely fine,” he said.“I feel perfectly normal after the vaccination. Drawing blood from veins hurts more,” said Naveen Kumar from LNJP Hospital’s administration department who also took the jab.Sandeep Nayar, head of Department of Respiratory Medicine at BLK Super Speciality Hospital, was the first one to get the shot at the facility.India has granted emergency use authorisation to two vaccines — Oxford’s Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute in India, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive and asserted that the made-in-India vaccines being rolled out will ensure a “decisive victory” for the country over the coronavirus pandemic.The vaccination exercise will span 81 sites across all 11 districts in Delhi.

It brings me great pride that #COVISHIELD is part of this historic effort & to endorse it’s safety & efficacy, I join our health workers in taking the vaccine myself. pic.twitter.com/X7sNxjQBN6  “Do not fall for propaganda, rumours and misinformation. Indian vaccine scientists, our medical system and rigour has respect and credibility in the world. We have earned this credibility with our track record,” the Prime Minister said. “The country has awaited this day eagerly for months. Everyone wanted to know when the COVID vaccine will come. The vaccine is here and in a very short time,” he added.“Today, a grateful nation returns that favour and repays that loan by ensuring that health-care workers get the first shots,” Modi said while kicking off one-of-a-kind vaccine drive in human history.Detailing its scale, the Prime Minister while over a hundred countries had a population of less than three crore, India aimed to cover three crore people in the first phase of the inoculation.“Never has such a scale of vaccination been run ever in history. You can imagine the scale from the first phase. More than hundred nations have less than three crore population and india is vaccinating three crore in phase one,” Modi said.“Do not make the mistake of taking one shot and forgetting another. There will be a 28-day gap. You must remember that two weeks after the second dose, you will get the necessary protection from COVID. Don’t become casual affer the jab,” he reiterated.The Prime Minister also said only three nations — India, China and the US — have a population of more than 30 crore, a number India will target in the first two phases of the vaccination, which will cover one crore health workers and two crore frontline workers in the first phase, and 27 crore 50-plus people and under 50-years category with co-morbid conditions.The Prime Minister asked people to take the benefit of the vaccines saying the world trusted Indian scientific rigour.“Today the scientists, and those associated with the vaccine deserve our special gratitude as they were engaged in vaccine development day in and day not through festivals,” Modi said. “This trust will be strengthened further as we conduct the COVID-19 drive, a process that will take a long year, but we just show the same self-confidence and self-reliance through the inoculation drive as we showed during our fight against the pandemic last year,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, quoting national poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar “maanavvl jan zor lagaata hai, pathar paani ban jaata hai”.To boost confidence among the countrymen about the vaccine, the Prime Minister also cited Telegu legend Apparao, who had said a nation was built on people and not bricks.“We must give back to society,” the PM said.After he launched the drive, New Delhi AIIMS kicked off the process by inoculating sanitation worker Manish, followed by Nursing Officer Dhawal Dwivedi, institute Director Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog Member (Health)VK Paul.Simultaneously, the drive rolled out across the country at 3,006 chosen locations — where 100 beneficiaries each will be covered today — taking the total number of vaccinated to three lakh by this evening, if all the three lakh registered Heath workers turn up to take their shots.Modi said scientists and experts had given permission for emergency use of the made-in-India vaccines only after being absolutely sure of their safety and the people should be aware of any propaganda and rumours.The made-in-India vaccines would ensure a “decisive victory” for the country over the coronavirus pandemic, he asserted.The process is voluntary.The first shot to be administered today was the indigenously made Bharat Biotech-ICMR’s COVAXIN.Earlier, the Prime Minister recalled the dark days following the pandemic outbreak and said: “Today, I am remembering the days when everyone wanted to do something but did not have a way. Children had to live apart from mothers. Mothers cried and couldn’t do anything. Many elders were battling the disease all by themselves. We could not even see off the departed in traditional ritualistic ways.”“The more we think of those days the more anguished we feel. But friends, in that same atmosphere of crisis, someone was weaving webs of hope. Someone was putting their lives at risk for our safety — our doctors, nurses, parade coal staff, Asha workers, ambulance drivers and sarai Karamcharis.  They gave their role of service to society a priority — they stayed apart from families, did not go home for days. Several friends never came back home. This is why the society is repaying its loan and gratitude by giving the first doses to health workers today. COVID-19 vaccines are a tribute of a grateful nation to health workers,” the Prime Minister said teary eyed.While all 100 beneficiaries at New Delhi AIIMS are being given COVAXIN shots, the 100 beneficiaries being vaccinated at PGI, Chandigarh, are being adminstered Covishield.States have been given both vaccines and the choice of allocation to session sites has been left to the states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-launches-covid-vaccine-drive-aiims-sanitation-worker-first-to-get-indigenous-covaxin-shot-199312

16-01-2021||United Nations||At 18 million, India has largest diaspora in the world: UN||The Indian diaspora, one of the most “vibrant and dynamic”, is the largest in the world, with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland in 2020, the UN has said.The United Arab Emirates, the US and Saudi Arabia host the largest numbers of migrants from India, it said.“India has the largest transnational population in the world. It has the most migrants abroad - 18 million, which is a significant number and another feature which is very interesting about the Indian migrant population is that they're really distributed all over the globe,” Population Affairs Officer in the Population Division at UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) Clare Menozzi told PTI in an interview on Friday.Menozzi said while some transnational populations are really clustered in one country or region, the Indian diaspora is present in all continents and regions - from the Gulf to Northern America to Australia, UK.“It's a very vibrant” and dynamic diaspora in the world, she said.The report, ‘International Migration 2020 Highlights’, by the Population Division of UN DESA, released on Friday said in 2020, 18 million people from India were living outside of their country of birth.Other countries with a large diaspora included Mexico and Russia (11 million each), China (10 million) and Syria (8 million).The report said India's large diaspora is distributed across a number of major countries of destination, with the UAE (3.5 million), the US (2.7 million) and Saudi Arabia (2.5 million) hosting the largest numbers of migrants from India.Other countries hosting large numbers of migrants from India included Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar and the UK.Between 2000 and 2020, the size of the migrant population abroad grew for nearly all countries and areas of the world. India experienced the largest gain during that period at nearly 10 million, followed in order of magnitude by Syria, Venezuela, China and the Philippines.Migration from India is largely motivated by labour and family reasons, Director of Population Division at UN DESA John Wilmoth told reporters at the launch of the report here, adding that forced displacement is a much smaller category (about 10 per cent) in the total.Menozzi said the Indian diaspora is comprised predominantly of people who are working, but also students and people who moved for family reasons.She said there is a very large presence of migrants who are born in India, in the Gulf countries where they are playing a central role in the economic prosperity of the countries, working in construction, hospitality and care services. The diverse Indian diaspora also includes highly-skilled scientists, engineers and doctors.The US remained by far the largest country of destination of international migrants with 51 million migrants in 2020, equal to 18 per cent of the world's total. Germany hosted the second largest number of migrants worldwide at around 16 million, followed by Saudi Arabia (13 million), Russia (12 million) and the UK (9 million).The report said preliminary estimates suggested that COVID-19 pandemic might have slowed the growth in the stock of international migrants by around two million by mid-2020, 27 per cent less than the growth expected since mid-2019.The report said growth in the number of international migrants has been robust over the last two decades, reaching 281 million people living outside their country of origin in 2020, up from 173 million in 2000 and 221 million in 2010. Currently, international migrants represent about 3.6 per cent of the world's population.Between 2000 and 2020, the number of migrants grew in 179 countries or areas. Germany, Spain, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the US gained the largest number of migrants during that period. By contrast, in 53 countries or areas, the number of international migrants declined between 2000 and 2020. Armenia, India, Pakistan, Ukraine and Tanzania were among the countries that experienced the most pronounced declines.In many cases, the declines resulted from the old age of the migrant populations or the return of refugees and asylum seekers to their countries of origin.In terms of regional migration corridors, between 2000 and 2020, some regional migration corridors grew very rapidly. The corridor Central and Southern Asia to Northern Africa and Western Asia grew the most, with 13 million migrants added between 2000 and 2020; more than tripling in size."The majority of that increase resulted from labour migration from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka to the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),” the report said.It noted that while it is too soon to understand the full extent, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 may have slowed the growth of this regional migration corridor. In many GCC countries, thousands of migrant workers in the construction, hospitality, retail and transportation sectors lost their jobs due to the pandemic and were required to return home.The report said according to World Bank projections, the COVID-19 pandemic may reduce the volume of remittances sent to low-and middle-income countries from USD 548 billion in 2019 to USD 470 billion in 2021, a decline of 14 per cent.Menozzi said India is the main country of recipient of remittances worldwide and in 2019 received USD 83 billion in remittances from its diaspora. The World Bank projects that in 2020, the amount will decline by around 9 per cent to about USD 76 billion.

16-01-2021||New Delhi||BJP Chief Ministers are least popular, says survey||Seven out of the 10 most popular Chief Ministers are from the Opposition parties while seven out of the 10 worst performing Chief Ministers are from the BJP/NDA camp, as per the IANS C-Voter State of the Nation 2021 survey.As per the survey, BJP Chief Ministers are the least popular currently. In all BJP/NDA ruled states, the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is several notches higher than the popularity of the BJP Chief Ministers.Non-Congress Chief Ministers are at times relatively at par or slightly more popular than Modi within their respective states. However, even the worst performing BJP/NDA Chief Ministers are more popular than Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in their respective states.Rahul Gandhi’s leadership seems to be more of a liability rather than an asset for the Congress. All Congress CM faces are way more popular than their central leadership. The Congress is unable to emerge as the fulcrum of the Opposition.Among the poll-bound states, the Chief Ministers of Kerala, West Bengal and Assam have scored way better than the national average, thus indicating a pro-incumbency sentiment in these states as far as Chief Minister candidates are concerned. The Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are among the bottom lot as far as satisfaction ratings are concerned, indicating anti-incumbency sentiments brewing up in these states, the survey found.Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik is the most popular chief minister in the country, followed closely by Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi and YS Jaganmohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh.On the other end of the spectrum is Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, arguably the least popular Chief Minister in India followed closely by Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh with the lowest satisfaction ratings in their respective states.Out of those surveyed, 11 Chief Ministers scored higher than the all-India average (42.8) nett approval ratings. Odisha, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh have the most popular leaders while 11 Chief Ministers score below the national average.By this metric, Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand have the three least popular Chief Ministers in the country. Three large states governed by the BJP or its allies score below the national average — Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar.The Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and West Bengal are doing better than the national average. It would be an overreach to read too much into the CM ratings as leaders often lag the unpopularity of their governments or legislators. Nevertheless, it is an important framework to view the state of politics in the country.Among the smaller and middle sized states, Haryana, Kerala and Punjab are lacklustres for PM Modi. Punjab in particular is the only state in the country to return a negative nett approval for Modi. Perhaps a consequence of the ongoing farmers’ protests.The Chief Ministers of Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have a higher nett approval rating than the Prime Minister within their respective states.Out of these states, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu are states where the BJP is eyeing expansion. The BJP/NDA’s primary vote catcher is Modi but if his charisma stalls in these states, then future gains may be limited.On the flipside, the Opposition’s universe is limited to these non-Congress dominated states. In other words, the Congress is currently unable to mount an effective opposition to the ruling party and any worthwhile opposition comes from the non-Congress leadership.This state of affairs is best reflected in the nett ratings of Rahul Gandhi and the respective state Chief Ministers. Rahul Gandhi is uniformly rated in the negative either vis-a-vis his party CMs or the others. Therefore, Modi’s relative unpopularity against some Chief Ministers is not benefiting Rahul Gandhi in any way.Maharashtra, due its high index of opposition unity, is slipping away from the grasp of the NDA. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is very popular on account of joint support from the Shiv Sena, Congress and the NCP.The next best is Chhattisgarh where CM Bhupesh Baghel is able to hold fort at a nett approval rating of 1. Jharkhand and Rajasthan are witnessing their usual cycle of anti-incumbency and the NDA may notch some electoral gains based on the relative popularity of Modi. The prospects of the Congress-led Opposition are mixed at best, even after the recent setbacks suffered by the government.The Chief Ministers of the states who are not aligned to either national parties are doing really well. Only Telangana Chief Minister is relatively less popular than Modi in his state.The Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi, Odisha and West Bengal are relatively more popular than Modi.The inherent message is twofold: First, the BJP finds it difficult to unseat non-Congress regional leaders; and second, the Congress has failed to gravitate anti-BJP or even non-BJP vote towards itself.Hence, it can be concluded that an effective future challenge to the BJP will have to take into account the rejection of Congress’ centrality to opposition leadership.The survey was carried out among over 30,000 respondents across the country.

16-01-2021||Mona||40 women who join hands to organise a two-day Indo-Pak Peace Summit||Forty women come together to collaborate in an effort to build peace in South Asia. Names like Dr Scilla Elworthy – the three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee from the UK, Dr Meenakshi Gopinath, political scientist and a Padma Shri awardee from India, Moni Mohsin, columnist and bestselling novelist from Pakistan, and Radhya Almutawakel, human-rights defender from Yemen are four of the forty women who gather virtually at the Indo-Pak Peace Summit Led by Women in their effort to bring stability and prosperity.These are the women who have been building bridges for an inclusive future. I strongly agree with Dr Scilla that women and youth have to play a significant role in bringing the world together for lasting peace.  - Aekta Kapoor, OrganiserBringing them all together is Aekta Kapoor. A writer and motivational speaker espouses the cause of women leading for a better tomorrow. An Indo-Pak Summit? “The idea came when I was interviewing Dr Scilla Elworthy, a peace builder from the UK, who suggested the idea. A month on, here we are with some exceptional women joining in for long-term solutions.”It’s tougher than it sounds for sure. “Even floating the idea - an Indo-Pak Peace Summit– startles people. Why would you want that, they ask. That’s precisely the reason. Why not, we share common history, culture, language, food – why not thrive on our shared heritage,” says Aekta. It’s been frantic putting together the panels, topics, talks and the end product looks like an impressive blend of cinema, literature, fashion, business and more – all geared towards the same end – a better future where women use their intrinsic strength to lead the world.Friendly neighbours has been a dream many chase, many of these women have been working on the theme in their own fields. “These are the women who have been building bridges for an inclusive future. I strongly agree with Dr Scilla that women and youth have to play a significant role in bringing the world together for lasting peace.”Power of Written Word, Documenting Heritage, Firing Imaginations Not Bullets are some of the interesting panel discussions spread over two days – January 16 and 17.How well does it work since it’s virtual? “That would have been the only way possible. Thanks to the last few months that people have become used to working online. With panellists from around the world joining in, a summit of this kind in real time wouldn’t have been possible given the travel restrictions.”Among others there is also a short session on meditation as well. Aekta says, “I have been doing these workshops for a while – for only when we are at peace with ourselves that we extend a hand in friendship.”The event due on January 16 and 17 has tickets available at eShe, organiser of the event. Students, writers, bloggers who are keen can write for the fee to be waived off as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/40-women-who-join-hands-to-organise-a-two-day-indo-pak-peace-summit-199251

Since setting up of the committee is a unilateral action on part of the court, only it can find a replacement for Mann,” senior counsel Vikas Singh, who is appearing a PIL petitioner seeking guidelines on agitations, said.Advocate Virag Gupta said, “The SC may modify its previous order and allow the committee to continue with only three members or name Mann’s replacement. Since kisan unions have expressed their willingness to continue talks with the government it may keep its order on hold or even refer it to a Constitution Bench.”While staying the implementation of the three farm laws, a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had on January 12 set up a four-member committee to hear stakeholders’ views.Besides Mann, the other three members of the committee were Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.They were mandated to talk to the agitating farmers on the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act and file a report before the court in two months.Advocate AP Singh, who is representing some farmers’ bodies in the case, said, “it was bound to happen as most of the members were pro-farm laws and their views were already known”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-panel-on-farmers-stir-in-limbo-198975

The ED’s probe is based on an FIR filed by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau in April 2017 against Khadse, his wife Mandakini, son-in-law Girish Choudhary and others. It is alleged that the land was purchased in the name of Khadse’s wife and son-in-law for Rs 3.75 crore, much lower than the market price of Rs 40 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncp-leader-khadse-grilled-by-ed-in-pune-land-deal-case-198977

The issue found no mention in the Indian read-out of the meeting chaired by Foreign Ministers S Jaishankar and Pradeep Gyawali, respectively.The Nepalese Foreign office’s assertion did not find a mention in the Indian statement about the joint commission’s proceedings. Rather, it suggested that both sides had kept aside their political differences to focus on bilateral cooperation, including a railway line to Kathmandu, a second oil pipeline, another integrated check-post and funding of two more cultural heritage projects in Nepal.But the Nepalese Foreign office said not just the boundary issue, but another political matter of revising the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 was also discussed.On Thursday, on being asked if the boundary issue would be discussed, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said, “Let me say that the Joint Commission meeting and boundary talks are separate mechanisms.”Later, Nepal Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali publicly underlined both the political issues. “We should sincerely attend to the issues that we have inherited from the past, address them appropriately and creatively work out the agendas for future,” he said, hinting at the unresolved boundary issue. On a review of the treaty, he said the Eminent Persons’ Group had done its work to review the entire spectrum of Nepal-India relations and “it is our job is to receive their report and implement it”.Both sides discussed connectivity, economy and trade, power, oil and gas, water resources, and political and security issues.Revising peace and Friendship treatyThe Nepalese Foreign office said not just the boundary issue, but another political matter of revising the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 was also discussed at the Foreign Ministers’ meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-for-early-solution-to-boundary-dispute-india-talks-development-198978

Parts of the chats, which created ripples on the social media today, reveal Dasgupta allegedly told Arnab that the new Telecom Regulatory Authority of India proposal to reform the TRP measurement mechanism could “harm both the Republic TV and BJP”.The conversation is dated March 25, 2019, with Dasgupta sending Arnab a confidential BARC letter on WhatsApp to say he had jammed the NBA, and asking for Arnab’s help through the PMO. In response, Arnab promises, “Noted and will happen.” The Republic TV chief then says he is meeting the PM coming Thursday.Sharing snapshots of the chats on the social media, advocate Prashant Bhushan tweeted: “The leaked WhatsApp chats of #ArnabGoswami are far more explosive than #RadiaTapes. They show the unholy nexus of media with those in power; It shows how TRP is manipulated; It shows how cynically fake news is propagated; Above all, it lays bare the prime Dalal of Dalali street!”Bhushan said the chats showed “unprecedented access to power in this government.” Several netizens questioned the chats which reveal the alleged role of Dasgupta in convincing Arnab to thwart the TRAI proposal of measuring TV viewership digitally through a specially installed software in a set-top box.The conversations reveal the proximity between Dasgupta and Arnab with the former writing to Arnab on May 5, 2017, “Best wishes boss from my heart and not from BARC. I really want you to succeed. “Arnab replies to the thread, saying, “Life is so strange Partho. Had you not met me in Delhi, I would have been languishing in NDTV.” Another chat dated July 18, 2017 has Dasgupta asking Arnab who the next Information and Broadcasting Minister would be and Arnab replying: “Smriti…Was worried about J.”Another chat reveals Dasgupta asking Arnab if he could get him a media adviser’s role in the PMO. Yet another conversation has Arnab telling the ex-BARC chief: “The PM is being dealt differently.” The chats became public on a day when the Mumbai Police told the Bombay HC it would not take coercive action against Goswami till January 29 in the TRP case.TRAI PROPOSAL THAT WAS NOT TO BEThe TRAI proposal (which Dasgupta allegedly asked Arnab to get nixed using his influence with the PMO) to digitally measure TRPs ultimately fell through after several TV channels resisted it, saying the installation of an automatic digital measurement software would cost a lot. TRPs continue to be measured manually through meters installed in households.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trp-scam-damning-arnab-ex-barc-boss-chats-leaked-198981

Paul said in emergency situations, the Indian law permits Phase 2 immunogenicity data to be used as a surrogate for the Phase 3 efficacy data which has happened in the case of Covaxin.“Both vaccines are safe and there have been no major side effects reported,” Paul said. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan spent his day firefighting rumours about vaccines and said vaccines neither cause infertility nor was there any reported case of vaccine derived Covid virus.Sending a clear message that the vaccination is not yet meant for the general public, Vardhan said the self-registration module of the government’s Co-WIN (app for Covid shot rollout) has not been released yet. “Be wary of fraudulent apps with similar names.

16-01-2021||---||Army displays combat swarm drone system||New Delhi, January 15The Army today demonstrated an offensive swarm drone system during the annual Army Day parade here.The system was tested using 75 indigenously designed and developed drones, which executed an array of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled simulated offensive missions. Such drones will be needed in close tactical battle.One such project is the AI offensive drone operation. The project symbolises the beginning of Army’s tryst with autonomy in weapon platforms.“This demonstration is recognition of the Indian Army’s ability to embrace emerging and disruptive technologies to transform itself into a technology-enabled force,” the Army said in statement.The Army is investing heavily in AI, autonomous weapon systems, quantum technologies, robotics, cloud computing and algorithm warfare in order to achieve a convergence between the Army’s war-fighting philosophies and the military attributes of these technologies.Army Day is celebrated on January 15 every year in recognition of Field Marshal KM Cariappa’s taking over as the first Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army from Sir Francis Butcher, the last British Commander, in 1949.It is celebrated in the national capital as well as at all six Army Command Headquarters in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-displays-combat-swarm-drone-system-198986

It has been over 14 days since I got the second dose. I am fit and fine,” she told The Tribune, seeking to settle the controversy around the safety of indigenously made COVAXIN which is part of the national rollout plan.Srivastava said everyone, particularly healthcare workers, “needed to have healthy respect for COVID-19 and get protected with the two nationally approved choices”.“COVID-19 continues to be unpredictable. There is no typecasting the disease. We cannot take it for granted. I will continue to have a very healthy respect for COVID 19 rather than say I know everything about it. I hope everyone else will do the same and get vaccinated. Both vaccines approved in India are safe. No regulator will approve a product without taking safety into account. We must believe the system. I am an Indian and I believe the scientific rigour of my system,” Srivastava said.She said she volunteered for COVAXIN trials because the onus of inspiring public confidence in the indigenous vaccine was primarily on the scientific community.Also read: Don't believe in rumours, experts say vaccines safe: Kejriwal“A big percentage of COVAXIN trial participants are scientific people. The scientific community had to volunteer to give optimism to society about the safety of COVAXIN. I am here before you having taken both my doses. I am safe and sound,” she said, adding that none of the COVID vaccines being used anywhere in the world had received general licensures yet.All vaccines had only received emergency use authorisations and all continue to be under further trials for additional data, she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/go-get-vaccinated-dont-take-covid-for-granted-nimhans-chief-to-health-workers-198991
