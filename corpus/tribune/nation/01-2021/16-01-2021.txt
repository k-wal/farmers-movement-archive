16-01-2021||New Delhi||Bird flu in poultry confirmed in 9 districts of Maharashtra; culling operation on in MP, Chhattisgarh||The Centre on Saturday said bird flu in poultry has been confirmed in nine districts of Maharashtra, while culling operation in poultry is underway in one district each in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.Apart from poultry, the viral disease has been confirmed in crow in Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, while in pigeon, brown fish owl and Heron in Delhi.However, the central government requested state governments to “rethink” their decisions to impose ban sale of poultry products and allow sale of poultry items sourced from the non-infected areas/states.In India, bird flu or avian influenza is spread mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months from between September and March. The disease is zoonotic.Releasing latest update on bird flu situation, the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying said bird flu cases have been confirmed in poultry in Latur, Parbhani, Nanded, Pune, Solapur, Yavatmal, Ahmednagar, Beed and Raigad districts of Maharashtra till Saturday.Unusual mortality of poultry has been found in a farm as per the report received from the Mumbai-based Central Poultry Development Organisation. The samples have been sent to the designated laboratory for testing, it said.Besides, bird flu in crow has been confirmed in Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh, in Surat, Navsari and Narmada districts of Gujarat as well as in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand and Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.Additionally in Delhi, Pigeon and brown fish owl in Najafgarh and Heron in Rohini have tested positive for avian influenza, the statement said.On culling operation in poultry, the ministry said it is underway in epicentres of Balod district, Chhattisgarh.Further in Madhya Pradesh also rapid response teams have been deployed. Culling operation of poultry is underway in the epicentre of Harda district, it added.According to the ministry, the central teams formed for monitoring the situation in the affected areas of the country are visiting the affected sites and conducting epistemological studies.On poultry sale and consumption, the ministry asked states to rethink their decisions to impose a ban on sale of poultry and poultry products and allow selling of poultry and poultry products sourced from the non-infected areas/states.“It is reiterated that consumption of well cooked chicken and eggs is safe for humans. Consumers should not heed to baseless rumours that are unscientific and often lead to confusion,” it said.These adversely affect poultry and egg markets and thereby poultry and maize farmers, who are already affected by the COVID 19 pandemic lockdown, it noted.Following the central government’s advisories, states are undertaking awareness generation activities through newspaper advertisements and social media platforms.Also, continued efforts to generate awareness about bird flu and how to deal with the situation are being shared among the general public through various media platforms, including social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook handles, the ministry added.

16-01-2021||New Delhi||Vaccination drive: Jab and job go hand in hand for doctors||Spending barely half-an-hour under mandatory observation after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine shot, Dr Sunny Kalra lost no time in going back to attending patients at BLK Super Speciality Hospital, this time with renewed confidence.Although happy to be vaccinated on the very first day of the world’s largest vaccination programme on Saturday, what really broadened Dr Kalra’s smile was the sense of relief that he saw on the faces of his patients.“My doctor is vaccinated. Hurray!’. It was that kind of sense of security and relief they had when I told them that I have just got inoculated and they are in safe hands. That is what made me realise how important it was for them as well,” said Dr Kalra, consultant Chest and Respiratory Diseases, BLK Super Speciality Hospital at Rajendra Place.“I am very confident that this assurance that we now have after getting the vaccine will motivate all health workers further to do their best for the patients,” he added.BLK Super Speciality, Max Hospital, Fortis Hospital, Apollo Hospital and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital are among the private hospitals chosen as the vaccination sites by the administration.Messages of congratulations, doctors posing with a victory sign for the media with their infectious smiles—visible even under the cover of mask—and the many ‘just got jabbed’ selfie by the health workers, it was a rare and happy day at the BLK hospital, which has witnessed many dreary days in the past due to the ongoing pandemic.“I was already motivated enough, and then the PM’s speech on TV which I saw just moments before I was getting inoculated also helped. I had a good sleep last night when they (the hospital administration) told me that I will be inoculated today.“I had a good breakfast and now I look forward to a fulfilling day,” said Dr Sandeep Nayar, senior director and head of department, Chest and Respiratory Diseases, who was the first one to be vaccinated at the hospital.“There is no local or systemic reaction. I am as healthy as before. Also, I am happy that as an HOD I could lead by example and hope there won’t be any doubts in the mind of others regarding the vaccine now,” said a visibly calm and relieved Dr Nayar.Though there was no apprehension whatsoever in the mind of doctors and healthcare workers, the same can’t be said for the families waiting back home with bated breath.Dr Kalra, whose phone kept buzzing with messages from his family members asking ‘if he is doing fine’, said it only stopped after he sent his photo on the family whatsapp group telling “it (vaccine) is done and I am doing absolutely fine”.“There will always be those two or three members in your family who are worried about things. It was the same in my case as well. I, as a doctor, was always confident.“Now, when they know I am doing fine, they are also feeling relaxed. It will help them to prepare for themselves when the time comes—which I am sure will be sooner enough,” said the 39-year-old.According to the hospital, the whole staff, which consists of approximately 3,000 people, will be vaccinated in another 10-12 days. The hospital administered Oxford’s Covishield for the vaccination drive on Saturday.The Delhi government has received 2.74 lakh doses of the vaccine so far from the Centre which would be sufficient for 1.2 lakh health workers.There are a total of 2.4 lakh health workers in the national capital and more vaccine doses are expected to arrive soon, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Wednesday.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive and asserted that the made-in-India vaccines being rolled out will ensure a “decisive victory” for the country over the coronavirus pandemic.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also urged people not to believe in rumours and listen to experts who say COVID-19 vaccines are safe.“I have interacted with those vaccinated. No one has any problem. All are happy that they will get rid of coronavirus,” the chief minister said at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital where he inspected the vaccination drive.The vaccination exercise was conducted at 81 sites across all 11 districts in Delhi. Six central government hospitals—AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital, Kalawati Saran Children Hospital and two ESI hospitals—are also part of the drive.

16-01-2021||New Delhi||Nepal never accepts interference in domestic politics: Foreign Minister Gyawali||Nepal does not accept interference in its domestic politics as it is capable of handling its internal problems, Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said on Saturday, in comments that came against the backdrop of China wading into the political turmoil in the Himalayan nation following the dissolution of its parliament.Gyawali’s assertion came at a media interaction when asked about China’s attempt to play a role in the aftermath of fast-paced political developments in Nepal last month.“We never accept interference in our domestic politics. We are able to settle our own problems. As a close neighbour, there may be some concerns or questions but we never accept interference,” the Nepalese foreign minister said.Nepal plunged into a political turmoil following Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli’s sudden decision to dissolve parliament and call for fresh elections in view of internal feud in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).As the crisis deepened, China rushed a high-level team headed by Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou to Kathmandu to hold talks with the rival factions within the NCP after the Chinese ambassador in the country failed to sort out differences.The team held talks with almost all top Nepalese leaders but had to return empty handed. The Chinese meddling in Nepalese political developments triggered strong criticism within Nepal.Gyawali said Nepal’s relations with both India and China are excellent and that it never compares ties with each other.Asked about the political crisis and role of NCP leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal who is popularly known as Prachanda, Gyawali refused to make any direct comment and said as foreign minister of the country, he represents everyone in Nepal.At the same time, the Nepalese foreign minister justified Oli’s decision to dissolve parliament saying he followed the democratic principle of seeking fresh mandate from the people whose decisions are supreme in a democracy.“In democracy, people are the final authority to decide about who will govern. I think dissolution of the parliament is a reflection of the internal issue. It is not wise to blame anybody,” Gyawali said.“Prime Minister Oli thought that time has come to seek a fresh mandate in line with universally accepted practice of seeking people’s views,” the Nepalese foreign minister said.Asked about the boundary row between Nepal and India, Gyawali said both the countries have common commitment to resolve the issue.“We have the common commitment to resolve it. The sanctity and security of the border is extremely important for expanding the overall developmental cooperation... We both have realised the urgency (to resolve the border issue),” he said.Ties between India and Nepal came under severe strain after Nepal last year published a new political map that showed three Indian territories - Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh - as part of Nepal.When asked about India’s assertion that the areas were its part, Gyawali said that “historical documents speak the reality”, in an indication that they belonged to Nepal.“We can sit together with mutual trust to find a solution,” he said. Gyawali, accompanied by Nepalese Foreign Secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal, arrived here on Thursday on a three-day visit.On Friday, Gyawali held wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar covering the entire expanse of bilateral ties.In the interaction, he also batted for an early review of the Indo-Nepal Peace and Friendship treaty of 1950 and flagged concerns over his country’s increasing trade deficit with India.Asked whether Nepal was looking to procure coronavirus vaccine from both India and China, Gyawali said the supply of vaccines should be viewed as global public good and that scientific aspects should determine decision making and not political judgement.He said affordability, availability and promptness in supply as well as compatible infrastructure to store the vaccines in Nepal will determine its decisions on their procurement.In their talks on Friday, Jaishankar and Gyawali held a comprehensive review of all aspects of bilateral ties including border management, connectivity, trade, power, oil and gas, water resources, capacity building and tourism among others.It was the first high-level engagement between the two sides after relations nosedived following the boundary row.

Due to this updated policy, the users will now have to compulsorily share all the information that WhatsApp collects, which includes information about the user’s activity on their services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, it pointed out.WhatsApp has already announced delaying by three months the implementation of its new privacy policy that has caused concerns among millions of its users, many of whom started to move to its rivals such as Signal and Telegram. It was originally scheduled to come into effect on February 8.The petitioner accused the Centre of failing to discharge its constitutional duty of protecting the privacy rights of citizens. Citizen’s personal data is being collected by a foreign entity and is being transferred outside the country, it alleged.“Centre failed to impose necessary and restrictive conditions in the instant case, though on the proposed policy of WhatsApp, European Union’s Antitrust Authority had imposed serious restrictions and fines of 110 million euros in 2017,” read the CAIT petition.In 20 16, Germany, the UK and the entire European Union had prohibited similar action of Facebook which was also asked to delete all the data relating to Whatsapp users, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-seeks-protection-of-citizens-right-to-privacy-from-whatsapp-facebook-199392

Covid ke viruddh humey pratirodhak shamta deti hai (Vaccines developed in India are safe and effective. They will provide immunity against COVID-19),” it said.The caller tune also urges people to trust the vaccine and not believe in rumours.“Bhartiya vaccine par bharosa Karen. Apni baari aane par vaccine zarur lagwayein. Afawaon par bharosa na kare (Have trust in the vaccines made in India and do get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Do not believe in rumours),” the new caller tune added.The new caller tune talks about the vaccination drive, asking people to continue to follow COVID-19-appropriate behaviours such as wearing mask, maintaining social distance and washing hands, even after taking the vaccine.The earlier caller tune, in the voice of Bachchan, began with a coughing sound, followed by a cautionary note on COVID-19-appropriate behaviours.“Covid-19 se pura desh hi nahi pura vishwa ladd raha hai (Not just India, but the entire world is battling against Covid-19),” the voice said.After this, Bachchan would further elaborate on the importance of Covid-appropriate behaviour like frequently washing hands, wearing mask and maintaining social distancing to avoid spread of the deadly virus.Recently, a PIL was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the Centre to remove megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s voice from the caller tune on precautions against the coronavirus on the grounds that he himself, along with some family members, had been infected with the virus.Healthcare workers at the frontline of India’s COVID-19 battle got their first jabs on Saturday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching the world’s largest vaccination drive against the pandemic.

On the basis of the complaint, another FIR was lodged against Rathore on Friday evening, he said.Some other boys have also come forward alleging that they were sexually assaulted by the accused. Efforts are being made to seek Rathore's police remand for the recovery of more videos, he added.Earlier, the police had found 15 to 20 videos on Rathore's laptop, DVD and hard disc in which he is seen sexually exploiting children. Nine more victims---seven minors and two women---were identified on the basis of these videos.The SP said the stringent National Security Act (NSA) could also be invoked against Rathore, the former vice-president of the BJP's Konch unit.Directives in this regard have already been received from the state government, he said.Under the NSA, a person can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that he or she is a threat to national security or law and order.Imran Khan, Station House Officer (SHO) of Konch police station, said during interrogation, Rathore admitted to having sexually exploited two women, who have been contacted.Though the women have spoken to the police about what happened, they have refused to record a statement citing their married life. The police are in touch with them, he said.The police said efforts are on to record statements of six-seven other children who were identified on the basis of the recovered videos.On Thursday, Khan had said Rathore would lure young children by giving them money and made their obscene videos which he used to blackmail them.Meanwhile, district BJP president Ramendra Singh said the party is trying to ascertain how Rathore was appointed as the Konch unit vice president.Rathore was expelled from the primary membership of the party soon after his arrest, Ramendra Singh said.Now the senior leadership is trying to ascertain why or on whose recommendation he was appointed as the vice president of the Konch unit, he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-fresh-fir-against-ex-bjp-functionary-after-another-boy-comes-forward-to-report-sexual-abuse-199365
16-01-2021||Lucknow||Indian Army has boosted country's morale during border standoff with China: Rajnath||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said the Indian Army has boosted the morale of the country and also enabled the people to hold their heads high during the border standoff with China.He said this while addressing a gathering here during the 'bhoomipujan' and foundation stone laying ceremony of the new Command Hospital."The charismatic (karishmaayi) performance by the Army during the India-China standoff has boosted the morale of the country and also enabled the citizens to hold their heads high," he said, drawing a thunderous applause from the crowd."The entire world is facing COVID-19. Pandemic No one had thought that with the onset of the pandemic, celebrating festivals such as Holi, Eid and Diwali will be without much fanfare (dhoomdhaam). No one had imagined that trains will come to a halt, and schools and markets will remain closed. However, the good thing was that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, efforts to deal with the crisis started with courage and understanding (of the issue)," he said.He added that the biggest challenge at the time of the pandemic was testing."There were barely two laboratories, but today there are over 1,000 laboratories. There was a shortage of masks, ventilators and PPE kits. But the swiftness and understanding of the issue which India displayed, masks, PPE kits and ventilators are now being exported. This has been done in 4-6 months," Singh said.Hailing the doctors and healthcare workers, he said, "Had our doctors, para-medical staff, whom we know as warriors, not take the risk, we could not have fought the challenge. It is for this reason that doctors are considered as the second God on earth. The threat of COVID-19 was on doctors, para-medical staff, sanitation workers. They stayed away from their families, ate food outside their homes, and then left for the hospital. These warriors have rendered charismatic performance. The doctors, para-medical staff, sanitation workers have worked as frontline soldiers and I salute their commitment and dedication."He also informed that besides the two indigenous anti-COVID vaccines used in the nationwide vaccination drive that began on Saturday, four more vaccines are coming soon."These vaccines will not only be administered to people in India, but will also be exported to other countries. Because, India does not think about itself alone, but is also concerned about the entire world. Seers here gave the message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam—the whole world is a family. Since the Vedic era, the medical treatment system here has not only thought about human beings, but also of other creatures. During the reign of Ashoka, there were provisions for treatment of cows, buffaloes, cats and bats."Army chief General MM Naravane and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were also present at the programme. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-army-has-boosted-countrys-morale-during-border-standoff-with-china-rajnath-199361

We consider these events as a 'REFUSAL' by the executive committee of the SCBA to carry out our directions which in terms of Rule 17A of the Rules of the SCBA are final and binding," the panel members said, adding it was not possible for them to continue to discharge their duties and hold the elections.Singh said the decision to hold elections virtually through NSDL had already been approved by the SCBA.

Covaxin manufactured by Bharat Biotech is being preferred in our hospital over Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute,” the letter stated.Also read: Bharat Biotech to pay compensation if Covaxin causes side effects“The residents are a bit apprehensive about the lack of complete trial in case of Covaxin and might not participate in huge numbers, thus defeating the purpose of vaccination. We request you to vaccinate us with Covishield, which has completed all stages of trial before its rollout,” the letter further stated.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive and asserted that the made-in-India vaccines being rolled out would ensure a “decisive victory” for the country over the coronavirus pandemic.In the national capital, the vaccination exercise will be carried out at 81 sites across all its 11 districts.At the RML hospital, a security guard was the first one to receive the shot.Six Central Government hospitals — AIIMS, Safdarjung, RML, Kalawati Saran Children Hospital and two ESI hospitals — have been chosen as sites for the drive.

I had asked her if she would be associated with the book for forward, there was no talk of the film then.

She could have asked me if she wants to do a film based on my book, but she didn't approach me," Kaul told PTI.When he took the matter with Ranaut and the film's producer, they denied that they are using his story for the movie, he said, adding that he will be seeking legal counsel to "protect my rights"."I will do whatever it takes to protect my rights and consult legal experts in coming days," he said.When contacted, Ranaut and Jain were not available for a comment."Manikarnika Returns: The Legend of Didda" is scheduled to go on floors in January 2022. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/author-of-diddas-biography-accuses-kangana-ranaut-of-copyright-violation-over-new-film-199323

16-01-2021||New Delhi||BJP Chief Ministers are least popular, says survey||Seven out of the 10 most popular Chief Ministers are from the Opposition parties while seven out of the 10 worst performing Chief Ministers are from the BJP/NDA camp, as per the IANS C-Voter State of the Nation 2021 survey.As per the survey, BJP Chief Ministers are the least popular currently. In all BJP/NDA ruled states, the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is several notches higher than the popularity of the BJP Chief Ministers.Non-Congress Chief Ministers are at times relatively at par or slightly more popular than Modi within their respective states. However, even the worst performing BJP/NDA Chief Ministers are more popular than Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in their respective states.Rahul Gandhi’s leadership seems to be more of a liability rather than an asset for the Congress. All Congress CM faces are way more popular than their central leadership. The Congress is unable to emerge as the fulcrum of the Opposition.Among the poll-bound states, the Chief Ministers of Kerala, West Bengal and Assam have scored way better than the national average, thus indicating a pro-incumbency sentiment in these states as far as Chief Minister candidates are concerned. The Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are among the bottom lot as far as satisfaction ratings are concerned, indicating anti-incumbency sentiments brewing up in these states, the survey found.Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik is the most popular chief minister in the country, followed closely by Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi and YS Jaganmohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh.On the other end of the spectrum is Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, arguably the least popular Chief Minister in India followed closely by Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh with the lowest satisfaction ratings in their respective states.Out of those surveyed, 11 Chief Ministers scored higher than the all-India average (42.8) nett approval ratings. Odisha, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh have the most popular leaders while 11 Chief Ministers score below the national average.By this metric, Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand have the three least popular Chief Ministers in the country. Three large states governed by the BJP or its allies score below the national average — Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar.The Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and West Bengal are doing better than the national average. It would be an overreach to read too much into the CM ratings as leaders often lag the unpopularity of their governments or legislators. Nevertheless, it is an important framework to view the state of politics in the country.Among the smaller and middle sized states, Haryana, Kerala and Punjab are lacklustres for PM Modi. Punjab in particular is the only state in the country to return a negative nett approval for Modi. Perhaps a consequence of the ongoing farmers’ protests.The Chief Ministers of Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have a higher nett approval rating than the Prime Minister within their respective states.Out of these states, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu are states where the BJP is eyeing expansion. The BJP/NDA’s primary vote catcher is Modi but if his charisma stalls in these states, then future gains may be limited.On the flipside, the Opposition’s universe is limited to these non-Congress dominated states. In other words, the Congress is currently unable to mount an effective opposition to the ruling party and any worthwhile opposition comes from the non-Congress leadership.This state of affairs is best reflected in the nett ratings of Rahul Gandhi and the respective state Chief Ministers. Rahul Gandhi is uniformly rated in the negative either vis-a-vis his party CMs or the others. Therefore, Modi’s relative unpopularity against some Chief Ministers is not benefiting Rahul Gandhi in any way.Maharashtra, due its high index of opposition unity, is slipping away from the grasp of the NDA. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is very popular on account of joint support from the Shiv Sena, Congress and the NCP.The next best is Chhattisgarh where CM Bhupesh Baghel is able to hold fort at a nett approval rating of 1. Jharkhand and Rajasthan are witnessing their usual cycle of anti-incumbency and the NDA may notch some electoral gains based on the relative popularity of Modi. The prospects of the Congress-led Opposition are mixed at best, even after the recent setbacks suffered by the government.The Chief Ministers of the states who are not aligned to either national parties are doing really well. Only Telangana Chief Minister is relatively less popular than Modi in his state.The Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi, Odisha and West Bengal are relatively more popular than Modi.The inherent message is twofold: First, the BJP finds it difficult to unseat non-Congress regional leaders; and second, the Congress has failed to gravitate anti-BJP or even non-BJP vote towards itself.Hence, it can be concluded that an effective future challenge to the BJP will have to take into account the rejection of Congress’ centrality to opposition leadership.The survey was carried out among over 30,000 respondents across the country.

16-01-2021||Mona||40 women who join hands to organise a two-day Indo-Pak Peace Summit||Forty women come together to collaborate in an effort to build peace in South Asia. Names like Dr Scilla Elworthy – the three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee from the UK, Dr Meenakshi Gopinath, political scientist and a Padma Shri awardee from India, Moni Mohsin, columnist and bestselling novelist from Pakistan, and Radhya Almutawakel, human-rights defender from Yemen are four of the forty women who gather virtually at the Indo-Pak Peace Summit Led by Women in their effort to bring stability and prosperity.These are the women who have been building bridges for an inclusive future. I strongly agree with Dr Scilla that women and youth have to play a significant role in bringing the world together for lasting peace.  - Aekta Kapoor, OrganiserBringing them all together is Aekta Kapoor. A writer and motivational speaker espouses the cause of women leading for a better tomorrow. An Indo-Pak Summit? “The idea came when I was interviewing Dr Scilla Elworthy, a peace builder from the UK, who suggested the idea. A month on, here we are with some exceptional women joining in for long-term solutions.”It’s tougher than it sounds for sure. “Even floating the idea - an Indo-Pak Peace Summit– startles people. Why would you want that, they ask. That’s precisely the reason. Why not, we share common history, culture, language, food – why not thrive on our shared heritage,” says Aekta. It’s been frantic putting together the panels, topics, talks and the end product looks like an impressive blend of cinema, literature, fashion, business and more – all geared towards the same end – a better future where women use their intrinsic strength to lead the world.Friendly neighbours has been a dream many chase, many of these women have been working on the theme in their own fields. “These are the women who have been building bridges for an inclusive future. I strongly agree with Dr Scilla that women and youth have to play a significant role in bringing the world together for lasting peace.”Power of Written Word, Documenting Heritage, Firing Imaginations Not Bullets are some of the interesting panel discussions spread over two days – January 16 and 17.How well does it work since it’s virtual? “That would have been the only way possible. Thanks to the last few months that people have become used to working online. With panellists from around the world joining in, a summit of this kind in real time wouldn’t have been possible given the travel restrictions.”Among others there is also a short session on meditation as well. Aekta says, “I have been doing these workshops for a while – for only when we are at peace with ourselves that we extend a hand in friendship.”The event due on January 16 and 17 has tickets available at eShe, organiser of the event. Students, writers, bloggers who are keen can write for the fee to be waived off as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/40-women-who-join-hands-to-organise-a-two-day-indo-pak-peace-summit-199251

Since setting up of the committee is a unilateral action on part of the court, only it can find a replacement for Mann,” senior counsel Vikas Singh, who is appearing a PIL petitioner seeking guidelines on agitations, said.Advocate Virag Gupta said, “The SC may modify its previous order and allow the committee to continue with only three members or name Mann’s replacement. Since kisan unions have expressed their willingness to continue talks with the government it may keep its order on hold or even refer it to a Constitution Bench.”While staying the implementation of the three farm laws, a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had on January 12 set up a four-member committee to hear stakeholders’ views.Besides Mann, the other three members of the committee were Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.They were mandated to talk to the agitating farmers on the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act and file a report before the court in two months.Advocate AP Singh, who is representing some farmers’ bodies in the case, said, “it was bound to happen as most of the members were pro-farm laws and their views were already known”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-panel-on-farmers-stir-in-limbo-198975

The ED’s probe is based on an FIR filed by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau in April 2017 against Khadse, his wife Mandakini, son-in-law Girish Choudhary and others. It is alleged that the land was purchased in the name of Khadse’s wife and son-in-law for Rs 3.75 crore, much lower than the market price of Rs 40 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncp-leader-khadse-grilled-by-ed-in-pune-land-deal-case-198977

The issue found no mention in the Indian read-out of the meeting chaired by Foreign Ministers S Jaishankar and Pradeep Gyawali, respectively.The Nepalese Foreign office’s assertion did not find a mention in the Indian statement about the joint commission’s proceedings. Rather, it suggested that both sides had kept aside their political differences to focus on bilateral cooperation, including a railway line to Kathmandu, a second oil pipeline, another integrated check-post and funding of two more cultural heritage projects in Nepal.But the Nepalese Foreign office said not just the boundary issue, but another political matter of revising the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 was also discussed.On Thursday, on being asked if the boundary issue would be discussed, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said, “Let me say that the Joint Commission meeting and boundary talks are separate mechanisms.”Later, Nepal Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali publicly underlined both the political issues. “We should sincerely attend to the issues that we have inherited from the past, address them appropriately and creatively work out the agendas for future,” he said, hinting at the unresolved boundary issue. On a review of the treaty, he said the Eminent Persons’ Group had done its work to review the entire spectrum of Nepal-India relations and “it is our job is to receive their report and implement it”.Both sides discussed connectivity, economy and trade, power, oil and gas, water resources, and political and security issues.Revising peace and Friendship treatyThe Nepalese Foreign office said not just the boundary issue, but another political matter of revising the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 was also discussed at the Foreign Ministers’ meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-for-early-solution-to-boundary-dispute-india-talks-development-198978

It has been over 14 days since I got the second dose. I am fit and fine,” she told The Tribune, seeking to settle the controversy around the safety of indigenously made COVAXIN which is part of the national rollout plan.Srivastava said everyone, particularly healthcare workers, “needed to have healthy respect for COVID-19 and get protected with the two nationally approved choices”.“COVID-19 continues to be unpredictable. There is no typecasting the disease. We cannot take it for granted. I will continue to have a very healthy respect for COVID 19 rather than say I know everything about it. I hope everyone else will do the same and get vaccinated. Both vaccines approved in India are safe. No regulator will approve a product without taking safety into account. We must believe the system. I am an Indian and I believe the scientific rigour of my system,” Srivastava said.She said she volunteered for COVAXIN trials because the onus of inspiring public confidence in the indigenous vaccine was primarily on the scientific community.Also read: Don't believe in rumours, experts say vaccines safe: Kejriwal“A big percentage of COVAXIN trial participants are scientific people.

Some people are saying that the national flag should be hoisted at the Red Fort, some are saying the Parliament will be stormed,” Rajewal said, accusing “anti-farmer forces and government agencies” of trying to malign and scuttle the peaceful agitation of farmers and common people. Morcha leaders also condemned inflammatory statements by an organizstion called ‘Sikhs for Justice’“We urge farmers to be aware of such organisations which are breaking the unity among us," they said.Though Samyukta Kisan Motcha leaders said they are yet to finalise the contours of January 26 tractor march, BKU leader from Uttar Pradesh, Rakesh Tikait, has already announced programme for the day.

16-01-2021||Mumbai||No coercive action against Arnab Goswami till Jan 29 in TRP case: Mumbai Police||The Mumbai Police told the Bombay High Court on Friday that it will not take any coercive action till January 29 against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and other employees of ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd in the alleged fake TRP scam case.ARG is the parent company that runs all Republic TV channels.A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale also extended till January 29, the interim relief for employees of the complainant company in the case, Hansa Research Group, by directing the police to ensure they are called for inquiry for not more than two days a week.The bench also took on record the status report filed by the Mumbai Police in its investigation in the alleged scam which came to light late last year.ARG media had approached the HC last year seeking, among other things, that the police be restrained from taking coercive action against its employees.On Friday, ARG’s counsel senior advocate Harish Salve told the court that the allegations of the Mumbai Police that Goswami paid bribes to rig TRP numbers was “nonsensical.”      Salve said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had registered a money-laundering case related to the alleged TRP scam and was probing the same.He said the HC must call for a status report from the ED, too, and if the contents of the status reports filed by the Mumbai police and the central agency differed much, the court would realise the case against ARG was malafide.The ED’s counsel, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, told the bench that the central agency had readied its status report and the court must accept it in a sealed cover.The Mumbai Police’s counsel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, however, opposed the ED’s submissions.Sibal raised questions on the ED’s locus standi in the matter. He also reminded the court that the financial probe agency was not a party in the case before the HC.Salve, however, told the HC that ARG had amended its plea and sought that the ED be impleaded as a party.The court then directed Sibal to file his reply to the amended plea and the ED being impleaded, by the next date of hearing.While opposing the ED being joined as a party, Sibal went on to question the central agency’s “enthusiasm” to file its status report even before it was impleaded as a party.“I have strong objections to the ED appearing in this matter. Why is this enthusiasm..,” Sibal said.Salve, however, argued that the police must not have any opposition to the court going through the ED’s report.“I dont understand how the State agency is trying to stop a Union agency from filing a report,” Salve said.The court, though, refused to take the ED’s status report on record on Friday and said it will consider the same on the next date of hearing.On January 6, Sibal had told HC that the Mumbai police will not take any coercive action against Goswami and employees of ARG till January 15.On Friday, as the HC granted the police time to file its reply to the amended petition and adjourned the hearing to January 29, Sibal submitted that he had no objection to such protection being extended till then.The HC accepted Sibal’s submission.ARG Media has filed several pleas and interim applications in the HC urging the court to transfer the probe in the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or any other independent agency.The pleas also urge the court to stay in the meanwhile, any further investigation in the case, and to restrain the police from taking any coercive action against the petitioners, their employees, or investors.The alleged racket was uncovered in October last year when the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint claiming certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers.

16-01-2021||New Delhi||India all set for world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday||Almost a year after reporting the first case of deadly coronavirus, which has claimed over 1.5 lakh lives in India till now, the country is set to witness a historic moment on Saturday with the commencement of the eagerly-awaited vaccination drive against the dreaded disease.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will virtually launch the world’s largest vaccination programme at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday and almost three lakh beneficiaries, belonging to the priority groups, will be administered the silver bullet at over 3,006 vaccination sites across the country. Around 100 beneficiaries will be vaccinated at each session site. The vaccine will be first offered to the healthcare workers, frontline workers and those above 50 years of age, followed by the below 50 population with comorbidities, and finally to the remaining population based on disease epidemiology and vaccine availability.The vaccination drive has been planned in a phased manner, identifying the priority groups. Healthcare workers, both in government and private sectors, including Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) workers, will receive the vaccine in the first phase.Tomorrow, 16th January, India begins the pan-India rollout of COVID-19 Vaccination drive. The launch will take place at 10:30 AM tomorrow morning. https://t.co/zopwtXPmZO  Two vaccines—Oxford Covid vaccine Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and indigenously developed Covaxin by the Bharat Biotech—will be administered to priority groups. Till now, the Central government has procured 1.1 crore Covishield and 55 lakh Covaxin vaccines at a cost of Rs 200 and Rs 206 per dose, respectively.Earlier on Friday, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said that India’s exercise to vaccinate its population against Covid-19 will be the largest immunisation drive in the world. The minister reiterated that both the indigenously manufactured vaccines have proven to be safe.The Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system, a digital platform, will be used to track the enlisted beneficiaries on a real-time basis. Prime Minister Modi will launch the app on Saturday. The platform enables national and state administrators to view and sort the data of the beneficiaries as per their gender, age and comorbidity. They can also view the metadata of vaccination and the Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) reported from the constituent districts. At the vaccination site, only pre-registered beneficiaries will be vaccinated as per prioritisation, and there will be no provision for on-the-spot registrations. A dedicated 24x7 hotline - 1075 - has also been set up to address questions related to the vaccine rollout and the Co-WIN app.The entire vaccination process will be broadly similar to the election process. Each vaccination team will consist of five members, including security personnel, nurses, paramedics and a doctor. Three will be a waiting area, an inoculation room and a post-vaccination observation area. There will also be a reception desk for registration and verification of the beneficiaries. Explaining the process of the vaccination drive, Ajeet Jain, the nodal officer of Delhi’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said, “The whole process from registration of beneficiaries to observation post-vaccination will take 45 minutes. At the entry point, vaccination officer-I will verify all the documents of the beneficiaries. On being cleared, they will come to the waiting area and wait for their turn.”  “From the waiting room, they will enter the vaccination room. The rooms are equipped with stretchers to shift a patient to the ICU in case of any untoward incident post-vaccination. ECG machine, monitor and oxygen mask will be available on the spot. After receiving the vaccine, the beneficiaries will be kept under observation for 30 minutes,” Jain added. Notably, only those above 18 years will be vaccinated. Pregnant women or who are not sure of their pregnancy and lactating mothers should not take the vaccine. Those with a history of bleeding or coagulation disorder will be administered the vaccine with utmost caution.Vaccination will have to be deferred for four to eight weeks after recovery of patients with active Covid symptoms, or those who have been given plasma therapy, and those who are unwell or have been hospitalised for any other reason. The second dose of the Covid vaccine will be administered after an interval of fourteen days. Also, interchanging Covid-19 vaccines is not allowed.The mild adverse impacts of the Covishield vaccine could be headache, fatigue, pain in muscle, injection site tenderness, weakness, pyrexia, chills, arthralgia and nausea. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-all-set-for-worlds-largest-covid-19-vaccination-drive-on-saturday-198955
16-01-2021||---||PM doesn’t respect farmers, wants to tire out those protesting against agri laws: Rahul||New Delhi, January 15Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not respect farmers and wants to tire out those protesting against the Centre’s new agri laws, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged on Friday.He also said that the talks that are being held with the protesting farmer leaders are part of the government’s delaying tactics.Farmers will not relent till the laws are repealed, said Rahul Gandhi at Jantar Mantar, where he along with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra joined party MPs in their demonstration against the legislations.The former Congress president’s remarks come on a day when the government is meeting protesting farmer unions for the ninth time to break the over-a-month-long deadlock on the three new agri laws.“The talks are being held only to delay. PM Modi thinks he has the power and will tire the farmers out, but he is mistaken,” Rahul Gandhi told reporters.“Narendra Modi does not have basic respect for farmers. He does not even care if over 100 farmers die. He thinks he has the power and the protesting farmers will tire out after some days, but they will not relent,” he said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at various border points of Delhi since November 28 against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Rahul Gandhi said this agitation has just started and the laws will have to be repealed. “They (the government) do not know the strength of farmers, they will not relent. PM Modi does not understand this. Had he understood this, the government would have taken back the laws today itself,” he said at the Jantar Mantar where Congress MPs Ravneet Singh Bittu, Jasbir Singh Gill and some other legislators from Punjab have been staging the protest for over a month.Asked about objections being raised over the proposed tractor rally by protesting farmers on Republic Day, he said, “If farmers want to come out and take out a tractor parade on Republic Day, what is the harm in it.”“The Prime Minister misunderstands, he thinks this country is run by four to five industrialists, who control him,” Rahul Gandhi said, adding that the country is run by farmers, labourers and the youth.He said if anyone “attacks” farmers, it is an attack on the country. The country’s farmers have maintained the country’s independence by ensuring food security and the day food security is lost, the country will lose its independence, Rahul Gandhi said.“This is a financial issue, not a political issue. PM Modi wants to hand over everything that farmers have to his corporate friends,” the Congress leader alleged.He also raised strong objections to protesting farmers being dubbed as “Khalistanis”.Thousands of farmers have come out to protest against the farm laws and “you should not have dubbed them as ‘Khalistanis’”, Rahul Gandhi said.Congress MP Bittu had earlier told reporters that it was Rahul Gandhi who had started the protests against the farm laws in Punjab and Haryana and had also undertook a tractor rally.The Congress is demanding a repeal of the farm laws, alleging that they are against the interests of farmers and farming and are aimed at helping only the “corporate friends” of the BJP.The three farm laws, enacted in September last year, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.Earlier, the brother and sister duo took part in the Raj Bhavan gherao, which the Delhi unit of the Congress organised today.“We will stand with farmers till the black laws are repealed and the government will have to budge,” Rahul said addressing party members.“These laws are not to help farmers but to destroy them. These laws have been drafted to aid corporates like Ambani and Adani,” Rahul Gandhi said.He said the government would have to rescind the laws.“The Congress will continue to stand with farmers till the time these laws are repealed. The government had earlier attempted to usurp farm lands by bringing the new land acquisition Act. Now the BJP and their corporate friends have again made a bid to attack the farmers and we will again stand against the government,” he said before leaving for the Jantar Mantar.Congress units from across India staged marches at state capitals today and gheraoed Raj Bhawans to protest against farm laws and fuel price hikes.The party is calling the protests Kisan Adhikar Divas.Agriculture Minister hits back at RahulUnion Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar hit back at Rahul Gandhi on Friday for his remarks against the Prime Minister over the farmers’ protest and said even the leaders of his own party do not take the Gandhi scion seriously and laugh at his remarks.Tomar, along with two other Union ministers, met the farmers protesting against three recent farm laws for the ninth round of talks today but the discussions did not reach a decisive stage.Addressing the media after the meeting with the farmers, Tomar said Gandhi’s statements and actions are laughed at even within his own party.“The Congress manifesto in 2019 itself had promised these reforms and therefore, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi should tell us whether they were lying then or are lying now,” he said. — with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-doesnt-respect-farmers-wants-to-tire-out-those-protesting-against-agri-laws-rahul-198871
16-01-2021||New Delhi||Centre wants unions to be more flexible, next meeting on Jan 19||Protesting farmer unions stuck to their demand for a complete repeal of the three contentious farm laws at the ninth round of talks with three central ministers — Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash. Tomar, who asked unions to be more flexible in approach, also told them that they should form “formal and informal groups and discuss the laws to prepare concrete proposals for discussions in the next meeting”. Also read: Govt wants farmer unions to form informal group to prepare concrete proposals: TomarPM doesn’t respect farmers, wants to tire out those protesting against agri laws: RahulFarmer leaders divided over tractor march on Republic DayFarm bills have potential to represent significant step forward for agriculture reforms in India: IMF He said the government is hopeful of discussions reaching a decisive stage in the tenth round on January 19.    Apparently, at one point during the five-hour plus meeting today, Tomar also asked unions when exactly the agitation will be called off and what will it take?  Tomar wanted to know if unions will withdraw the protests if one of the two main demands (that is, either MSP guarantee or repeal of the three laws) is met. He also said what is the point in discussing MSP when the repeal agenda is important enough that the ‘andolan’ will not be called off without that being acceded to.  Kavitha Kurunganti of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha said unions clarified that both are equally important demands and the next meeting’s agenda was fixed on both these points and not just one or the other.Both sides reaffirmed commitment to continue with the direct dialogue process, “It was reiterated that the resolution will happen only through this route. The government, of course, said that it is also bound by the Supreme Court processes,” Morcha leaders said.Dr Darshan Pal said they opposed the government’s claim that the Supreme Court should decide to repeal these laws.“The Lok Sabha is the house of people elected by the people of India.  These laws have been made by Parliament and should be repealed by Parliament,” he said.Unions said the two Cabinet ministers also “congratulated the movement for its disciplined and peaceful conduct so far” and also made it clear that the ongoing movement has nothing to do with Sikhs for Justice and therefore, there should be no projection from the government’s side also that they are involved”. There was also a discussion on “Home Ministry and state police repression on people associated as well as not associated with the ongoing movement, including NIA raids on transporters in Punjab  providing logistic support for the agitation,” said Joginder Singh Ugrahan. “The government promised that it will address the issue of questioning by NIA/Home Ministry and lodging of FIRs against protesters in the movement by Haryana government and the incident in Andhra Pradesh where BJP and Bajrang Dal workers disrupted a farmers’ protest,” Morcha leaders said.On the issue of ECA amendments, there was back and forth on particular provisions as well as the general direction of the amendments. “Piyush Goyal defended some amendments and also suggested that some changes can be made in that Act too without quite saying that amendments will be made,” said Kavitha. The government, she said, was not keen on discussing the MSP issue today. However, there was a discussion on the financial health of the FCI, on whether the Shantha Kumar Committee recommendations will be implemented, and whether there is a threat to the PDS system.Goyal said the government is in fact discussing ways of strengthening the FCI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-wants-unions-to-be-more-flexible-next-meeting-on-jan-19-198861

Pakistan is adamant on using terrorism as state policy, he said.President Ramnath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat have extended their wishes on Army Day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-one-should-try-to-test-our-patience-army-chief-on-ladakh-standoff-198851
