Nobody had the intention to dishonour the national flag. However, I have asked party members to be careful in the future,” Ghosh told reporters.Reacting to the incident, district TMC chief Anubrata Mondal said, “Those who cannot ensure proper unfurling of the national flag are not fit to run the country or a state.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-bjp-chief-unfurls-tricolour-upside-down-204038

26-01-2021||GS PAUL||Republic Day celebrated at Attari border sans spectators||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, January 26As India celebrated its 72nd Republic Day, the flag-hoisting, ceremonial drill and Beating Retreat was held at the joint check post at Attari.BSF Director General Rakesh Asthana graced the occasion which was incidentally his maiden visit to Punjab after assuming the charge.The occasion was celebrated in a low-key affair due to Covid-19 restrictions.The usual patriotic spirit of the occasion was a miss due to the absence of general spectators. Only the BSF troops and close associates of the defence and family members were allowed to sit in the gallery.Asthana also addressed the troops.Keeping in view the repeated instances of infiltration and smuggling attempts, the BSF is plugging the loopholes at the India-Pakistan border, he said.“BSF is the first line of defence committed to defending the country. We are in the process of upgrading every aspect of the operations of the BSF and our technology, including the anti-drone technology,” said Asthana.About the action being taken, post-detection of a tunnel near the fence in Jammu’s Pansar area, Asthana anticipated that more such tunnels could be there to push trained armed militants and other forbidden material into India. “The tunnel was a fact. We are constantly in the process of detecting more tunnels which are being used for not only pushing the contraband but also infiltration to India from the other side,” he said.A cross-border tunnel — around 150-metre-long and 30-foot-deep — was unearthed by the Border Security Force along the International Border in Jammu on January 23, the fourth such tunnel found in the past six months.Nonetheless, the BSF and Pakistan Rangers conducted the joint coordination parade as the tradition goes but the gallery was devoid of spectators in view of Covid-19 threat.The cultural programme was conducted, including the live band displayed by the BSF. The students of historic Khalsa College, Amritsar, performed bhangra and gidha on the occasion.The exchange of sweets with the Pakistani counterparts too was avoided due to the pandemic protocol.The BSF and Pakistan Rangers have not been exchanging sweets on special occasions at the border since India abrogated Article 370, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019.The troops at Attari-Wagah border had last exchanged sweets on Eid-ul-Fitr and on Republic Day in 2019.India and Pakistan had suspended the entry of spectators in view of Covid-19. On the Indian side, only the flag-lowering ceremony is conducted at sunset.Since March 7 last year, public was not allowed at the Attari border, though Pakistan has reopened its door for spectators from Wagah. Since then, Pakistan Rangers have been holding their daily military parade and ceremony on the normal course.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/republic-day-celebrated-at-attari-border-sans-spectators-204033

This would be to everyone's benefit as deeper integration with the region would enable greater access to significant opportunities," said Tan, congratulating India on its 72nd Republic Day, celebrations for which were held virtually by the Indian High Commissioner P Kumaran.India would always be a valued partner and a friend to Singapore, Tan said. "We look forward to strengthening this relationship in the years to come," he said, recalling India's relationship with the city-state since its independence in 1965.The 10-member countries of ASEAN are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.The ties between India and ASEAN have been on an upswing in the last few years with focus being on ramping up cooperation in the areas of trade and investment as well as security and defence."As our countries move towards the next stage of recovery from COVID-19, we look forward to working with India which is a key player in the global pharmaceutical supply chain," he said, noting the hard work put in by the two countries in keeping the supply chains open especially for essential goods such as health supplies and food."Our partnership is especially strong on the economic front. We will work with the Indian government to establish skill centres in different parts of India to expand on this area of cooperation. Indian companies in Singapore have played their parts through partnerships with us and the region. Similarly, Singapore companies have a vested interest in the bright potential and promise of India,” he said.The minister singled out Capitaland of Singapore, which is continuing to expand its presence in India, having commenced construction of an IT Park in Chennai in the middle of last year.In his address at the virtual Republic Day celebration, the High Commissioner Kumaran noted Singapore's interests in various economic development fields, with over 440 companies having registered in India and total investments of USD 106 billion.Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore has retained its position as the top source of FDI and FPI for India and Singapore companies continue to be interested in various fields from real estate, infrastructure, logistics, food processing and high technologies.Nearly 9,000 Indian companies are registered in Singapore, exploring business opportunities across markets in the region, said the envoy.

Don’t defame annadata, call an extremist an extremist only,” Patra tweeted as a section of protesting farmers broke the agreement with Delhi Police and indulged in hooliganism.Another BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam, who is also a Rajya Sabha member, asked if the “mob” should be called “terrorist”.“What a shame. Our brave policemen jumping the wall to save themselves from being lynched by a mob, yet showing remarkable display of restrain. What do you call this mob—Protesting farmers? Group of Anti Social or Anti National Elements or Simply Terrorist? You Decide!” he tweeted.Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan also said that the manner in which a crime was committed under the garb of agitation by some unruly elements, it was not acceptable at any cost.“LJP condemns this type of behaviour,” he tweeted.A tractor march meant to highlight farmers’ demands dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital on Tuesday, as hordes of rampaging protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult—hoisting a religious flag from the rampart of Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India’s Tricolour. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extremists-in-garb-of-food-providers-bjps-patra-on-violence-during-farmers-protest-204029

26-01-2021||New Delhi||I feel ashamed and take responsibility: Yogendra Yadav on violence during tractor parade||Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav said he felt “ashamed” of the way the farmers’ tractor parade turned out on Tuesday, and took responsibility for it.“Being a part of the protest,” he said, “I feel ashamed of the way things proceeded and I take responsibility of it.” The tractor march meant to highlight farmers’ demands dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as hordes of rampaging protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult—hoisting a religious flag from the rampart of Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India’s tricolour.“Violence impacts any kind of protest in a wrong way. I cannot say at the moment who did it and who did not, but prima facie it looks like it has been done by the people that we kept out of the farmers’ protest,” Yadav told a TV channel.“I appealed continuously that we stick to whatever route was decided and not deviate. Only if the movement goes peacefully, we will be able to win,” said Yadav, who has been supporting the farmers’ agitation against the new agriculture laws.Tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police in multiple places, leading to chaos in well-known landmarks of Delhi and suburbs, amid waves of violence that ebbed and flowed through the day, leaving the farmers’ two-month peaceful movement in tatters.Farmer leaders, who have been spearheading the protest at the national capital’s border points to demand a repeal of the farm laws, distanced themselves from the protests that had taken such an unseemly turn and threatened to shift public sympathy from their movement.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions, alleged that some “antisocial elements” infiltrated their otherwise peaceful movement.

26-01-2021||New Delhi||Opposition blames Centre for capital siege, hopes farm unions will reclaim the agitation||Major opposition parties on Tuesday united against the government blaming its insensitivity for the capital siege by farmers on Tuesday and demanded immediate repeal of the farm laws that have agitated the protesters for over 61 days now.The Congress, NCP and Trinamool Congress led the charge against the BJP government and termed the developments in Delhi as “painful”.While the Congress said there was no place for violence in a democracy, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee said the developments in Delhi were worrying and painful. NCP’s Sharad Pawar too laid the blame at the Centre’s doors asking why the government could not secure the capital and anticipate the violence.CPM’s Sitaram Yechury slammed the Centre for mishandling the farmers’ issues and said the Republic is of the public and the tantra (establishment) in Ganatantra has no meaning without the gana (people).“The farmers’ protests are for a legitimate demand of millions. That remains the issue at hand and must be resolved,” Yechury said adding that violence in any form is unacceptable.All opposition stalwarts went on to seek the repeal of farm laws blaming today’s developments in the “undemocratic passage of the legislations”.Congress’ media chief Randeep Surjewala asked the protesters to keep their goals in mind welcoming Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s decisions to dissociate from violent elements.“Non-violence is the biggest strength of the farmer agitation. We hope that this farmer-labourer alliance will remain committed to peaceful means for the repeal of the anti-agriculture laws,” said Surjewala asking the government if it was justified in holding inconclusive talks with farmer leaders without ever heeding to their demands of repeal.“It is clear that the people are anguished with the government and the 61-day-old face-off between the people and the system is not good for our democracy. The abiding message of the Republic Day is that the government must listen to the people, shun its arrogance and rescind the laws,” said the Congress general secretary referring to the 61-day peaceful farmer’s agitation and the death of 175 farmers in the process.West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said the government had been extremely casual in dealing with the farmers and must repeal the laws now. That said, the opposition remains in a wait and watch mode and is hoping the agitation redeems its reputation as peaceful and genuine, as the Budget Session of Parliament approaches.All eyes are on the morchas parked at Delhi’s borders to see if they can tame the unruly elements that have infiltrated the protests. This remains a challenge after Samyukta Kisan Morcha failed miserably in ensuring a peaceful tractor parade today.Although the Morcha abruptly called off the tractor parade this evening, the question everyone was asking is who is listening to them.The government for its part is waiting for things to pan out in the coming days with the Delhi Police earning praise across social media for restraint in the face of grave provocations today.The police released a list of 41 personnel injured in the clashes with the farmers and has begun assessing losses on persons and of property.The government will weigh the public sentiment on the matter before making the next moves as the law takes its course against elements that ran rampage in the capital on Republic Day.Farm unions for their part returned to the borders tonight to mull what went wrong and how to reclaim the narrative.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-blames-centre-for-capital-siege-hopes-farm-unions-will-reclaim-the-agitation-204025

Let us try something similar,” remarked Saroj, who had invited Anjali Kumari to the function.The trainee IPS seemed hugely impressed with the achievements of Anjali Kumari, a Class 9 student of Vivekanand Public School here, who has been learning karate for the past six years and has represented Bihar in a number of national competitions.Her feats include a bronze medal at a competition held in Alwar, Rajasthan, last year and the gold at Hyderabad in 2019.The girl draws her inspiration from her father Manoj, who is a local karate coach.“Community policing is the future of the society. And by exposing the young to the workings of the police we will be taking an important step in that direction”, said Saroj while handing over the charge to the girl.Officials like Sub Divisional Officer Uttam Kumar, Deputy Superintendent of Police Bir Dhirendra and Block Development Officer Vikash Kumar, who were present on the occasion, clapped enthusiastically.“Residents of the localities under the jurisdiction of the police station should, for the day, come to Anjali with their complaints. She would take a decision on these in her own way”, said Saroj after which the girl was escorted inside the SHOs chamber where she took the seat, presenting a picture of confidence.Within minutes came the first complainant.Vikas Paswan, a resident of Bhagatpur locality, came up with an application requesting the help of the police in decongesting the road in front of the local high school which witnesses traffic jams on a regular basis.Like a seasoned SHO, Anjali put her forwarding note on the application drawing attention of the official concerned. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihars-13-year-old-karate-girl-becomes-sho-of-police-station-for-a-day-204017

Its firm stand is that all issues can be resolved through talks, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-minister-kataria-condemns-violence-on-r-day-calls-for-strict-action-against-rioters-204013
26-01-2021||Ghazipur border||In Ghazipur farmers, leaders dwell on violence||The normal bouncy Ghazipur protest site has fallen silent. The blaring music from the speakers is missing and so are the enthusiastic dancers. Discussions are centering around the circumstances regarding the death of a farmer in ITO and whether it was right for unfurling of “Nishan Sahib” at the Red Fort.“We shouldn’t have done that. We were to keep discipline and I am sorry to say that we were not able to show that we are disciplined,” Mahendra Singh Mukati, from Ujjain said.Farmers and leaders are also looking for answers after violent scenes put paid to their agitation and brought a bad name to the protest site.The leaders pointed fingers at a political party from western Uttar Pradesh for foisting troubles on Tuesday. “Few miscreants from a political party joined the rally and created trouble to bring us a bad name,” Rajpal Sharma, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Tikait), said.“But I must say the violence has brought the farm protest a bad name and we are all sad about it,” he added.Sharma added that the protest site is in mourning. “The boy who died today was from our protest site too and we are in mourning,” he said.However, BKU activist Dharmendra Malik called out Rashtriya Lok Dal for all the violence. “We know they were from RLD. The same lot was involved in skirmishes at the Loni border yesterday,” Malik said.Malik stated that the police was blamed for removing barriers from the roads that were not part of the cleared route.“Where was the need for the police to remove barriers on the Ghazipur flyover when we were to start from bottom of the flyover,” he said.“Once that happened it became very hard for any of us to control the crowd and every advisory and instructions we issued went out of the window,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-ghazipur-farmers-leaders-dwell-on-violence-204011
26-01-2021||New Delhi||Left parties condemn violence during farmers’ rally, blame govt for letting things go out of hand||Left leaders on Tuesday condemned the violence that broke out on the streets of the capital during the tractor rally of farmers, but squarely blamed the government for letting the situation deteriorate. The Delhi Police had given permission to farmers protesting the agri reforms to hold their tractor parade on selected routes only after the official Republic Day parade on the Rajpath concluded.Deviating from the designated route for the tractor parade, protesting farmers reached the Red Fort and hoisted flags from some domes of the iconic monument in the national capital.They earlier clashed with the police at ITO while trying to enter Lutyen’s Delhi. The police used tear gas shells and lathi-charge to dispel the violent farmers.“The situation has been brought to this pass by the Modi government. Farmers have been protesting peacefully in the cold for more than 60 days, not allowed to come into Delhi and more than 100 kisans are dead,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in a tweet.“Violence in no form is an answer & is unacceptable. A govt which smears dissent, BJP’s troll army vilify those who ask for their rights, ministers make wild allegations, law officers make claims without basis in court—this is no way to deal with legitimate demands of our Kisans,” he said.  Yechury further said three farm laws must be immediately repealed and the announcement to that should be made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself.“The Republic is of the public. The tantra (establishment) in Ganatantra has no meaning without the gana (the people). The protests are for a legitimate demand of millions of our farmers from various states across the country. That remains the issue at hand, and must be resolved. The solution is clear - repeal these farm laws,” he said.CPI general secretary D Raja too said violence was no way for either party to deal with the situation, but also blamed the Centre for letting things go out of hand.“The farmers have been agitating for almost 60 days and it has been peaceful and nonviolent. When they were stopped at the borders, they sat there. Now after negotiations, they were allowed to have the rally on agreed routes, then why did the police not ensure that they took the designated path? The incident should have been averted. For this it is the government that is to blame,” he said. “The government should have assured the farmers that in the forthcoming parliament session they will move bill to withdraw the three laws. Modi should be blamed for letting farmers be treated like this. The farmers have said that the laws are not in the interest of the country, but for the corporates,” Raja said.Farmers’ union body Samyukta Kisan Morcha has, however, disassociated itself from those who indulged in violence during the tractor parade, and alleged that some “antisocial elements” infiltrated their otherwise peaceful movement.  The union also condemned and regretted the “undesirable” and “unacceptable” events as the parade turned violent after several groups of farmers deviated from the pre-decided route for the march.

26-01-2021||Bhopal||Uma Bharti, Pragya Thakur seek renaming of some places in Bhopal||Senior BJP leader Uma Bharti and the party’s Lok Sabha member Pragya Singh Thakur have demanded renaming of certain places located in and around Bhopal, including Halali Dam and Islam Nagar.Bharti on Monday sought renaming of Halali Dam, a popular picnic spot located on the outskirts of Bhopal, saying the current name conveys a sense of “betrayal and hatred”.Pragya Thakur, the BJP Lok Sabha member from Bhopal, on Tuesday backed Bharti’s demand and also sought change in names of some other places, including Lal Ghati and Islam Nagar, in the Madhya Pradesh capital.Bharti has written a letter to Berasia BJP MLA Vishnu Khatri, saying the name “Halali” is an “expression of betrayal, deception and inhumanity inhistorical perspective”.The former Union minister urged Khatri to take up the issue of name change with Minister for Culture and Tourism Usha Thakur.The dam falls under the Berasia Assembly segment of Bhopal district.In her letter, Bharti said Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the state of Bhopal, had killed his friendly kings at Halali, where water of the nearby river had turned red due to their blood.“So the name of this place evokes a sense of hatred,” the former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister said.The BJP leader said as per her knowledge, the name of the place has been changed, but it’s not reflected on signboards put up by the authorities.On the other hand, MLA Khatri told PTI that the name of the water body is Samrat Ashok Dam in government records.But the Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation still writes the place as Halali Dam on their signboards, he said.The ruling party MLA said he has written a letter to Minister Usha Thakur urging her to change the name of the site (to Samrat Ashok Dam) as per government records.Meanwhile, Pragya Thakur backed Bharti’s demand and sought change in names of some other places, too.Local residents have demanded that the name of Islam Nagar be changed because there was no such place earlier. Lal Ghati was named because of the blood of Dost Mohammed Khans son.“Halali was named so as Hindu kings were killed there.These all names should be changed and real history would be re-established.“Uma didi is making efforts in this regard (for renaming). I am also making efforts in this direction,” the Lok Sabha MP said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uma-bharti-pragya-thakur-seek-renaming-of-some-places-in-bhopal-204006

26-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police appeal to farmers to shun violence, return to agreed route||In a first official statement since morning on the troubled day in the National Capital, the Delhi Police have appealed to protesting farmers to shun violence and go back to their agreed route, while maintaining that the forces have acted in accordance with agreement reached with them at the time of granting permission to hold tractor parade.“Our forces have acted and made arrangements as per the conditions agreed between the farmers’ leaders and the officials. Till now our forces have showed extreme restraint, but protesting farmers have disregarded all the agreed norms for holding the rally,” they said in the statement.The police alleged that farmers began their rally well before the time agreed upon and have chosen to indulge in violence and other unlawful activities, which led to huge loss of public properties.“Thus we appeal to them to leave the path of violence and go back to the already agreed route for the tractor rally,” the police statement read.Delhi's Joint Commissioner of Police Alok Kumar claimed several attempts were made to run over cops and the law will take its course against those who damaged property and assaulted public servants on duty.“Elements in today’s protests were very aggressive. Those who assaulted the cops and damaged public property will be dealt with strongly,” Kumar said.He said several physical barriers were erectedto ensure the tractor parade went to plan plan and the police trusted the farm union leaders who assured a peaceful agitation.“Many rounds of meetings were held with the leaders and they assured us of the route being followed. Such large demonstrations are based on trust but the trust was betrayed. At Ghazipur, we tried to convince the farmers for two hours to return as per the decided route. We even used tear gas shells but the aggressive farmers violated all agreements and broke barricades marching inside Delhi where the cops and the farmers kept clashing through the day,” he said.Kumar said the situation in most parts had normalised but several farmers were still in Delhi and the police had appealed to them to return to the Borders.A police spokesperson put number of policemen wounded in the clashes at 83---42 of these at the Red Fort.Police later conducted a flag march, which Commissioner of Police SN Shrivastava personally led, in ITO---one of the scenes of Tuesday's chaos, where a protester died in what police say was an accident. Until evening, some farmers were still in the area with the body of a protester who police claim died after the speeding truck he was driving turned turtle.Shrivastava had ordered his men to deal with "trouble makers" in all parts of the city and bring things under control.It is also learnt that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has ordered deployment of 15 additional battalions of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) of which 10 are being drawn from CRPF and five from other forces. One battalion comprises of 100 personnel.Meanwhile, police said traffic flow that was affected by the events of the day is slowly returning to normal. NH 24 & 9, DND and Barapula elevated roads are being opened for normal traffic, police said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-appeal-to-farmers-to-shun-violence-return-to-agreed-route-203998
26-01-2021||Hyderabad||Not ‘100 pc satisfied’ with Mahavir Chakra awarded to Col Santosh Babu, says his father||The father of late Colonel Santosh Babu on Monday said he was “not 100 per cent satisfied” with the Mahavir Chakra posthumously awarded to him for his acts of gallantry against the Chinese attack in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in June 2020, and that he should have been honoured with the Param Vir Chakra.“It is not that I am unhappy. But I am not 100 per cent satisfied (with the award of Mahavir Chakra). There is scope for honouring him in a better way.But my opinion is that Santosh Babu should have been named for the highest military award Param Vir Chakra for the gallantry he displayed while discharging his duties,” Babu’s father B Upendra told PTI.He said the valor shown by his son had inspired many people, including those working in the defence forces.Colonel Babu, the commanding officer of the 16 Bihar regiment, was among 20 Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 last year in the Galwan Valley, an incident that marked one of the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.Upendra said his son, overcoming the challenges posed by the climatic conditions of the area where he was posted, fought with Chinese troops.“My son and his men fought barehanded. He proved that India is superior and stronger than China by killing more enemy soldiers,” he said.According to him, Col Babu’s family did not get anything more than the departmental benefits that are usually given to the families of martyred soldiers, from the Centre.The Telangana Government gave Rs 5 crore ex-gratia to Santosh Babu’s family, besides Group-I post to his wife and a residential plot.

This is New India for me. I am recording this for my grandchildren who are too little to understand its importance now. I am sure they will thank me for this later," said Anita Batwal, 62, retired school teacher.Many bystanders who witnessed the parade termed the farmers their brothers and guests who were fighting for their rights."My husband and I have come to welcome them. They are our guests. We lost our land in UP in a court battle, we know their pain," said Kamla from Boodhpur Delhi.A large number of people near Anand Vihar railway station lined the roadsides and recorded the tractor parade as farmers from Ghazipur drove past. People cheered and waved at the farmers riding tractors and those walking on foot."It is bigger and better than what we expected.

Will do whatever it takes to help them in their struggle. They are fighting for all of us. This is just a little contribution from our end to tell them we stand by them,” said Chant Singh, 45, a local distributing food and water.The whole nation, in fact people across the world should know about this "farmers' revolution" taking place here in Delhi, said 32-year-old Jaskaran Bajwa who was busy making Facebook Live while sitting atop a brand new tractor. The people as well as the farmers recorded the parade using cellphones, with many saying history was being scripted.

26-01-2021||New Delhi||Ayodhya on Rajpath: UP's R-Day tableau showcases replica of Ram temple, city's cultural heritage||The cultural heritage of ancient holy town Ayodhya, a replica of a Ram temple, glimpse of 'Deepotsav' and various stories from Ramayana epic were depicted in the tableau of Uttar Pradesh in the Republic Day parade on Rajpath on Tuesday.The bedecked tableau was fronted by a sitting model of Maharishi Valmiki and the temple model occupied a large portion on the rear side."Ayodhya is our holy place and the Ram temple issue has been an emotive one for the faithful. Our tableau showcased the ancient heritage of the temple town, revered by countless people across the country," an official of the Uttar Pradesh government, accompanying the state team, said.A group of artists, including many dressed as saints, accompanied the tableau.Tableaux from a total of 17 states and union territories were showcased at the Republic Day celebrations, whose scale this year was severely curtailed on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.Strict safety protocols and social distancing norms were in place."I am very excited and happy that Ayodhya and its heritage will be showcased in our tableau," Ajay Kumar, a member of the UP tableau team, had earlier said."We have been waiting to see Ayodhya's heritage being showcased on Rajpath," said Kumar, a resident of Laxmangarh in Chandauli district, as he posed for photographers.Ayodhya's Deepotsav celebrations, which found its name in the Guinness Book of Records, was depicted on one side of the tableau with earthen lamps, while other murals showed embracing of Nishadraj by Lord Ram and eating of Shabri's berry by him, the salvation of Ahilya, bringing of Sanjeevani by Lord Hanuman, Jatayu-Ram samvad, Ashok Vatika and other scenes.   On November 9, 2019, the Supreme Court had settled the fractious Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue, going back more than a century, and backed the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site. It also had ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town.Prime Minister Narendra Modi last August had performed the 'bhoomi pujan' of a Supreme Court-mandated Ram temple in Ayodhya, bringing to fruition the BJP's mandir movement that defined its politics for three decades and took it to the heights of power.The Ram temple is scheduled for completion in 2023.

26-01-2021||United Nations||Indian economy estimated to grow at 7.3 per cent in 2021: UN||India's economy is projected to grow at 7.3 per cent in 2021, even as it is estimated to contract by 9.6 per cent in 2020 as lockdowns and other efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic slashed domestic consumption, the UN has said.The World Economic Situation and Prospects 2021, produced by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), said the world economy was hit by a once-in-a-century crisis—a Great Disruption unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.The global economy shrank by 4.3 per cent last year, over two-and-a-half times more than during the global financial crisis of 2009. The modest recovery of 4.7 per cent expected in 2021 would barely offset the losses of 2020."The devastating socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for years to come unless smart investments in economic, societal and climate resilience ensure a robust and sustainable recovery of the global economy,” the report said.The Indian economy, which grew at 4.7 per cent in 2019, will contract by 9.6 per cent in calendar year 2020, “as lockdowns and other containment efforts slashed domestic consumption without halting the spread of the disease, despite drastic fiscal and monetary stimulus".India's economic growth is forecast to be 7.3 per cent in 2021, the fastest growing major economy with only China coming in a close second with a 7.2 per cent projected growth rate in calendar year 2021, the report said.According to the fiscal year estimates released in the report, India's economy is estimated to decline by 5.7 per cent in 2020 and will return to a 7 per cent growth rate in fiscal year 2021, slowing down again to 5.6 per cent in 2022.The report said economic growth in South Asia in 2021 will be insufficient, at 6.9 per cent, to make up for the losses of 2020, as pandemic hotspots re-emerge and, increasingly, the ability of governments to deal with the multitude of challenges becomes exhausted.“The pandemic and the global economic crisis have consequently left deep marks on South Asia, turning this former growth champion into the worst performing region in 2020.“While trade, remittances and investment are expected to pick up in 2021, as much of the global economy moves towards recovery from the widespread lockdown, investment and domestic consumption in many South Asian countries will nevertheless remain subdued owing to the continuing threat of the pandemic and the scarring effects of the crisis,” it said.

Contractual supplies to various countries are also being undertaken in a phased manner. We will also gradually supply to the COVAX facility of the WHO,” Naidu said, adding that India has also provided training to several partner countries to strengthen their clinical capabilities, as well as to enhance their capacities for vaccine administration.COVAX is the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level.Last week, COVAX had announced that, pending WHO emergency use listings, nearly 150 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate are anticipated to be available in the first quarter of 2021, via existing agreements with the Serum Institute of India (SII) and AstraZeneca.Naidu told the Council that India has assisted more than 150 countries through urgent health and medical supplies.New Delhi has pledged 15 million dollars for GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and operationalised the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for its neighbours with an initial contribution of 10 million dollars. “In the spirit of South-South cooperation, through the USD 150 million India-UN Development Partnership Fund, we have responded to member states' requests for COVID-19 related assistance,” Naidu said.Naidu underscored that while the pandemic continues to rage across the world, 2021 has started on a positive note with many countries having initiated the vaccination process.He, however, cautioned that “no one is safe, till everyone is safe. Our endeavor should be to work towards making the vaccine accessible on a universal, equitable and affordable basis.”           Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives have received India's COVID-19 vaccines under grant assistance in sync with its “Neighbourhood First” policy.India has already rolled out a massive coronavirus vaccination drive under which two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, are being administered to frontline health workers across the country.Last week, Bangladesh and Nepal received COVID-19 vaccines from India.India sent 150,000 doses of Covisheild vaccines to Bhutan and 100,000 doses to the Maldives, while over 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were provided to Bangladesh, about one million doses to Nepal. Myanmar received over one million doses and Sri Lanka 500,000.On Friday, India began commercial exports of COVID-19 vaccines and sent two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has thanked India for supplying COVID-19 vaccines to his country and shared on social media an illustration of Lord Hanuman bringing 'Sanjivani booti' from India to Brazil.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had replied through a tweet that “The honour is ours, President @jairbolsonaro to be a trusted partner of Brazil in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic together. We will continue to strengthen our cooperation on healthcare.”       In keeping with India's stated commitment to use India's vaccine production and delivery capacity to help all of humanity fight the COVID pandemic, supplies under grant assistance to Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles began from January 20 under the initiative termed “Vaccine Maitri”.                 The MEA said that in an ongoing effort, India will continue to supply countries all over the world with vaccines. “This will be calibrated against domestic requirements and international demand and obligations, including under GAVI's Covax facility to developing countries,” the MEA had said in a statement.

Now, I want to understand why an inquiry hasn’t started? Rahul Gandhi“PM Narendra Modi is the person through whom prior information on the 2019 IAF strikes in Balakot was made available to Goswami,” alleged Rahul during a roadshow in Tamil Nadu’s Karur.The BJP hit back with the party’s IT cell head, Amit Malviya, attacking Rahul for his comments in Tamil Nadu that Indian workers could replace the Army on the borders with China.Rahul Gandhi, commenting on the LAC standoff in Tamil Nadu, said, “If you use India’s labourers, India’s farmers, India’s workers, you will not need the Indian Army, Navy and Air force to be standing over there. China will not have the guts to come inside.”Malviya retorted to the above comments saying, “Muhammad Imran, who was translating Rahul Gandhi’s speech, fainted and had to be taken to a hospital. Honestly, who would be able to stay the course after hearing such ridiculous ideas.”On Arnab chat leaks, Rahul asked today as to why the PM was not ordering a probe.“The only reason the PM is not ordering a probe is because he is the person through whom that message has gone to this journalist. Today, the Chinese army is sitting inside the Indian territory. The PM does not have the courage to say the word China.” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-leaked-balakot-info-to-arnab-alleges-rahul-203727

High Courts are constitutional courts,” it noted. As the Bench wasn’t included to entertain the transfer petition, senior advocate PS Narasimha, representing the UP Government, chose to withdraw it and accordingly the petition was “dismissed as withdrawn”.The Uttar Pradesh Government had moved the Supreme Court last week seeking transfer of petitions challenging its ordinance aimed at checking unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages.The state government had invoked Article 139A of the Constitution, which empowers the Supreme Court to transfer to itself cases “involving the same or substantially the same questions of law” pending before the top court and one or more HCs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-transfer-love-jihad-law-pleas-203730

26-01-2021||New Delhi||India FDI inflow rises 13%, China by 4%; Israel & Spain also in positive territory||The UN has noted that India and China have largely bucked the world-wide trend of falling foreign direct investment (FDI) during the pandemic period. India, a major emerging economy, recorded positive growth of 13 per cent in FDI, boosted by investments in the digital sector, according to the UNCTAD Investment Trends Monitor.Overall, global FDI collapsed in 2020, falling 42 per cent from $ 1.5 trillion in 2019 to an estimated $859 billion.However, China was the world’s largest FDI recipient, with flows rising by 4 per cent to $ 163 billion due to increased activity in high-tech industries, cross-border mergers and acquisitions, mostly in ICT and pharma.India and Turkey are attracting record numbers of deals in IT consulting and digital sectors, including e-commerce platforms, data processing services and digital payments.Some 80 per cent of the acquiring firms are based in developed economies, primarily in Europe, but a few multinational enterprises from developing countries are also active buyers.The US recorded a 49 per cent drop in FDI, falling to an estimated $ 134 billion. The decline took place in wholesale trade, financial services and manufacturing. Cross-border M&A sales of US assets to foreign investors fell by 41 per cent, mostly in the primary sector.Flows to Australia fell (-46 per cent to $22 billion) but increased for Israel (from $18 billion to $26 billion) and Japan (from $15 billion to $17 billion).Investment to Europe dried up. Flows fell by two-thirds to minus $ 4 billion. In the UK, FDI fell to zero, and declines were recorded in other major recipients. But the overall performance masked a few regional bright spots like Sweden (flows double to $ 29 billion) and Spain (rose 52 per cent).Such a low level was last seen in the 1990s and is more than 30 per cent below the investment trough that followed the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.China recently reported a 6.5 per cent gain in GDP for the fourth quarter of 2020. This pushed its growth for the full year to 2.3 per cent and has put it in a leading position after nearly a year of pandemic-induced downturn, noted the UN.Although FDI flows to developing economies decreased by 12 per cent to an estimated $ 616 billion, they accounted for 72 per cent of global FDI—the highest share on record.The fall was highly uneven across developing regions: -37 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean, -18 per cent in Africa and -4 per cent in developing countries in Asia while FDI to transition economies declined by 77 per cent to $13 billion.While developing countries in Asia weathered the storm well as a group, attracting an estimated $476 billion in FDI in 2020, flows to members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) contracted by 31 per cent to $ 107 billion, due to a decline in investment to the largest recipients in the sub-region.According to the report, the decline in FDI was concentrated in developed countries, where flows plummeted by 69 per cent to an estimated $ 229 billion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-fdi-inflow-rises-13-china-by-4-israel-spain-also-in-positive-territory-203527

26-01-2021||New Delhi||Republic Day eve address: President backs farm laws; salutes farmers, jawans, scientists||President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday saluted the farmers, soldiers and scientists for ensuring food, border and health security of all Indians and backed the farm reform legislations terming them “much awaited”.In his 72nd Republic Day address to the nation, the President said the government’s commitment to farmers’ welfare remains undoubted.Hailing the farmers for making India self-reliant in food grains and dairy products and sustaining agricultural production despite COVID 19, the President said a “grateful nation is fully committed to the welfare of our farmers”.He went on to back the agriculture reform laws noting that economic reforms have continued apace and have been supplemented by long-pending reforms in the areas of labour and agriculture through legislation.“The path to reform at the initial stages may cause misapprehensions. However, it is beyond doubt that the government remains singularly devoted to farmers’ welfare,” said the President amid a raging agitation by farmers who will take out a tractor parade against farm laws tomorrow.The President in his address spoke of brave soldiers of the armed forces who ensure the security of national boundaries amid severest conditions.“From the freezing cold at Siachen and Galwan Valley in Ladakh with temperatures as low as minus 50 to 60 degree Celsius to the scorching heat in Jaisalmer with temperatures as high as 50 degree Celsius – on land, in the skies and at the vast coastal areas – our warriors are vigilant every moment. Every citizen feels proud about the bravery, patriotism and the spirit of sacrifice among our soldiers,” said the President, hailing Indian scientists for strengthening national endeavours and especially for decoding the coronavirus and developing vaccines in record time.Urging every Indian to take the vaccine once their time comes, the President said 2020 should be taken as a year of learning.Saluting doctors, administrators and other COVID warriors who helped keep the fatality rate lower in India compared to the developed countries, the President said, “Our farmers, soldiers and scientists deserve special appreciation and a grateful nation greets them.”On the country’s efforts to fight COVID-19, the President said an effective response to the pandemic would not have been possible without the constitutional value of ‘Fraternity’ among the people of the country.He also took pride in the fact that India was called as “pharmacy of the world” for supplying medicine to several countries to contain sufferings across the globe.He felt that after about a year of this “unforeseen ordeal”, India today stands “not despondent but confident”.                 Paying tributes to the 20 Indian soldiers who laid down their lives at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh last June during clashes with the Chinese troops, the President said the past year “was a time of adversity, and it came from many fronts”.                  “We faced an expansionist move on our borders, but our valiant soldiers foiled it. To achieve this objective, 20 of them had to lay down their lives.”                 Kovind said the nation shall remain grateful to those brave soldiers.“Though we reiterate our commitment to peace, our defence forces – Army, Air Force and Navy – are adequately mobilised in a well-coordinated move to thwart any attempt to undermine our security. Our national interest will be protected at all costs. We have also ensured a widespread understanding in the international community of India’s firm and principled stand,” the President said.India and China are locked in a nearly nine-month long military standoff in eastern Ladakh.He said adversity often plays the role of a great teacher and makes people stronger and more confident. With that confidence, India has taken great strides in several sectors.“Economic reforms have continued apace and have been supplemented by long-pending reforms in the areas of labour and agriculture through legislation. The path to reform at the initial stages may cause misapprehensions. However, it is beyond doubt that the government remains singularly devoted to farmers’ welfare,” he added.Kovind said India is moving ahead and taking its rightful place in the world.“During the recent years, its arc of influence has been expanding and encompassing the larger part of the world. The manner in which India got overwhelming support of the international community for its entry as non-permanent member in the Security Council this year is indicative of that influence.”    He said the engagement with world leaders has enhanced manifold and India, with its vibrant democracy, has rightfully earned its respect as a responsible and trustworthy nation. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/republic-day-eve-address-president-backs-farm-laws-salutes-farmers-jawans-scientists-203521

Tomorrow, they are planning to hoist the flag and submit a memorandum to the Governor.Sources say a lot depends upon the way the situation unfolds tomorrow.The sources said the government may “reach out” to unions once the tractor rally “passes off peacefully”. “They (unions) have been allowed to have their way (on Republic Day),” they add. Tomar maintains that 11 rounds of dialogue have not yielded result because of “some farmer unions from Punjab”.“A few farmer unions, majority of which are from Punjab,” had objections to the laws.

What is happening Mr. Mehta?...Three-week is unreasonable. We asked you to decide before January 26."The Solicitor General said, "The decision going either way will have some repercussions in the present circumstances."The Bench agreed to grant two weeks as a last chance for the government to decide the matter.On behalf of the petitioner, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi for petitioner opposed Mehta's request, saying, "The man (Rajoana) is in jail for 25 years. His mercy plea has been pending for over eight years.""He is in jail for killing a chief minister," replied Mehta.Convicted of assassinating Beant Singh in 1995, Rajoana has been in jail for 25 years awaiting his execution. The former Punjab Chief Minister and 16 others were killed in an explosion outside the Civil Secretariat in Chandigarh in 1995.Rajaona was sentenced to death in 2007 by a special court. His mercy petition under Article 72 of the Constitution is hanging fire for eight years.The Supreme Court had on January 8 asked the Centre to decide by January 26 Rajoana's plea for commuting the death penalty awarded to him in former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh''s assassination case.It had said the decision had to be taken before the Republic Day which was a "good date"."We will give two-three weeks. You should complete the process before January 26. January 26 is a good day.  It will be appropriate if you take a decision before that," the CJI had said.Maintaining that Pendency of appeals by co-accused has no bearing on Presidential pardon granted to a death-row convict, the Supreme Court had on December 4 questioned the Centre over delay in sending proposal to the President for commuting Rajoana’s death penalty.Once the Centre has decided to recommend Presidential pardon for a death row convict, the pendency of appeals of his co-accused can’t be a reason to delay the clemency proceedings, it had said."Appeal of other co-accused has no relevance to the decision to commute the death sentence of some convicts taken to commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev," it had noted.The court’s comments had come after the Centre said the proposal to commute death sentence was not sent to the President as appeal of other co-accused was pending and the convict himself hadn't filed an appeal.Citing Devender Pal Singh Bhullar’s case, the petitioner has claimed that the "Delay caused by circumstances beyond the prisoners’ control mandates commutation of death sentence.” The inordinate delay caused agony and adversely affected his physical and mental health, Rajaona contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-gives-centre-14-days-to-decide-on-rajoanas-mercy-plea-203439
26-01-2021||---||Indian, Chinese troops had 'minor face-off' in Sikkim, issue resolved, says Army||New Delhi, January 25Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in a "minor face-off" at Naku La area in North Sikkim on January 20 and it was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols, the Indian Army said on Monday.The incident in Sikkim came amid the prolonged military standoff between the two sides in eastern Ladakh that erupted on May 5."It is clarified that there was a minor face-off at Naku La area of North Sikkim on January 20 and the same was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols. Media is requested to refrain from overplaying or exaggerating reports which are factually incorrect," the Army said in a brief statement.People familiar with the developments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in North Sikkim said the Chinese troops attempted to transgress into the Indian side of the frontier but were stopped by the Indian military personnel.They also said a brawl had broken out between the troops of the two armies.Naku La was the same site where the Indian and Chinese troops had engaged in a fierce clash on May 9 last year following a violent face-off between the two sides in Pangong lake area that triggered the military standoff in eastern Ladakh.The Indian and Chinese armies on Sunday held another round of Corps Commander-level talks with an aim to move forward on disengagement of troops from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh.Following the Ladakh standoff, the Indian Army has significantly bolstered its strength at all its bases along the nearly 3,500 KM-long LAC, the de-facto border between the two nuclear-powered Asian giants.India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the icy heights of eastern Ladakh.Close to 100,000 Indian and Chinese troops are deployed in eastern Ladakh as both sides have been holding on to their ground and showing readiness for a long-haul, amid continuing diplomatic and military talks to find an amicable solution.Reflecting India's firm approach in handling the situation, Army chief Gen MM Naravane had said nearly two weeks ago that Indian troops will hold their ground as long as it takes to achieve the "national goals and objectives" even as he hoped for an amicable resolution of the border standoff through talks.
