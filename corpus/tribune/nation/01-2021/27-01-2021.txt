27-01-2021||New Delhi||HC questions CBI of moving late for permission to examine foreign national in case against Tytler||The Delhi High Court Wednesday questioned the CBI for approaching at a belated stage, seeking permission to examine a foreign national through video conferencing as a witness in a case involving Congress leader Jagdish Tytler and arms dealer Abhishek Verma for allegedly writing a forged letter addressed to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2009.The high court said allowing CBI’s plea to examine C Edmond Allen, a foreign national, will lead to ‘de novo’ trial as the subordinate court has already fixed the case for final arguments.“For bringing a witness, you have to spend money. He (Allen) was asking for business class flight tickets and other things for the last three years. Now when everything is complete, you have come here,” Justice Yogesh Khanna said.The charge sheet was filed by CBI on a complaint of then Minister of State for Home Ajay Maken, alleging a forged letter on his letterhead was addressed to Manmohan Singh seeking easing of business visa norms in 2009.Verma and Tytler were named in the charge sheet for the offence of attempting to cheat under IPC and a provision of Prevention of Corruption Act.The high court was informed that the Supreme Court had fixed the time of one year for completing trial in the case which has already expired in 2019 and allowing examination of the witness would start the trial de novo.Regarding this, CBI counsel Anil Grover said he has instructions to say that they do not intend to seek enhancement of time from the Supreme Court for completion of time as the same is not required.However, the court observed: “Why are you shying away from going to the Supreme Court”.   An intervention application was also filed by Allen, through advocate Harshvardhan Jha, seeking to be heard in the matter.The plea was opposed by advocates Anurabh Chowdhury and Maninder Singh, who were representing Tytler and Verma respectively, saying that Allen has been evading law since 2016 and now he has come up with this application at a belated stage.The high court was hearing CBI’s plea challenging a trial court’s October 23, 2020, order by which its plea to examine C Edmond Allen, a foreign national, was dismissed.The plea was opposed by advocates Maninder Singh and Dinhar Takiar, representing Verma, on the ground that CBI had tried to summon this witness earlier and he was summoned on four occasions but despite being served he did not appear before the trial court after which the prosecution evidence was closed.The counsel had earlier told the high court that the trial court already fixed the case for final arguments and allowing examination of Allen would lead to recording of additional statements of the accused and they will have to be given the opportunity to summon further witnesses.The agency had submitted that Allen could not be called earlier for examination since he had put in various conditions for coming to India, including business class flight ticket, but now he has agreed to depose as a witness through video conferencing.CBI wants to examine Allen to prove certain email IDs allegedly used by the accused to send the purported forged letter.However, the application was dismissed by the trial court noting that despite an order of November 26, 2018 of closure of evidence of this witness, no effort was made by CBI to challenge it and if he was really important, the CBI ought to have examined the witness by challenging the earlier order.The trial court had on December 9, 2015, put Tytler and Verma on trial after framing charges for alleged offences punishable under various sections of IPC, including 420 (cheating), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using as genuine any forged document or electronic record) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy).It had also framed charges under a provision of Prevention of Corruption Act.The accused persons had denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.Tytler was granted bail by the court after he had appeared before it in pursuance to summons.Verma, who was lodged in Tihar Jail, was later granted bail in the case.In its charge sheet, CBI had alleged Tytler had “actively connived” with Verma to cheat a Chinese telecom firm and the Congress leader had first shown a “fake and forged” letter to the company’s officials, claiming it was written by Maken to the then Prime Minister.

27-01-2021||Mumbai||Poet Varavara Rao is stable, reject his medical bail plea: NIA to HC||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday urged the Bombay High Court to reject the plea for bail on medical grounds filed by poet-activist Varavara Rao, arrested in the Elgar-Parishad-Maoist links case, arguing that his present health condition is stable.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the NIA, reminded the court that Rao's medical reports from the Nanavati Hospital from earlier this month stated that he was stable and fit to be discharged.He pointed out that the Maharashtra government had made a statement before the HC last week, saying once discharged from the private hospital, Rao (81) will not be sent back to the Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai, but instead, he will be admitted to the prison ward of state-run JJ Hospital here and given requisite medical care."His (Rao's) medical reports, his present health condition is stable, and the state's statement takes care of all the prayers made in these pleas," Singh said."Therefore, the question of granting him bail arises only if the court doesn't have faith in the care that the JJ Hospital will be able to provide," Singh told a bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale.The bench was hearing three petitions---a writ petition seeking Rao's complete medical records and a bail plea on medical grounds filed by Rao. The third one is a writ petition filed by Rao's wife Hemlatha alleging a breach of his fundamental rights owing to lack of medical care during his continued incarceration.Hemlatha, too, had sought in her plea that Rao should be let out of prison and be permitted to go back to his family in Hyderabad.The poet-activist, lodged in the Taloja prison as an undertrial, is currently admitted to the Nanavati hospital in Mumbai.Following the NIA's submission, the court, however, pointed out that as per the medical reports, Rao was being given over 20 pills a day."Just see the list of medicines being given to him everyday. He is sustaining on these medicines. So, he's continuously on medical support," HC said.ASG Singh, however, said most of these pills were "age-related.""We also have old people in our homes and 70 to 80 per cent of these medicines are taken (by elderlies)," the NIA counsel said.He reiterated that as per the Nanavati Hospital report, Rao didn't have dementia, a disease in which there is deterioration in memory, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities.The HC, however, pointed out that Rao's reports from the JJ Hospital, the Taloja prison hospital and state-run St George hospital, issued in November last year, all mentioned dementia, and brain atrophy or shrinkage of the brain.Singh, however, said the older report notings on dementia seemed more like "course and discussions" among doctors to check for dementia and delirium."We have full faith in the JJ Hospital but the Nanavati Hospital, where he was last treated, says he doesn't have dementia right now," Singh said."We believed the Nanavati Hospital while Rao was being treated there. Why should we not believe it then when he says Rao doesn't have dementia?" he said.Singh said one's health condition could fluctuate often and therefore, while deciding on Rao's medical bail plea, the HC must go by his latest health condition report."The Nanavati report says Rao doesn't require indoor management and is fit to be discharged. This is the latest report, there is no counter or different medical advice so we have to believe this report," Singh said."Therefore, unless the court does not have faith or it feels the JJ prison ward will not be able to provide him (Rao) medical care, only then should he be granted bail," Singh said.Rao's counsel, senior advocate Anand Grover argued that the JJ Hospital or any other hospital was a "bed of infection," and the ailing Rao must not be sent there."The only option is to send him back to the Taloja prison if he is fit, else let him out on bail to be at home with his family," Grover said.The HC then directed the Nanavati hospital to submit a fresh medical report with Rao's latest health condition on Thursday morning and will continue hearing the arguments in the afternoon.Rao has been in an out of the JJ Hospital in Mumbai and the Taloja prison hospital since his arrest in June 2018.On July 16 last year, he tested positive for coronavirus after which he was shifted to the Nanavati Hospital.He was discharged from the Nanavati Hospital following a final assessment report on July 30 and sent back to the Taloja prison.In December last year, he was admitted to the Nanavati Hospital again following the intervention of a bench of Justice Shinde and Justice MS Karnik.The case related to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city.The police have claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links. Several activists and academicians have been named as accused in the case. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/poet-varavara-rao-is-stable-reject-his-medical-bail-plea-nia-to-hc-204140

27-01-2021||New Delhi||Person accused of sexual harassment can’t be of high reputation, Ramani tells court about Akbar||Referring to former Union minister MJ Akbar, journalist Priya Ramani told a Delhi court on Wednesday that a person accused of sexual harassment cannot be of high reputation.Ramani is facing a criminal defamation complaint filed by Akbar, who has been accused by her of sexual misconduct over 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Ramani, who had made the allegation of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018, also accused him of undermining the sexual harassment that women go through at workplace by terming her allegations as “fictitious”.She made the submission before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar through senior advocate Rebecca John during the final hearing of Akbar’s criminal complaint against her for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct decades ago.John said though it was a fact that Ramani did not name Akbar in the Vogue article of 2017, “in her evidence she has explained that it was #MeToo that gave her the courage to name him in her tweet”.“Merely because the accused (Ramani) had not named in 2017, it does not take away the credibility of the allegations made at the height of the #MeToo,” she said.Countering Akbar’s allegation that Ramani’s claim of having faced sexual misconduct was “fictitious”, John said, “How is this fictitious? When I recall something that happens me it is a real life story and not fictitious. You are undermining the sexual harassment that women go through at workplace.”       John further referred to Akbar’s reported consensual relationship with a 23-year-old subordinate at workplace.“This is what harassment looks like. No human being accused of sexual harassment can be a person of high reputation.“No journalist guilty of contempt of court can be a man of high reputation. Writing books does not define reputation,” she said, pointing out that Akbar was held guilty by Delhi High Court in a contempt of court case.John further said that ten women had made allegations against Akbar, as admitted by him.“She (Ramani) is naming them and if this doesn’t show predatory behaviour, nothing does,” she said.Ramani further denied Akbar’s allegations that she did not make proper enquiry before writing the article, and said, “When I (Ramani) am talking about myself and my own personal experience, whom do in inquire from? I am an eye witness in my own case. I could have only asked Akbar. We were the only two in the case.”    The court will hear the matter further on February 1.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani in October 15, 2018.He resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/person-accused-of-sexual-harassment-cant-be-of-high-reputation-ramani-tells-court-about-akbar-204130

27-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt hikes MSP of milling copra by Rs 375 per quintal; ball copra up Rs 300||The government on Wednesday decided to hike in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for both the milling and ball copra—which are more than 50 percent of their input cost—as per Swaminath formula, said Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar. Briefing media after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA), which was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I&B Minister said, “Approvals for hike in MSPs have been given for two types of copra for 2020 season. The MSP for Fair Average Quality (FAQ) of milling copra has been increased to Rs 10,335 per quintal for 2021 season from Rs 9,960 per quintal in 2020 and the MSP for ball copra has been increased to Rs 10,600 per quintal for 2021 season from Rs 10,300 per quintal in 2020. These increases will accrue benefits of Rs 375 per quintal in the milling copra and Rs 300 in case of the Ball Copra.”Javadekar said, that today’s decision will ensure a return of 52 percent for milling copra and 55 percent for ball copra over the all India weighted average cost of production, which is the same Rs 6,805 per quintal for both the categories.The approval is based on recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), he added.It assures a minimum of 50 percent as margin of profit as one of the important and progressive steps towards making possible doubling of farmers’ incomes by 2022, said the Minister.Javadekar also said that the MSP becomes a benchmark for the open market and farmers even get higher prices.“Thus, the entire copra produced in the country (12 coastal states) in a year need not be bought by the government agencies. However, the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) and National Cooperative Consumer Federation of India (NCCF) will continue to act as Central Nodal Agencies to undertake price support operations”, he noted.India is number one in production and productivity of Copra in the World.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-hikes-msp-of-milling-copra-by-rs-375-per-quintal-ball-copra-up-rs-300-204110
27-01-2021||---||Conspiracy to derail peaceful farmer struggle, says Samyukta Kisan Morcha||Chandigarh, January 27The Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Wednesday held an emergency meeting under the leadership of Balbir Singh Rajewal.The farmer organisations appreciated the struggling farmers for extending an unprecedented response to the Kisan Republic Day Parade. They discussed the violent incidents in New Delhi and concluded that the Centre had been severely shaken by their agitation. They claimed that a dirty conspiracy was hatched with Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and others against the peaceful struggle.They said when the farmer organisations announced the Kisan Parade on January 26, anti-social elements like Deep Sidhu and others, along with the said farmer organisation, tried to torpedo the farmers’ agitation.They claimed that under this conspiracy, the said farmer organisation and other persons announced that they would march on Ring Road and unfurl a flag at Red Fort. So the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee started marching on the Ring Road two hours before schedule, they said, adding that it was a deep-rooted conspiracy to derail the peaceful struggle. They said the farmer organisations appealed to the farmers to stay on the protest venues and continue a peaceful struggle.The farmers’ organisations resolved to continue the agitation and condemned the government and administration, the said farmers' organisation and anti-social elements, who tried to damage the peaceful struggle. The organisations resolved not to allow the government and other forces inimical to the peaceful movement to break the struggle. They said Tuesday’s events clearly exposed and isolated the anti-farmer forces.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/conspiracy-to-derail-peaceful-farmer-struggle-says-samyukta-kisan-morcha-204109

27-01-2021||Ballia (UP)||UP BJP MLA blames Sonia, Rahul for farmer violence; Congress hits back||UP BJP MLA Surendra Singh has alleged that violence during the farmers' tractors parade in the national capital had taken place on the directions of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and demanded that a case of sedition be lodged against those involved in the violence.Hitting back, Uttar Pradesh Congress media coordinator Lalan Kumar alleged that the BJP government was responsible for the violence saying the BJP MLA's statement showed his "mental bankruptcy".The tractor parade on Tuesday that was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws led to anarchy on the streets of the national capital as tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday night, the BJP MLA said, "The act of violence during the tractor parade is condemnable. A case of sedition should be lodged and strict action should be taken against those involved in the act."Asking the party leadership to take strict action against those involved, Singh alleged, "There is a foreign hand behind the violence. The incident had taken place on directions of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The Congress leaders not expressing regret over the incident proves that."Reacting strongly to the allegation, Kumar said, "The BJP government, Home Ministry, police and intelligence agencies were responsible for whatever happened during the tractor parade.”"For bringing a bad name to the agitation some persons intruded into it in the guise of farmers. Deep Sidhu is an example. Sidhu was representative of BJP MP Sunny Deol. The BJP should tell how Sidhu is related with it and what punishment will he be getting for whatever he did at Red Fort," Kumar said.Deol, meanwhile, has said that he has no link with Sidhu.Expressing anguish over the violence in the national capital during the farmers' tractor parade, the Congress had said on Tuesday that there is no place for such incidents in a democracy, even as it urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to "shun arrogance" and repeal the farm laws.UP Minister for Backward Welfare Anil Rajbhar had said on Tuesday that "those protesting in Delhi are not farmers but middlemen-type people, who stand exposed after the incident"."The work of farmers is not to protest on the roads with their tractors. They always work in their fields. They are protesting against the laws passed in Parliament," he had added.

And it's increasing every day. There's some sort of concert in this and we want to avoid it. Now we have seven in the last five days," Nariman told the Bench which wanted the petitioners to move high courts."It's a political satire. If people are so sensitive in everything, then art, cinema, TV, all will be destroyed. Article 19(1)(a) is the most jealously guarded right. It must be protected. This is a genuine case. We have done no wrong. Every day there is a new FIR. Where will a man go? Can he go to every state and argue? Your lordships may at least club the FIRs," Rohatgi said.But the Bench wasn't convinced. "We cannot use the power under Section 482 CrPC. We are not inclined to grant interim protection," the top court said even as it clarified that pendency of the matter before it will not prejudice the petitioners' right to seek bail from the courts concerned.The 'Tandav' team members were booked for gate speech and hurting religious sentiments of Hindus under Sections 153-A, 295, 505(1)(b), 505(2) and 469 of IPC and certain provisions of the the Information Technology Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-grant-protection-from-arrest-to-tandav-team-members-204098

In the video, Sidhu said in Punjabi, “We have only hoisted the Nishan Sahib flag on the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest.”Also read: Red Fort video surfaces, farmers chase away Deep Sidhu after saffron flag is hoistedOfficials further said, like others, the notices to Deep Sidhu and his brother were served under Section 160 of the CrPC to call them as witnesses in the case, as those who are being summoned appeared acquainted with the circumstances of the case and asked them to appear before the investigating officer (IO) for examination.Sources in the know of the case said the probe is based on a suspicious transaction report (STR) compiled by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and was shared with the NIA.

27-01-2021||New Delhi||State on record there’s no 2009 report on 2006 Mumbai train blasts case: HC to IB||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the Intelligence Bureau (IB) to record on an affidavit that it had not prepared any report in 2009 or shortly thereafter on the 2006 Mumbai train bombings case.The order came on a plea moved by Ehtesham Qutubuddin Siddique, who has been awarded capital punishment for the July 11, 2006, serial blasts when seven RDX bombs ripped through as many Western line local trains in Mumbai killing 189 people and injuring 829, seeking an IB report of 2009 purportedly calling for a review of evidence in the case.The direction was issued by Justice Prathiba M Singh who noted that the agency had earlier told the high court, in an earlier round of litigation on the same issue, that it was exempted from providing the report under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.“There is a contradiction in your (IB) stand. Let IB’s stand be filed on the record before this court categorically stating whether any report was prepared by it in 2009 or shortly thereafter (regarding the Mumbai train blasts case) and placed before the then Minister of Home Affairs. Affidavit be filed in four weeks and rejoinder thereto in two weeks thereafter,” the court said and listed the matter for hearing on April 13.In the earlier matter, the high court had said the Central Information Commission (CIC) “erroneously” concluded that the information sought by Siddique did not pertain to allegations of corruption or human rights violation and asked it to consider his request afresh.However, before the CIC, the IB stated that there was no such report as claimed by the convict and the commission, thereafter, dismissed his plea on June 11, 2019.Siddique, in his plea filed through advocate Arpit Bhargava, has sought setting aside of the June 11, 2019 order of CIC claiming that the CIC decided by “blindly” trusting IB’s statement that there was no report of 2009.Bhargava told the court that the IB filed an affidavit in July 2019 before CIC stating no such report existed only after the plea was dismissed.The IB, represented by central government counsel Rahul Sharma and advocate C K Bhatt, opposed the plea saying Siddique’s claims were based on news reports.They also told the high court that the CIC had accepted the IB stand that there was no such report.Siddique, presently lodged in the Nagpur Central Jail, has claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case which amounts to a violation of his human rights and therefore, he needed the IB report which purportedly called for a review of the evidence in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts case.

27-01-2021||Washington||India’s new agri laws have potential to raise farm income; social safety net needed: IMF’s Gopinath||India’s recently-enacted agri laws have the potential to increase farmers’ income, but there is a need to provide a social safety net to the vulnerable cultivators, IMF’s Chief Economist Gita Gopinath has said.Indian agriculture is in need of reforms, she said.There are multiple areas where the reforms are needed, including infrastructure, the Chief Economist of the Washington-based global financial institution said on Tuesday.The three agri laws, enacted in September last year, have been projected by the Indian government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.Gopinath, in response to a question on the new farm laws, said: “These particular farm laws were in the area of marketing. It was widening the market for farmers. Being able to sell to multiple outlets besides the Mandis without having to pay a tax. And this had the potential to raise, in our view, farmers’ incomes”.“That said, every time a reform is put in place, there are transition costs. One has to make sure and pay close attention that it’s not harming vulnerable farmers, to make sure that the social safety net is provided. Clearly there is a discussion right now, and we’ll see what comes out if it,” she said.Thousands of farmers in India, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops.So far, 11 rounds of talks have taken place between the government and farmer leaders with both sides hardening their positions.In the last round of talks, the government offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi borders.Farmer leaders, however, said they would settle for nothing less than a complete repeal of the laws, which they find pro-corporate, and a legal guarantee for the procurement of crops at government-fixed MSP.The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions, is leading the protest against the three central farm laws at several border points of Delhi.Tuesday’s tractor parade in New Delhi, which was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws, dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the city as tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.The Kisan Morcha has disassociated itself from those who indulged in violence during the tractor parade and alleged that some “antisocial elements” infiltrated their otherwise peaceful movement. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-new-agri-laws-have-potential-to-raise-farm-income-social-safety-net-needed-imfs-gopinath-204090

This incident also affected the daily life of the public. The Internet services were interrupted as government ordered the operators to suspend the same. In the present time, the Internet services are very essential to carry out the work in different professions, especially in advocacy as the courts and our Supreme Court is functioning online,” Tiwari has said in his plea.The petition said that clash between the farmers and police on the Republic Day had caught the attention of the entire world.“The matter is serious because when the protest was going on peacefully for last two months then suddenly how it turned into a violent movement and led to violence on January 26. The question for consideration in national security and public interest arises that who is responsible for creating the disturbance and how and who turned the peaceful farmer protest into violent movement or how and who created the circumstances which let the protest to turn violent,” it said.“The blames are from both sides and the matter is to be inquired by an independent agency, that is, by setting up an inquiry commission under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge,” the plea said.It said there might be some conspiracy by some “notorious forces or organisations” to cause disturbance and damage the peaceful protest and create clash between police and protesting farmers.

27-01-2021||United Nations||India announces pledge of USD 150,000 to UN peacebuilding||India has announced a pledge of USD 150,000 to activities of the Peacebuilding Fund this year and said that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the COVID pandemic.“While I would like to assure you all of our sincere commitment to remain engaged in peacebuilding, we extend our support to the activities of the Peacebuilding Fund and as a token of our engagement, India would like to announce today a pledge of USD 150,000 to the fund’s activities and programme this year,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said.In a virtual address to the High-Level Replenishment Conference for the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund Tuesday, he said India believes that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in the broader context and in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the COVID pandemic, which is threatening to erode the gains made over the years.He added that the recently concluded 2020 review of the UN peacebuilding architecture provides a framework to strengthen peace building collectively.He voiced appreciation that as a part of its 2020-24 strategy, the Peacebuilding Fund has put forth a comprehensive scenario covering a horizon of five years. The Fund requires 1.5 billion dollars for 2020-2024. “There is no doubt that conflict prevention is essential to ensure that peacekeeping translates into something more durable for the benefit of the people,” he said, adding that for this determined support is needed from member states to strengthen the hands of the United Nations.He emphasised that strengthening security structures go hand in hand with strengthening civilian structures of good governance.“We need to consequently prioritise our focus on specific aspects of peacebuilding, which will have the highest impact in post-conflict situations, so that the funds are utilised to the optimum.”  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the conference that peacebuilding in fragile contexts requires political courage and leadership at national and local levels, but also the right support at the right time from the international community.“We need to take risks for peace and enable stakeholders with the resources and space to seize opportunities. We have a responsibility to bring down the institutional silos and bring together, in an agile and responsive manner, the full range of the UN system capacities,” he said.The UN chief pointed out that as the medium-term effects of the COVID19 pandemic become more apparent, it is more important than ever to ensure the fund is adequately and predictably resourced.In 2020, the Peacebuilding Fund mobilised over USD 180 million, which Guterres said is an important sign of the trust the fund has garnered over the years and its demonstrated ability to deliver in the most difficult contexts.“But its resources are now depleted. We must urgently replenish it. Doing so will save lives and serve as a clear demonstration of multilateral support.”               Tirumurti highlighted India’s constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia.India continues to assist countries bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans, apart from focusing on infrastructure, especially housing, education and health, on connectivity, providing livelihood to those impacted by conflict, especially in agriculture and on projects at the grassroots level.He cited the example from Afghanistan, where India has undertaken projects in every province of the country.India has tried to enhance the security environment of these countries since peace, security and development have to go together.India is also fulfilling its commitment to make available its COVID19 vaccines to other countries and has already supplied more than six million doses to nine countries in phase one as grant assistance.The Peacebuilding Fund is the UN’s financial instrument of first resort to sustain peace in countries or situations at risk or affected by violent conflict.The Fund’s 2020-2024 strategy is its most ambitious yet, responding to the Secretary-General’s call for a quantum leap of support for peacebuilding and prevention. The Fund has invested over USD 1.2 billion to date in over 60 countries, with support from almost 60 member states.At the close of the conference, the co-chairs issued a Joint Communique stating that the General Assembly would convene a High-Level meeting on financing peace during its 76th session.“The Conference took place at a time of unprecedented challenges and as the world contends with the tragic immediate effects of the pandemic and its alarming medium to long-term impacts. The unprecedented economic shocks and inadequate response strategies are entrenching social and economic inequalities and increasing risks for crisis, eroding peace and development gains along the way,” the Joint Communique said.Member states reiterated the importance of investing in peace. Including funds received for 2020, a total of 39 member states have contributed or pledged over USD 439 million for peacebuilding in support of the Fund’s 2020-2024 Strategy which set a target of USD 1.5 billion. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-announces-pledge-of-usd-150-000-to-un-peacebuilding-204080

This was followed by a short cultural programme involving local artistes and rendition of patriotic songs by students of Gandharva School of Music, Richmond, and a violin recital by Kamalakiran Vinjamuru.

27-01-2021||---||How extremist elements hijacked farmers' rally and Deep Sidhu’s role in chaos||Chandigarh, January 26Amid slogans of 'Raj karega Khalsa', actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu handed over a 'kesri' flag to a man to hoist on the ramparts of the Red Ford on Tuesday afternoon -- the Republic Day.Also readOpposition blames Centre for capital siege, hopes farm unions will reclaim the agitationSamyukta Kisan Morcha calls off tractor march after Delhi violenceI feel ashamed and take responsibility: Yogendra Yadav on violence during tractor paradeViolence brought a bad name to farm protest: Rakesh TikaitDespite being shunned by farmer unions at various stages of the ongoing anti-farm law agitation, Deep Sidhu has been attempting to take a leadership role in the movement for the past several months.Pushed to the periphery of the agitation, Deep Sidhu bounced back one day ahead of the planned tractor march of Tuesday. He was seen campaigning for the march on the Outer Ring Road. The position taken by the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee in favour of sticking to the original plan of holding the parade on the Outer Ring Road, along with another extreme Left-leaning body Bharti Kisan Union (Krantikari), which is part of the 32 farmer organisations, gave Deep Sidhu the opportunity to push for not following the new route agreed upon.On Monday evening, Deep Sidhu took over the main stage at Singhu, and along with gangster-turned-social activist Lakha Sidhana, announced they would hold the march “inside Delhi”.According to sources, they also had support from certain extreme Left-leaning elements among the 32 organisations in the plan for not following the agreed upon route. They had a plan ready by Tuesday morning. First, they started a march of their own much before the official march of the farmer unions, and positioned their 'henchmen' in large numbers at a road turning towards central Delhi. From there they directed other tractors towards the Red Fort instead of the agreed route. At one point of time, volunteers of farmer unions tried to intervene in this, but they were outnumbered by the Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sidhana group.This contingency had been foreseen by farmer unions long back. Around a month ago, during a meeting of the 32 farmer unions, one of the leaders had termed Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sidhana as “enemies of this struggle”.Since the start of the agitation, the common concern among the 32 organisations was that the two were pushing the “struggle” towards a communal path.Rajinder Singh Deepsingh Walavice-president of Kirti Kisan UnionThe Centre has been trying from the very beginning to paint this movement in a communal colour. They are master of religious games, but in this struggle led by farmers, they are for the first time at the receiving end. Deep Sidhu has served them well.Deep Sidhu, who has acted in a few Punjabi films, surprised everybody last year when he raised a question over the leadership of the farmer unions and announced to launch his own 'morcha' at Shambu.During the last Lok Sabha election, Deep Sidhu was campaigning to strengthen the BJP, and had even posed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he was the election agent of the party’s Gurdaspur candidate Sunny Deol. He was accused of being an “RSS agent” by farmer unions in Punjab.The 'Shambu morcha', as he called it, soon started receiving “live streaming” support from some pro-Khalistan channels and Deep Sidhu would often attack the 'Leftist' leadership of the unions. He would cite the example of Jews and motivate people to fight for a “Sikh homeland”.A question being raised now is over his shift from supporting “Hindu Right” to “Sikh Right wing”. He himself gave the explanation that it was Naxalite-turned-Khalistan proponent Ajmer Singh's books on Sikh history that changed his perception. Farmer unions, however, openly allege that Sidhu is a “front man” of Ajmer Singh.As farmer unions gave no space to Sidhu during the agitation, after November 26-27 -- when farmers reached at the doorstep of Delhi -- Sidhu in a TV interview asked people to go back as the “Communists” wanted to use their children as cannon fodder. Soon, however, he was seen backtracking from the statement.Around two weeks back, in a letter sent to the unions, he expressed a desire to get associated with their platforms. However, the plea was rejected.***We only hoisted the Nishan Sahib at the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest, India flag not removed : Deep SidhuDeep Sidhu has posted a video on his Facebook page saying, “We have only hoisted the Nishan Sahib at the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest.”He said in such a protest, people’s anger flares up and you cannot blame one person for inciting the protesters.Also readTractor parade becomes violent; farmers enter Red Fort, hoist flag32 farmer unions from Punjab not responsible for violence: RajewalHe said they went to the Red Fort as a symbolic protest and didn’t remove the Tricolour, but hoisted the Nishan Sahib as a sign of “unity in diversity”.He also said that today’s incident shouldn’t be seen in isolation as the farmers’ protest has been going on for the past few months.Sidhu said the protesters didn’t go to Delhi to hurt anyone or damage government property and should not be termed as communal elements or hardliners.He said the protest was peaceful and symbolic and the emotions of the people should be understood and no one person should be blamed for the mobilisation of people or protest.He added India’s flag was not removed from the flagpole, and they only hoisted the Kisan Mazdoor Ekta’s flag and the Nishan Sahib.Deep Sidhu had campaigned for BJP's Sunny Deol during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.Two agitators hoisted their own flags after climbing the flagstaff at the Red Fort where thousands of protesters stormed, creating a major law and order issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-extremist-elements-hijacked-farmers-rally%C2%A0and-deep-sidhus-role-in-chaos-203993
27-01-2021||New Delhi||Groups of farmers start moving back to respective protest states, but thousands still in Delhi||Some groups of farmers started going back to their respective sit-in sites on Tuesday evening after hours of chaos during their tractor parade against the farm laws, but thousands of other protesters were still in several areas, including ITO, Nangloi and Mukarba Chowk, of the national capital.Hundreds of farmers were sitting at the ITO crossing and many, who entered the city from the Singhu border protest site, were moving towards Delhi’s Outer Ring Road.Farmers were seen moving back in batches to Tikri and Ghazipur border protest sites on Tuesday evening.Earlier, wielding sticks and clubs and holding the tricolour and union flags, tens of thousands of farmers atop tractors broke barriers, clashed with police and entered the city from various points to lay siege to the Red Fort and climb the flagpole on Republic Day on Tuesday.A protesting farmer died after his tractor overturned at ITO during the farmers’ tractor parade on Tuesday, police said.The farmers draped the body in the tricolour and kept it at the ITO crossing, not allowing the police to send it for post-mortem.“We have finally gained entry into Delhi after four months—two in Punjab and two at the Delhi border. The mood is clear, we have come here to stay. There’s no point in going back to where we started,” Amarjeet Singh, 62, a protesting farmer, said.The Delhi Police resorted to baton charge and firing of tear gas shells on farmers at Nangloi Chowk in West Delhi when they tried to deviate from the pre-agreed route to enter the national capital during their protest.The agitating farmers broke cement barricades at Nangloi Chowk and Mukarba Chowk following which the police used heavy tear gas shells to disperse the unruly crowd, an official said.

27-01-2021||---||MHA orders additional forces in Delhi as farmers lay siege to the Red Fort, break Tikri Border barricades||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 26The Ministry of Home Affairs has ordered additional forces to be deployed inside Delhi after clashes erupted in several parts of the national capital during a tractor rally on Tuesday, official sources said.The directions come after a high-level meeting at the Ministry of Home Affairs.Ten of the 15 companies would be from the Central Reserved Police Force, official sources said.Meanwhile, Delhi Police Commissioner has ordered his force to deal with “trouble making” protesters who still remained in the national capital with a strong hand, sources said.They said some people still remained at the ITO, one of the scenes of chaos.Additional forces have also been stationed at the Red Fort, another scene of chaos.As an immediate measure the Home Ministry suspended internet connection around the most volatile Singhu, Tikri and Nangloi areas until midnight on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, thousands of farmers broke barricades at Nangloi and entered the city to march towards the Red Fort, where thousands of protesters had reached earlier on Tuesday after breaking barricades, flashing weapons, damaging public property, and threatening to run over cops with speeding tractors. A farmer from Uttarakhand, Navneet, died when the speeding tractor he was driving turned turtle, said the Delhi police, even as several farmers sat on a dharna at ITO beside the body of the deceased.Unprecedented scenes of chaos and vandalism erupted across central Delhi on Tuesday as the two month farmer agitation turned violent and went out of control of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body that had promised a peaceful tractor parade on the Republic Day. The morcha and the Delhi Police had arrived at a 37-point understanding before the tractor parade permission was granted. None of the agreed upon points were honoured, as was clear from the start of the day with the farmers breaking into Delhi from all borders even before the Republic Day parade on Rajpath had concluded.At Ghazipur Border, thousands of farmers broke into Delhi’s arterial roads and reached ITO intersection right next to the Delhi police headquarters. The ITO looked like a war zone for hours with farmers on tractors ramming across and many clashing with the police, which lobbed tear gas shells to contain the crowds.Several protesters defied police appeals not to move towards the Red Fort and stormed the historic structure before hoisting saffron flags aloft the Red Fort in visuals that enraged netizens and commoners alike.Farm union leader Yogendra Yadav’s video appeal to the farmers to maintain peace and return to the decided route went unheeded.“If we violate peace, we will not win. We appeal to farmers to return to the path of peace. Do not undermine the peaceful farmers’ protests,” said Yadav as the union leaders washed hands off the protesters.Another farm union leader Rakesh Tikait alleged he had identified the miscreants and these agitators were part of a political party.While government ministers condemned the violence and the unfurling of a specific flag at the Red Fort with culture minister Prahlad Patel leading the charge, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said violence was no solution and asked the government to repeal the farm laws against which the farmers have been agitating for over two months now. A host of Congress leaders including Kumari Selja and Sachin Pilot demanded the laws be rescinded.HOW THE TRACTOR PARADE WENT AWRY10:00 am: Farmers break barricades at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur Borders to enter Delhi’s arterial roads; this even though the R Day Parade was on.

27-01-2021||Vibha Sharma||32 farmer unions from Punjab not responsible for violence: Rajewal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 26Amid growing criticism of violence by a section of farmers in Delhi, the leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of farmer unions agitating against the three farm laws, on Tuesday said the the 32 Punjab unions were following the set routes. It is the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Commitee that broke the rules and routes, they added."The rest are all following the set routes. The first group that broke the set routes was not part of the Punjab platform and since Monday farmer leaders from SKM were pleading with them not to do this," said Kavitha Kuruganti.Balbir Singh Rajewal also said that the 32 unions from Punjab are following the route and rules. Rajewal criticised the violence and distanced himself from those indulging in violence, saying they were not part of the unions from Punjab.Though the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Commitee (KMSC) may not be  a part of the platform of the 32 Punjab unions they participate in the SKM meetings.Kavitha said, "Though they (KMSC) sit in the (SKM) meetings, on the issue related to the route of the parade they had separately negotiated with the police all day on Monday. And they did not listen to any SKM leader asking them not to force their way into Delhi."While farmers took centrestage at the ITO and Red Fort, official sources said the SKM and its leaders were lauded by Union ministers for peaceful conduct of the agitation.“Therefore, the responsibility that the agitation remains peaceful was also the responsibility of the unions and farmer leaders, which they failed today," they said.Samyukta Kisan Morcha issued a detailed statement condemning the violence."We also condemn and regret the undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today and dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts," the umbrella body of farmer unions heading the agitation said  Unions said despite their efforts, "some organisations and individuals have violated the route and indulged in condemnable acts"."Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement. We have always held that peace is our biggest strength, and that any violation would hurt the movement", the statement said."We dissociate ourselves from all such elements that have violated our discipline. We appeal strongly to everyone to stick to the route and norms of the Parade, and not indulge in any violent action or anything that taints national symbols and dignity. We appeal to everyone to desist from any such acts," the statement said. Meanwhile, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait claimed that those who were trying to create trouble had been identified. He said, “They belong to a political party, and we have identified them.”Tikait appealed to protesters to keep to the parade's planned route. He said in a tweet in Hindi: "Farmers should maintain discipline. Parade on the designated path. Anybody who has forgotten the route and moved toward Delhi should return to the 'dharna'".किसान अनुशासन बनाये रखे। निर्धारित रास्ते पर ही परेड करे। अगर कुछ लोग रास्ता भूलकर दिल्ली की और चले गए है। वह वापस अपने धरने पर पहुचे।#KisanParade @ANI @PTI_News  Given below is a detailed statement from the SKMWe thank farmers for the unprecedented participation in today's Farmers Republic Day Parade. We also condemn and regret the undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today and dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts.Despite all our efforts, some organisations and individuals have violated the route and indulged in condemnable acts. Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement. We have always held that peace is our biggest strength, and that any violation would hurt the movement.The long struggle for more than 6 months now, and more than 60 days of protest at Delhi borders also seemed to have led to this situation.We dissociate ourselves from all such elements that have violated our discipline. We appeal strongly to everyone to stick to the route and norms of the Parade, and not indulge in any violent action or anything that taints national symbols and dignity. We appeal to everyone to desist from any such acts.SKM has been trying to get a full picture of all the events with regard to the several Kisan Parades that were planned today and will share a fuller statement soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/32-farmer-unions-from-punjab-not-responsible-for-violence-rajewal-203969

The farmers however refused to budge with many attempting to ram their tractors into police personnel almost stopping short of running them over.Some of the farmers when asked where they would go said they were headed to the Red Fort.The violent protesters kept saying they would conquer Delhi and that Delhi belonged to them.Many of them mentioned Rakesh Tikait was their leader.As the volatile protests left a trail of destruction in their wake, the focus shifted to Red Fort which they stormed to make their point against the farm legislations.Delhi Police were seen maintaining restraint and said they were talking to the protesters asking them to go back out of Delhi.The farmers climbed the Red Fort and its historic structures flashing victory signs, as the government maintained a close watch on the situation dominated by unstoppable farmers.Even as the movement towards Red Fort began, more and more farmers entered Delhi and the crowds continued to swell.Protesting farmer dies as his tractor overturnsAn unidentified protesting farmer lost his life, as his tractor turned upside down on the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg near ITO, amid police action of lathicharge and teargas.The deceased has not been identified yet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tractor-parade-becomes-violent-farmers-enter-red-fort-hoist-flag-203919
