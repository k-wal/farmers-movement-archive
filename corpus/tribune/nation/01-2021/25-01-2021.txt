However, we are of the view that it would be appropriate for the petitioners to invoke the powers of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India for the relief claimed by them,” said the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramadubramanian.“Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that the suit is pending since 1958. We are certain that the high court can pass appropriate directions for disposing of that suit and other connected proceedings in a time bound manner,” the bench said in its order.The petition, filed through advocate Piyush Dwivedi, claimed that after the death of the Nawab, his alleged distant relative and several others started filing “false, bogus and collusive civil suits” for partition against each other with the malafide intention of illegally grabbing properties left by him.It said that petitioners had filed a suit before the lower court for issuance of succession certificate and the court passed order in April 2020 to issue certificate in their favour.The plea said that petitioners had made a representation to the concerned authorities along with a succession certificate with a request to release the assets belonging to the Nawab but “the representation was of no avail”.It sought the apex court’s direction to the Centre to release of assets in favour of the petitioners.During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing, Singhvi told the bench about the details of the case including the various orders passed by the courts and said that one of the suits is pending since 1958.“We think you should go to the Telangana High Court,” the bench said.The property dispute has had a chequered history in which some alleged claimants of Royal property filed a lawsuit in the city civil court of Hyderabad which was later withdrawn.The suit was then taken to the high court which recorded the compromise decree and paved way of distribution of property among the claimants. Several petitions were filed later in the property dispute which is still continuing. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-takes-note-of-pendency-of-suit-since-1958-asks-petitioners-to-approach-hc-for-relief-203548

AEFI (adverse events following immunisation) was reported in 14 persons,” a senior official of the Delhi Health Department said.Under the nationwide mega vaccination drive launched on January 16, a total of 4,319 (53 per cent) health workers against a target of 8,117 were administered the shots at 81 centres across the city on day one.On the second scheduled day, the figures had stood at 3,598 (44 per cent of the target).

25-01-2021||New Delhi||SC notice on Kerala Government plea against CBI probe into Life Mission Project||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the CBI to respond to Kerala government’s petition challenging an order of the state high court allowing a probe by the central agency into alleged corruption in the Life Mission Project which aimed to achieve total housing for the homeless.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan issued notice to the CBI and asked the agency to respond to the petition filed by the CEO of Life Mission Project in four weeks.On behalf of the petitioner, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan said government projects were exempted under the Foreign Contribution Regulations Act and that the CBI probe was contrary to the spirit of federalism.Vishwanathan said the CBI needs either the sanction of the State government or an order of the court to investigate a crime within the jurisdiction of the State.He said that under the pretext of corruption and FCRA violations, CBI has been conducting a roving inquiry on completely baseless allegations.On January 12, the Kerala High Court had dismissed a petition challenging the CBI investigation into alleged irregularities in the project which is a massive housing campaign to build houses for families without land or housing.The CBI had registered an FIR for alleged offences of criminal conspiracy and under the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 on a complaint by Congress MLA Anil Akkara, listing Santhosh Eappen, Managing Director of Unitac Builder, as main accused and Sane Ventures as second accused.In another case, the Bench refused to entertain a plea seeking directions to the Centre, the West Bengal government and the Election Commission to ensure "free, peaceful, safe and fair" assembly polls scheduled this year in the state and a CBI probe into alleged killings of political activists by TMC workers.Another Bench headed by SK Kaul dismissed YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government’s appeal against the Andhra Pradesh High Court’s order upholding the State Election Commission decision to hold gram Panchayat elections in the state.“We cannot be part of this ego battle (between state government and state election commission),” the Bench said.The AP government had sought postponement of Panchayat polls due to the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination drive.“We will not interfere with the decision of the State Election Commission,” it said, noting elections have been held in far more difficult conditions and successfully.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-on-kerala-government-plea-against-cbi-probe-into-life-mission-project-203531

25-01-2021||New Delhi||Times Network mulls legal action against BARC for rating manipulation||Bennett Coleman & Company Ltd, India's top newspaper publisher and television channel owner, on Monday said it was mulling legal action against the BARC over its alleged role in the manipulation of TV ratings.In a statement, the BCCL said it was contemplating legal action against Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) over alleged fraud in declaring rival Republic TV as leading in the English News Genre ahead of the group's Times Now news channel.BARC's Forensic Audit of July 2020, as well as the multiple emails and WhatsApp chats of that period, which have been accessed by the Mumbai Police, clearly shows that BCCL's Times Now's TRPs were indeed manually reduced by BARC officials.The BCCL, a subscriber of viewership data from the BARC for its channels, including Times Now operating under Times Network, said the rating agency had "fraudulently declared Republic TV as No 1, even when Times Now was consistently higher" by a large margin."Due to this unacceptable and unpardonable act of BARC, Times Network has suffered huge financial losses and irreparable damage to its reputation/goodwill. Times Network/BCCL is contemplating all possible legal actions against BARC for non-redressal of its grievances, as available in law for wrongful loss caused," Times Network said in the statement.It also intends to initiate appropriate proceedings against the individual perpetrators of the fraud as per provisions of Criminal and Civil laws, Times Network added.Times Network had made multiple attempts to get an official statement of explanation from BARC in the last few weeks, which has been rebuffed.Even after unearthing this gross misreporting of an entire genre for a protracted period vide the Forensic Audit Report of July 2020, BARC's present Management and Board kept this matter under wraps and took no action against any of the perpetrators other than asking some of the errant officials to silently resign, it added."The inaction as far as we can see is systemic and deliberate, as had it not been for the Mumbai Police investigators who stumbled upon this report in December 2020, BARC had no intention in the first place to either inform us as affected party or penalise the fraudulent broadcaster," it said.This constitutes moral turpitude, breach of trust and puts a question on code of conduct and ethical standards of the present BARC Board and Management."It is worth pondering as to whether such a Board and Management can indeed preside over a system which puts out ratings that impact ad spends worth over Rs 30,000 crore per annum and impacts the livelihoods of thousands of employees engaged in the broadcast sector," read the statement.According to the BCCL, it had suspected manipulation of ratings after the launch of Republic TV."Since 2017 and especially after the launch of Republic TV in May 2017, BCCL/Times Network suspected large scale manipulation of ratings pertaining to illegal usage of multiple LCNs and out of EPG placement by Republic TV," it said.It had found significant abnormalities in market-wise ratings of Republic TV, which clearly indicates ground level tampering and deliberate intervention at the raw data level to favour them.It has repeatedly complained about these irregularities to BARC for almost two years but got no resolution, said Times Network, part of country's largest media conglomerate, The Times Group.Now, the press statement by Mumbai Police on December 25, 2020, in the ongoing investigation into the BARC TRP Scam, has made it clear that proof had been unearthed exposing manipulation by BARC officials for the benefit of Republic TV in 2017/18, Times Network added."As per BARC's Forensic Audit of July 2020, as well as the multiple emails and WhatsApp chats of that period, which has been accessed by Mumbai Police, it is now clear that Times Now's TRPs were indeed manually reduced by BARC officials headed by Partho Dasgupta and Romil Ramgarhia before publishing, with the intention to give undue advantage to Republic TV in the English News Genre and thereby fraudulently declare Republic TV as No 1, even when Times Now was consistently higher by a large margin and was the undisputed leader of the Genre," it said.Time Network broadcasts news channels - TIMES NOW, ET NOW and MIRROR NOW.

25-01-2021||Kendrapara (Odisha)||16 white crocodiles spotted in Odisha's Bhitarkanika||Sixteen white crocodiles have been sighted in the brackish water bodies of Odisha's Bhitarkanika National Park, the country's lone habitation for albino estuarine crocodiles, as per the latest census report released on Monday.The crocodile population in Bhitarkanika has swollen to 1,768 from 95 four decades ago, the report said.There were only two white crocodiles in Bhitarkanika when a crocodile conservation programme of the Centre and the UNDP was launched in 1975 while the number had increased to 15 last year, researcher Sudhakar Kar, who led the census team, said."We were earlier apprehensive of the mortality rate among albino crocodiles but as they have been spotted again, it seems the brackish water bodies of the national park have emerged as a favourable habitation for the reptiles," he said.As per the report, 593 crocodiles are hatchlings, 367 yearlings, 30 juveniles, 152 sub-adults and 336 adults.Estuarine crocodiles are also found in West Bengal's Sundarbans and mangrove wetlands in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands but the population of the reptiles is the highest in Bhitarkanika, he said.Apart from the 16 white crocodiles in the wild, Bhitarkanika is also home to two members of the species living in captivity in the park's enclosure, including a 46-year-old female crocodile that shuns mating.Bhitarkanika is home to the world's largest crocodile measuring 21 feet.More than 70 per cent of the crocodiles were spotted in water bodies in the core area of the national park, reducing chances of man-animal conflict in riverside villages, the report said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/16-white-crocodiles-spotted-in-odishas-bhitarkanika-203520
25-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor has time for Kangana, not for kisan: Pawar||Maharashtra Governor has time to meet Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut, but not the thousands of "kisan brothers" who have assembled in Mumbai in huge numbers from all over the state, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said here on Monday.Attacking Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari without taking his name, Pawar said that the farmers were planning to go to the Raj Bhavan to submit a memorandum after Monday's rally at the Azad Maidan."However, now I am told that he (Governor) has gone away to Goa. We have never had such a Governor in the state's history. He has time to meet Kangana, but not our kisan brothers who have come here from all over the state," Pawar said while addressing a huge farmers' rally at the Azad Maidan.The NCP strongman said that it was the "moral duty" of the Governor to at least remain and receive the tillers of the state who were the 'annadaatas' (food-givers), but he did not even show the courtesy to remain in Raj Bhavan to accept their memorandum.Pawar's remarks came after he was informed that the Governor was not in the state and has reportedly gone to Goa, putting a question mark on the plans of the Samyukta Shetkari Kamgar Morcha leaders to submit the memorandum.Pawar termed the Governor's move as "an insult" to the farmers, agitated leaders of SSKM and other political parties which cancelled plans to depute a 20-member delegation to the Raj Bhavan to hand over the memorandum.Instead, All India Kisan Sabha President Ashok Dhawale, Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant and others said they would "tear copies" of the memorandum to protest against the Governor's "anti-farmer bias" and send a copy of the representation to President Ram Nath Kovind.Dhawale pointed out that the farmers had last week informed the Raj Bhavan about their plans to come and hand over a memorandum to the Governor to repeal the three Central farm laws."This is an insult to the farmers and is regretful. We will tear the memorandum in protest," said Dhawale."The Governor has fled from the scene. This is the state of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. They cannot betray the farmers and go away like this," said AIKS general secretary for Maharashtra, Ajit Nawale.Koshyari, who also holds the additional charge of Goa, was in the coastal state on Sunday for the closing ceremony of the 51st International Film Festival of India and to address the Goa Legislature Budget Session opening. He is likely to return to Mumbai late on Monday night.On the absence of any senior Shiv Sena leaders at the rally, Dhawale said that Tourism Minister Aditya Thackeray and Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde had said that they would be present, but they were tied up with the inauguration of a bridge in Thane on Monday afternoon.However, Shiv Sena president and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had himself extended his support to the programme on Monday and sent a party spokesperson who spoke on the occasion.In the final phase on Tuesday, the farmers will assemble at the Azad Maidan, unfurl the tricolour, sing the national anthem and take a pledge to continue the struggle of peasants-farmers till they get justice, said the SSKM leaders.Mumbai Police have made elaborate security arrangements at the Azad Maidan with police personnel assisted by nine platoons of the SRPF, drones and other agencies deployed.The action on Tuesday will coincide with the proposed 'Farmers Republic Day Parade' in the national capital for which an estimated 100,000 tractors have reportedly reached the Delhi borders.

The cavalcade will join the Kundli-Meerut-Palwal Expressway at Duhai and then return to their protest site in Ghazipur.The entire route has been broken down into 12 zones, where volunteers will be present to regulate traffic or to help if any of the vehicles break down.No tractor will be allowed to exit on this route until the cavalcade reaches Duhai. Four teams of volunteers have been provided with the metal detectors to check the tractors for firearms.“We have to ensure that everything goes as per our plan. These volunteers have been trained while we have recruited around 2,500 for the tractor parade only,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Tikait) activist Dharmendra Malik said.“We have also decided to not allow anyone to join the parade if they don’t have a participation slip. No one will be allowed to halt and water will be provided for the moving tractors,” he added.The volunteer group has also called in the drones to keep an eye on the parade besides filming the entire length of the parade.“We also have a group of volunteers to operate the drones. Three teams will operate five drones for security purposes. The drones will also record the tractor parade. It is needed so that we can keep an eye on everything,” Malik said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/volunteers-metal-detectors-drones-ghazipur-gears-up-for-farmers-tractor-parade-203506
25-01-2021||Pursurah (West Bengal)||BJP insulted Netaji by raising 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday lashed out at the BJP, accusing it of insulting Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose by raising 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans at an event to mark the icon's 125th birth anniversary.Mamata said she had to face taunts and insult in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Victoria Memorial during the main 'Parakram Diwas' celebration on Saturday.Branding the BJP as a group of "outsiders" and "Bharat Jalao Party", she said it had been continuously insulting the icons of Bengal, Netaji being the "latest addition to the list"."Would you invite anyone to your house and then insult the person? Is this the culture of Bengal or our country? I would have had no problem if slogans hailing Netaji were raised. I would have saluted them."But they didn't do that. To taunt me, they shouted slogans which had no relation to the programme. I was insulted in front of the Prime Minister of the country. This is their (BJP) culture," the Trinamool Congress boss told a rally here.She also termed those who raised the slogans as "religious fanatics", and said they had no idea about the culture of Bengal.Mamata had on Saturday refused to speak at an official event attended by Modi to observe Subhas Chandra Bose's 125th birth anniversary, after 'Jai Shri Ram' chants greeted her.The Chief Minister said the saffron party could offer cash for votes ahead of the Assembly elections, but urged people to cast their ballots in favour of the TMC."BJP may pay you cash. If they do, take it but vote for TMC when you enter the booth. The BJP is completely a fake party. It is 'Bharat Jalao Party'. They can insult me, but I will not tolerate West Bengal's insult," she asserted.Reacting to Mamata's accusations of disrespecting icons, BJP vice-president Jaiprakash Majumdar said it was the CM who insulted Netaji."The allegations are baseless. It is she who insulted Netaji and tried to politicise the event. We don't need lessons from her," he said.Mamata also referred to a recent incident of trolling of two Bengali actresses on the social media, contending that the BJP does not know how to respect women."The actresses were telling me how they were threatened and trolled on social media with dire consequences.“How dare the BJP and its members intimidate daughters of Bengal? If our daughters are harmed in any way, we will teach them (BJP) a lesson for life," the TMC supremo thundered.Dubbing turncoats in her party as "betrayers", she said those who had deserted the TMC in the run-up to the polls would never be welcomed back."The ones who left knew they would not be getting tickets in the coming elections. It is good they exited, or else we would have thrown them out... Those who want to leave the party should do that as early as possible," she added.Mamata said those who were greedy switch over to the saffron camp to protect the money "they have looted" in the last few years.Unrelenting in her attack on the BJP, Mamata further said it had assumed the role of "washing machine", becoming a party "tainted leaders join to come out clean"."BJP is using money bags and intimidation tactics to coerce TMC leaders into joining the party," she alleged.The feisty Chief Minister also blamed the CPI(M) and the Congress for the rise of the BJP in the state.Exuding confidence of returning to power for the third consecutive term with a bigger mandate, Mamata said the saffron party's defeat was imminent in the upcoming polls."They have bought a few media houses who are showing fake surveys, indicating more seats to the BJP," she said.Elections to 294 Assembly seats in West Bengal are due in April-May.

25-01-2021||Chandigarh||To boost mineral exploration, GSI developing repository of all geological data of country||To collate and disseminate all the geological data of the country, the Geological Survey of India has initiated a project, National Geoscience Data Repository (NGDR) that would hold data by all agencies engaged in exploration and geoscientific pursuits.The project, being undertaken under the aegis of the Ministry of Mines, aims at integrating the data collected by GSI, state geological departments, central public sector enterprises, academic and private sector agencies working in the domain to build a repository in the digital medium entailing multiple user access.The ministry has also proposed that all the stakeholders from India and across the globe who are willing to participate in the current auction regime for allocation of mineral acreages will also be able to use the NGDR.Further, the planned Baseline Geoscience Data Collection campaign would also lead to a huge database, which will be the primary inputs for future exploration programmes.GSI is in consultation with Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics, Gandhinagar, a national institute under Ministry of Information and Technology for development of NGDR.To expedite exploration activities in the country, GSI has also embarked upon an ambitious scheme to complete major national level surveys by 2022. These include the National Geochemical Mapping (NGCM), National Geophysical Mapping (NGPM) and National Aero Geophysical Mapping Program (NAGMP).NGCM is an all India programme to cover the entire surface area of the country by geochemical sampling. It will generate distribution pattern of 62 elements for use in managing and developing natural resources; application in environmental, agricultural, human health and other social concerns, as well as to search for hidden mineral deposits.NAGMP, which is the first of its kind project in the country, is meant to delineate concealed, deep seated structure/ litho-units capable of hosting mineralisation, delineate extension of the existing mineralised zone and understating of shallow crustal architecture in the context of mineral occurrence.The collation, assimilation and integration of the data generated from the above projects and further interpretation will lead to identification of more areas for mineral exploration in the country, according to a statement issued today by the Ministry of Mines.The increased investment in mineral exploration will build a robust pipeline of prospective mineral blocks for auction. This will ensure long-term viability and continuity of mining in the country in pursuit of self –reliance.GSI is also going to adopt sophisticated deep penetration geophysical techniques such as Magneto-Telluric Surveys and Deep Seismic Reflection Surveys to define the crustal architecture for deep seated mineral targeting.Out of the total mappable area of 3.146 million square kilometres of the country, 3.119 million square kilometres has been covered by Systematic Geological Mapping till December 2020, building up the knowledge database for National Geo-scientific information for boosting mineral exploration activities and other earth science related socio-economic activities and programmes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-boost-mineral%C2%A0exploration-gsi-developing-repository-of-all-geological-data-of-country-203501

25-01-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||2021 is going to be electorally a disastrous year for BJP: TMC||Tribune News Service New Delhi, January 25 Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Monday said 2021 would be electorally a disastrous year for BJP as the party was all set to suffer humiliating defeat in three major states.Addressing a press conference here, senior TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy and party leader in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien said that BJP was having “zero chance” in three of the four states where assembly general elections were going to be held this year.Roy and O’Brien said that in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala – states where assembly elections were slated to take place this year – BJP was certain to get mauled in the hustings. Assam, the fourth state going to the elections in 2021, will see a close contest, the two TMC lawmakers said.Roy and O’Brien said the real “big” election would be the general elections for the Lok Sabha in 2024. “The idea of India, as envisioned by the makers of our constitution would be at stake in the 2024 general elections for Lok Sabha. The results will determine whether India would continue to remain a secular, socialist country or not,” they said.Asked who would be the leader of the anti-BJP parties in the 2024 elections, the TMC MPs answered that they would not like to reveal their “strategy” at this stage. “First ask the BJP who they are going to project as their candidate for the post of Chief Minister in West Bengal assembly elections,” O’Brien said. TMC would have no issue if 1,000 companies of paramilitary forces (meaning one lakh jawans) were deployed in West Bengal for the smooth conduct of the assembly elections, the two TMC lawmakers said. “It is up to the Election Commission to decide and then arrange the deployment in consultation with the Union Home Ministry,” Roy said.“All we want is that the BJP or central ministers should not be going around saying so much security personnel were being deployed in West Bengal for the elections, they will teach a lesson to TMC, and so on,” Roy added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2021-is-going-to-be-electorally-a-disastrous-year-for-bjp-tmc-203498
25-01-2021||Amaravati||Parents in AP kill daughters believing in spiritual powers||In a bizarre incident, a highly educated couple had allegedly killed their two daughters in their 20s in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, hoping that they would come back to life within hours due to spiritual power as the Kaliyuga ends, turning into the Satya Yuga, police said on Monday.In fact, the man himself was said to have called one of his colleagues over the phone soon after the incident on Sunday night and disclosed the killings.The shocked colleague immediately tipped off the police, who rushed to the couple’s house and found them in a trance.Police suspect that the family had apparently been following certain occult practices for some time now.According to Madanapalle Deputy Superintendent of Police Ravi Manoharachari, it was the mother who bludgeoned the daughters to death.One of the daughters was tonsured before she was killed, he said.The man remained a spectator as his wife went about the alleged killings.The younger daughter was first killed with a trident.Then, the elder one was bludgeoned with a dumbbell.Police sources said the couple had actually planned to kill themselves as well to prove that they would come back alive but the timely entry of police personnel averted the possible suicide.V Purushottam Naidu, M.Sc, PhD, worked as an associate professor in the Government Women’s Degree College in Madanapalle. He was also the College Vice-Principal.His wife Padmaja, a post-graduate and gold medalist, was Correspondent and Principal of a local private school.The eldest daughter Aleikhya (27) was doing her post- graduation in Bhopal while the youngest Sai Divya (22) was a ward in the KM Music Conservatory of AR Rahman.The daughters were staying with their parents since the coronavirus-induced lockdown.According to the DSP, the family apparently “transcended the peaks of spiritualism”, going by their interaction.“They asked us to wait for a day as their daughters will come back to life again,” he said.Manoharachari said the family was well-educated but wondered why they resorted to such an act.Police have detained the couple in their house and started questioning while forensic teams were examining the closed-circuit television footage to establish if someone else were also involved in the spiritual rituals practised by the family.Bodies of the victims have been removed for post- mortem while police launched a full-scale investigation into the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parents-in-ap-kill-daughters-believing-in-spiritual-powers-203494

It is being dismantled with the help of around 300 trained workers at one of the plots owned by ship breaking firm, Patel said.“We started the dismantling process in December last year and hope to finish the task in the next eight to nine months. We are following the global norms on eco-friendly ship breaking,” he said.Viraat had reached the Alang ship breaking yard from Mumbai in September.The centaur-class aircraft carrier was in service with the Indian Navy for 29 years before being decommissioned in March 2017.There was a campaign on social media to save the warship and convert it into a maritime heritage museum but nothing came out of it.The Centre in July 2019 informed the Parliament that the decision to scrap Viraat was taken after due consultation with the Indian Navy.In a last-ditch effort, Mumbai-based Envitech Marine Consultants had approached Patel to acquire the ship for converting it into a museum, for which Patel had sought Rs 100 crore and an NOC from the Central government for the resale.“I was ready to sell the ship for converting it into a museum and even delayed the dismantling for about two months. But that company could not procure the NOC from the Centre, which is mandatory in such deals,” said Patel.At present, the ship is anchored around 300 metres off the shore and is being cut into pieces using gas cutters and heavy duty cranes. After a significant portion is cut, it will be pulled ashore next month for further dismantling, he said.“The ski-jump was cut first when dismantling process began. To maintain balance and keep the ship afloat, we then cut apart the back portion and removed some metal from the middle. Reduction in weight will help pulling it ashore,” he said.There is no clear estimate about how much metal would be salvaged from the ship, Patel said.“All the memorabilia and parts like the steering wheel were removed by the Navy before the ship was handed over to us. Though the engine was there, propellers and shaft were removed before we received the possession, which is a standard procedure,” he said.Viraat is the second aircraft carrier to be dismantled in India. In 2014, Vikrant was dismantled in Mumbai. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/viraat-dismantling-to-take-nine-more-months-30-per-cent-work-over-203491

Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of held that there must be “skin to skin contact with sexual intent” for an act to be considered sexual assault.It has drawn the ire of child rights bodies and activists, who have termed it “absolutely unacceptable, outrageous and obnoxious”, and called for challenging the judgement.Dhananjay Tingal, executive director of child rights NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, said their legal team was looking into the matter and all the data related to this is being collected.“We shall be appealing the Supreme court on the basis of their inputs,” Tingal told PTI.The apex child rights body National Commission for Protection of Child Rights  on Monday asked the Maharashtra government to file an urgent appeal against the recent judgement.Activist Kavita Krishnan, secretary of All India Progressive Women’s Association, called it an “outrageous judgement” that goes against the letter of the law.“The POCSO law defines sexual assault very clearly and it has a provision for sexual touch. This notion that you will circumvent the law by saying touch with or without clothes makes no sense at all,” Krishnan said.“That is absolute rubbish and it fails the test of common sense also. For me, it”s a larger question of who qualifies to be a judge in cases related to gender,” she said.Yogita Bhayana, an activist who heads the People Against Rape in India (PARI), said it was disappointing to hear from a judge and such statements “motivate the criminals”.“I really think it”s very regressive of her to say this,” Bhayana said.After the Nirbhaya case, Bhayana said they were trying to push that even verbal gestures are included as assault, adding that they wanted to be more progressive and move to issues of cyber bullying. “On other hand, they are talking about this!” she said.Prabhat Kumar, deputy director of Save the Children, said nowhere in the POCSO Act itself there is talk about skin-to-skin contact.“The act talks about physical (abuse), which is largely the use of force to sexually assault. So we feel that this interpretation is not right,” Kumar said.“If there are inconsistencies in interpretation of this law, then we must choose the law with the stricter punishment for the person accused of the offence. So even that has not been complied with,” he said.Women”s rights activist Shamina Shafiq called it very unfortunate that a lady judge had come out with this judgement.“As a woman, you must understand that groping while you are wearing clothes is very usual and unfortunately normal in this country and this is something that keeps on happening to women and girls. And to say such a thing will give ideas to men also and it will not act as a deterrent,” Shafiq said.“It’s shocking and the judge is a woman. I absolutely fail to understand how a woman judge can pass this kind of judgement,” social activist Shabnam Hashmi said.

The BJP is hatching a conspiracy of the lowest kind against the farmers. If the farmers give a reply to ‘Diesel-bandi’ (non-supply of diesel) with BJP’s ‘naakaabandi’ (cornering the BJP), then what will happen?” he said.In the ‘Gantantra Divas Mahaghoshnaa’ document, Yadav said, “Today, the Constitution, Republic-Democracy and Independence are in danger. Hence, the SP is going to give a new declaration to face the new challenges with new pledge—nayee hava hai, nayee SP hai, barho kaa haath, yuva kaa saath”.He said instead of hatred and non-confidence, society, state and the country should be strengthened with mutual love and confidence. “Our inspiration is true development and good work (vikaas sachaa aur kaam achhaa). Peace and harmony are our mantra. We know that without unity, there is no peace, and without peace there is no development.”He said everyone should come together and avoid “misguidance and disorientation (bahkaave-bhattkaave)” and make every effort for peace and harmony.Meanwhile, in a tweet in Hindi BSP chief Mayawati said, “The BSP once again requests the Centre to withdraw the three farm laws, so that on January 26 no new tradition gets started.

25-01-2021||Bareilly (UP)||UP: 4 held for killing farmer||A 50-year-old farmer was allegedly killed over property here, police said on Monday after arresting four people, including the man’s nephew and sister-in-law.The farmer had reportedly married ten times and had no child. He wanted to give away his property to a youth who used to look after him. This reportedly irked two of his relatives, who hatched a conspiracy to kill him with two other men, police said. Senior Superintendent of Police Rohit Singh Sajwan said Jaganlal Yadav was killed on January 20.“Police have arrested Munni Devi, the sister-in-law of the deceased, his nephew Darshan Singh, Dev Singh and Prahlad, and sent them to jail. Another accused Kalicharan is absconding,” Sajwan said.He said Darshan Singh, who had hatched the conspiracy to kill Yadav, had lodged a police complaint. He had said his uncle had married 10 times and five of his wives had died, three had left him and two were living with him.SHO Bhojipura police station Manoj Tyagi said Yadav had no child.“During interrogation, the accused said Yadav was murdered over property,” he said.According to the police complaint, Yadav, a resident of Manda village, had gone for a walk on January 20 after having his dinner, but did not return till late night.His nephew Darshan and Balveer searched for him. His body was found in a field the next day, he said.Police believed that the murder had been made to look like a suicide.Tyagi said in 1999, Yadav’s father had declared that his entire property should be given to his elder son, following which there was a dispute between Yadav and his elder brother.Later, his father gave 14 bighas to Yadav.The accused told the police that Yadav was childless, and a youth from the neighbourhood was looking after him. Yadav wanted to give his property to the youth, which his nephew and sister-in-law did not like and that is why they hatched a conspiracy and killed him.Police spoke to Yadav’s two wives who alleged that their husband was murdered over property. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-4-held-for-killing-farmer-203480

The rally would start from the Cross Iron Mills Mall in Calgary at 9 am.Calgary-based Paramjeet Singh said: “The Indian farmer community of Calgary will undertake a protest on January 26 to show absolute solidarity with farmers in India in their struggle with Indian Government for enacting draconian Farm Bills giving agricultural rights to allied corporates and rendering land owner farmers as mere tenants to work on their own lands for sowing/harvesting of farm produce.”Indian farmers are protesting peacefully for the last several months by gathering in open spaces, facing all incremental auguries of climate, resulting in loss of several dozen precious human lives but Indian Government is still adamant on not repealing these Bills, he said.Paramjeet Singh further said that they were moving to the provincial legislature with a request to convey their sentiments to the Government of Canada for taking up the matter at their level with the Indian Government for processing the matter urgently on logical and humanitarian grounds.“Canadians having land holdings in India or with their near and dear ones among the farmers’ community have their own concerns about the farm laws, which have not been addressed yet,” he pointed out.A few days ago, members of the Indians Abroad for Pluralist India (IAPI) came together to reject controversial Indian laws.They burnt copies of the contentious Indian farm laws, Citizenship Amendment Act and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act outside the Indian visa and passport office in Surrey to mark the 92nd birth anniversary of US civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nris-to-hold-car-rallies-in-canada-to-support-farmers-tractor-march-on-jan-26-203479

The principle is that we are having a parade on January 26 as we wanted and that is the most important thing,” he said.Regarding the demand for the Outer Ring Road by some factions, Yadav said the Outer Ring Road was only 47 km long, and judging by the overwhelming response the agitation had received, the parade could not be contained even in 250 kms.“This is why we have made nine rings so that everyone can participate,” Yadav said.“Delhi police wanted the Outer Ring Road for rescue and relief in the case of any emergency and that is why we are not going on it. Please consider the bigger picture — which is that farmers, for the first time, are holding such a big rally. I would urge those insisting on Outer Ring Road to remember that,” Yadav added.“No one will remember which road the parade was held on when people talk about this event in future. People will only remember it as a historic event with widespread impact,” Yadav said.He added that hopefully, tomorrow, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi saw their peaceful parade, he would be forced to “reconsider his decision” regarding the three farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/consider-bigger-picture-of-parade-says-samyukta-kisan-morcha-leader-203469
25-01-2021|| Chandigarh||Huge traffic snarls on Karnal–Delhi and Rohtak–Delhi roads day ahead of farmers’ tractor march||A day ahead of their tractor march, farmers from Punjab and Haryana have reached Singhu and Tikri borders in large numbers leading to huge traffic snarls on Karnal–Delhi and Rohtak–Delhi stretches of two national highways.Many more are still on the way leading to the slow movement of traffic on roads leading to the national capital.Over 12-kilometre of NH-44, from Bahalgarh village to Singhu border in Sonipat district, is witnessing a massive traffic jam as farmers have parked their tractors on both sides of the highway.In Jhajjar district, a 15-km long Bahadurgarh bypass is jam-packed with tractor-trailers forcing Punjab farmers to take Bahadurgarh city route to reach Tikri leading to traffic chaos.Also read: Farmers’ rally in Mumbai: No police nod for march to Raj BhavanConsider bigger picture of parade, says Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaderSanyukt Kisan Morcha issues advisory for farmers’ Republic Day paradePolice say forces inimical to India intend to hijack, disrupt farmers’ tractor rallyTractors, bearing tricolour have created a patriotic atmosphere at Tikri.In Karnal, enthusiastic farmers continue to march towards Delhi on tractors, leading to complete traffic chaos on the national highway-44. Several farmers are marching on foot showing their resentment against the three farm laws passed by the Union government.On the other hand, at Bastara toll plaza, in absence of male farmers who have left for Delhi, women have taken over the charge of the protest at the toll plaza, where the farmers have been sitting on dharna since December 25 to make the toll plaza free for commuters.In Ambala, enthusiastic farmers continue to move on the Amritsar-Delhi National Highway.However, the frequency of tractors passing on the NH seem to have decreased on Monday morning compared with the numbers of tractors seen over the last three days.A majority of farmers from Ambala and Kurukshetra had left for Delhi on Friday or Saturday.Gurugram police are not allowing entry of tractors on Delhi-Jaipur expressway and are asking the farmers to stick to the designated route.Meanwhile, Haryana police have issued a traffic advisory for people travelling to or from Delhi on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.A spokesperson of the Haryana Police said that in view of the security and traffic arrangements for Republic Day and the proposed Tractor Rally, commuters will face traffic disruptions on NH between Karnal to Delhi and Rohtak to Delhi from 25-27 Jan 2021. Traffic on KMP-KGP Expressway will also be impacted and Interchanges at Kundli, Assaudha and Badli will not be accessible to traffic movement on these dates.“Therefore, all commuters are being advised not to use these routes on these dates, to avoid any inconvenience,” said the advisory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/huge-traffic-snarls-on-karnal%E2%80%93delhi-and-rohtak%E2%80%93delhi-roads-day-ahead-of-farmers-tractor-march-203466

We are the farmers and we have given our sons for the security of the country. These policemen are there for our safety and so we should not only cooperate with them but share their responsibility of making the rally a grand success,” he said.When asked as to why he had been participating in the protest and what is the problem in the farm laws enacted by Parliament, Ankit Tomar, a young protester from Bijnore, said, “The laws are not good for us, not good for the farming community.” But when asked how, he said, “I don’t know the details. But seniors in our village said, it is not good, we believe it. Why will they mislead us?”Suraj Chaudhary from Muzaffarnagar, who is an Army jawan and has taken leave to participate in the protest rally, however, said, “The laws in their entirety are bad for farmers. It is not about the provisions of the laws, rather their souls are anti-farmer. We can’t accept them and till they are repealed we will continue with our protest.”Karamveer Bharti of Bulandshahr, another protester, said people in the cities are not able to grasp the dangers these laws will bring. “Prices of food items will increase manifold even without adequately compensating the farmers. Corporates will enter villages and first they will exploit farmers with their huge capital and then consumers will be fleeced of their money,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jai-jawan-jai-kisan-not-mere-slogan-but-a-matter-of-faith-and-practice-say-protesting-farmers-203465

25-01-2021||New Delhi||Never rest on past laurels, strive on: PM to Republic Day child awardees||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday held personal conversations with 32 winners of National Child Awards 2021 asking them not to rest on past laurels but to strive on. He urged them to not get consumed by the charms of momentary accomplishments.After an hour of virtual engagement with the children, awarded in the categories of bravery, art, craft and innovation, the prime minister asked them to take three pledges—of humility in success; of consistency in action and of acting for the national good.He earlier urged children to read biographies saying, “Read one biography every year, of a scientist, a farmer, a writer or anyone. Biographies will inspire you to strive harder in life.”The PM also exhorted the children to treat awards as one milestone in the long journey called life.“Award is just a milestone. People will shower you with praises but if you get lost in the momentary joys of success, the same success will become an impediment in your onward march. So do not rest on past laurels, strive on,” he said.The Women and Child Development Ministry will send cash prizes and e-citations to the awardees this year as they could not travel to New Delhi due to COVID-19 restrictions.The hallmark of the virtual engagement was the PM’s no-holds-barred discussion with the children on their accomplishments, future dreams and aspirations.The PM started by interacting with Maharashtra’s Kamya Kartikeya, an avid mountaineer, currently practising in Jammu and Kashmir for her June challenge to scale Mt Denali in North America.Kartikeya, who earlier found a mention in PM’s Mann ki Baat, told him that she was a first-generation mountaineer from her family and was currently training in Gulmarg.“I kept training even in COVID times,” she told the PM who hailed her for mountaineering accomplishments despite the pandemic and said, “So you also converted adversity into opportunity.”Moving on to Karnataka’s Rakesh Krishna, the PM introduced the winner’s unique farm innovation in times when Indian farmers are protesting against the three contentious farm laws.Krishna’s multipurpose farming machine allows agriculturists to work without farm labourers, reducing farming time manifold and enhancing profits by over 50 per cent.When the PM asked Krishna if any industry had offered to scale up his innovation he said, “I am working to develop my prototype further.”Noting that modern agricultural practices were the need of the hour, the PM saluted Krishna for innovating on farming and said, “A society that learns from its children never stagnates.”Among others the PM engaged was Jharkhand’s archer Savita Kumari; Manipur’s artist Navish Kisham who paints on ecological conservation; UP’s Mohd Shadab, AMU’s class XI student currently stationed in the US and Gujarat’s swimmer Mantra Jitendra Hakhani.The PM spoke to Hakhani in Gujarati reminiscing his childhood memories of Vadnagar and asked him, “Will you serve me gathiya if I visited you?”The elated child replied, “I will serve you gathiya and jalebi and tea. Please come.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/never-rest-on-past-laurels-strive-on-pm-to-republic-day-child-awardees-203456

They said these installations in and around the national capital are likely to be targeted, and that intelligence inputs also suggested that Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale’s posters might be flashed during the rally.On Sunday, a series of restrictions were announced by Delhi Police as they allowed the farmers - protesting near Delhi’s borders since late November - to enter the national capital, but “they can’t disturb the Republic Day parade”.The permission to the protesting farmers was granted after a series of meetings, which took place following the Supreme Court observation that the issue is well within the domain of the police and they had to take the final decision.The police officials, however, said it would be a challenging task for them, but the rally would be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day parade is over.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-say-forces-inimical-to-india-intend-to-hijack-disrupt-farmers-tractor-rally-203451
25-01-2021||Mumbai||Farmers’ rally in Mumbai: No police nod for march to Raj Bhavan||Police have made tight security arrangements at the venue of a farmers’ rally and protesters are not allowed to march from south Mumbai to the Raj Bhavan, a senior police official said on Monday.Thousands of farmers from across Maharashtra have come to participate in a rally at the Azad Maidan in south Mumbai on Monday against the Centre’s three new farm laws.The All India Kisan Sabha’s (AIKS) Maharashtra unit on Sunday said the protesters will later march to the Raj Bhavan and submit a memorandum to Governor BS Koshyari over their various demands.Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Vishwas Nangre Patil said, “As per a Bombay High Court order, no morcha is allowed in south Mumbai and we are convincing representatives of the farmers to follow the court order.”                “They are urging us to allow a morcha till the Raj Bhavan, but we have shown them the high court order. If they come out of the Azad Maidan to go to the Raj Bhavan, we will try to stop them and allow only their delegation to go to the Raj Bhavan,” the official said.Elaborate security arrangements have been made as a large number people come to south Mumbai for work, he said.“We don’t want people to face traffic congestion due to the morcha. There will be a smooth flow of traffic in south Mumbai,” the official said.Two companies of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) companies and over 800 personnel of the Mumbai police have been deployed for the rally, he said.In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, those participating in the morcha should wear masks, he said.The city civic officials, with the help of an NGO, have provided masks and sanitisers at the venue, he said.“We are making continuous announcements to maintain social distancing,” the official said.Heavy security arrangements, including the deployment of women police personnel, have been made at the venue of the rally to tackle any untoward incident, another official said.Police personnel in plainclothes are also present at the site, he said.The rally is part of a call given by Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a pro-farmer body, to intensify the struggle till January 26 over various demands of farmers.The rally is being held to support and expand the two-month-long farmers’ struggle in Delhi for a repeal of the three farm laws and for a central law to guarantee a remunerative Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement all over the country, the AIKS said on Sunday. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-rally-in-mumbai-no-police-nod-for-march-to-raj-bhavan-203450
25-01-2021||Satya Prakash||Love Jihad: SC refuses to transfer to itself petitions from Allahabad HC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 25The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain the UP Government's petition seeking transfer petitions challenging it's ordinance on religious conversion from Allahabad High Court to the top court.Refusing to stop the Allahabad High Court from going ahead with the hearing of the matter, a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said it would like to have the advantage of having a decision of the high court."People are making light of high courts these days. High Courts are constitutional court's," it noted.As the Bench wasn't included to entertain the transfer petition, senior advocate PS Narasimha, representing UP government, chose to withdraw it and accordingly the petition was "dismissed as withdrawn".The Uttar Pradesh Government had moved the Supreme Court last week seeking transfer of petitions challenging its ordinance aimed at checking unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages.The state government had invoked Article 139A of the Constitution which empowers the Supreme Court to transfer to itself cases “involving the same or substantially the same questions of law” pending before the Supreme Court and one or more high courts.The Supreme Court had on January 6 refused to stay provisions of an Uttar Pradesh Ordinance and an Uttarakhand law aimed at checking unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages.A Bench led by CJI Bobde had, however, issued notice to the two states asking them to respond in four weeks to petitions filed by Vishal Thakre and others and NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace challenging the controversial UP Ordinance and the Uttarakhand law.Terming the provisions as "oppressive" and "obnoxious" the petitioners alleged that several innocent persons had been arrested on the basis of UP Ordinance against 'love jihad'.The top court was hearing PILs against the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 and Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018 which criminalise fraudulent religious conversion for interfaith marriages.Promulgated in November last, the UP ordinance prescribes imprisonment from one year to 5 years, or Rs 15,000 fine (in normal cases) minimum three years and maximum 10 years, and fine of Rs 25,000, if the girl is a minor or from the SC/ST community. It prescribes a jail term of minimum three years up to 10 years, and Rs 50,000 fine in cases involving mass religious conversion. The offence is cognizable and non-bailable.According to the Ordinance, no person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any other person from one religion to another by use/practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.The petitioners also challenged the validity of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018 which has similar provisions on the ground of alleged violation of fundamental rights of citizens, contending their provisions went against public policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/love-jihad-sc-refuses-to-transfer-to-itself-petitions-from-allahabad-hc-203449

The Babri mosque was named after Babar.To make the Ayodhya mosque project a symbol of communal brotherhood and patriotism, the Trust has decided to dedicate the project to Shah, who represented these values and was also a true follower of Islam, according to Trust sources.Hussain said: “The Trust is thinking very seriously over the proposal of dedicating our Ayodhya Mosque project to the great freedom fighter Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah. We have got suggestions regarding the same from different platforms. It is a good suggestion. We will officially announce it after deliberations.”Shah was martyred on June 5, 1858. British officers namely George Bruce Malleson and Thomas Seaton have made a mention of his courage, valour and organisational capabilities.Malleson has repeatedly mentioned Shah in the History of Indian Mutiny, a book on the Indian revolt of 1857.During the freedom struggle, Shah had launched revolts in the Awadh region. He made the local mosque, Masjid Sarai, located in Chowk area of Faizabad his headquarters. As he liberated Faizabad and larger part of Awadh region, he used the premises of this mosque to hold meetings with rebel leaders.According to researcher and historian Ram Shankar Tripathi: “Besides being a practising Muslim, Shah was also the epitome of religious unity and Ganga-Jamuni culture of Ayodhya. In the revolt of 1857, royalties like Nana Sahib of Kanpur, Kunwar Singh of Arrah fought alongside Shah. His 22nd Infantry Regiment was commanded by Subedar Ghamandi Singh and Subedar Umrao Singh in the famous Battle of Chinhat.”The Apex Court on November 9, 2019, had ruled in the favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.The state government allotted a five-acre land in Dhannipur village in Sohaval Tehsil of Ayodhya. The blueprint of the mosque was unveiled on December 19. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ayodhya-mosque-may-be-named-after-1857-mutiny-warrior-maulvi-ahmadullah-shah-203448
25-01-2021||Karur||Modi is the person 'through whom' Balakot information went to Arnab: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the “person through which” prior information on India’s airstrikes in Balakot in Pakistan in 2019 was made available to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami.The Congress MP, however, did not provide evidence to back up his claim. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) did not immediately respond to the claim.Addressing a roadshow here during his final day of the election campaign in poll-bound Tamil Nadu, he said only five people, including the PM and the Defence Minister, would have prior information of the planned strikes.“Some days back, it came out that a journalist knew about the airstrikes in Balakot. Three days before the (Indian) air force bombed Pakistan, an Indian journalist was told it was going to happen,” he said.This meant the lives of our IAF pilots were put at ‘risk', he said.“Now, five people in this world knew about Balakot (air strikes). Prime Minister of India, the Defence Minister of India, the National Security Adviser and the Chief of the Air Force and the Home Minister.”“Nobody else in the world knew about Balakot before it happened. Now I want to understand why an inquiry has not started on who told this journalist about Balakot before it happened. The reason is that one of these five people told this man. One of these five people betrayed our Air Force,” he claimed.He alleged that “one of these people put the lives of our pilots in danger”.“If the Prime Minister did not do it then why is he not ordering an inquiry. Think about it. The only reason that the Prime Minister has not ordered an inquiry is because he is the person through whom that message has gone to this journalist,” Gandhi claimed.Else, the PM should investigate and tell which one of these five people did it, Gandhi demanded.Purported chats between Goswami and former Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) head Partho Dasgupta, which mentioned that the former was privy to the 2019 airstrike, by the IAF on the biggest JeM training camp in Balakot had surfaced recently.The IAF had carried out the strike deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019, in the wake of the killing of 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district then by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed.Gandhi also hit out at Modi once again over the Sino-India face-off, saying “today the Chinese army is sitting inside Indian territory”.“The Prime Minister has said he has a 56-inch chest. Today the Chinese army is sitting inside Indian territory. Thousands of kilometres of Indian land has been taken by the Chinese,” he said.He alleged that Modi could not say the word China as he “does not have the courage to say” so.“You look at his speeches for the last three to four months, he does not say the word China. When the Chinese entered our territory he lied that nobody had come. After some days the Army and Defence Minister said the Chinese army had come into Indian territory,” Gandhi added.“And the only reason the Chinese have the guts and the courage to come into this country is because Narendra Modi has destroyed the economy and weakened (the country) by dividing it,” he charged.

25-01-2021||Satya Prakash||SC issues notice to Centre on PIL seeking setting up of Media Tribunal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 25Amid allegations of hate speech, media trial, fake news and violation of the right to privacy against the media, the Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Centre on a PIL seeking setting up of an independent Media Tribunal to hold journalists and media houses accountable for such acts.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to respond to the PIL filed by film producer Nilesh Navalakha, and Nitin Memane, who contended that a citizen-led independent Media Tribunal was needed to hear and expeditiously adjudicate on complaints against media businesses.It also issued notices to the Press Council of India, the News Broadcasters Association and others on the PIL demanding an independent media tribunal.“Over the past few years, media trials, hate speech, propaganda news, paid news, have become the order of the day, thereby impeding the right to a fair trial of victims and right to fair and proportionate reporting,” Navalakha and Memane submitted in their petition filed last month.They contended that “reckless reportage by the electronic media without accountability can, by no stretch of imagination, be read into the right to freedom of speech and expression enjoyed by the electronic media”.Such a body was needed to bring about a balance between the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression of the media houses and right to reputation and the right to dignity as also in the interests of preserving peace and harmony, the petitioners submitted.Noting that self-regulation by TV channels wasn’t good enough, the top court had on November 17 made it clear to the Centre that it wanted a statutory regime to regulate TV channels in India.Self-regulation by TV channels through private bodies such as the National Broadcasters Association (NBA) and the National Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) wasn’t good enough, CJI Bobde had said, wondering why a private body such as NBSA should look into complaints against media.While hearing PILs filed by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Peace Party, seeking directions to the Centre to stop the dissemination of “fake news”, it had asked the Centre to consider creating a mechanism to address grievances against fake news circulated by TV channels and media.“What is shown on TV channels is of great consequences for the country... Create a mechanism under the law if there is none at present,” it had told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta after he submitted that there was no regime for content regulation of electronic media.It had asked the government to inform it in three weeks about putting in place a proper regime to regulate TV channels.Maintaining that the exercise of power by the electronic media without any accountability was detrimental to the due process of law, and contrary to the rule of law, Navalakha’s PIL urged the court to issue appropriate guidelines for the regulation of media in exercise of the plenary and inherent powers under Article 32 and 142 of the Constitution, until a legislation was introduced.He said self-regulation by media could not be the answer to the problem, he sought setting up of an independent high-powered committee headed by a retired Chief Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court and comprising distinguished citizens from different fields and representatives of the Central Government to scrutinise the entire legal framework relating to the regulation of media industry and recommend guidelines to be laid down by the top court.The petitioners, however, sought to clarify that the PIL wasn’t aimed at curbing fundamental rights of the media and that they only wanted to ensure that those indulging in spreading misinformation, inflammatory coverage, fake news and breach of privacy were held to account.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-setting-up-of-media-tribunal-203441
25-01-2021||New Delhi||Union govt completes formalities for funding 'DRIP'||The Union Government has completed the formalities with the World Bank for funding of the Phase II and III of the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP).In effect, this raises hopes of the project’s implementation kicking in sometime in the coming summer.The formalities with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which will co-fund the project, will be completed soon, allowing for the rollout of the funds.The funding period of the two international institutions will be ten years.The Union government had approved externally aided DRIP II and III scheme with an outlay of over Rs. 10,211 crores on October 29, last year.Out of the total outlay, Rs 7,000 crores will be equally funded by the two international institutions.The two phases will initially cover 19 states and three Central agencies, including the Bhakra-Beas Management Board.DRIP implementation and management of water resources figured during a Central Water Commission’s (CWC) meeting which was presided over by Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria a few days ago.  Kataria was also informed that under DRIP – I, rehabilitation of 223 dams located in 7 states has been done with an estimated cost of Rs 3,466 crore. The official deadline of this phase is this March-end.DRIP aims physical rehabilitation of key dams as well as capacity building of dam operators to ensure availability of trained and skilled manpower for better operation of dams.“The consequences of dam failure can be catastrophic, in terms of loss of human life and property, and damage to ecology,” a functionary of the Jal Shakti Ministry echoing large scale destruction during in Kerala during the 2018-19 floods.The DRIP programme complements the provisions in the Dam Safety Bill 2019, by ensuring capacity building of the dam owners as well as the proposed regulators, as well as creating necessary protocols for dam safety.India ranks third globally, after China and the United States of America, with 5,334 large dams in operation. Besides, about 411 dams are under construction at present.There are also several thousand smaller dams. These dams are vital for ensuring the water security of the country.Indian dams and reservoirs play an important role in the economic and agricultural growth of our country by storing approximately 300 billion cubic meters of water annually.They present a major responsibility in terms of asset management and safety.

25-01-2021||New Delhi||SC issues notice to Centre on PIL seeking constitution of 22nd Law Commission||The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a plea seeking direction to the Centre to declare Law Commission a “statutory body” and appoint the panel’s chairperson and members within a month.A bench of Chief Justice Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notice to the Centre on the plea of BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay, who made the Ministries of Home Affairs and Law and Justice as well as the Law Commission of India as parties.The plea said the cause of action arose on August 31, 2018, and was still continuing when the tenure of the 21st Law Commission ended but the Centre had neither extended the tenure of its chairperson and members nor notified the 22nd Law Commission.“Although, on February 19, 2020, the Centre approved the constitution of 22nd Law Commission but it has not appointed the Chairperson and Members till date,” Upadhyay said in the petition filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey.The plea, which sought a direction to the Centre to appoint the chairperson and members to the 22nd law panel, has also made an alternative prayer urging the top court to do the needful itself.“Alternatively, being the custodian of the Constitution and protector of the fundamental rights, the Court may be pleased to use its plenary constitutional power to appoint the chairperson and members of the 22nd Law Commission of India and declare that the Law Commission of India is a statutory body,” it said.Upadhyay has sought a direction to the law panel, to be set up, to also consider his submission seeking action on the Vohra commission report on alleged nexus between politicians and criminals.The PIL also sought action from the law panel on the plea “seeking 100 per cent confiscation of black money, benami property and disproportionate assets and life imprisonment to looters as a Representation and prepare two separate reports within three months”.It said: “Injury to the public is extremely large as the Law Commission of India is headless since September 1, 2018, hence unable to examine public issues. Even the directions of the Constitutional Courts to Law Commission have become a dead letter.”The plea said on December 11, 2020, the petitioner withdrew other PILs seeking action on the Vohra report and seeking 100 per cent confiscation of black money, benami property with the liberty to approach the Law Commission but was unable to do so as it is headless.The plea said since the Law Commission was not working, the Centre did not have the benefit of recommendations from this specialised body on the different aspects of law, which are entrusted to the Commission for its study and recommendations.The Commission, on a reference made to it by the Centre, the Apex Court and high courts, undertakes research in law and reviews existing laws for making reforms therein and enacting new legislations, it said.The panel has been able to make important contribution towards the progressive development and codification of Law of the country and it has so far submitted 277 reports, the plea said.

25-01-2021||New York||Jayati Ghosh named by UN to high-level advisory board on economic, social affairs||Indian development economist Jayati Ghosh is among 20 prominent personalities appointed by the United Nations to a high-level advisory board that will provide recommendations for the UN Secretary-General to respond to the current and future socio-economic challenges in the post-COVID-19 world.Ghosh, 65, is a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She has taught economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University for nearly 35 years and has authored several books.The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) announced that the 20 “prominent personalities, globally renowned for their intellectual leadership in economic and social fields, will form the second United Nations High-level Advisory Board (HLAB) on Economic and Social Affairs.” Over the next two years, the board will strengthen the United Nations thought leadership on sustainable development and reinforce its impact on policies at every level – from global to local, it said.Comprising a diverse group of experts from around the world, the board will closely collaborate with UNDESA to provide guidance and focused recommendations for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to respond to current and future socio-economic challenges in the post-COVID-19 world and to advance the Decade of Action for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The first United Nations High-level Advisory Board was established in June 2018 as a key element of the efforts to support the UN Member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Over the last two years, the interventions and insights of the board greatly expanded the understanding of UNDESA of some of the most burning economic and social issues shaping the world and inspired the United Nations to break new ground in policy research, the UN agency said in a statement.Born in 1955, Ghosh got her M.A, M. Phil. in economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University and joined Cambridge University for her PhD.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jayati-ghosh-named-by-un-to-high-level-advisory-board-on-economic-social-affairs-203433
25-01-2021||New Delhi||Wealth amassed by 100 richest Indians during pandemic can give 13.8 crore poor Rs 94,000 each: Oxfam||India’s 100 top billionaires have seen their fortunes increase by Rs 12,97,822 crore since March last year when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the country and this amount is enough to give 13.8 crore poorest Indians a cheque for Rs 94,045 each.The latest India supplement of the Oxfam report ‘The Inequality Virus’ said it would take an unskilled worker 10,000 years to make what businessman Mukesh Ambani made in an hour during the pandemic and three years to make what he made in a second.The report has been released on the opening day of the World Economic Forum’s ‘Davos Dialogues’.Calling the coronavirus pandemic the world’s worst public health crisis in a hundred years, the report said it triggered an economic crisis comparable in scale only with the Great Depression of the 1930s.“India’s 100 billionaires have seen their fortunes increase by Rs 12,97,822 crores since March last year which is enough to give every one of the 138 million poorest Indians a cheque for Rs 94,045 each,” the report said.The new global survey of 295 economists from 79 countries, commissioned by Oxfam, reveals that 87 per cent of respondents, including Jeffrey Sachs, Jayati Ghosh and Gabriel Zucman, expect an “increase” or a “major increase” in income inequality in their country as a result of the pandemic.“India has the world’s fourth lowest health budget in terms of its share of government expenditure,” it said, adding: “If India’s top 11 billionaires are taxed at just 1 per cent on the increase in their wealth during the pandemic, it will be enough to increase the allocation of Jan Aushadi Scheme by 140 times, which provides affordable medicines to the poor and marginalised.”India introduced one of the earliest and most stringent lockdowns in the face of the pandemic and its enforcement brought the economy to a standstill, triggering unemployment, hunger, distress migration and untold hardship in its wake, the report said.“The rich were able to escape the pandemic’s worst impact; and while the white-collar workers isolated themselves and worked from home, a majority of the not-so-fortunate Indians lost their livelihood,” it said.The report noted that billionaires namely Gautam Adani, Shiv Nadar, Cyrus Poonawalla, Uday Kotak, Azim Premji, Sunil Mittal, Radhakrishan Damani, Kumar Manglam Birla and Laxmi Mittal working in sectors such as coal, oil, telecom, medicines, pharmaceutical, education and retail, increased their wealth exponentially since March 2020 when India announced world’s biggest COVID-19 lockdown and economy came to standstill.On the other hand, data has shown that 1,70,000 people lost their jobs every hour in the month of April 2020, the report said.Findings of the report showed that rich got richer during the pandemic.“Data shows what Ambani earned during the pandemic would keep the 40 crore informal workers that are at risk of falling into poverty due to COVID-19 above the poverty line for at least five months,” the report said.The wealth of Indian billionaires increased by 35 per cent during the lockdown and by 90 per cent since 2009 to $422.9 billion, ranking India sixth in the world after the US, China, Germany, Russia and France, it said.In fact, the report said the increase in wealth of the top 11 billionaires of India during the pandemic could sustain the rural job scheme MGNREGA for 10 years or the Health Ministry for 10 years.Noting that the informal sector had been the worst hit, the report said out of a total 12.2 crore people who lost their jobs, 75 per cent, which accounts for 9.2 crore jobs, were lost in the informal sector.“The mass exodus on foot triggered by the sudden lockdown and the inhuman beating, disinfection and quarantine conditions, the informal workers were subjected to turned a health emergency into a humanitarian crisis,” it said.“Over 300 informal workers died due to the lockdown, with reasons ranging from starvation, suicides, exhaustion, road and rail accidents, police brutality and denial of timely medical care. The National Human Rights Commission recorded over 2,582 cases of human rights violation as early as in the month of April 2020,” the report added.It noted that the long disruption of schooling risked doubling the rate of out of school, especially among the poor.“Only 4 per cent of rural households had a computer and less than 15 per cent rural households had an internet connection,” it said.On health inequalities, the report said only 6 per cent of the poorest 20 per cent has access to non-shared sources of improved sanitation, compared to 93.4 per cent of the top 20 per cent. It added that 59.6 per cent of India’s population lives in a room or less.The report said 1.7 crore women lost their job in April 2020 and unemployment for women rose by 15 per cent from a pre-lockdown level.Oxfam India CEO Amitabh Behar said if not addressed immediately, the crisis could worsen.“Extreme inequality is not inevitable but a policy choice. The fight against inequality must be at the heart of economic rescue and recovery efforts now,” Behar said.“Newer and creative ways of catering to the needs of the masses is possible if governments are committed to the needs of its people. It is time for the government of India to take specific and concrete actions that will build a better future, more equal and just a future for everyone,” he said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wealth-amassed-by-100-richest-indians-during-pandemic-can-give-13-8-crore-poor-rs-94-000-each-oxfam-203431
25-01-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp treating Indian users differently from Europeans matter of concern, Centre tells Delhi High Court||WhatsApp is treating Indian users differently from Europeans over opting out of its new privacy policy which is a matter of concern for the government and it is looking into the issue, the Centre informed the Delhi High Court on Monday.The Centre told the high court that it was also a matter of concern that Indian users were being “unilaterally” subjected to the change in privacy policy by the instant messaging platform.The submissions were made before Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma during hearing of a petition by a lawyer against the new privacy policy of WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook.At the start of the hearing, the court reiterated what it had said on January 18 that WhatsApp was a private app and it was optional whether to download it or not."It is not mandatory to download it. Every other app has similar terms and conditions regarding sharing of user information with others," the court said and asked why the petitioner was challenging the policy of WhatsApp.The court also observed that the Personal Data Protection Bill was being considered by Parliament and the government was looking into issues raised in the plea.During the hearing, ASG Sharma told the court that by not giving Indian users the option to opt out of sharing their data with other companies of Facebook, WhatsApp prima facie appears to be treating users with an "all or nothing approach"."Insofar the government is concerned, while the privacy policy offered by WhatsApp to its European users specifically prohibits use of any information shared with Facebook companies for the companies' purposes, this clause is not found in the privacy policy offered to Indian citizens who form a very substantial part of WhatsApp's user base."This differential treatment is certainly a cause of concern for the government. It is also a matter of concern for the government that Indian users are being unilaterally subjected to the changes in the privacy policy," the ASG told the court."This leverages the social significance of WhatsApp to force users into a bargain which may infringe on their interests in information privacy and information security," he said.He told the court that though the issue was between two private individuals - WhatsApp and its users - the scope and expanse of WhatsApp "make it a germane ground that reasonable and cogent policies are put in place which is being done by the Personal Data Protection Bill and discussions are very much on".Sharma said the government was already looking into the issue and had sent a communication to WhatsApp seeking certain information.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for WhatsApp, told the court that the communication had been received and would be responded to.The court, thereafter, listed the matter for hearing on March 1.The petition, by a lawyer, has contended that the updated privacy policy violates users’ right to privacy under the Constitution.The plea has claimed that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp allows full access into a user's online activity without there being any supervision by the government.Under the new policy, users can either accept it or exit the app, but they cannot opt not to share their data with other Facebook-owned or third-party apps.

25-01-2021||New Delhi||India among top 10 hit by climate change: Germanwatch||India is among the top 10 most affected countries in the Global Climate Risk Index 2021 published on Monday by the Bonn-based environmental think tank Germanwatch.It said vulnerable people in developing countries suffered the most from extreme weather events like storms, floods and heatwaves, while the impacts of climate change are visible around the globe. Being the deadliest and costliest tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical Cyclone ‘Idai’ was labelled “one of the worst weather-related catastrophes in the history of Africa” by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. It caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis, making Mozambique and Zimbabwe the two most affected countries in 2019. The Bahamas rank third after the devastation of Hurricane Dorian. In the past 20 years (2000-2019), Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti were the countries most affected by the impacts of such weather events.These are some of the main results of the Global Climate Risk Index 2021, published only a few hours before the Global Climate Adaptation Summit begins. “The Global Climate Risk Index shows that poor vulnerable countries face particularly great challenges in dealing with the consequences of extreme weather events. They urgently need financial and technical assistance,” said David Eckstein of Germanwatch.“Therefore, it is concerning that recent studies show that the 100 billion dollars per year pledged by the industrialised nations will first not be reached, and second that only a small proportion of this has been provided for climate adaptation. The Climate Adaptation Summit starting today must address these problems.”  Eight of the 10 countries most affected between 2000 and 2019 are developing countries with low or lower middle income per capita. India ranked as the seventh worst-hit country in 2019. Responding to the ranking, Anjal Prakash, Research Director and Adjunct Associate Professor at Bharti Institute of Public Policy and Coordinating Lead Author of IPCC’s special report on oceans and cryosphere, said it was not surprising to know that India appeared to be in the top 10 most affected countries in the global climate risk index of 2021.“As an IPCC scientist, we have been pointing towards extreme risk an emerging market such as India is going to face due to very rapidly changing climatic conditions.“India is blessed by many ecologies—glaciers, high mountains, long coastlines as well as massive semi-arid regions which are the hotspots for climate change. Global warming is leading to an increase in the frequency of cyclones, the melting of glaciers at much faster rates, and heatwaves. “A majority of the Indian population is dependent on agriculture, which is being severely affected by the impacts of climate change. This year, India saw many of its cities drowning due to variability of the monsoon system. Many global reports, including IPCC reports, have been pointing this out year after year,” he said.“What is the appalling lack of response from the government to safeguard its people against the impacts of climate change? A national adaptation plan was prepared way back in 2008 followed by state action plans. However, most of the plans lack resources so that they are integrated into the district development and disaster risk reduction plan. It is high time that the government commissions India’s state and district-specific climate-risk maps to further disaggregate this information to understand which areas need more attention than others,” said Prakash.Vera Kuenzel of Germanwatch said the poorer countries are hit hardest because they are more vulnerable to the damaging effects of a hazard and have the lower coping capacity. “Countries like Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan are repeatedly hit by extreme weather events and have no time to fully recover before the next event hits. Thus, strengthening their resilience must not only address adaptation, but also provide the necessary support for dealing with losses and damages.” In the past 20 years, globally nearly 4,80,000 fatalities were directly linked to more than 11,000 extreme weather events. The economic damages amounted to approximately $2.56 trillion (calculated in purchasing-power parity, PPP) -- again a rise compared to the previous year.Storms and their direct implications—precipitation, floods and landslides—were the major cause of damage in 2019. Of the 10 most-affected countries in 2019, six were hit by tropical cyclones. Recent science suggests that not only the severity but also the number of severe tropical cyclones will increase with every tenth of a degree in global average temperature rise. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-among-top-10-hit-by-climate-change-germanwatch-203429
25-01-2021||Mumbai||Nobody should feel pain while chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’, says Sanjay Raut||Days after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee declined to speak at an event where ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans were raised, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said nobody should feel pain while chanting the slogan.Talking to reporters here on Monday, Raut said he is sure Mamata Banerjee also had faith in Lord Ram.Banerjee on Saturday declined to speak at an official programme to celebrate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's 125th birth anniversary in Kolkata after ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans were raised from the audience in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.She said such "insult" was unacceptable.Asked about the BJP accusing Banerjee of feeling pained when chanting the slogan, Raut said, "Nobody should feel pained to say 'Jai Shri Ram' in the country."        "Nobody's secularism will be under threat by saying ‘Jai Shri Ram’. We think Lord Ram is the pride of the country," he said.“‘Jai Shri Ram’ is not any political word. It is a matter of our faith, and I am sure that Mamata didi also has faith in Lord Ram," the Rajya Sabha member said.An editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' also said Banerjee should not have got upset when ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans were raised by some people during the programme."Rather, tables would have turned on them (those who raised slogans) had she mixed her voice among theirs. But everyone is catering to their own vote banks," it said.The BJP had identified Banerjee's "weak point" and it would keep playing up such sensitive issues until the Assembly elections (in West Bengal) were over, it said.The editorial also launched a veiled attack on the BJP, accusing it of poaching TMC leaders in West Bengal to defeat the Mamata Banerjee-led party in the forthcoming polls in that state.It said the leadership of West Bengal, Punjab and Maharashtra were at the forefront of the country's freedom struggle.The three states are fighting for their self-pride at present also and the Centre is against them, it claimed.Farmers from Punjab, who are agitating against the Centre's new farm laws near Delhi border, are allegedly being trampled, it said.Maharashtra is being targeted in a "pre-decided" manner, the Marathi daily alleged, apparently referring to notices by central agencies to some of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders.The BJP poached Congress and NCP leaders ahead of the 2014 Maharashtra Assembly polls and gave them candidature, it alleged, saying most of such candidates had got elected."What happened in Maharashtra is (now) happening in West Bengal. (BJP) doesn't have anything of its own. It creates its legion poaching with whom it is going to fight. It happened in Bihar. Now, struggle is on to defeat the TMC by poaching TMC (leaders)," the Shiv Sena charged.West Bengal forest minister Rajib Banerjee quit the Mamata Banerjee cabinet recently, joining the growing list of dissenters who have put the ruling camp in a tight spot ahead of the Assembly elections.The editorial said the BJP winning 18 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal is a matter of concern for Mamata Banerjee."But this Bengal tigress (Mamata Banerjee) is the one who fights on the streets and will keep fighting," it added.

25-01-2021||New Delhi||EC soon to begin mock trials for remote voting: CEC||Mock trials for remote voting facility for electors would begin soon, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora has said.In his message to mark the 11th National Voters’ Day, he said a research project on remote voting using cutting-edge technology had already begun.“There has been a good progress in this regard and mock trials will begin soon,” Arora said on Sunday, adding the poll panel’s proposal to extend postal ballot facility for overseas Indian voters was under active consideration of the Law Ministry.The Election Commission has collaborated with IIT-Madras to work on a new technology which will allow electors to vote from faraway cities without going to designated polling station of their constituencies.Explaining the ‘blockchain’ technology involved in the project, former Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Sandeep Saxena had earlier said the concept was a “two-way electronic voting system in a controlled environment on white-listed IP devices on dedicated Internet lines enabled with biometric devices and a web camera”.Saxena, however, made it clear that the voters would have to reach a designated venue during a pre-decided period of time to be able to use this facility.“It does not mean voting from home. After a voter’s identity is established by the system, a blockchain-enabled personalised e-ballot paper will be generated. When the vote is cast, the ballot will be securely encrypted and a blockchain hashtag generated. This hashtag notification will be sent to various stakeholders, in this case, the candidates and political parties,” the official said.The encrypted remote votes so cast will once again be validated at the pre-counting stage to ensure that they have neither been decrypted nor tampered with or replaced.“Suppose there is a Lok Sabha election and a Chennai voter is in Delhi. Instead of returning to vote in his or her constituency or missing out on voting, the voter can reach a pre-designated spot set up by the EC, say in Connaught Place, in a particular time window and can cast his vote,” Saxena had said.He said such voters may have to apply in advance to their returning officers to exercise the option.

25-01-2021||New York||FDI in India rose by 13 per cent in 2020, as inflows declined in major economies due to pandemic: UN||Foreign Direct Investment into India rose by 13 per cent in 2020, boosted by interest in the digital sector, and while fund flows "declined most strongly" in major economies such as the UK, the US and Russia due to the Covid pandemic, India and China “bucked the trend”, the UN has said.An 'investment trends monitor' issued by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on Sunday said that global foreign direct investment (FDI) collapsed in 2020 by 42 per cent to an estimated USD 859 billion from USD 1.5 trillion in 2019.Such a low level was last seen in the 1990s and is more than 30 per cent below the investment trough that followed the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.The decline in FDI inflows was concentrated in developed countries, where fund flows fell by 69 per cent to an estimated USD 229 billion.However, FDI in India rose by 13 per cent, boosted by investments in the digital sector."China was the world's largest FDI recipient, with flows to the Asian giant rising by 4 per cent to USD 163 billion. India, another major emerging economy, also recorded positive growth (13 per cent), boosted by investments in the digital sector," the report said.It added that "in relative terms, FDI flows declined most strongly in the UK, Italy, Russia, Germany, Brazil and the US due to the dramatic impact of COVID-19. India and China bucked the trend".FDI in South Asia rose by 10 per cent to USD 65 billion. India's 13 per cent rise in FDI saw the total foreign investments for 2020 touching USD 57 billion. The report noted that acquisitions in India's digital economy was the largest contributor to this rise.Cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) sales grew 83 per cent to USD 27 billion, the report said, citing social networking giant Facebook's acquisition of 9.9 per cent stake in Reliance Jio platforms, via a new entity, Jaadhu Holdings LLC Infrastructure. Similarly deals in the energy sector propped up M&A values in India, it said.Further, India and Turkey are attracting record numbers of deals in information consulting and digital sectors, including e-commerce platforms, data processing services and digital payments.Despite projections for the global economy to recover in 2021, the UNCTAD expects FDI flows to remain weak due to uncertainty over the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.The organisation has projected a 5 per cent to 10 per cent FDI slide in 2021 in last year's World Investment Report.“The effects of the pandemic on investment will linger,” said James Zhan, Director of UNCTAD, investment division.“Investors are likely to remain cautious in committing capital to new overseas productive assets," Zhan said.

However, with these temporary bases we can overcome many of those challenges and do what we’re here to do – build durable peace,” Shearer said.The UN official said he was very proud of the peacekeepers for their commitment and dedication and for taking this proactive, robust approach to protecting civilians and building peace.

25-01-2021||Jammu||Soldier succumbs to injuries caused in Pak firing along LoC||An Army soldier, who was critically injured in Pakistani firing along the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri district last week, succumbed to injuries in the command hospital in Jammu and Kashmir’s Udhampur district on Sunday, a defence spokesperson said.He is the third Army personnel to have died in the ceasefire violations by Pakistan this month.“Pakistan Army had resorted to unprovoked ceasefire violation on the LoC in Sunderbani sector on January 18, which was responded to strongly by Indian troops. In the incident, Naik Nishant Sharma of 10 JAK RIF was critically injured and was under treatment at command hospital,” the spokesperson said.However, he said the Non-Commissioned Officer succumbed on Sunday.“Naik Sharma was a brave, highly motivated and a sincere soldier.

25-01-2021||Mumbai||Not sexual assault if there is no ‘skin to skin’ contact: HC||Groping a minor’s breast without “skin to skin contact” cannot be termed as sexual assault as defined under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the Bombay High Court has said.Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court, in a judgement passed on January 19, the detailed copy of which was made available now, held that there must be “skin to skin contact with sexual intent” for an act to be considered sexual assault.She said in her verdict that mere groping will not fall under the definition of sexual assault.Justice Ganediwala modified the order of a sessions court, which had sentenced a 39-year-old man to three years of imprisonment for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl.As per the prosecution and the minor victim’s testimony in court, in December 2016, the accused, one Satish, had taken the girl to his house in Nagpur on the pretext of giving her something to eat.Once there, he gripped her breast and attempted to remove her clothes, Justice Ganediwala recorded in her verdict.However, since he groped her without removing her clothes, the offence cannot be termed as sexual assault and, instead, constitutes the offence of outraging a woman’s modesty under IPC section 354, the high court held.While section 354 entails a minimum sentence of imprisonment for one year, sexual assault under the POCSO Act entails a minimum imprisonment of three years.The sessions court had sentenced him to three years of imprisonment for the offences under the POCSO Act and under IPC section 354. The sentences were to run concurrently. The high court, however, acquitted him under the POCSO Act while upholding his conviction under IPC section 354.“Considering the stringent nature of punishment provided for the offence (under POCSO), in the opinion of this court, stricter proof and serious allegations are required,” HC said.“The act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault,” it said.Justice Ganediwala further said in her verdict that “the act of pressing breast can be a criminal force to a woman/ girl with the intention to outrage her modesty”.The POCSO Act defines sexual assault as when someone “with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, or does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration is said to commit sexual assault”.The court, in its verdict, held that this “physical contact” mentioned in the definition of sexual assault must be “skin to skin” or direct physical contact.“Admittedly, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast. As such, there is no direct physical contact i.e. skin to skin with sexual intent without penetration,” the HC said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-sexual-assault-if-there-is-no-skin-to-skin-contact-hc-203110

Those farmers group will cover 46 km of distanceTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 24Delhi Police on Sunday said they have taken an in-principle decision to allow farmers to hold their proposed tractor rally inside the territory of the national capital on January 26. The proposed tractor rally of farmers on Tuesday will begin amid tight security after Republic Day celebrations conclude, the police added.The rally will be conducted in three parts -- first from Singhu border having 62 km route, then from Tikri border with around 60 km route and Ghazipur Border with 46 km route. Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Deependra Pathak mentioned about the intelligence inputs suggesting that there are elements, which pose threats to the proposed rally.He said an analysis of Twitter handles revealed that there are 308 such accounts created in Pakistan which are attempting to create confusion and thus disturbances during farmers’ rally.Police are working out the details and the security drill for the rally, he said.Detailing the plan for the tractor parade, Deependra Pathak said the rally on Tuesday will be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day celebrations conclude.“Over 300 twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan during January 13 to 18 to disrupt the tractor rally by farmers only by misleading people. There are inputs about the same from different agencies too. It will be a challenging task for us but the rally will be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day parade is over,” Pathak said at a press conference.Since November last year, farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the Centre’s three new agriculture laws at several Delhi border points, including Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, demanding that the legislations be repealed.Pathak said, “As the farmers wanted to do a tractor rally on January 26, we have come to a conclusion that the rally will be conducted after the timing of the Republic Day Celebration ends. We have given them around 170 kilometres of distance in three routes”.Barricades and other security arrangements will be removed and the farmers will enter the national capital. Later, they will return to their destinations after covering a “respectable” distance, police said.“For the Delhi Police, it will be a challenging task. We have spoken to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh Police officers about how it will be conducted in a convenient way. The rally will be started after the time period of the Republic Day Celebration has ended,” he said.“We will have the tractor rally on January 26 and there will be no disturbance of the Republic Day celebration and security arrangements,” Pathak said.The professional assessment of these routes has been done, he said.The expected number of tractors should be distributed in a way that the rally will be concluded in a peaceful and discipline way, police said, adding that adequate security will be provided to the rally.“The rally will start from Singhu border and pass through Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, Kanjhawala, Bawana, Auchandi Borer, Kundli–Manesar–Palwal expressway and will return to Singhu border. It will cover a stretch of around 62 kilometres,” Pathak said.He said the farmers with their tractors will start from Tikri border and pass via Nangloi, Najafgarh, Jharoda, Kundli–Manesar–Palwal expressway and will head back to Tikri border.“The rally from Ghazipur border will pass through Apsara Border, Hapur Road Kundli–Manesar–Palwal expressway and concluded at Ghazipur. Those farmers group will cover 46 km of distance,” Pathak said.The routes will cover over 100 km of distance in the national capital, police said.The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha assured that they will go back to their respective places from where the rally started, police said.As of now, there are approximately 12,000 to 13,000 tractors at various Delhi border points—around 7,000 to 8,000 at Tikri, around 5,000 at Singhu and around 1,000 at Ghazipur border—police said, adding that their number is expected to go further up.While police tried to convince farmer leaders to hold their tractor parade outside the national capital, they were adamant on holding the proposed rally on Delhi’s busy Outer Ring Road.Earlier, there have been three rounds of meetings between the unions and police officers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, but it was during the fourth round of talks over the tractor parade on Friday where both sides reached an agreement.

25-01-2021||Mumbai||Thousands of farmers march to Mumbai to protest new agriculture laws||Thousands of farmers have left for Mumbai from Maharashtra’s Nashik district for a rally to demand repealing of the Centre’s three new farm laws.The rally organised by Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha will be held in Mumbai on January 25, a statement issued by the organisation said on Saturday.The rally will be addressed by former Union agriculture minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, state Congress president Balasaheb Thorat and Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray.A delegation will also present a memorandum to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the release said.The farmers owe allegiance to over a 100 organisations under the umbrella of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), which has given a nationwide call for similar agitations between January 23-26, including taking out rallies to Raj Bhavans in all states.From Sunday, thousands of farmers will stage a 3-day 'sit-in' protest at Azad Maidan in Mumbai in which the 'vehicle morcha' will also join them, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) president Dr. Ashok Dhawale said.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of these laws.Multiple rounds of talks between the government and farmer unions have failed to break the impasse so far, while the Supreme Court has appointed a panel for resolution.

25-01-2021||Nalbari (Assam)||Congress-AIUDF will open all gates to welcome infiltrators: Amit Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday alleged that if the Congress-AIUDF combine come to power in Assam they will open “all gates” to welcome infiltrators.Addressing a public rally here, Shah said the Congress rule in the state gave only bloodshed, in which thousands of youths lost their lives.“Can Congress and Badrudding Ajmal keep Assam free from infiltration? If they come to power, they will open all gates to welcome them, because it is their vote bank,” he said.Only the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi can protect the state from infiltration from the neighbouring country, Shah said in his first election rally in poll-bound Assam.The Congress has formed Grand Alliance with AIUDF, CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML) and Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) to fight the upcoming Assembly election, likely to be held in March-April.Attacking the Congress, Shah said, “Congress continued the British policy of divide and rule. They created a divide between Adivasis and non-Adivasis, Assamese people and hill peoples, Bodos and non-Bodos.“In 20 years there was only bloodshed and 10,000 Assamese youths were killed by bullets fired by the Congress.”     Appealing to the people to vote for the BJP, Shah said if the party comes to power again, Assam will be “bullet-free, agitation-free and flood-free”.Shah also slammed the Congress for its constant criticism that the BJP is a communal front and said, “Congress alleges us to be communal, but it has allied with Muslim League in Kerala and AIUDF in Assam.“One thing is sure, Assam is not safe in the hands of Congress and AIUDF”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-aiudf-will-open-all-gates-to-welcome-infiltrators-amit-shah-203055
25-01-2021||New Delhi||Ladakh standoff: India, China hold 9th round of military talks||After a gap of over two-and-half months, the Indian and Chinese armies on Sunday held another round of Corps Commander-level talks with an aim to move forward on disengagement of troops from all friction points in eastern Ladakh, sources said.The ninth round of high-level military talks began at around 10 am at Moldo border point on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, they said.            The eighth and last round of military talks had taken place on November 6 during which both sides broadly discussed disengagement of troops from specific friction points.The Indian delegation at talks is being led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps.India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region.The seventh round of Corps Commander-level talks had taken place on October 12 during which China was pressing for withdrawal of Indian troops from a number of strategic heights around the Southern bank of Pangong lake.However, India insisted that the disengagement process has to start simultaneously at all the friction points.Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded concrete outcome to resolve the standoff.China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials.Last month, India and China held another round of diplomatic talks under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs. However, no concrete outcome emerged from the talks.Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides had announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.This round was held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.
