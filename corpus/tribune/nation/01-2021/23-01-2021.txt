There are some moments where you fall short of words to express your gratitude, and I think today is that day. Balasaheb remained cordial with all political parties at the personal level," the CM recalled.Uddhav said he was thankful to leaders of various political parties who attended the unveiling event by keeping their political affiliations aside."My grandfather Balasaheb Thackeray always respected personal relations with political leaders irrespective of their ideological differences. This is a very important moment for us as his statue has finally come up here in Mumbai," said Aaditya Thackeray, state minister and son of CM Thackeray.On the occasion, the CM felicitated Shashikant Wadke, who sculpted the statue.Deputy Chief Minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar was absent from the function as he was in Pune.The state government had earlier named the upcoming Nagpur-Mumbai super communication highway after Bal Thackeray.One of the hospitals run by the Mumbai civic body was also named after the Sena patriarch.

23-01-2021||New Delhi||Legal education in the country needs urgent reforms: Supreme Court judges||There is an urgent need for reforming legal education in the country as its quality is being affected due to the “mushrooming” of law colleges, two Supreme Court judges said on Saturday.“I do believe we are churning out too many lawyers without any analysis of the number of lawyers required,” Justice S K Kaul said.He said the quality of legal education has suffered as a result of a large number of “not so great law colleges” and the “crying need of the hour” was to see how legal education can be improved.Similar issues were also raised by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.Referring to the concerns raised by Justice Kaul and Singhvi, Justice N V Ramanna said, “I welcome this thought-provoking discussion and I agree with what they have expressed. It (legal education) requires urgent and immediate reform.”“I hope something can be done and we can take up this issue in the coming days,” he added.The remarks by the two apex court judges came during an event for the release of the book—The Law of Emergency Powers—authored by Singhvi and professor Khagesh Gautam, who teaches law at Jindal Global Law School, on a legal and constitutional study of emergency powers.Speaking at the event, which was conducted virtually, Singhvi lamented upon the “glaring absence of genuine legal research in large parts of India”.“Part of this is due to the many factories of legal education we produce with hardly any quality control. The negative impact of the stratification of law colleges must be urgently addressed.“Central universities set up by Parliament operate their law faculty as law schools, while state universities act mostly as affiliating universities which are affiliating colleges set up by private trusts and societies,” he said.He said that the major problem facing Indian legal education, particularly good legal research, was the affiliated law college system.“Many do not have adequate or qualified faculty or libraries or e-resources and they omit regular classes and examinations,” he added and demanded that substandard and mediocre law colleges ought to be closed down.

23-01-2021||New Delhi||India says it doesn’t support treaty on nuclear-weapon prohibition||As the first-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons entered into force, India said on Friday that it does not support the treaty and shall not be bound by any of the obligations that may arise from it.The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in 2017, but none of the nine countries known or believed to possess nuclear weapons supported it and neither did the NATO alliance. The treaty came into force on Friday.In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said India continues to attach high priority and remains committed to universal, non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament.“As far as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is concerned, India did not participate in the negotiations on the TPNW and has consistently made it clear that it will not become a party to the Treaty,” the MEA said.India does not support the treaty and shall not be bound by any of the obligations that may arise from it, it said.India believes that the treaty does not constitute or contribute to the development of customary international law, nor does it set any new standards or norms, the statement said.The MEA stated that India reiterates its commitment to the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world.India believes that this goal can be achieved through a step-by-step process underwritten by a universal commitment, and an agreed global and non-discriminatory multilateral framework, as outlined in the country’s working paper titled ‘Nuclear Disarmament’, submitted to the UN General Assembly and the Conference on Disarmament.In this regard, India supports the commencement of negotiations on a comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Convention in the Conference on Disarmament, which is the world’s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum working on the basis of consensus, the MEA said.India stands ready to work with all UN member states towards the objective of a world free of nuclear weapons, it said.

23-01-2021||Bilaspur||Chhattisgarh: Three women held for assaulting inmates at shelter home||Two days after the manager of a shelter home for women was arrested for allegedly raping an inmate, three women employees of the facility in Chhattisgarh’s Bilaspur district were nabbed on Saturday, police said.The police have arrested three women staffers of Ujjawala Home, a government-aided shelter, on charges of physically assaulting inmates, said JP Gupta, station house officer (SHO) of Sarkanda police station here.The trio, all in their 20s, was arrested based on the statements of three inmates, who were recently shifted out of the shelter, he said.Ujjawala Home Bilaspur, run by NGO Shri Shivmangal Shikshan Samiti since 2014, landed into controversy on January 17, when a 20-year-old woman was allegedly not allowed to leave the shelter even after her husband came to take her back home.The man then forcibly took his wife and reached Sarkanda police station where they lodged a case of wrongful confinement, voluntarily causing hurt and obscene acts against the shelter home staff.Shelter home manager Jitendra Maurya also lodged a case against the woman’s family on charges of house trespass and obscene acts, he said.Meanwhile, two other women inmates also reached the police station alleging physical and mental abuse of women at the facility and they were also made complainants in the case, he said.On January 19, the three women approached the media stating that one of them was sexually assaulted by Maurya and other inmates were physically tortured by the staff, following which they were called to record their statement before a magistrate on Thursday.In their statements, one of them alleged that she was raped by Maurya, following which he was arrested, he said.Another woman also said that she and other inmates was physically assaulted by the staff, based on which three women employees were apprehended, he said.Further investigation into the matter is underway, he added.The shelter home has been shut and seven other inmates have been shifted to their homes and other government facilities, another official said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chhattisgarh-three-women-held-for-assaulting-inmates-at-shelter-home-202654

So technologies and sensors contemporary to that period of development would be added into fifth-generation fighters,” he added.Bhadauria said when IAF received the Rafale aircraft, the first priority was to operationalise it and integrate it with the existing combat fleet.“It has already been done, and the current exercise Desert Knight was the result of that,” he said.“We have some Indian pilots training in France and some in India itself. We have enough pilots to have a right pilot-cockpit ratio,” the Air Chief Marshal said, adding that the entire induction would be completed by next year.Earlier, Bhadauria congratulated both the air forces for successfully completing the exercise in just four days. Desert Knight-21 was scheduled to be held over five days.“It is not in terms of interoperability which has been learnt in this exercise, but employment of best practices, operational philosophies and mutual as well as professional interaction,” he said.Later, talking to the media, French Ambassador to India Emmanuel Lenain said bilateral cooperation between the two countries has been going on ever since the first French aircraft landed in India in 1953.“Now Rafale is the reflection of this strengthened cooperation and partnership,” Lenain said.He said this partnership has persisted through good and bad times.“When India faced difficulties during its atomic test in Pokran in 1998, we were at your side while other countries opposed and objected. And we were also by your side in cooperational manner when you had difficulties with one of your neighbours,” the ambassador said.He said this exercise would further help in building mutual trust and pave the way for more cooperation.

23-01-2021||New York||Ageing dams in India, US, other nations pose growing threat: UN report||Over a thousand large dams in India will be roughly 50 years old in 2025 and such aging embankments across the world pose a growing threat, according to a UN report which notes that by 2050, most people on Earth will live downstream of tens of thousands of dams built in the 20th century.The report, titled ‘Ageing water infrastructure: An emerging global risk’ and compiled by United Nations University’s Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health, says most of the 58,700 large dams worldwide were constructed between 1930 and 1970 with a design life of 50 to 100 years.It said at 50 years, a large concrete dam “would most probably begin to express signs of ageing.”Ageing signs include increasing cases of dam failures, progressively increasing costs of dam repair and maintenance, increasing reservoir sedimentation, and loss of a dam’s functionality and effectiveness, “strongly interconnected” manifestations, the report said.“By 2050, most people on Earth will live downstream of tens of thousands of large dams built in the 20th century, many of them already operating at or beyond their design life,” according to the UN University analysis.The analysis includes dam decommissioning or ageing case studies from the USA, France, Canada, India, Japan, and Zambia and Zimbabwe.According to the report, the world is unlikely to witness another large dam-building revolution as in the mid-20th century, but dams constructed then will inevitably be showing their age.The report said that 32,716 large dams (55 per cent of the world’s total) are found in just four Asian countries: China, India, Japan, and South Korea - a majority of which will reach the 50-year threshold relatively soon.The same is true of many large dams in Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe, it said.In India, there are over 1,115 large dams that will be roughly 50 years old in 2025, more than 4,250 large dams in the country will be over 50 years old in 2050 and 64 large dams will be more than 150 years old in 2050, it said.The report says approximately 3.5 million people are at risk if India’s Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala, built over 100 years ago, “were to fail”The report said approximately 3.5 million people are at risk if India’s Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala, built over 100 years ago, “were to fail”.“The dam, in a seismically active area, shows significant structural flaws and its management is a contentious issue between Kerala and Tamil Nadu States,” it said.The report added that dams that are well designed, constructed and maintained can “easily” reach 100 years of service but predicts an increase in “decommissioning” - a phenomenon gaining pace in the USA and Europe - as economic and practical limitations prevent ageing dams from being upgraded or if their original use is now obsolete.In the US, the average age of 90,580 dams is 56 years. More than 85 per cent of US dams in 2020 were operating at or beyond their life expectancy and 75 per cent of US dam failures occurred after 50 years of age. The estimated cost to refurbish US dams is about USD 64 billion. Nearly 1,275 dams were removed in 21 US states in the last 30 years; 80 removed in 2017 alone, it said.Worldwide, the huge volume of water stored behind large dams is estimated at 7,000 to 8,300 cubic km - enough to cover about 80 per cent of Canada’s landmass under a metre of water.The report’s co-author Vladimir Smakhtin, Director of UNU-INWEH, said the report aims to attract global attention to the creeping issue of ageing water storage infrastructure and stimulate international efforts to deal with this emerging, rising water risk.“Underlined is the fact that the rising frequency and severity of flooding and other extreme environmental events can overwhelm a dam’s design limits and accelerate a dam’s ageing process. Decisions about decommissioning, therefore, need to be taken in the context of a changing climate,” Smakhtin said.Lead author and UNU-INWEH Senior Researcher Duminda Perera said the problem of ageing large dams today confronts a relatively small number of countries - 93 per cent of all the world’s large dams are located in just 25 nations.“Large dam construction surged in the mid-20th century and peaked in the 1960s - 70s especially in Asia, Europe and North America, while in Africa the peak occurred in the 1980s. The number of newly-constructed large dams after that continuously and progressively declined,” he said.The pace of large dam construction has dropped dramatically in the last four decades and continues to decline in part because “the best locations for such dams globally have been progressively diminishing as nearly 50 per cent of global river volume is already fragmented or regulated by dams,” the report says.There are also strong concerns regarding the environmental and social impacts of dams, and large dams in particular, as well as emerging ideas and practices on the alternative types of water storage, nature-based solutions, and types of energy production beyond hydropower, it said.Public safety, escalating maintenance costs, reservoir sedimentation, and restoration of a natural river ecosystem are among the reasons driving dam decommissioning, the report said, adding that overall, dam decommissioning should be seen as equally important as dam building in the overall planning process on water storage infrastructure developments.

23-01-2021||New Delhi||Women army officers once again move SC for grant of permanent commission, promotions and benefits||Eleven women army officers have moved the Supreme Court seeking compliance of its February last year directions to the Centre for grant of permanent commission, promotions and consequential benefits to them "in an inclusive, fair, just and reasonable manner".In a plea, Lieutenant Colonel Ashu Yadav and 10 other women Army officers alleged that the directions were not being complied with in "letter and spirit".The procedures for grant of permanent commission is "vitiated with arbitrariness, unfairness and unreasonableness", they alleged in the petition, which is scheduled to be taken up for hearing by a bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud on January 27."The respondent institution is not leaving any possibility of thrusting their stand of unequal treatment to the women officers indirectly by trapping them into technical and procedural formalities and consequential denial of their rights," it said.The conduct of the Centre suggests that it is "playing a psychological warfare with these women officers" to avoid every possibility of granting them the benefits of permanent commission, promotion and consequential benefits, which is in clear violation of the order dated February 17, 2020, the plea said."Hence, it is most humbly prayed before this court to direct the respondent institution to determine a fair, rational road map and a well-reasoned policy for women officers on all the aspects, including grant of Col (Colonel) TS (time scale) rank and long outstanding financial dues, so as to promote inclusiveness rather than elimination techniques," it said.The plea challenged the general instructions, dated August 1, 2020, regarding the requisites of Special Board-5 (SB-5) for grant of permanent commission to short service commissioned (SSC) women officers.It has also challenged the absence of any policy for organising the SB-3 board which is the promotion board for women officers who will be approved by the permanent commission board.The plea also questioned the terms regarding substantive promotion by time scale on the rank of Colonel to women officers after completing 26 years of reckonable service in light of the terms of a notification dated December 21, 2004.Pointing out the shortcomings of the SB-5 board criterion, the women officers said that the general instructions of August 1 last year, "are a set of arbitrary norms/criterion and pre-requisites, for the consideration of women officers by the SB-5 board that is the board for granting permanent commission".It said that the medical criterion laid down in the general instructions is inconsistent with the basic tenets of equality as laid down in Article 14 of the Constitution of India.The general instructions released by the Indian Army on August 1 last year are "full of ambiguities as it contains provisions which seek to eliminate the women officers rather than giving them a fair chance or opportunity of permanent commission", the plea said.The petitioners said that it is apprehended that applying such procedure on women officers is only to render them unfit."For instance, women officers above 45 years (approaching menopause) and unmarried women officers were also made to undergo pregnancy test overlooking their age and marital status," they claimed in their plea.The plea said that women officers subjected to the permanent commission board include those who have continued in service beyond 14 and 20 years performing all such duties that have been performed by their male counterparts without any obstruction due to physiological changes."Thus, the medical conditions not being an impediment in career progression and promotions for male officers in the similar service length bracket cannot be so for the women officers," it said.The petitioners said that in a hierarchical organisation like the army, where stiff competition exists for each vacancy in promotion boards (SB-3), objectivity of ACRs of senior women officers having been rendered by male counterparts who were many batches junior to them, in some cases their students, cannot be considered at such a belated stage or for that matter at any stage to avoid unparalleled prejudices."It will be in clear breach of the provisions of the Army Order… consisting of the terms of protection of rights of a batch," the plea said.The officers submitted that they have been deprived of the provision for time-scale promotion recognised by the Indian Army which was introduced through the notification of December 21, 2004, wherein all officers who have completed the service period of 26 years without promotion to the rank of Colonel by selection shall be so promoted by time scale.They said that the purpose of filing the plea is to "highlight the remaining hurdles to the battle of permanent commission, promotion and consequential benefits which has been fought and won over a period of 15 years with a hope of achieving their rightful claims".On February 17 last year in a landmark verdict, the top court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted permanent commission, rejecting the Centre's stand of their physiological limitations as being based on "sex stereotypes" and "gender discrimination against women".The apex court had directed that within three months, all serving SSC women officers have to be considered for permanent commission irrespective them having crossed 14 years or, as the case may be, 20 years of service.---

The family took the body to the forest area adjoining their home to perform the last rites. However, of late the forest department has banned funerals in the forest land so the family had no option but to go to the public crematorium.Veluchamy, the crematorium keeper employed by the Puthur panchayat, refused to let the family perform the last rights of Vasantha as he feared that people from the upper caste will become angry.He told mediapersons, "I can't allow the funeral of a Dalit woman at this place as other caste people will turn violent." The Puthur panchayat is under the progressive Left Democratic Front (LDF) and a Communist Party of India (CPI) leader is the panchayat president.Jyothi Anilkumar, the panchayat president while speaking to media persons said, "This is not a panchayat crematorium. Instead we have constructed the side wall and provided funds for the maintenance of the crematorium but the land is owned by Goundar community and they will not allow cremation of Dalits here." The statement by the panchayat president is surprising as the party which she belongs to claims to follow a progressive ideology.State minister for SC/ST AK Balan told IANS, "I got to know about the unfortunate incident. The SC/ST commission has already directed the Palakkad district collector to look into the matter and submit a report on it. We will take necessary action once we receive the report." The Palakkad district collector was not available for comment. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dalits-denied-funeral-at-public-crematorium-in-keralas-palakkad-202647
23-01-2021||Johannesburg||South Africa's regulatory body approves Serum Institute of India's COVID-19 vaccine||South Africa's health regulatory body has granted approval to the world's largest drug manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) to supply COVID-19 vaccine to the country.Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced on Saturday that the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) has granted approval to the SII, which is producing the vaccine in collaboration with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, to supply the drug to the country.The approval comes amid growing concerns that the 1.5 million vaccine doses to be shipped to South Africa in the next few weeks had not been approved by the local regulator.“We will, in the next coming days, engage with the public in order to give an update on the progress of the first batch of the vaccines that we committed would be received in the first quarter," said Mkhize.The minister had earlier told the country's Parliament that the SII would supply a million doses of the vaccine to South Africa by the end of January and a further 500,000 in February, which would be used to vaccinate front line healthcare workers.“At this stage we would like to assure South Africans that all is on track. We are working closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure a smooth implementation of the vaccine roll-out programme,” said Mkhize.South Africa is battling a second wave of the COVID-19 as well as a new variant of the deadly virus.The country reported 11,761 new COVID-19 cases and 575 deaths in the last 24 hours. With this, the total number of fatalities in the country has reached 40,076.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, the country has 1,392,568 COVID-19 cases.The minister said that his department had also been offered vaccines from private agents.“As a department we have resolved and wish to advise the public that it is critical that any such agent and vaccine authenticity must be verified directly with manufacturers. This is the only way, in our view, to guarantee the quality of the vaccines that may be acquired through third parties,” said Mkhize.

23-01-2021||New Delhi||Customary 'halwa ceremony' kickstarts process of compilation Budget documents||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur and senior officials of the Finance Ministry on Saturday participated in the symbolic 'halwa ceremony' that marks the beginning of compilation of Budget documents.Unlike the past, the voluminous Budget documents will not be printed this year following the COVID-19 protocol and will instead be distributed electronically to the Members of Parliament (MPs). Previously, the ceremony marked the launch of printing exercise for the Budget.This will be the first time since the presentation of independent India's first Budget on November 26, 1947, that the documents containing income and expenditure statement of the Union Government along with the Finance Bill, detailing new taxes and other measures for the new financial year, will not be physically printed."In an unprecedented initiative, Union Budget 2021-22 will be delivered in paperless form for the first time. The Union Budget 2021-22 is to be presented on February 1, 2021," the Finance Ministry said in a statement.On the occasion, the Finance Minister also launched the 'Union Budget Mobile App' for hassle-free access to Budget documents by Members of Parliament (MPs) and the general public using the simplest form of digital convenience.The mobile app facilitates complete access to 14 Union Budget documents, including the Annual Financial Statement (commonly known as Budget), Demand for Grants (DG), Finance Bill, etc. as prescribed by the Constitution, the ministry said.Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj, Financial Services Secretary Debasish Panda, DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Expenditure Secretary TV Somanathan and Chief Economic Adviser KV Subramanian and other senior officials involved in the Budget preparation and compilation process, were also present in the customary pre-Budget event."Later, the Finance Minister reviewed the status of the compilation of the Union Budget 2021-22 and extended her best wishes to the officials concerned," read the statement.It further said that the app had a user-friendly interface with embedded features of downloading, printing, search, zoom in and out, bidirectional scrolling, table of contents and external links, etc.The App can also be downloaded from the Union Budget Web Portal (www.indiabudget.gov.in), it said, adding, the app has been developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) under the guidance of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA).The Budget documents will be available on the Mobile App after the completion of the Budget Speech by the Finance Minister in Parliament on February 1.As part of the ritual, ''halwa'' is prepared in a big ''kadhai'' (large frying pot) and served to the entire staff involved in the Budget making exercise of the ministry.Halwa was served while maintaining COVID protocol with all present in mask and those distributing sweets were wearing gloves.The significance of the event is that after the sweet dish is served, a large number of officials and support staff, who are directly associated with the Budget making are required to stay in the ministry and remain cut off from their families till the presentation of the Budget in the Lok Sabha.They are not even allowed to contact their near and dear ones through phone or any other form of communication, like e-mail.This will be the first time since Independence that physical copies of Budget documents will not be shared with MPs to avoid the risk of COVID-19 infection, the sources said, adding all MPs will get soft copies of the Budget and Economic Survey.The familiar sight of trucks loaded with budget papers in Parliament on the Budget Day and scanning of these by the security guard will also be given a miss.The Budget for FY22 will come against the backdrop of an economic contraction of 7.7 per cent, the first time in the history of independent India. So, all stakeholders have great expectations from the upcoming Budget, which could provide a healing touch to the pandemic-battered economy and push growth.Even Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month promised a 'never before' like Union Budget to the people of India.

23-01-2021||Kochi||Kerala HC dismisses habeas plea of ‘spiritual guru’ for release of woman from parents’ custody||The Kerala High Court has dismissed a habeas corpus plea filed by a 52-year-old man claiming to be a “spiritual guru” seeking release of a 21-year-old woman from the custody of her parents terming her as his “spiritual live-in-partner”.A Division Bench of the High Court, comprising justices K Vinod Chandran and M R Anitha, dismissed the plea observing that the “antecedents” of the man are “not such as to trust him with the custody of a young girl of 21” on mere statement of she being tutored, by him, in spirituality.“This is especially so when the parents of the subject had initially approached the petitioner with their daughter for psychiatric consultation and their trust in him as a doctor and therapist was breached to the extent of the petitioner declaring his patient to be a live-in partner; when he himself was married with two children,” the court said in its January 20 order.In his plea, the man alleged illegal detention of the woman by her own parents on the ground that he had a live-in relationship with her for the last two and half years.The man moved the court as the live-in spiritual partner of the woman and does not speak of any marriage between them.The court, which interacted with the woman, also found that she was “incapable of taking a decision for herself” and directed her to be retained with her parents at her parental home.“We in fact found nothing to remove the subject from the custody of her parents; in her present mental state, which they are the best persons to address.”    “We are not satisfied that the parents are in any manner incapable of or dis-entitled from retaining custody of their daughter who though a major was showing signs of mental disturbance,” said the judgement authored by Justice Vinod Chandran.The man is said to have completed MBBS from Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram and after his marriage to a woman in 2001, proceeded to the UK for post-graduation in Psychiatry.After returning, he initially pursued the medical profession, but later proclaimed himself to be a Vedic Yogacharya/Instructor.The court noted that the man is also stated to have not cooperated for a direct and detailed inquiry and was unwilling to disclose his personal and professional details.The petitioner claimed that he was getting fees and gifts from his followers and he had no other regular means of income.“On local inquiry it is reported that there is no information of the petitioner having any followers. It is reported that the petitioner is not leading a socially acceptable life and has difficulty in explaining the means and goals of his spirituality,” the court said.In his plea, the man asserted he had a live-in relationship with the woman for the last two-and-a-half years as spiritual partners.The court observed that there was no allegation that the parents had illegally removed the woman from the man’s custody.The man admitted he is married with two children but goes on to say that they are under the care and shelter of the petitioner, living separately, it said.The court recalled its earlier interaction with the woman wherein she categorically denied she was married and asserted the relationship with the man to be divine.The court offered her assistance for counselling and tried to persuade her to at least, at its behest, to interact with a psychiatrist or psychoanalyst for it to get an expert opinion, which she refused point blank, it said.“We attempted such a course of action since the subject, on our assessment, was incapable of taking a decision for herself and the parents too had raised serious concerns of her obsessive behaviour which we too witnessed during our interaction,” the court said.In its judgment, the court cited the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Hadiya case holding that its interactions with the woman suggested that she was having “vulnerability occasioned by mental disturbance.”            The court also referred to a passage from the Hadiya case where the Supreme Court observed that there was nothing to suggest that Hadiya suffered from any kind of “mental incapacity or vulnerability”. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-hc-dismisses-habeas-plea-of-spiritual-guru-for-release-of-woman-from-parents-custody-202618

It (Ramani's claim of Akbar's sexual misconduct in a hotel) is complete hearsay, fabricated and false,” Luthra said She said that Nilofer, Ramani's friend and a key witness in the case, was not an eyewitness.The court will further hear the matter on  January 27.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018. He resigned as union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as "media's biggest predator" that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment he faced from the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/me-too-ramanis-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct-false-akbar-reiterates-before-delhi-court-202608

23-01-2021||Ahmedabad/Amritsar||Gujarat cattle herder who crossed over to Pak in 2008 returns||A cattle herder from Gujarat’s Kutch district, who had inadvertently crossed over to Pakistan in 2008 and was arrested there on charges of spying, has finally returned to India after languishing in the neighbouring country’s jails, officials said.Ismael Sama, 60, from Nana Dinara village in Kutch, located some 60 km from the Pakistan border, had mistakenly crossed over to Pakistan while grazing his cattle.He was arrested and kept in the jails of that country before he was released two days back following the Islamabad High Court’s order on a plea moved by the Indian High Commission there.Sama reached Amritsar after crossing over to the Indian territory through Wagah-Attari international border on Friday, officials at Attari said.Some of his family members also reached Amritsar to receive him, sources said.The authorities in Amritsar are completing some formalities, including Sama’s medical examination, after which he would be handed over to his family, the officials said.He was received by Fajal Sama, who runs an NGO in his village, and his relative Yunus Sama, on Saturday at the Indian Red Cross Society in Amritsar.“I had mistakenly crossed over to the Pakistan side while grazing my cattle. They called me a spy and an agent of RAW. ISI kept me in jail for six months, then handed me over to the Pakistan Army. I was in their custody for three years before being sentenced to five years in jail. Even after completing my sentence in October 2016, I was not released,” Sama said over phone from Amritsar.“I remained in Hyderabad Central Jail for seven years until 2018. Thereafter, I was sent to Karachi Central Jail along with two other Indians,” he said.Fajal Sama, also a native of Nana Dinara village, said, “After his disappearance in 2008, Sama’s family members had no idea on his whereabouts till 2017, and could only surmise that he might have been arrested in Pakistan, but had no documentary evidence.”“It was confirmed only after another person from a neighbouring village, who was released from Pakistan in 2017, returned and told us that Sama was with him in the jail there,” he said.Journalist and peace activist Jatin Desai said after learning about Sama’s case, Pakistan-India Peoples’ Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFPD) and a local NGO started contacting the two governments and writing to the Pakistan High Commission requesting his release.“He had mistakenly crossed over to Pakistan in 2008 through the border as there was no fence then. Cattle herder would inadvertently cross over to the other side. He crossed over by mistake and was caught,” Desai said.His release was made possible after the Indian High Commission petitioned for the release of four Indian prisoners who had completed their sentences long back, he said.“When the case was heard on January 14, the court was told that three of them have already been released. As for Ismael, Pakistan’s deputy attorney general told the court that he will be released,” Desai said.He said peace activists in the two countries have been demanding that prisoners like Sama be released and repatriated on the same day their sentence gets over.“If we talk of the two countries, I’d say there is only one case, that of Hamid Ansari, who was released and repatriated on the same day that his sentence got over in 2018, and returned immediately to India,” he said.However, people are sometimes forced to languish due to delay in confirmation of nationality, he added.

The protesters threw stones, broke down barricades and attacked police personnel, prompting the police to resort to mild lathi charge," Tiwari said.The CSP denied that police used force to suppress the protest.Addressing protesters at Jawahar Chowk before the clash, Nath said the three new farm laws enacted by the Central government were completely anti-farmer."The three laws would benefit only capitalists while the farmers would become slaves and bonded labourers of industrialists," he said.Alleging that small and marginalised farmers have been ignored while making these laws, Nath said mandis (agri markets) and Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime will come to end if these legislations are implemented.Farming would become a contractual affair, he added."The Central government should immediately repeal the three laws by accepting the farmers' demand," the former chief minister said.He said the Congress will continue to support the agitating farmers till the government accepts their demands.Later, Nath took to twitter to blast the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government over the police "brutality"."I strongly condemn the barbaric cane charge, use of tear gas and water on thousands of farmers and Congressmen protesting peacefully (sic)," Nath tweeted."In the lathi charge, farmers, Congressmen, women and mediapersons have been injured. I wish them speedy recovery.Our support to farmers would continue. We are not going to be bogged down with such suppression," Nath added.According to the Madhya Pradesh Congress, the protests launched by the party in the state since January 7 on the issue of farm laws culminated on Saturday with the "massive protest" held at Bhopal.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws.Multiple rounds of talks between the government and farmer unions have failed to break the impasse so far, while the Supreme Court has appointed a panel for resolution. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-congress-protests-over-farm-laws-cops-use-tear-gas-water-cannons-202585

I didn’t even experience anything mild after taking the shot. It was exhilarating to get inoculated and contribute to the national fight against COVID,” Panda said.Asked if he had apprehensions before taking the shot, the joint secretary rank officer who has previously served in the ministries or food, civil supplies and petroleum and natural gas, said, “I had no apprehensions whatsoever. I was always clear that I have to take the vaccine. There was no dilemma. The vaccines have passed the regulatory rigours and are safe.”Panda added that bureaucrats serving in health systems are also being covered in phase one of the inoculation drive along side health workers.Panda has been at AIIMS for three years and urged everyone registered for the shot in phase one to accept the vaccine and build immunity against the virus.“All of past year we ate and drank anything anyone said would build our immunity against Covid. Why not take the vaccine? It’s no silver bullet against the virus but it sure offers protection from disease,” said Panda whose brother Debasis Panda is also an IAS officer of 1987 batch from Uttar Pradesh Cadre and is currently posted as Secretary to government of India in the Department of Financial Services.Panda said people must be conscious of a scenario of potential resurgence of COVID as being witnessed in the European countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/exhilarating-says-first-serving-bureaucrat-to-get-covaxin-202578

23-01-2021||London||Vijay Mallya applies for ‘another route’ to stay in UK, says his lawyer||Vijay Mallya, who is due to be extradited to India, has applied for “another route” to be able to stay in the UK, the embattled liquor tycoon’s barrister representing him in bankruptcy proceedings in the High Court here confirmed in the court for the first time.The 65-year-old businessman, whose legal challenge to the Indian government’s extradition request was turned down at the Supreme Court level in the UK last year, remains in Britain on bail until UK Home Secretary Priti Patel signs off on the order for him to be extradited to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering related to the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.“The extradition was upheld but he [Mallya] is still here because as you know there is another route for him to apply to the Secretary of State [Patel] for status,” said barrister Philip Marshall, when specifically asked by Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Nigel Barnett about the status of the extradition proceedings during a remote hearing on Friday.The UK Home Office has so far only confirmed on background that a confidential legal process remains ongoing before the extradition request, signed by the Home Secretary on February 3, 2019, can be certified and executed.This had raised widespread speculation that Mallya had sought asylum in the UK, details of which are neither confirmed nor denied by the Home Office in Britain while an application is pending.It is likely that the reference made by Mallya’s barrister is to an asylum route which, according to legal experts, would depend upon whether Mallya applied for asylum prior to the extradition request or after.“He would need to argue much stronger grounds. There are specific rules that detail when asylum is a bar to extradition, it is clear that claiming asylum after all appeals have been exhausted is unlikely to be considered a valid claim to asylum protection,” explains Toby Cadman, co-founder of Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers and a UK-based extradition specialist.The court on Friday also heard how Mallya, who submitted written evidence for the hearing, was in a “constrained” position as a close relative had passed away as a result of COVID-19.The remote hearing in the commercial division of the High Court in London was to establish whether the court could sanction substantial sums towards Mallya’s living expenses and legal fees from the sale of a French luxury property Le Grand Jardin last year.The money is held in the UK’s Court Funds Office (CFO) as part of bankruptcy proceedings brought by a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) in pursuit of unpaid loans.Mallya’s legal team argues that he should be sanctioned the required funds to meet mounting legal costs in India and the UK, which includes costs to be paid to the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which argued the extradition proceedings on behalf of the Indian authorities.The lawyers for the banks have challenged this as it would dissipate the funds owed to his creditors towards speculative and “unreasonable” costs while other sources of funds remain available to the businessman.The banks’ barrister, Tony Beswetherick, argued that Mallya’s latest written evidence shows that he “does have other assets that he can utilise to meet the very significant costs he is seeking to have validated and paid (including two yachts that he has put into storage in Southampton, debts owed to him by family trusts, and cars in storage in France)”.However, Mallya’s lawyers pointed to a worldwide freezing order in place that constrains access to his assets and the conclusion in October last year of his consultancy arrangement for a Formula One team meant he had no other sources of income at his disposal.They claimed the conduct of the banks was “highly oppressive” and an attempt to “starve Dr Mallya of the funds”.At the end of a half-day hearing, the judge reserved his judgment on the issue of access to court-held funds and is expected to hand down his ruling in the coming weeks.The hearing forms part of a series as both sides make arguments for and against a bankruptcy order against Mallya in the UK.

23-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmer unions hold meeting to reconsider govt proposal to put farm laws on hold||A meeting of 32 Punjab farmer unions opposed to the Centre's farm laws was held at the Singhu border here, a major protest site, to reconsider the government’s proposal to put the contentious legislations on hold.This comes a day after the government asked farmer leaders to revert by Saturday in case they agree to its proposal to suspend the legislations for 18 months.Unlike the last 10 rounds of talks between the government and farmer leaders, the 11th round on Friday saw both sides hardening their positions. They could not even reach a decision on the next date for the meeting.Also read: Adani Group says being targeted through false propaganda, manufactured online campaignThe government asked farmer unions to revert by Saturday in case they agree to the suspension proposal and the talks can continue only thereafter.This followed a big climbdown made by the Centre in the last round of talks on Wednesday when it offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi borders.Farmer leaders, however, said they would settle for nothing less than a complete repeal of the laws, enacted in September last year, which they find pro-corporate, and a legal guarantee for the procurement of crops at government-fixed MSP (minimum support price).They said their tractor parade would go ahead as per the plans on January 26 and unions had told the police that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.The farmer unions are adamant on taking out their tractor parade on Delhi's busy Outer Ring Road on January 26, even as Delhi Police urged them to hold it outside the national capital, a request that was publicly rejected by the unions.A meeting between a group of farm leaders and police officers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is scheduled later on Saturday to discuss alternative routes for the tractor parade.Talking to reporters after the meeting on Friday, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government had always maintained a sensitive approach towards farmers and their interests, but some forces were definitely at work to keep the agitation on and those forces certainly did not want farmers to benefit."No resolution is possible when the sanctity of an agitation is lost," he had said while adding that no decision could be reached in the interest of the farmers if vested interests got an upper hand.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on MSP for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the 'mandi' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

23-01-2021||Pune||Tourists can now peek inside Pune's historic Yerwada jail||Marking a new chapter for tourists, the Maharashtra Government will throw open important prisons in the state for 'jail tourism', starting this Republic Day on January 26 with the historic 150-year-old Yerwada Central Jail in Pune.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will inaugurate the initiative on Republic Day in the presence of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and other top officials, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced on Saturday."This is the first phase of 'jail tourism'. Later it will be extended to other prisons like Nagpur, Nashik, Thane, Ratnagiri, etc. A small fee of Rs 5 for school students, Rs 10 for collegians and Rs 50 for general tourists shall be levied," said Deshmukh.Built by the British in 1871, parts of the high-security Yerwada Central Jail – spread across lush greenery of 512 acres, the largest in South Asia – will be opened for tourists, students, researchers and others to go around and study various aspects of the old prison deeply linked with India's freedom struggle.Pune's human rights lawyer Asim Sarode welcomed the move and said it should be implemented with full security protocols for all concerned so that the tourists could get a feel of the jail without disturbing the inmates.Earlier, the Cellular Jail in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, infamous as 'Kala Paani' and Fort Aguada Jail in Goa – both sea-facing – were among the major prisons where tourism has been allowed, besides the Sangareddy Central Jail, Telangana, which permits a 24-hour paid stay with full 'jail-comforts' for tourists.Accessible through an imposing fortress-like entrance, with a tall foyer on which the Tricolour flutters, the Yerwada Central Jail complex is secured by four high walls to prevent any adventurous escapes.The prison areas are sub-divided as per security zones and barracks for the roughly 5,000 inmates, and there are ultra-secure 10 'Anda Cells' (oval cells) for isolating the most heinous criminals and terrorists.It has a 'Kishore Wing' for prisoners in 18-21 age-group where the young incarcerated inmates are given education or skills to keep them off crime after their release, and a 300-capacity Female Jail where the inmates get various types of vocational training.Outside the jail is the Open Jail where inmates with minimum five years of very good behaviour are permitted limited freedom, with basic security as per the jail norms.The prisoners' white uniforms are 'colour-coded' - Yellow Bands for those representing their groups/barracks, Violet Bands for those working as volunteers and Red Band for those who made failed escape attempts.The Yerwada Central Jail also has the historic 'Gandhi Ward' where Gandhiji spent years as a political prisoner, now vacant, but with a 'Charkha' and his signed documents, besides other documents signed by other prominent personalities of the freedom movement.The jail has a 'Mulakat Kaksh' (Meeting Room), a radio station where popular numbers are played and once incarcerated Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt even served as its radio jockey, important festivals are celebrated jointly like Republic Day and Independence Day, along with Rakshabandhan, Diwali, Eid, Makar Sankranti and Gandhi Jayanti, and an annual 'Prison Panchayat' is also held.Education, which is now compulsory for all inmates across jails includes courses in English, Hindi or Sanskrit with periodic examinations, besides vocational training in computers, carpentry, tailoring, soap-making, footwear, farming, etc, and the proceeds of the products sold outside get distributed among the inmates, and for recreation a library, games room, gym, yoga centre, etc.The sprawling prison canteen prepares food for all, ensuring the menu is not repeated in a week, and on special occasions, biryanis or 'puran-polis' are served, a jail hospital where all treatment barring surgeries are available, besides a welfare fund was created out of the profits from the canteen or the jail industry centre.Among the legendary historic figures who spent time here include Mahatma Gandhi, Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Sarojini Naidu, Lokmanya Tilak and Joachim Alva.During the Emergency, notables who were jailed included Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Pramila Dandawate, Balasaheb Deoras, and Vasant Nargolkar.More recently, Anna Hazare, Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt, scamster Abul Karim Telgi and ex-mafia don Arun Gawli also were lodged here on various occasions.In his 18-month stint starting January 1932, Gandhiji launched an indefinite hunger strike to protest the Communal Award for separate seats for depressed classes by then British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.This culminated in the famed 'Poona Pact' signed by Gandhiji, Dr BR Ambedkar - the architect of the Indian Constitution - and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, in September 1932.Gandhiji again spent some time at Yerwada Central Jail in 1942 and also in Pune's Aga Khan Palace, from where he was released on medical grounds.The jail also saw some instances of criminals getting the noose - notably the May 1899 hangings of the Chaphekar brothers - Balkrishna, Vasudev and Ranade - for killing British Plague Commissioner in Pune, WC Rand, in 1897, soon after the diamond jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria's coronation.In October 1992, Sukhdev Singh Saini and Harjinder Singh Jinda - the killers of Indian Army chief Gen AS Vaidya - were hanged on the same day.Much later, in November 2012, Ajmal Kasab, the sole surviving terrorist of the Mumbai terror strikes of November 2008, also was sent to the gallows.

FIRs have been lodged in connection with some of the incidents, according to officials.Panic gripped a busy neighbourhood in Noida's Sector 63 on Friday morning as heavy security was deployed and the area cordoned off following an alert that a bomb-like device was found on a road."The device was checked by a bomb disposal squad which found that it had no detonator or explosive attached to it. It turned out to be a suspicious-looking item with a watch strapped to its front portion and placed there by some miscreant," a police spokesperson said.On Thursday, an unidentified caller informed a prominent private hospital in Noida's Sector 27 that a bomb was placed in its basement, triggering panic and evacuation of people from the premises."Police personnel, bomb disposal squads, dog squads and fire tenders reached the hospital immediately and the building was checked for any suspicious item. It turned out to be a hoax," Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Noida, Ranvijay Singh had said.In Ghaziabad, an LPG cylinder with a watch-like device attached to it triggered an alarm on Wednesday. The "suspicious" item was found in an empty plot in Madhuban Bapudham area by two police officials on patrol duty.A bomb disposal squad soon reached the spot and found that it was not a bomb. However, an FIR has been lodged against an unidentified person, according to Ghaziabad police officials.Two hoax bomb threats were also received in Allahabad and one in Kanpur on Friday."The police were informed that a bomb had been placed in PVR mall (Vinayak City Centre). Security was deployed immediately and the area cordoned off for a search by bomb disposal squads and anti-sabotage teams," SP (City) Dinesh Kumar Singh.The officer said similar information was received regarding the Star World multiplex on Katghar road in Mutthiganj area of the city. Both turned out to be hoaxes.Singh said police are tracking the persons who gave the false information and action would be taken against them.In Kanpur, a Twitter user flagged a bomb threat for South X shopping mall in Kidwai Nagar area and a couple of other crowded spaces in the city on Friday, triggering panic among the public and quick deployment of security personnel.Later, in a statement, the Kanpur police said it was a hoax as no explosives were found in the vicinity of the mentioned spots. An FIR was lodged against the Twitter user at the Juhi police station and legal proceedings initiated.The Twitter handle, @suryavanshiBad1, which had posted the bomb hoax, could not be found when last checked by PTI on Saturday morning.

23-01-2021||Sivasagar||PM reaches out to indigenous Assamese amid anti-CAA clamour||Reaching out to the indigenous people of election-bound Assam amid frequent anti-CAA protests, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday distributed land ownership certificates to over one lakh such families, insisting the move will guarantee them “pride, freedom and protection”.On his first physical visit outside the national capital this year, Modi reaffirmed the state and the central government’s commitment to protecting the land rights and the unique cultural traditions of the indigenous people.आज असम की सरकार ने आपके जीवन की बड़ी चिंता दूर की है। 1 लाख से ज्यादा मूल निवासी परिवारों को भूमि के स्वामित्व का अधिकार मिलने से आपके जीवन की बड़ी चिंता अब दूर हो गई है।- पीएम @narendramodi #AssamWithPMModi pic.twitter.com/boCi4u2liT  He also castigated the previous governments for depriving them of their land rights for years since Independence.“When the Sarbananda Sonowal government took over the reins in Assam, more than six lakh indigenous families had no legal rights over their land. In the last few years more than two lakh such families have been allotted ownership certificates.“With more than one lakh families added today, the government has shown its commitment to protecting the rights of the indigenous people,” Modi said.The previous governments in Assam never cared for the rights of those who “loved this sacred land”, he alleged.“The land ownership certificates (pattas) will guarantee their ‘Swabhiman’ (pride), Swadheenta (freedom) and Suraksha (protection),” the prime minister asserted.As Modi spoke at the function in Sivasagar, the historical capital of the Asom kings, anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests were staged at several places in Assam. The prime minister, however, steered clear of the controversies surrounding the two and made no mention of these in his speech.Seeking to impart nationalistic fervour to the event, Modi said Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, whose 125th birth anniversary was being celebrated on Saturday across the country by his government as ‘Parakram Diwas’ (The Day of Valour), “inspires hope and national pride”.“Netaji is loved and respected for the sense of pride he instilled in all Indians and his spirit of freedom will guide as we celebrate the day across the country to realise our national goals,” he said.He asserted that the BJP-led government is committed protecting the land, language and culture of the indigenous people of Assam.Modi said the state’s BJP-led government had introduced a new land policy in 2019 to give land ownership rights to them.“They can now improve their living standards by availing of the benefits of a host of central government schemes like PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, crop insurance scheme, and also easily secure farm loans from banks,” he said.About 70 tribal communities in Assam were provided social security under BJP-led governments at the Centre and in the state, he said.Modi said, in the last four-years-and-half, his government took steps to honour and promote Assamese literary, cultural and spiritual heritage.“It should have been the responsibility of all governments to preserve, protect and spread Assam’s cultural heritage. But what happened to the sattras, including Batdarva, the birth place of saint Srimanta Sankardeva, is not hidden from the people of Assam,” he said, apparently referring to alleged encroachment of its land by illegal immigrants.The sattras are hallowed Vaishnavite monastries in Assam.The prime minister said the development of Assam and the North East was fundamental to his government’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ mission.He said the 1.75 crore Jan Dhan accounts opened by his government proved a boon during the COVID-19 pandemic as relief funds could be directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries without any leakage.Over 50 lakh cooking gas cylinders were distributed to 35 lakh households under the Ujjwala scheme during the pandemic, he said.Reaffirming his commitment to restoring peace in the North East, Modi said the historic Bodo accord signed last year, and the subsequent Bodoland Territorial Council election gave a fresh impetus to the state’s development.Noting that Assam and other states of the North East formed the cornerstone of his government’s ‘Act East Policy’, Modi said improved surface, water and air connectivity has opened new vistas of development in the region.

Farm leaders said the youth had confessed he was part of a 10-member team that had been ‘instructed by a cop’ to disrupt the tractor parade on January 26. The youth was presented at a press conference by union leaders. TNSAlso read:At the end of the over four-hour-long meeting, that saw discussions for barely 30 minutes, Tomar asked the unions to reconsider his offer and to get back by Saturday, if they decide in its favour. Thanking the unions, Tomar said: “Even though there was nothing wrong in the laws, for the benefit of farmers and respect for their agitation, the government came up with several proposals.”He said: “You (unions) launched agitations even as you were engaged in talks with us. We didn’t object. The vision (at your end) was lacking.” Later speaking to the media, the minister claimed there were forces which did not want the talks to succeed. “The government made several proposals to end the stir, but when the purity of the movement is lost, no solution is possible,” he maintained.Sources say Tomar is believed to have told the unions that they should not have issued a statement rejecting the proposal ahead of the talks today.He also hinted at “differences” among the unions regarding the government’s offer. Fifteen Punjab unions are said to have voted in the favour of the Centre’s offer yesterday.Unions, meanwhile, said they would now concentrate on the agitation and prepare for the tractor parade.

It considered the election schedule of May 29 proposed by the central election authority and unanimously agreed to extend the schedule until June as counting for five state elections could be happening in May,” AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal and Congress media head Randeep Surjewala said.Both insisted that the CWC meeting was “very fruitful and argument-free”.But committee sources said Sharma clashed with Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot when the latter suggested that leaders should concentrate on fighting the BJP instead of seeking internal elections.“The BJP never speaks of internal elections. Whose agenda are we furthering?” Gehlot said. Former party chief Rahul Gandhi later said he respected both Gehlot and Sharma’s sentiments and “everyone should now move on”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-to-elect-new-president-by-june-after-polls-in-5-states-202272

He is survived by his wife and three children.Born on October 16, 1940, in Amritsar’s Shakti Nagar locality, Chanchal hailed from a middle class family. Despite his interest in singing, his family never encouraged him to become a singer. But when his father suffered huge losses in the share market, Chanchal took up singing to support his family.“He began performing at weddings and other functions. He also worked with playwright Gursharan Singh, composing music for his plays. Gradually, his popularity grew and he started getting invitations to perform in other cities as well,” says Kewal Dhaliwal, theatre director and art historian. In 1972, one such invitation to perform in Mumbai changed Chanchal’s life forever. Raj Kapoor spotted him and offered him work in his film “Bobby”. The rest, as they say, is history. The song “Beshak Mandir Masjid Todo” from the cult movie became immensely popular and won him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Singer. He received Rs 12,000 for the song from Raj Kapoor.Chanchal’s film career as a playback singer was short but notable with songs like “Do ghut pila de saakiya” in “Kaala Sooraj”. His songs like “Tune mujhe bulaya” from “Aasha” and “Chalo bulawa aaya hai” from “Avtaar” firmed up his career as a devotional singer. With a four-decade-long career in music, Chanchal changed the genre of devotional music with his unparalleled popularity.Despite his fame, Chanchal never lost touch with his roots. “He visited his home in Amritsar every year, and distributed Vaishno Devi parshad from his annual visits to the shrine to the entire neighbourhood,” recalls Inderjit, his immediate neighbour in Shakti NagarVicky Datta, the organising head of the Maa Durga Welfare Society started by Chanchal in 2010, says the singer never skipped the religious events organised by the society every April in Amritsar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chalo-bulawa-aaya-hai%E2%80%A6-chanchal-no-more-202278

South Africa and Saudi Arabia are among the nations that have sought large doses of vaccines made in India.Brazil has become the test bed for a contest between Chinese and Indian vaccines. This was the reason why Brazil wanted to dispatch aircraft a few days back but New Delhi had withheld clearance at that time. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had then vented his frustration at being bested by his political rival who was promoting a Chinese developed vaccine. He blamed the delay in receiving India-made vaccine on political pressures on PM Modi to first provide vaccines to all Indians.The Leftist Governor of Sao Paulo province, Joao Doria, is backing a vaccine developed by the Chinese lab Sinovac with a local institute. She has already started an inoculation programme forcing Bolsonaro, her Rightist rival, to begin pressing New Delhi for faster supply of the vaccines as they are potential rivals in the 2022 presidential contest in Brazil.The free supply to India’s neighbouring countries from Wednesday and the beginning of commercial exports from today marked a dramatic turnaround in the government’s position. A week ago, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said it was “too early to make specific comments” as “we are still in the stage of domestic production and distribution and making assessments here”.

23-01-2021||---||Farmers threaten to intensify agitation as 11th round of talks hits roadblock||New Delhi, January 22The government's negotiations with protesting farm unions hit a roadblock on Friday as the farmer leaders stuck to their demands for a complete repeal of three farm laws they find pro-corporate and a legal guarantee for MSP, even as the Centre asked them to reconsider its proposal for putting the Acts on hold for 12-18 months.Unlike the last 10 rounds of talks, the 11th round could not even reach a decision on the next date for the meeting as the government also hardened its position saying it is ready to meet again once the unions agree to discuss the suspension proposal.Farmer leaders said they will intensify their agitation now and alleged that the government's approach was not right during the meeting. Also read: Farmers’ tractor parade to go ahead as planned on Republic Day: Union leadersNo resolution possible when sanctity of agitation gets lost; some forces want protest to continue: TomarPunjab, Haryana farmers to set out for tractor parade in Delhi on SaturdayWhy can’t Centre repeal farm laws? asks Capt Amarinder, dubs it ‘inhuman’They also said their tractor parade will go ahead as per the plans on January 26 and unions have told the police that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.The 11th round of farmer-government meeting lasted barely for 30 minutes.Broadly, the government has made it clear that the three controversial laws will not be repealed and that the government has made its best offer.The Union Government has also urged the farmer leaders to consider building consensus around the proposal.Ending the meeting, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told unions that “the government is grateful for thier cooperation”.“There is nothing wrong in the three laws. We gave the proposal but you could not arrive at any decision. If you arrive at any conclusion please let us know, we will discuss again,” Tomar said.Sources say Union Ministers have told farmer leaders that they had given the “best proposal” and that they should try to build consensus around it.Meanwhile, farmer leaders said they were firm on their stated stance and have already decided that farmers would not settle for anything less than the repeal of the three laws.“We will now prepare for the January 26 parade,” they said, adding “the government could not build a consensus and was wrong of them to accuse us of going to the media.Balbir Singh Rajewal has said unions will now concentrate on the January 26 tractor parade.“It will be a unique event. We have told the government and the Delhi police that we will march peacefully on the Outer Ring Road on January 26. If there is violence, the government will be responsible,” Rajewal added.While the morning session lasted for barely 20 minutes, the post lunch was also finished in 10 minutes after Tomar’s brief statement.The government has not set a date for the next meeting and has told the union leaders to think on its proposal.Notably,  a section among Punjab unions were in the favour of accepting the government’s offer. They included some “small unions from Doaba” and similar jathebandis.Unions have claimed “threats” to union leaders namely Darshan Pal and Rakesh Tikait.In the last round of meetings held on Wednesday, the government had offered to put on hold the three laws and set up a joint committee to find solutions. However, after internal consultations on Thursday, the farmer unions decided to reject the offer and stick to their two major demands -the repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP)."We told the government that we would not agree to anything other than the repeal of the laws. But the minister asked us to discuss separately again and rethink on the matter and convey the decision," farmer leader Darshan Pal told PTI during a break after the first session.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said: "We conveyed our position clearly to the government that we want a repeal of the laws and not a suspension. The minister (Narendra Singh Tomar) asked us to reconsider our decision."The eleventh round of talks between protesting farmer unions and three central ministers began at around 1 pm, but not much headway was visible in the first few hours of the meeting.Some leaders had apprehensions that the movement would lose its momentum once the farmers went away from Delhi borders.Harpal Singh, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union - Asli Arajnaitik, said: "Even if we accept the government's offer, our fellow brothers sitting at Delhi borders will not accept anything other than a repeal of the laws. They will not spare us. What achievement will we show to them?"He also questioned the government's credibility, alleging it was difficult to believe that they would keep their word on putting the laws on hold for 18 months."We will die here but we will not return without getting the laws repealed," Singh said.Along with Union Agriculture Minister Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash are also participating in the talks with representatives of 41 farmer unions at the Vigyan Bhawan here.In a full general body meeting on Thursday, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of the protesting unions, rejected the government's proposal."A full repeal of three central farm Acts and enacting a legislation for remunerative MSP for all farmers were reiterated as the pending demands of the movement," the Morcha said in a statement.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws.Farmer groups have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.On January 11, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee appointed by the apex court.Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati, the other three members on the panel, started the consultation process with stakeholders on Thursday. — with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-threaten-to-intensify-agitation-as-11th-round-of-talks-hits-roadblock-202078
23-01-2021||New Delhi||CWC decides to have elected Congress president by June||The Congress on Friday said it would have an elected president by June this year through a process of organisational polls and the election for the all-powerful working committee would also be held.Announcing it after the meeting of the Congress Working Committee, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said: “The CWC unanimously decided that the new elected Congress president should be in place by June 2021. The CWC considered the election schedule of May 29 proposed by the central election authority and unanimously agreed to extend the schedule until June as counting for five state elections could be happening in May.”Asked if the suggestion by dissenters, including Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, to hold elections to the CWC was accepted, Venugopal said elections to the committee would be held but “we will have to go back to the constitution to see if CWC elections will be held before or after the election of the Congress chief. The practice is that the CWC elections are held after the Congress president’s election but we are looking into that.”Venugopal said there were no arguments in the meeting.This despite clear reports from CWC sources of a bitter spat between Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and Anand Sharma.Gehlot is learnt to have ticked off the dissenters without naming them and said “instead of hammering internal Congress elections we should all be talking about fighting elections against the BJP. But we are wasting time discussing irrelevant issues like party elections. We should leave the party matters and decisions to the party president.”At this, Sharma retorted saying Gehlot had been “disrespectful of people who have raised demands about the need for reforms”.Senior leader Ambika Soni had to intervene to cool off tempers with Rahul Gandhi later saying “I understand and respect the sentiments of both Gehlot ji and Sharma ji.”The CWC also passed three resolutions — the first to demand a JPC probe into Arnab chat leaks saying “those guilty of treasonous acts and of violating the official secrets act and breaching national security must be punished”; a second on demanding the repeal of farm laws and third demanding free COVID vaccines for SCs, STs, OBCs and the poor.Earlier in the meeting, Sonia slammed the Centre for arrogance and inflexibility on farm issues, economic affairs, COVID response and Arnab leaks.Sonia said the Centre’s silence on the leaking of national security secret in Arnab chats was “deafening” and quoted former defence minister AK Antony as saying that leaking of the national security secret is treason.Stressing that the Congress would raise people’s issues in the upcoming Parliament session, Gandhi said: “The agitation of farmers continues and the government has shown shocking insensitivity and arrogance going through the charade of consultations. It is abundantly clear that the three laws were prepared in haste and Parliament was consciously denied an opportunity for examining in any meaningful details their implications and impacts.”Gandhi said the Congress position had been very clear from the beginning: “We reject them categorically because they will destroy the foundations of food security that are based on the three pillars of MSP, public procurement and PDS.”Citing recent reports on how national security has been compromised, in a reference to Arnab chats, Sonia said: “I think just a few days back, Antony-ji had said that leaking of official secrets of military operations is treason. Yet the silence from the government’s side on what has been revealed has been deafening. Those who give certificates of patriotism and nationalism to others now stand totally exposed.”She said the vaccination of courageous frontline health professionals and workers had begun and “the Congress hopes the process will continue and be completed to the fullest extent”.Targeting the Centre on the state of the economy, Sonia said the economic situation remained grim and large parts of the economy like MSME and the informal sector had been decimated with the government refusing to extend a lifeline.She said, “When public expenditure has to be carefully prioritised, it is very painful to find huge amounts of money being allocated and spent on initiatives that can only be described as personal vanity projects. Equally anguishing is the manner in which the government has weakened labour and environmental laws and it’s moving ahead with selling-off of carefully built-up public assets. Panic privatisation has gripped the government and this is something that the Congress can never accept and support.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cwc-decides-to-have-elected-congress-president-by-june-202076

However, the CBI enquiry did not find any evidence of any such destruction, according to the officials."The enquiry prima facie established that Global Science Research Ltd, UK dishonestly and fraudulently accessed data of app users of "thisisyourdigitallife" and their Facebook friends," an official said, citing the FIR.

Romney also wanted to know the Biden administration’s response to Indian openness to work with the US in its military preparation and war games.“We are working with India so that no country, including China, could challenge its sovereignty… we are with it on concerns we share about terrorism,” Blinken replied to Romney.He said India was a bipartisan success story over successive administrations starting with Bill Clinton when both sides got over the tensions due to India’s nuclear tests in 1998. The ties were bolstered by the civil nuclear deal (George Bush) which Biden helped pass through US Congress, defence procurement and information sharing (Barack Obama) and the concept of the Indo-Pacific (Donald Trump).“So, I think there are many ways in which we can continue with the path that successive administrations have put us on,” he said while offering the climate crisis as a new area of cooperation especially because Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a strong advocate for renewable energy and associated technologies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kamala-harris-as-vice-president-further-cements-india-us-relationship-white-house-202059
