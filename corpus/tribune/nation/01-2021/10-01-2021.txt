The TMC government is trying to take credit of it. The state government would distribute the vaccines supplied by the Centre and say it is providing free inoculation, just like renaming other central schemes,” West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.            “She is trying to turn it into a poll sop,” he added.The state’s Congress president Adhir Chowdhury, too, spoke in the same vein, alleging that it is yet another attempt by the TMC to fool the masses.“The TMC is well aware its days are numbered, so these are desperate attempts,” he said.The ruling party, meanwhile, dismissed the allegations as baseless.“The TMC government has done a splendid job in COVID management. If we have announced about providing free vaccines, what is the harm in it?” state minister Subrata Mukherjee said.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had recently made a similar announcement. The southern state will also go to polls along with Bengal.The Bihar government, too, has given the cabinet nod to provide free vaccine to every citizen of the state, a promise the saffron party made in its manifesto for the assembly elections held in October-November. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-says-tmc-govt-making-arrangements-for-free-covid-19-vaccine-poll-gimmick-dubs-opposition-196596

The first set of PILs is by Congress MP from Trissur in Kerala TN Prathapan, DMK MP Tiruchi Siva, RJD MP Manoj Jha, Bhartiya Kisan Party and advocate ML Sharma.They have challenged the validity of the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They contended the farm laws were “discriminatory” and will expose marginal farmers to exploitation by big companies.Read also: Farmers ransack Khattar’s Kisan Mahapanchayat venueThe second set of petitions is by Rishabh Sharma and others highlighting the plight of commuters entering the national capital due to continued blockade by agitating farmers. On Saturday, he filed an affidavit in the top court complaining that the farmers have blocked Noida Chilla Border, Tikri Border, Sindhu Border, Gazipur Border, Delhi-Rohtak National Highway, causing hardships to those entering Delhi from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.Citing the top court’s verdict on Shaheen Bagh protests that said public places can’t be blocked and occupied indefinitely, he said the protesters must be removed as they violated the court’s verdict.The third set of plea is by the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA) -- a Hyderabad-based farmers’ organization – which contended that the reforms were beneficial for growth of agriculture in India.“We wish (to) submit that farm reforms are beneficial to enable increased income to farmers and growth of agriculture,” the consortium’s plea filed through CIFA advisor P Chengal Reddy said, demanding to be heard before any decision was taken.Noting that there was no improvement in talks between agitating farmers and the government, the Supreme Court on January 6 said it would take up petitions against farm laws and those against farmers’ protests on January 11. “There is absolutely no improvement in the situation,” CJI Bobde had said.A day later, the CJI had expressed concern over the possible spread of COVID-19 among the agitating farmers and asked the Centre if they were taking precautionary measures against the pandemic. “We are trying to ensure that COVID-19 doesn’t spread. Ensure guidelines issued are followed,” he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-all-eyes-on-monday-hearing-in-sc-196585

For the convenience of the candidates, new CTET examination centres have been created in 23 more cities.According to the CBSE, all the candidates appearing in the examination would be provided with the admit cards as well as information of the examination centres by next week.Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said that the prestigious CTET exam conducted by the CBSE would now be held on January 31 keeping in mind the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Candidates have also been given an opportunity to choose the location of their examination centre, he said.The CTET examination was earlier scheduled to be held in 112 cities across the country, but now under the new arrangements made by the Union Education Ministry, the examination would be conducted in 135 cities.The Ministry said: "'Safety first, then education'... there will be no compromise with the safety of the students. The safety of the students will be strictly ensured before taking any step. The student can only be present in the class or can appear for exams only in a safe environment. " Before this due to coronavirus, Joint Entrance Examination (Mains) and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) had to be postponed thrice in 2020. However, both these exams were finally conducted in late 2020 despite delays.This year, the JEE Advanced 2021 exam would be conducted on July 3 in computer-based test mode. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, this year the eligibility criteria for scoring 75 per cent marks in class 12 has been removed for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).On the other hand, JEE Main examinations would be held in February, March, April and May this year. As per the schedule, the first session of the JEE Main Examination would be conducted between February 23 and 26.---IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ctet-exams-to-be-held-after-200-day-delay-exam-centres-to-be-located-nearby-196575
10-01-2021||New Delhi||SC judgement on pleas seeking review of verdict upholding validity of Aadhaar on Monday||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce on Monday its verdict on pleas seeking review of a verdict upholding the Centre’s flagship Aadhaar scheme as constitutionally valid but striking down some of its provisions, including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions.A five-judge bench, comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan, S A Nazeer and B R Gavai, will take up in-chambers a batch of review pleas challenging the September 26, 2018 verdict.A five-judge Constitution bench headed by then Chief Justice Dipak Misra held that while Aadhaar would remain mandatory for filing of Income Tax Return and allotment of permanent account number (PAN), it would not be mandatory to link Aadhaar number to bank accounts and telecom service providers cannot seek its linking for mobile connections.In a 4-1 verdict that also quashed some contentious provisions of the Aadhaar Act, the top court, however, had held Aadhaar would be needed for availing facilities of welfare schemes and government subsidies.Ruling that seeding of Aadhaar would not be required for opening bank accounts, availing mobile services, by CBSE, NEET, JEE, UGC and for admissions in schools and free education for children, the top court had observed that Aadhaar had also become a household name and that its use has spread like a “wildfire”.It had struck down as unconstitutional the portion of Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to avail of the biometric Aadhaar data.Justice D Y Chandrachud, who was part of the bench, had given a dissenting judgement in which he ruled the Aadhaar Act should not have been passed as a Money Bill as it amounts to fraud on the Constitution and is liable to be struck down.But the majority verdict by the other four judges, including the then CJI, upheld the passage of the Aadhaar Bill as Money Bill in Lok Sabha.

When a number of people started coming to the hospital, it was discovered that they had all consumed spurious liquor. Vikarabad SP M Narayana said 51 people have been admitted so far after they complained of similar symptoms. “51 people are being treated at the Vikarabad government hospital and they are now stable. Three people have been moved to the Mahaveer private hospital and are under observation. Krishna Reddy, a 55-year-old man from Pulimamidi village, died this morning.”Police investigating the case said spurious alcohol consumption is being reported on a daily basis. Because of the festivities due to Sakranti many cases of sickness from alcohol are being reported, but as many people complained of similar symptoms at the same time now, the issue has been highlighted.The symptoms appeared to be similar to withdrawal symptoms about consuming a heavy quantity of adulterated liquor. The police suspect that the liquor could be adulterated toddy or another spirit, a locally brewed alcohol. Investigations are on to ascertain the exact cause, the district SP said. Local media reported that some people said they had felt giddy after drinking just one glass of toddy. All the sick are reportedly from half a dozen neighbouring villages in Vikarabad district. A medical camp has been set up in Erravalli and in Chittigidda to make sure the sick get immediate attention and are not required to be moved to the hospital. The local MLA, Dr M Anand, a doctor himself, has been monitoring the situation and is in touch with the medical doctors. Giving out details, he said, “People from several villages have been affected after they consumed the toddy. I request all those who have toddy that hasn’t been consumed as yet, to not consume it.”The police have launched an inquiry into the incident and some teams also visited the toddy manufacturing unit and inspected the place.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-sakranti-1-dead-over-50-taken-ill-from-toddy%C2%A0in-telangana-196557

10-01-2021||Bhopal||Stop Covaxin trial in Bhopal: NGOs working for gas victims||At least four NGOs working for the survivors of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that the ongoing clinical trials for Covaxin, an indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, be stopped in the Madhya Pradesh capital in view of the “gross violation of laws and guidelines”.In the letters addressed to the PM and Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, these NGOs have also sought punishment for the “responsible parties who were negligent in ensuring the safety, well being and the rights of the trial participants”.They also demanded monetary compensation for “damages caused during the Covaxin trial in Bhopal”.These letters have been written by Rashida Bee of Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh, Nawab Khan of Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha, Rachna Dhingra of Bhopal Group for Information and Action, and Nausheen Khan of Children Against Dow Carbide.Covaxin is developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“We are writing to you to apprise you of the onground situation with regard to the conduct of the trial. Evidence has emerged that the trial in Bhopal is being conducted in gross violation of laws and guidelines governing clinical trials in India,” the NGOs stated in the letters, copies of which were shared with media persons.“This is leading to exploitation and harm to a community of people that are not just economically and socially deprived, but whose health is compromised owing to the destructive impact and its consequences,” they said.The NGOs alleged that vulnerable people were being misguided and herded to participate in the trials, and the consent procedure and other protocol of the testing is being flouted.“The (clinical) trial should be stopped immediately and an impartial probe be conducted,” they demanded.Talking to reporters virtually, Rashida Bee said, “At least 700 of the 1,700 people on who this vaccine, with unknown efficacy, is being tested, are the people poisoned by Union Carbide (gas leak in 1984).“One gas victim has already died within 10 days of getting the trial shot and many continue to have health complaints of serious nature,” Bee alleged.A 42-year-old man, who had taken part in the clinical trial for Covaxin in Bhopal on December 12, died nine days later, with doctors suspecting that poisoning could be the cause.Bharat Biotech had said in a statement that preliminary reviews indicated that the death was unrelated to Covaxin.Bee claimed that nobody was punished for the “death of 13 gas victims during the trials by pharma companies at the Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre some 12 years ago”.She demanded compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the people “who have died during the Covaxin trial, as being given in the case of deceased corona warriors”.Alleging irregularities in the conduct of the Covaxin trials, Dhingra said, “People whose health is compromised due to Union Carbide’s poisons are being given the Covaxin trial shots without their knowledge or consent”.She said audio and video consent should be taken of all the vulnerable people (before allowing them to volunteer for this clinical trial).“No records are kept of the health problems the trial’s participants have had following the shots and several have been turned away without tending to the adverse effects of the shots. Trial participants who leave or are excluded halfway are denied care and are not followed up,” she alleged.Shehzadi Bee of Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha said, “In addition to immediate stopping of the trial and awarding compensation for the gas victim who has died during this trial, we demand a thorough and impartial audit, criminal punishment to officials and institutions responsible for this public health disaster and compensation for injuries caused due to the trial vaccines”.“By ignoring the ongoing criminal irregularities in the Covaxin trial in Bhopal, the government is potentially unleashing a public health disaster on the 16th of this month,” said Nousheen Khan of the Children Against Dow Carbide.The Drugs Controller General of India last week approved Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by Serum Institute, and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country.The Central government on Saturday said India will launch its COVID-19 vaccination drive from January 16, with priority to be given to nearly three crore health care and frontline workers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stop-covaxin-trial-in-bhopal-ngos-working-for-gas-victims-196553

Kharjahrin clarified that by “outside agencies” he meant Punjab government primarily.State government of Punjab had strongly protested when various Khasi interest groups – ranging from the insurgent group HNLC to the state government run by a coalition that includes BJP – tried to arm-twist the Dalit Sikhs living in Harijan Colony to vacate the area.The stand taken by Punjab government to defend the hapless residents of Harijan Colony has not gone down well with the HYC and other Khasi parochial organisations which proliferate in Meghalaya.HYC said relocation of Harijan Colony residents should be viewed from the developmental perspective. “We are asking the outside agencies one last time to refrain from making it a communal issue. Adding fuel to the fire may once again lead to agitations and law and order problems,” the statement, issued by Kharjahrin at Shillong on Sunday, said.Kharjahrin demanded that only state government employees among the Harijan Colony residents should be relocated and the other “illegal residents” evicted.“There is no harm if the legitimate employees are shifted to state government quarters. But I don’t know how accommodation can be provided to Grade 4 employees when the government has not been able to do so for Grade 1 & 2 employees,” the statement quoted the HYC president as having said.According to HYC, there were no records to establish that the Dalit Sikh residents of Harijan Colony were owners of their residences.“The area can be redeveloped for a shopping mall, or a parking lot or a warehouse for storing coal. Utilising the area commercially can sustain the poor people and farmers,” Kharjahrin said.Dalit Sikhs residents of Punjabi Lane claim living in the area for several generations as their forefathers were brought to the hill town by the British for working as sweepers.An incident of assault in the area in 2018 had resulted in group clashes following which the neighbourhood was put under curfew for over a month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/khasi-outfit-warns-punjab-govt-against-interference-196551

Both vaccines, the statement from the Health Ministry said, have established safety and immunogenicity.After vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers, priority will be given to those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities, together numbering around 27 crore, a government statement said.

10-01-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19 impact: Door-to-door survey to enroll students, relaxing detention norms recommended by Education Ministry||The Education Ministry has asked the states to conduct a door-to-door survey to identify out-of-school children and prepare an action plan for their enrolment as part of efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on migrants, according to officials.The ministry has also recommended relaxing detention norms to prevent drop-outs this year as well as a slew of measures to address learning loss due to the coronavirus-induced shutdown of schools.The move is particularly aimed at identification, admission and continued education of migrant children who have been affected during the pandemic, they said."In order to mitigate the impact of challenges thrown by the COVID-19 pandemic for out of school children, it was felt necessary for every state and UT to devise a proper strategy for preventing increased dropouts, lower enrolments, loss of learning and deterioration in the gains made in providing universal access, quality and equity in the recent years," a senior ministry official said."The states and UTs have been advised to carry out proper identification of Out-of-School Children (OoSC) for 6 to 18 years age group through a comprehensive door-to-door survey and prepare an action plan for their enrolment," the official added.The ministry has also issued guidelines for offering support to students during the closure of schools and when they reopen."To ensure that school-going children have access to education with quality and equity and to minimise the impact of the pandemic on school education across the country, the Ministry of Education has prepared and issued detailed guidelines on steps to be taken by the States and UTs during school closure and when the schools reopen," the official said.Exploring the option of classroom-on-wheels and classes in small groups at the village level, increasing the access of children to online and digital resources, use of TV and radio to reduce learning losses and ensuring easy and timely access to the provisions of uniforms, textbooks and mid-day meals are among the recommendations made by the ministry for student support during the closure of schools.Similarly, the guidelines for student support when schools reopen after prolonged closure include preparation and running of school readiness modules and bridge course for the initial period so that they can adjust to the school environment and do not feel stressed or left-out.Identifying students across different grades based on their learning levels and relaxing detention norms to prevent drop out this year have also been recommended.The ministry has also suggested encouraging children to read books beyond the syllabus and indulge in creative writing and problem solving for ensuring reading with comprehension and numeracy skills.Large-scale remedial programmes and learning enhancement programmes should be held to mitigate learning loss and inequality, it recommended.This comes as experts have warned of more school dropouts spurred by the pandemic and its economic fallout.  Last year, UNESCO projected that an estimated 24 million children in 180 countries may not return to education because of the pandemic. Experts fear that pandemic-driven online classes and limited access to internet and technology could be factors adding to dropout rates. --- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-impact-door-to-door-survey-to-enroll-students-relaxing-detention-norms-recommended-by-education-ministry-196533
10-01-2021||New Delhi||Sri Lankan Navy apprehends nine Indian fishermen||A large number of fishermen from Tamil Nadu will keep off the sea on Monday in an apparent reflection of the inability of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to resolve their issues with the Sri Lankan leadership during his Colombo visit earlier this week.In fact with the latest arrests by Sri Lankan Navy on Sunday, the number of Indian fishermen in custody has crossed 50 as against 36 when Jaishankar had left for Colombo amid hopes that he would secure their release.A meeting of the India-Sri Lanka joint working group on fisheries had met in the run up to Jaishankar’s Colombo visit but it has apparently failed to resolve the issue.Fishermen from Tamil Nadu who plan to go on strike say the Sri Lankan Navy has also been seizing mechanised boats and damaging fishing nets as well besides it allowing them to be in the vicinity of Katchatheevu Island.The Katchatheevu Island along with the fishermens’ harassment has become a testing stone of India-Sri Lankan bilateral ties under the Modi government. The Sri Lankan media has been expressing apprehension that New Delhi might take back Katchatheevu Island which was ceded by India to Sri Lanka but this was not ratified by Indian Parliament.Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, in his opening remarks after meeting Jaishankar, had spoken of both sides making efforts to curb illegal activities. Analysts this was a subtle reference to Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu swarming Palk Straits with mechanised trawlers that cause permanent damage by dredging up the sea floor. But their aggressive forays also cause political damage as apprehensions in Sri Lanka rises that India has an eye on the Katchatheevu Island.India has posted diplomat Gopal Bagle, straight from a stint in the Prime Minister’s Office, as its High Commissioner in Sri Lanka to turn around ties.

10-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt reduces security cover of Fadnavis, Raj Thackeray||The Maharashtra government has reduced the security cover of Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and his family, former UP governor Ram Naik and MNS president Raj Thackeray, and withdrawn the security cover of state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.State BJP spokesman Keshav Upadhye termed it as “vendetta politics”, while former chief minister Fadnavis said this would not impact his plans to travel and meet people.However, state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh rejected the opposition BJP’s charge and said the security of political leaders was reviewed as per the prevailing threat perception.As per a government notification issued on January 8, Fadnavis will now get ‘Y-plus security with escort’ instead of the ‘Z-plus’ cover.The security of his wife Amruta Fadnavis and daughter Divija has been downgraded from ‘Y-plus with escort’ to ‘X’ category.Former Uttar Pradesh governor Ram Naik will now get ‘Y’ cover instead of ‘Y-plus’.MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s security cover has been downgraded from ‘Z’ to ‘Y plus with escort’.The security covers of BJP leader and former CM Narayan Rane, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil and senior party leader Sudhir Mungantiwar have been withdrawn. Rane had ‘Y-plus’ security.Besides, the security of state Lokayukta M L Tahiliani has been downgraded from ‘Z’ to ‘Y’.According to sources, the ‘Z-plus’ security comprises a bullet-proof car, a police inspector, two assistant police inspectors, two police sub-inspectors, two escort vehicles with six constables in each, and 10 other constables at any given point of time, while the ‘Z’ category has a security cover of 22 personnel.The ‘Y’ category comprises a security cover of 11 personnel, while the ‘X’ category has a security cover of two personnel, the sources said.The government, as per the notification, has upgraded the security of two persons, downgraded of 11, withdrawn of 16, while 13 new people have got security cover.Prominent among the new persons to get security are Sunetra Pawar, wife of state Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, and Varun Sardesai, secretary of the Yuva Sena and nephew of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s wife Rashmi Thackeray.Both have been given ‘X’ security cover.Union minister Ramdas Athawale will get only 'Y-plus' security instead of the 'Y-plus with escort', while central minister Raosaheb Danve's 'Y-plus' cover has been withdrawn.The government has also withdrawn the security cover of former minister Rajkumar Badole, BJP MLAs Prasad Lad and Ram Kadam, and former speaker and BJP legislator Haribhau Bagde.The state has also withdrawn the ‘X’ category security of former Mumbai Congress chief Kripashankar Singh, who quit the party, and BJP’s former minister Shobhatai Fadnavis, an aunt of Devendra Fadnavis.Senior advocate Ujjwal Nikam’s ‘Y-plus with escort’ cover has been upgraded to ‘Z’, while film actor and Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha’s ‘Y-plus’ cover has been upgraded to ‘Y-plus with escort’.The security of BJP’s former minister Ashish Shelar has been downgraded from ‘Y-plus’ to ‘Y’.State Legislative Council Chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar and Relief and Rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar will get ‘Y-plus with escort’, while Shiv Sena MLA Vaibhav Naik, who had defeated Narayan Rane in the 2014 Assembly polls, will get ‘X’ security cover.Current state ministers Sandeepan Bhumre, Sunil Kedar, Dilip Walse Patil and Abdul Sattar, Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar and state Assembly’s Deputy Speaker Narhari Zhirwal have been given ‘Y’ cover.Meanwhile, state BJP spokesman Keshav Upadhye alleged that the security of Fadnavis and other BJP leaders was downgraded out of “political vendetta”.“The decision shows what kind of a mindset the government has, and it is unfortunate. During the COVID-19 lockdown period, Fadnavis was travelling to the nook and corner of the state, while Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was sitting at home,” he claimed.Upadhye said Fadnavis was the first to reach Bhandara where 10 babies died in fire at a hospital on Saturday.“Even if the entire security cover is removed, he (Fadnavis) would continue to travel in the state and highlight the voice of the people,” the BJP leader said.Reacting to the government’s decision, Fadnavis said he had no complaints or worry.“I am a people’s person and this doesn’t impact my travel (schedules) to meet people,” he said.Speaking to reporters in Nagpur, state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh rejected Upadhye’s charge and said the decision to review the security cover of several leaders and prominent personalities has been taken as per the threat perception, irrespective of political affiliations.“A committee of five senior officers was set up to review the security and take a decision as per the threat perception,” he said.Deshmukh said even NCP chief Sharad Pawar, whose party is an ally of the Shiv Sena in the state government, called him over phone, asking that his security cover be downgraded.“During the BJP’s rule, Sharad Pawar and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar did not have any security. Sharad Pawar has also written a letter seeking reduction in his security,” the minister said.Meanwhile, BJP leader Narayan Rane said he was given security by Mumbai police because he had a threat from terrorists.“I have no complaints. If anything happens to me, the state government is to be blamed,” he said.Sudhir Mungantiwar said he was given security due to Naxal threat.“I thank the government for withdrawing my security cover. This means the Naxal threat doesn’t exist. Our aim to highlight people’s voice will be more stronger,” he said.

Only, after a contempt petition was filed, the bank lept into motion and co-ordinated with the PCDA to send the PPO to the DPDO at Chandigarh.The DPDO—despite receiving the PPO—did not release the pension, and claimed that the PCA had sent a wrong photocopy of the same, and not the original.After multiple visits by the widow's family, the DPDO admitted receiving the PPO, but still did not release the pension.When contacted, the counsel of the widow said, that this was another case of extreme harassment of pensioners by various authorities, and ever since the death of her husband in 1989, the lady has been making rounds of courts, banks, and offices, while the system remained unresponsive.“In case the pension is not released by the end of this month, drastic measures by way of appropriate legal proceedings would have to be initiated by name against the concerned officers,” he added.Legal experts said, that there are many instances where military pensioners, disabled soldiers, and widows, are not provided with their benefits even after court orders, and in several cases, the beneficiaries have died before the implementation of orders in their favour.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/30-years-after-army-officers-death-his-ailing-widow-waits-for-pension-despite-court-govt-orders-196520
10-01-2021||New Delhi||India to get UN tag of international disaster response force for NDRF||India could soon be a part of the United Nations (UN) mandated international disaster rescue operations as the country’s federal contingency force, the NDRF, is expected to obtain a globally recognised standardisation later this year, a top-ranking official has said.The authorisation will be done by the Switzerland-headquartered International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG), which is a network of more than 90 countries and organisations under the UN umbrella to deal with urban search and rescue related issues.“Just like we have the Bureau of Indian Standards in the country, the UN agency INSARAG standardises disaster response teams across the world. It is an international gold standard,” NDRF director general SN Pradhan told PTI in an interview.“We are very much in thick of it and hopefully we will get the standardisation in 2021,” he added.He further explained the purpose of this categorisation that is possessed by some of India’s neighbours such as China and Pakistan.“If there is a call from the UN to respond to some disaster you will be called upon...you will be an international response force,” Pradhan said.“It is not that we have not been doing that (going for international rescue operations) but when the NDRF went to Japan and Nepal in the past, it was a bilateral decision between two countries, but with this standardisation, it will be a UN-mandated task,” he said.It will be a matter of great prestige for India that its force is known as an international response force, the DG said.He said an INSARAG committee, comprising Australian and Singaporean experts, has conducted preliminary review of the NDRF teams in September 2019 but the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic put the process on a back burner for a while.“Hopefully, in 2021 you will see at least two heavy teams of the NDRF notified as INSARAG teams,” he said.The National Disaster Response Force was raised in 2006 to undertake specific tasks of relief and rescue during natural and manmade disasters or life-threatening situations. It has 12 operational battalions comprising more than 15,000 personnel based across the country at present while four more battalions are taking shape.Pradhan said this UN standardisation could “trigger a long-term process where more and more of its teams can be certified”.“It (INSARAG standardisation) will be a good thing as the NDRF is second to none. This could lead to a cascading effect where the NDRF can become a national accreditation agency for state disaster response forces and that also could be UN supported. In Chile and China, the UN has certified their provincial teams so that state teams can also travel across the world for disaster response operations,” he said.These were “very exciting developments” and it can add to the profile of India being a great disaster response-oriented country, where the protocols and standard operating procedures were of world standard, he said.The DG also spoke about reviewing the technology and rescue gadgets used by the force.“We are reviewing our technology and changing specifications. It is not bad but authorised items in quality and quantity are 10 years old so it calls for a review. The review has already been completed and submitted to the government,” he said.Pradhan said the force was undertaking “simple but effective” technology changes like using battery-operated saw cutters as compared to those which run on petrol at present.“We are reviewing the national emergency communication plan. It is going into phase 2 now. We are going to upgrade, have more in quantity and better equipment which is true to form so that we are able to negate any impact of total collapse of communication in a disaster-hit area,” he said.The DG said the force would be upgrading its capacity and equipment in the next two financial years, which will be followed by training.Training would be made effective in such a way that while NDRF will be the federal force, there will be collaboration with other central paramilitary forces such as the CRPF, the BSF and the ITBP and others, so that they have their disaster response units ready to “shore up” the NDRF when required, he said.

The accused had threatened her that he will kill her family members if she revealed the incident to them.The victim's father filed a complaint at Fatehganj West police station regarding the rape of his daughter on December 4, following which a case under the POCSO Act and the IPC was registered against the accused, police said. The accused was arrested on December 6, they added.Station House Officer of Fatehganj West police station Ashwani Kumar said a charge-sheet has been filed in the case.The girl's father had sought permission from the district administration to abort her baby but the permission was denied as doctors cited the pregnancy was of many days and a police case was on. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rape-survivor-who-was-7-month-pregnant-dies-in-up-196510
10-01-2021||New Delhi||CAIT asks govt to ban WhatsApp, Facebook over new privacy policy||Traders' body CAIT on Sunday wrote to Information and Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad demanding that the government restrict WhatsApp from implementing its new privacy policy or impose a ban on the messaging app and its parent company Facebook.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) claimed that through the new privacy policy, "all kinds of personal data, payment transactions, contacts, location and other vital information of a person who is using WhatsApp will be acquired by it and can be used for any purpose by WhatsApp".In the communication to Prasad, CAIT has demanded that "government should immediately restrict WhatsApp from implementing the new policy or put a ban on WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook", the traders' body stated.CAIT said Facebook has more than 200 million users in India and enabling it to access data of every user can pose serious threat to not only the economy but even to the security of the country.However, in an email response to PTI, a WhatsApp spokesperson said, "To further increase transparency, we updated the privacy policy to describe that going forward businesses can choose to receive secure hosting services from our parent company Facebook to help manage their communications with their customers on WhatsApp."Though of course, it remains up to the user whether or not they want to message with a business on WhatsApp." The spokesperson further said that the update does not change WhatsApp's data sharing practices with Facebook and does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family wherever they are in the world."WhatsApp remains deeply committed to protecting people's privacy. We are communicating directly with users through WhatsApp about these changes, so they have time to review the new policy over the course of the next month," the spokesperson added.An email sent to Facebook seeking comment on the issue did not elicit a response.CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said, "The changed privacy policy of WhatsApp is an encroachment on privacy of an individual and runs against the basic fundamentals of Constitution of India and therefore the CAIT has demanded immediate intervention of the government." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cait-asks-govt-to-ban-whatsapp-facebook-over-new-privacy-policy-196507
10-01-2021||New Delhi||Bird flu virus is heat-labile, gets killed at 'cooking temperature'||Contrary to what some people think that the bird flu virus, also known as Avian influenza, is spread to humans via consumption of cooked poultry products, health experts on Sunday stressed that it usually does not infect people as the virus is heat-labile (degraded and killed when subjected to heat).Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.According to the World Health organisation (WHO), cooking of poultry (e.g. chicken, ducks and geese) at or above 70 degree Celsius so that absolutely no meat remains raw and red, is a safe measure to kill the virus in areas with outbreaks in poultry.Richa Sareen, consultant (pulmonology) at Fortis Vasant Kunj in New Delhi, said the virus is heat-labile and it gets killed with cooking temperatures."At this time, people should eat fully cooked chicken and eggs and not raw or partially cooked ones. One should avoid going to open markets that sell poultry as they are the focal point of the spread," Sareen told IANS."People who handle poultry should take special precautions. They should wear PPE, gloves and masks while handling birds and should practice frequent hand washing," she added.Although the virus causing bird flu usually does not infect people, rare cases of human infection with these viruses have been reported, especially in individuals working with infected domestic birds."The possible cause of infections in humans is when they come in contact with birds with the viruses and enough viruses get into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled through the excretions of birds," said Kunal Kothari, Senior Physician, Internal Medicine, SMS Medical College in Jaipur."The spread of Bird Flu from one individual, who is sick to another has been very rare and data is limited, inefficient and not sustained but as a precaution, we should all be watchful of public health advisory," Kothari added.Bird Flu is a communicable virus among the avian population and human to human spread is not too prominent with the current strain.However, viruses are prone to mutation, so if this virus undergoes mutation in future, it has the potential to spread from human to human and cause a pandemic.Bird flu mostly infects the respiratory system of humans. Common symptoms are fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, etc."If severe, it can cause ARDS, multi-organ involvement and even death. The sporadic data on bird flu from the past shows very high mortality, to the tune of 60 per cent. Thus, it becomes important to take precautions now," Sareen mentioned.Nevertheless, maintaining distance from birds in the environment is important as the spread of the avian virus is through the saliva, faecal matter of an infected bird."The avian virus is airborne. Notify the community health department on seeing sick or dead birds and try not to come in direct contact with these birds without proper masks, gloves and disinfectants," Kothari noted.The Central government has issued a status report of avian influenza in the country, saying the disease has been confirmed in seven states.The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAHD) has issued an advisory to the affected states so as to avoid further spread of disease.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bird-flu-virus-is-heat-labile-gets-killed-at-cooking-temperature-196504
10-01-2021||New Delhi/Bengaluru||Yediyurappa in Delhi, may discuss state cabinet rejig, by-poll candidates with BJP leadership||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday has said he will meet Home Minister Amit Shah during the day to discuss state politics and finalise candidates for the upcoming by-polls as he arrived in the national capital on a day-long visit.The much-awaited cabinet rejig in the state may also come up for discussion during his meeting with the central BJP leadership, he said.“I am going to discuss the political situation in Karnataka,” the CM told reporters after landing in Delhi.“Recently, we won the gram panchayat elections in a very big way. Within a month, we are going to face two parliamentary and an assembly bypolls. We have to finalise the candidates. We will discuss all these issues with Amit Shah and other important leaders,” he added.The BJP leader said while his appointment with the Home Minister was confirmed, he would also try to meet JP Nadda.Asked about the steps taken to check the spread of COVID-19 in the state, the Chief Minister said: “In Karnataka, the COVID-19 situation is under control. We are taking all precautions.”Earlier before leaving the Bangalore airport, he hinted that the cabinet expansion may also come up for discussion during his meeting with the party high command.“I don’t know. I will discuss all the issues,” he told reporters at the airport when asked if a cabinet rejig is likely this week.The cabinet expansion in the state has been on the cards for over a year now but it could not take place, giving some anxious moments to ministerial aspirants and also leading to dissatisfaction.Among those in the ministerial race are MLAs Umesh Katti, Munirathna, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, M P Renukacharya, Aravind Limbavali and S R Vishwanath. Three MLCs — CP Yogeshwar, MTB Nagaraj and R Shankar — are too aspiring for a ministerial berth.Another MLC, AH Vishwanath, too, was in the race but his hopes dashed when the Karnataka High Court on November 30 barred him from becoming a minister until at least May this year.The state can have a total of 34 ministers and it has 27 now.Bypolls are scheduled for Maski and Basavakalyan assembly segments, and Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency.While Maski fell vacant due to the resignation of sitting Congress MLA Pratap Gouda Patil in 2019, the by-polls to Basavakalyan and Belagavi seats have been necessitated by the deaths of their representatives B Narayan Rao and Suresh Angadi, respectively, due to coronavirus.“I will discuss all other issues with the party high command and wish to return in the night,” the Chief Minister said before he departed.

10-01-2021||New Delhi||Cities key to India's post-pandemic growth: WEF study||Cities have borne the maximum brunt of the COVID-19 outbreak but they will also be key to India's post-pandemic growth as they account for nearly 70 per cent of the country's GDP and an average of 25-30 people migrate to cities from rural areas every single minute, a new study has shown.The study by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF) said the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has been catastrophic for cities."According to estimates, about 70 per cent of India's GDP comes from its cities and around 25-30 people migrate to the cities from rural areas every minute. However, most big cities in India have a wide economic disparity, with expansive slums and a large urban poor population," the WEF said.The study further said that about 25 million households in India -- 35 per cent of all urban households -- cannot afford housing at market prices and it is time to create a new urban paradigm that enables cities to be healthier, more inclusive and more resilient.The WEF report, titled Indian Cities in the Post-Pandemic World, highlights the country's most pressing urban challenges that were further exacerbated by the pandemic. The report also provides insights for translating the lessons learned from the pandemic into an urban reform agenda.The impact of the pandemic has been profoundly uneven on different population groups. Vulnerable populations, including low-income migrant workers, have suffered the dual blows of lost income and weak social-protection coverage, while the pandemic has also laid bare gender-based imbalances in public and private life in India's urban areas, the WEF said.The report, produced in collaboration with Mumbai-based IDFC Institute, compiles insights from leading global and Indian urban experts across seven thematic pillars -- planning, housing, transport, environment, public health, gender and vulnerable populations.Among other recommendations, the report underscores the critical role data can play in helping cities manage and direct emergency operations during a crisis."But data alone is not a panacea; realizing the potential of cities requires empowered and capable governance, investment in transport and infrastructure to fuel productive urban economies, and a rethink of outdated planning norms and regulations," the WEF said.The wide-ranging recommendations compiled in the report include a rethink of outdated urban planning regulations, which will make cities more compact, commuter-friendly and green.It also recommends greater decentralisation and empowerment of local governments, which will allow for more proximate and responsive governance.Besides, it suggests addressing supply-side constraints to building houses at an affordable cost and encouraging a vibrant rental housing market that allows for labour mobility.The study also calls for investing in transport solutions that recognise the need to integrate peri-urban areas with urban cores, and bolstering health capacity in cities by increasing the number of trained healthcare personnel.It also recommended ensuring that infrastructure has adequate functional capacity, aligned with current and future demands, and prioritising inclusivity by addressing the biases and impediments faced by women and vulnerable populations in accessing urban opportunities.Another suggestion calls for prioritising action on environmental sustainability, air pollution and disaster management in urban rebuilding efforts."Well-designed and governed cities can be dynamic centres that spur innovation, drive economic productivity and provide citizens with a good quality of life. The pandemic is an opportunity to address historical urban challenges and bring about positive long-term change," said Viraj Mehta, Head of India and South Asia and Member of the Executive Committee, World Economic Forum."Amidst every pandemic, from the bubonic plague to the Spanish flu, pundits have foretold the death of cities. And yet they have emerged stronger every time. The pandemic can be a turning point in India's urban journey if we draw the right lessons and translate them into lasting change," said Reuben Abraham, CEO and Senior Fellow at IDFC Institute.The study is part of the WEF's broader collaboration with the IDFC Institute for a working group on 'Rebuilding Cities' which has emerged from the Regional Action Group for South Asia. This group brings together public and private sector leaders and prominent experts from the region to interact regularly in order to support an adequate public-private response to the COVID-19 pandemic and jointly chart recovery efforts.The working group on Rebuilding Cities is partnering with multiple Indian state governments to constitute state-level working committees comprising local and municipal government representatives, urban experts, and other relevant stakeholders to devise implementable and context-specific urban reform recommendations.

10-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt pays Rs 1,364 cr to over 20 lakh undeserving beneficiaries under PM-KISAN: RTI data||The government has paid Rs 1,364 crore to 20.48 lakh undeserving beneficiaries under its ambitious PM-KISAN scheme, a reply to a Right to Information (RTI) query by the Union Agriculture Ministry reveals.Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sammann Nidhi (PM-KISAN) was launched by the Centre in 2019 and under the scheme, an income support of Rs 6,000 per year in three equal instalments is paid to small and marginal farmer families having combined land holding or ownership of up to two hectares.The Union Agriculture Ministry, in response to the RTI application, identified two categories of undeserving beneficiaries who received PM-KISAN payouts as “ineligible farmers” and “income tax payee farmers”.RTI applicant Venkatesh Nayak of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) who received the data from the government said: “More than half (55.58 per cent) of these undeserving persons belong to the ‘income tax payee category’.”“The remaining 44.41 per cent belong to the ‘ineligible farmers’ category’,” he added.Nayak said according to media reports, proceedings had been initiated to recover these funds transferred to undeserving persons.He said data obtained under RTI Act, 2005, indicated that since the commencement of the PM-KISAN Yojana in 2019, Rs 1,364.13 crore ($186.59 million) has been paid to ‘ineligible persons’ and ‘income tax payee farmers’ till July 31, 2020.“Government’s own data indicates money went into the wrong hands,” he added.A major chunk of these ineligible beneficiaries belongs to five states — Punjab, Assam, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, as per the data.“Punjab tops the list accounting for 23.16 per cent (4.74 lakh) of the total number of undeserving persons across the country who received payouts, followed by Assam with 16.87 per cent (3.45 lakh beneficiaries) and Maharashtra with 13.99 per cent (2.86 lakh beneficiaries). These three states account for more than half (54.03 per cent) of the number of undeserving persons who received payouts,” Nayak said.Gujarat is at the fourth position with 8.05 per cent (1.64 lakh beneficiaries), followed by Uttar Pradesh at fifth position with 8.01 per cent (1.64 lakh beneficiaries), he said.Sikkim with just one undeserving beneficiary reported the lowest figure, Nayak said.“The total amount of Rs 1,364.13 crore was paid to recipients across the states in 68.20 lakh instalments (where each instalment of Rs 2,000 paid out per recipient is counted separately). Out of this, 49.25 lakh instalments were paid to ‘IT payee farmers’ while 18.95 lakh instalments were paid to ‘ineligible farmers’ across the country,” he said quoting the RTI data.Under the scheme, an amount of Rs 6,000 per year was transferred in three instalments of Rs 2,000 every four months directly into the bank accounts of the farmers, subject to certain exclusion criteria relating to higher income status, a PIB statement had said.The scheme was formally launched on February 24, 2019, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a grand function in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.Several categories of farmers are excluded from the scheme like institutional landholders; farmer families in which one or more members is among beneficiaries — former and present holders of constitutional posts;  former and present ministers, MPs, MLAs, MLCs, mayors and chairmen of district panchayat; serving and retired government employees; pensioners receiving over Rs 10,000 monthly pension; income tax payees and professionals such as doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and architects etc. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-pays-rs-1-364-cr-to-over-20-lakh-undeserving-beneficiaries-under-pm-kisan-rti-data-196499

10-01-2021||New Delhi||Labour ministry likely to give shape to National Employment Policy by December||The Ministry of Labour and Employment is likely to give a shape to the National Employment Policy (NEP) by December this year following the implementation of four labour codes and completion of four major surveys.The NEP will draw a broad road map for improving job opportunities in the country, mainly by various initiatives like skill development, bringing investment in employment-intensive segments and other policy interventions.Last year, Parliament passed three labour codes on Industrial Relations, Social Security and Occupational Health Safety & Working Conditions (OSH).The Code on Wages was approved by Parliament last year and its rules have been firmed up. But the implementation of the rules for Code on Wages was held back because the government wanted to implement all four labour codes in one go. These four codes are likely to be implemented from April 1 this year.The implementation of these four labour codes would provide a conducive legal framework for universalisation of social security and other safeguards for the entire workforce of over 50 crore in the country.But for job creation, a broad NEP would be required to exploit the potential of each segment of different sectors of the economy. This would require up-to-date data on employment across the sectors in the country. This gap would be bridged by the four employment surveys to be conducted by the Labour Bureau, a wing of the ministry.Talking to PTI, DS Negi, Director General, Labour Bureau, said the bureau had begun spadework on the four surveys and fieldwork would begin by March and the results would be out by October-end this year only.He said the NEP would take a shape based on the data inputs of these four surveys by December this year only.Thereafter, the NEP would be sent for the approval of the Union Cabinet.The document is expected to aid employment generation in the country to a great extent, especially when the government is grappling with the issue of job loss especially due to the pandemic.Earlier last month, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar had also said the four all-India surveys on migrant workers, domestic workers, employment generated by professionals and transport sector, which would be launched by early March 2021, and the results of these will be available by October 2021.The minister had opined that for any evidence-based policymaking for these workers, ‘authentic data’ on employment in organised and unorganised sector enterprises is highly called for.The minister had also informed that the bureau will soon launch an ‘All India Quarterly Survey’ on ‘Employment of Enterprises’ that would provide comprehensive data on the employment numbers in both the organised and unorganised sectors to address these data needs.

This application tracks COVID-19 waste at the time of generation, collection and disposal.In July last year, the Supreme Court made it mandatory for all urban local bodies and state pollution control boards to use the mobile application for tracking biomedical waste daily in a bid to ensure that the waste is collected, transported and sent to the registered CBWTFs.As on Sunday, India’s COVID-19 caseload stands at 1,04,50,284 while the death toll is 1,50,999.

The farm unions said these unions would go to the court on Monday in the pending case.“The eight farm unions which are already part of the case and have been impleaded in the matter of protests by farmers will go to the SC on January 11. The issue of constitutionality is not even before the SC and we will not become party to it. We have consulted our lawyers,” Darshan Pal, one of the union leaders said on a day the Congress threw its weight behind the protesters, daring the PM to quit if he could not rescind the laws.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala urged the SC to introspect. “The Modi government was elected by the people, not the SC. It is answerable to the people for its decisions and not to the Supreme Court. The responsibility of making and annulling the laws is that of Parliament. I would urge the SC to ask itself why the farmers are so unwilling to approach it? Why does the government want the SC to solve all contentious issues, from the CAA and the National Register of Citizens to farm laws,” he asked. Announcing protests on January 15 in solidarity with the farmers, Surjewala said “Jan Andolans” would be held at all state headquarters and the day observed as Kisan Adhikar Diwas.
