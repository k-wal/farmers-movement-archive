22-01-2021||New Delhi/Varanasi||Over 1 million COVID-19 jabs administered; PM says no need to fear, vaccines cleared by scientists||The number of beneficiaries receiving COVID-19 vaccine shots crossed the one million mark on Friday even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to dispel fears among a section of people over the injections asserting that all sorts of things are said in politics but the inoculation drive was launched only after nod from scientists.Amid concerns expressed by some over the emergency-use clearance given to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, Modi interacted virtually with healthcare workers of his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi and told them that when doctors and healthcare workers have given a clean chit to the vaccine, it sends a very strong message among people about the efficacy of the shots.The government has also sent consignments of coronavirus vaccines under grant assistance to Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Mauritius and Seychelles and is undertaking commercial supplies of the doses to a number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Brazil and Morocco.Meanwhile, Covaxin has showed enhanced immune response without any serious side effects in the participants enrolled for the phase one trials, according to the results published in The Lancet Infectious Disease journal.The vaccine, codenamed BBV152, was well tolerated in all dose groups with no vaccine-related serious adverse events, noted the authors of the study funded by Bharat Biotech.Till Friday, nearly 12.7 lakh health workers have received anti-coronavirus shots, the Union Health Ministry said. It said that on Friday, 2,28,563 beneficiaries were vaccinated till 6 pm through 6,230 sessions. According to the ministry, over 1,110 cases of adverse effect after vaccination (AEFI) have been reported till now.          In Gurgaon, a healthcare worker, who had received a coronavirus vaccine six days ago, died but officials said there was nothing yet to suggest any link with the inoculation.The 55-year-old woman Rajwanti used to work at the Bhangrola primary health centre and her viscera has been sent for investigation, Chief Medical Officer Virender Yadav said.Two healthcare workers in Odisha were admitted to hospital as they reported AEFI after receiving the jabs. The condition of the duo was stated to be stable.Five minor AEFI cases were reported in West Bengal and Assam.With authorities grappling with hesitancy over the vaccination as many health workers are not turning up to get themselves inoculated at their assigned centres, Modi told the COVID warriors about the hard work of the scientists and the scientific process involved in making the vaccines.He said all sorts of things are said in politics but he went by the scientists’ decision. Politicians talk about “this and that” (“Idhar ki bhi baat hoti hai, udhar ki bhi”), he said.Modi had launched the inoculation drive on January 16, with the government prioritising three crore health and frontline workers for the initial phase. Two vaccines are being used—Covaxin and Covishield, developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and manufactured by Serum Institute of India.“It was an unknown enemy which scientists, who are modern ‘rishis’, chased in laboratories by working day and night,” he said, hailing their fight against the virus. Our own made-in-India vaccine is reaching every corner of the country. India has not only become ‘atmanirbhar’ in the field of vaccines but is also helping other countries,” Modi went on to say.Starting his interaction with Pushpa Devi, a matron at a district women’s hospital, Modi asked whether she could say with confidence to others that the vaccine is safe.“I was fortunate to get vaccinated,” she replied, adding that she now felt safe for her family’s sake as well.“I am telling everyone that there is no side effect. It’s like any other injection and I appeal to everyone to go for it,” she said.Modi reminded her that some people had apprehensions. The health worker said fear must shed and the vaccine taken—“Darr ko hatana hai, vaccine lagwana hai”.Health worker Rani Kunwar from the same hospital said, “People bless us for the vaccine that we got within 10 months due to you.”Talking to Dr V Shukla, chief medical superintendent at DDU hospital, the PM hailed the work of the medical fraternity as “corona warriors”. He said projects such as a cleanliness drive, safe drinking water and toilets offered “indirect benefits” while dealing with the virus.The doctor said there are potential side effects of every vaccine and drew a distinction between them and any adverse events due to a previous medical history.“Despite India being a developing country, we stole a march over developed countries in developing the vaccine,” Shukla said.Modi suggested that there should be competition among hospitals and other institutes on vaccinating frontline workers so that the next phase can start soon.Senior Lab Technician R C Rai said his team was full of confidence and seeing them the others’ trust on the vaccine has increased.Another medical worker said she vaccinated 87 people on January 16 alone, and also got herself vaccinated.“Really, corona warriors have done a wonderful job,” Modi said in the 30-minute interaction.He had earlier said the interaction was meant to get feedback on the vaccination drive, described as the world’s biggest. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-1-million-covid-19-jabs-administered-pm-says-no-need-to-fear-vaccines-cleared-by-scientists-202182

It is open to a Court to grant or refuse the prayer for anticipatory bail, depending on the facts and circumstances of the particular case,” a Bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Sanjiv Khanna said.“A criminal court, exercising jurisdiction to grant bail/anticipatory bail, is not expected to act as a recovery agent to realise the dues of the complainant, and that too, without any trial,” the top court said, allowing an appeal against a Madhya Pradesh High Court’s order to an accused to deposit Rs 41 lakh as a condition for granting him anticipatory bail.The complainant had alleged that the accused took Rs 41 lakh from him following an agreement for purchase of agricultural land but thereafter refused to execute the sale deed.While disposing of the anticipatory bail accused Dilip Singh, the High Court directed him to deposit Rs 41 lakhs in court and furnish personal bond in the sum of Rs 50,000 with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting officer.Holding that the dispute of civil nature, the top court said by imposing the condition of deposit of Rs 41 lakh the High Court virtually issued directions in the nature of recovery in a civil suit.The top court said while deciding bail pleas, courts should take into account factors such as the nature of accusation, severity of the punishment if convicted, nature of the materials relied upon by the prosecution, reasonable apprehension of tampering with witnesses, apprehension of threat to the complainant or the witnesses; reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the time of trial or the likelihood of his abscondence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/courts-exercising-bail-jurisdiction-cant-act-like-recovery-agents-sc-202179

These operations led to a sizable damage to ships and shore installations of East Pakistan and contributed immensely to the victory at sea,” he said.The tableau commanders would be Lieutenant Commander CS Ruben and Lieutenant Commander Surbhi Sharma, he mentioned.India is currently celebrating the golden jubilee year (Swarnim Vijay Varsh) of the victory in the 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh.On the sides of the tableau trailer would be murals depicting various ships that participated in the war, commando operations undertaken by the Navy along with Mukti Bahini and the surrender ceremony at Dhaka, Madhwal stated.The naval contingent being paraded comprises 96 young sailors which will be led by Lieutenant Commander Lalit Kumar as contingent commander and Lieutenant Commander Sune Phogat, Lieutenant Aditya Shukla and Sub Lieutenant Agastya Chaudhary as platoon commanders, he said.In a video message, Vice Admiral SN Ghormade, Controller of Personnel Services, said that while the Indian Navy has many other operations to its credit during the 1971 war, the paucity of space on the tableau precludes showcasing all those elements.“The tableau is an attempt to highlight the most significant aspects of Naval operations conducted during 1971 war and pay rich tributes to those who were involved in these,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/r-day-parade-navy-tableau-to-showcase-ins-vikrant-model-operations-conducted-during-1971-war-202170

Throughout the agitation, efforts were made to mislead farmers. Despite this, we continued to hold a dialogue with the unions,” Tomar said.“When unions remained adamant on the repeal, we gave several suggestions. I believe there was a lack of concern for farmers and that is the reason the talks could not fructify. The Government asked them to consider proposals except repeal, however, they remained adamant,” the Agriculture Minister added.“That is why we told them that to end this dialogue. We told the farmers that if they arrive at any decision, they should let us know and we will continue the dialogue,” Tomar said.Concluding his statement, the Agriculture Minister said he remained hopeful of a resolution saying that “there is both ‘sahmati’ and ‘ahsamti’ in democracy”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-resolution-possible-when-sanctity-of-agitation-gets-lost-some-forces-want-protest-to-continue-tomar-202160

Two people have been arrested in connection with the racket,” Chander said.“We are investigating in detail how these foreigners were brought into the country and who else is involved in this racket. We are also verifying in detail the documents provided by these people,” the officer said.Those held have been identified as Bangladeshi citizen Ahmed Sharif and Bazulhaq, a native of Siwan district in Bihar and currently living in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, police said.The others booked in the case included a man who was supposed to be getting the kidney harvested illegally from Sharif, a Bangladeshi travel agent Abdul Mannan, and one more person, they said.The FIR has been lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 468 and 471 (all related to forgery of documents) besides the Foreigners Act, 1984, and the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, police added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kidney-transplantation-racket-busted-in-noida-bangladeshi-national-among-2-held-202158
22-01-2021||Hyderabad||Speculation rife over next Telangana CM||Rumours are rife in Telangana about the possibility of Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) paving the way for the “coronation” of his son and Working President of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) KT Rama Rao (KTR) as the chief minister of the state sometime soon.Though, the party and family sources have denied any such move, congratulatory messages are growing louder by the day. KTR was made the working president of the party during the last tenure of the TRS and he has successfully managed the affairs of the party.The recent setback to the TRS in the recently concluded Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections have led to the party losing ground and hence the talk of political “anointment”. There are reports that party workers, including ministers, MLAs and senior leaders have been congratulating KTR.Political observers feel that the chief minister may be feeling that the growing influence of the BJP in the state may not return the TRS to power again, so it may be best to hand over the baton to his son during the current term. KCR is only 67 years old at present and has no significant health issue that may be forcing him to take such a decision. The only logical reasoning, if at all he is contemplating such a move, could be his view that the party’s charm among the people may be diminishing. The speculations have gained ground after Telangana Assembly’s Deputy Speaker T Padma Rao addressed KTR as “chief minister-in-waiting”, in the latter’s presence at a function of the South-Central Railway employees in Secundrabad. “I congratulate KT Rama Rao Garu, who is going to become the chief minister of the state very soon, on behalf of the state assembly and also railway employees,” Padma Rao said, amidst loud cheers from the audience.  KTR did not comment on the deputy speaker’s utterance, giving further rise to speculation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/speculation-rife-over-next-telangana-cm-202155

We have informed the police that it is for the government to ensure that it should be peaceful,” Rajewal said.The government’s negotiations with protesting farm unions hit a roadblock on Friday as protesting unions stuck to their demands for a complete repeal of three farm laws, even after the Centre asked them to reconsider its proposal for putting the Acts on hold for 12 to 18 months.Unlike the last 10 rounds of talks, the 11th round could not even reach a decision on the next date for the meeting as the government also hardened its position saying it is ready to meet again once the unions agree to discuss the suspension proposal.Union leaders said they would intensify their agitation while keeping it peaceful.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28, demanding a repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.

We are collecting samples of meat, chicken, milk, rice and fertilisers used in paddy cultivation,” he added.Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das, Principal Secretary (Health) Anil Kumar Singhal, Health Commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar rushed to Eluru to take stock of the situation.Several hundred people in Eluru city fell ill with symptoms of fits and nausea in December last year.Experts from various national research institutes established that organochlorine substances were the causative agents of the disease but drinking water was ruled out as a cause.The disease subsided in less than a week and when things appeared to be returning to normal, some people in Poolla started falling ill again since Thursday.Medicare is being provided to the affected people in Poolla, Gundugolanu as well, apart from the District Hospital in Eluru. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/22-people-fall-ill-in-eluru-ap-deputy-cm-suspects-conspiracy-202127
22-01-2021||Patna||Bihar police circular says offensive social media posts against govt to be treated as cyber crime||Offensive social media posts against the government, ministers, MPs, legislators and state officials will now be treated as cyber crime and invite penal action, a circular issued by a top Bihar police offier said, provoking the opposition to accuse Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of acting like Nazi dictator Hitler.Under the Information Technology Act, cyber crimes are punishable with imprisonment up to seven years and fine or both.The letter was issued on Thursday by Naiyar Hasnain Khan, the ADG heading the Economic Offences Wing (EOW), which is also the nodal body of the police for cyber crimes.Addressed to all principal secretaries and secretaries of various departments in the state, the letter has sought intimation of any such activity by individuals or organisations so that the EOW could take action in accordance with law.Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav, who shared a screenshot of the letter on his Twitter handle, expressed outrage."Look at the deeds of the Chief Minister (Nitish Kumar) who is following in the footsteps of Hitler", Yadav tweeted."Protesters cannot demonstrate at designated places.People sent to jail for writing against the government. Nitish ji, we understand that you are completely tired. But, at least, have some shame", he added in a series of tweets in Hindi.The ruling NDA, however, came out in support of the communication, saying restraining those spewing venom on the social media had become necessary."It is a welcome step. The social media was supposed to be a tool which would speed up information dissemination and help intellectual uplift of the people on a mass scale.But more often than not we come across content on these platforms which are full of vile abuses", Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, spokesperson of the Janata Dal (United), said in a statement.BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand echoed similar views."Freedom of expression does not mean no holds barred.There must be some regulations and guidelines with regard to the use of social media. Interests of the nation and the society ought to be upheld", he said.Anand also expressed concern over social media increasingly lending itself to character assassination and defamation and pointed out that in many instances even government officials have been found guilty of posting remarks that violate their code of conduct."Such things need to be stopped," the BJP spokesperson said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-police-circular-says-offensive-social-media-posts-against-govt-to-be-treated-as-cyber-crime-202124

Please note that they are rumours and factually incorrect. The Mumbai police is providing full assistance to the UP police.”Mirzapur Range IG Piyush Kumar told PTI that in the FIR lodged on January 17, it has been alleged that the web series tried to malign the image of Mirzapur, which is a historic and religious place, having no relation with crime as shown in it.The FIR was lodged under Sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 505 (statements conducing to public statements to mischief of the IPC, along with sections of the Information Technology Act).The Supreme Court on Thursday had sought responses from the Centre, Amazon Prime Video and Excel Entertainment Pvt Ltd on a plea which has alleged that the web series has completely tarnished the historical and cultural image of the place by showing it as a city of goons.Mirzapur is known for its Vindyachal temple dedicated to Goddess Durga. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-cops-begin-probe-in-fir-against-mirzapur-makers-in-mumbai-202123

The police are yet to register an FIR in the case. The Bombay High Court on Thursday dismissed Sood’s plea seeking a stay on the BMC notice for the alleged unauthorised construction. Earlier, the Mumbai court had also dismissed his petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/illegal-construction-actor-sonu-sood-moves-sc-against-bombay-hc-order-202113

Being a new entrant to the ashram, she was tested for Covid as per the regular protocol of the ashram where she came out positive."Since then, she has been staying in isolation and has been given all three types of treatment namely allopathic, Homeopathic and Ayurveda. However, despite all treatments, each time, her report comes positive. "Surprisingly, despite having positive Covid report, she is healthy and has gained around 7-8 kilo," said Dr B.M. Bhardwaj, from Ashram, adding that she was too weak and fragile when she had come here and could not even stand on her own."Although her present condition satisfy us as she is healthy, however, her Covid-19 status is at another level, and we are worried." "We have called Bharatpur Health officials and Sawai Man Singh hospital, Jaipur, health officials too to take up her case and explain her reports," he added.Ashram officials said when she was brought in it was said that her mental and physical health is not too good. Since then, she has been staying here, however, following all medical protocols."She is still staying in isolation in ashram as we need to care for other people staying in ashram," said an official.Bhardwaj said that the doctors who visited here have opined that low immunity in Sharda Devi may be the reason that her tests are continuously coming positive.Kaptan Singh, CMHO Bharatpur told IANS that the patient is now completely healthy and does not show any ILI symptoms."As per the rule, those showing no symptoms for COVID-19 for the last 10 days should be treated as normal," he said adding that sometimes, the dead virus houses inside the stomach and intestine which brings in positive report although the person at this time does not transmit the virus, he said adding that the patient has low immunity and that must be the reason she is showing positive report." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-woman-tests-covid-positive-no-less-than-31-times-leaves-doctors-baffled-202109

22-01-2021||Aditi Tandon||Compete for 100 per cent Covid inoculation targets, Modi tells health facilities||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 22Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asked health-care facilities to compete with one another and reach 100 per cent Covid vaccination targets so that the next phase of inoculation for those above 50 could begin soon.Engaging health-care workers who have taken Covid shots in Varanasi, his Lok Sabha constituency, the Prime Minister said, “We may say anything we want about the vaccines but the common man feels reassured about safety aspects only when medical field workers vouch for them.”The PM expressed a pleasant surprise when Shringhla Chauhan, a community health centre leader in Sewapuri, told him that she took the Covid shot on January 16 and returned to work soon after to vaccinate 87 others.“So you did so much work the same day as you took your shot?” asked the PM as he addressed vaccine hesitancy in India by engaging inoculated health workers about their experiences after the shot. The PM said vaccines are absolutely safe and were launched after months of hard work by “scientists who are modern-day saints”. Varanasi has a target of covering 20,000 health workers.Every beneficiary who spoke to the PM stressed Covid vaccine safety saying they returned to normal functioning the day they took the shots.Matron of Varanasi district hospital Pushpa Devi, one of the first beneficiaries, hailed the PM for choosing health workers for inoculation in Phase 1.“Thank you for providing us with a Covid vaccine in the first phase. I have been vaccinated and feel blessed and fortunate. I feel safe and am confident of safety of my family and society,” Pushpa Devi said, adding that she had no side-effects and that Covid shot was like any other jab.When the PM asked Pushpa Devi to “say something to inspire those who have concerns about the shots”, she said, “Covid vaccine is significant and has been made in record nine months. We are fortunate it is available in India. People must not feel scared of its side-effects. The shot will protect them. My message is: kill the fear and take the shot.”The PM told the beneficiaries that he resisted pressures of an early vaccine launch and the country rolled out the vaccines only after safety approval from scientists.“I was under pressure to launch the vaccine. But I was sure we would follow our scientists. It is not the job of politicians. When we considered who should be targeted first, we thought of health workers because once they are protected society will also be protected,” the PM said, adding that some people were upset at delayed shots for them.Among those who spoke to the PM about safe experience of taking Covid shots was Rani Kunwar, an ANM and a vaccinator; V Shukla, head of a local dispensary; and Ramesh Chandra Rai, a lab technician.To Rani Kunwar, who administers 100 Covid vaccine shots a day, the PM said, “Get ready to break record with Covid vaccine administration.”Shukla told the PM that he had no side-effects and was counselling people to accept the shots without fear.The PM said government campaigns like Swachh Bharat and others for clean air and water had helped boost the immunity of even the poorest Indians and helped the national Covid fatality rate to remain low.“We may say what we want about the vaccine but when medical people say others feel inspired. People must be asking you what happened,” the PM told Shukla, who said everyone at his dispensary was back to work after taking the shot.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/compete-for-100-per-cent-covid-inoculation-targets-modi-tells-health-facilities-202099
22-01-2021||United Nations||‘Irony that country where temple was demolished co-sponsors resolution on peace', India slams Pakistan at UN||India has called out Pakistan for co-sponsoring a UN resolution on culture of peace while rights of minorities are "emasculated" in the country, saying Pakistani law enforcement agencies stood as "mute spectators" when a historic Hindu temple was attacked and set on fire by a mob.In December, a mob led by some local clerics and members of radical Islamist party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam vandalised the Hindu temple and set it on fire at Terri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Karak district.The attack drew strong condemnation from human rights activists and the minority Hindu community leaders, prompting Pakistan's Supreme Court to order its reconstruction."It is a matter of great irony that the country where the most recent attack and demolition of a Hindu temple took place in a series of such attacks and where the rights of minorities are being emasculated is one of the co-sponsors of the resolution under the agenda item ‘Culture of Peace’."The resolution cannot be a smokescreen for countries like Pakistan to hide behind,” India said in its statement on adoption of resolution on 'Promoting a culture of peace and tolerance to safeguard religious sites' on Thursday.The UN General Assembly on Thursday adopted the resolution that condemned all acts or threats of violence, destruction, damage or endangerment, directed against religious sites as such, that continue to occur in the world, and denounced any moves to obliterate or forcibly convert any religious sites.The resolution was co-sponsored by Pakistan along with 21 other nations.India, in the explanation of position on the resolution, cited attacks on the Hindu temple in the Pakistani town of Karak, against a gurdwara as well as the destruction of the Bamyan Buddha in Afghanistan and said in the world of growing terrorism, violent extremism, radicalisation and intolerance, religious sites and cultural heritage sites remained vulnerable to terrorist acts, violence and destruction."The images of the shattering of the iconic Bamyan Buddha by fundamentalists are still vivid in our memories. The terrorist bombing of the gurdwara in Afghanistan where 25 Sikh worshippers were killed is yet another example of this vulnerability."Most recently, in December 2020, a historic Hindu temple was attacked and set on fire by a mob in the town of Karak in Pakistan with explicit support and connivance with the law-enforcement agencies, which stood as mute spectators while the temple was being razed,” India said in the statement.India reiterated its call for the application of the principles of objectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality to form the basis of discussions in the United Nations, especially on the issue of religion.“The United Nations, including the UN Alliance of Civilisations, should not take sides and as long as such selectivity exists, the world can never truly foster a culture of peace. We must stand united against the forces that supplant dialogue and peace with hatred and violence,” the statement said.India joined the consensus for adoption of the draft resolution and acknowledged efforts of the co-facilitators of the negotiations, Saudi Arabia and Morocco, for their inclusive and transparent approach during the negotiations and piloting the “delicate negotiations” for achieving a consensus text of the resolution.Emphasising that it attaches great importance to safeguarding cultural heritage and religious sites, India cited the preamble of the Constitution that declares the country as a “sovereign socialist secular democratic republic” which secures to all citizens “liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship”.India told the General Assembly that it had strong legal framework for acts of violence or discrimination based on religion, including violence targeted towards the places of worship.The UNGA resolution calls for strengthened international efforts to foster a global dialogue on the promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace at all levels, based on respect for human rights and for the diversity of religions and beliefs.

22-01-2021||Kolkata||Bengal Minister resigns from Mamata Banerjee Cabinet; TMC says it won’t impact party||In yet another jolt for the TMC dispensation, West Bengal Forest Minister Rajib Banerjee quit the Mamata Banerjee Cabinet, joining the growing list of dissenters who have put the ruling camp in a tight spot ahead of the Assembly elections.The TMC, however, asserted that Banerjee’s move would have no impact on the party.Banerjee, while talking to reporters, said he was forced to take this decision after being publicly humiliated by a section of the party’s leaders for airing his grievances over their style of functioning.He, however, declined to comment when asked if he plans to quit the party in the days to come.“I had grievances against some of the party’s senior members and informed the leadership about it. I also had a word with party supremo, but nothing happened. Instead, I was personally attacked by a section of leaders.“I was hurt by the personal attacks. Hence, I resigned from the state cabinet,” he said.In his letter to the chief minister, however, the TMC MLA did not cite any reason for quitting the Cabinet.“It has been a great honour and privilege to serve the people of West Bengal. I heartily convey my gratitude for getting this opportunity,” he said in the letter.The Domjur MLA also met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at Raj Bhavan after submitting his resignation, and held a meeting with him for an hour.“Shri Rajib Banerjee, Minister for Forest Affairs @MamataOfficial called on me and handed over a letter of resignation from the Council of Ministers. He was indicated that steps by the constitution would be taken,” Dhankhar tweeted.Incidentally, Banerjee had skipped the last five Cabinet meetings, amid murmurs that he was trying to distance himself from the party leadership.Sharing his resignation letter on Facebook, Banerjee said that he hopes that he will be able to continue to work for the people of the state in the days to come.“I hope that in the years to come I will be able to be at each of your services in the best way possible as that has been the sole reason I am into politics,” he said in his post.The TMC leadership, for the past one month, held several rounds of dialogue with Banerjee to address his grievances. State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee and the party’s poll strategist Prashant Kishor had met the leader and tried to pacify him.The Domjur MLA features in the list of TMC legislators who have expressed discontentment over the state of affairs in the Mamata Banerjee camp.Barring Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who quit his Cabinet post citing apolitical reasons, most of them, including Banerjee’s former Cabinet colleague Suvendu Adhikari, have switched over to the BJP.Reacting to the development, senior TMC Leader and MP Sougata Roy said if he had problems, he should have brought it up for discussion during cabinet meetings.“We tried to address his grievances, but it seems he was adamant. He might have some other plans... it is for him to decide,” Roy said.Echoing him, senior TMC leader and minister Arup Roy, known to be a detractor of Banerjee in Howrah district, said he had apprehended that something like this would happen.“When the TMC was formed in 1998, neither Laxmi Ratan Shukla nor Rajib Banerjee was in the party. I always knew such a situation was in the offing. People like him leaving the party hardly matters,” he said.Coming out in support of Banerjee, dissident TMC MLA Baishali Dalmiya said “honest and sincere people have no place in the party.“Corrupt people are calling the shots in Howrah district. There is no place for the honest ones,” he said.An elated BJP said the “beginning of the end of the TMC has already begun”, and the party would disintegrate soon.“It is only a matter of time before the TMC disintegrates. If he (Banerjee) wants to join us, we will look into it,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.BJP national general secretary and the party’s Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya lauded Banerjee over his move.“Rajib Banerjee ji is a good leader and a successful minister.  Honest and good people have no place in a party like the TMC,” he said.Vijayvargiya, however, refused to say anything when asked if Banerjee would join the saffron camp.The TMC received its biggest jolt last month, during Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally in Midnapore, when party heavyweight Adhikari and 34 other leaders, including five MLAs and an MP of the ruling camp, switched over to the BJP.Since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when the BJP bagged 18 seats, just four less than the ruling TMC, and emerged as its challenger in Bengal, a TMC MP, 15 TMC MLAs, three legislators of the CPI(M) and four belonging to the Congress have switched over to the saffron camp.However, none of them resigned as MLAs.Elections to the 294-member assembly are likely to be held in April-May this year.

22-01-2021||New Delhi||Brazil becomes test bed for contest between Indian, Chinese vaccines||Brazil has become the first country to receive commercially exported India-made vaccines after the issue became a political slugfest in Sao Paulo while South Block independently decided that there were enough stocks to meet its domestic requirements.On Friday, the government cleared commercial exports to Brazil and Morocco through 50 countries have sought the vaccine. South Africa and Saudi Arabia are among the nations that have sought large doses of vaccines made in India.Interestingly, Brazil has become the test bed for a contest between Chinese and Indian vaccines. This was the reason why Brazil wanted to dispatch the aircraft a few days back but New Delhi had withheld clearance at that time. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had then vented his frustration at being bested by his political rival who was promoting a Chinese developed vaccine. He blamed the delay in receiving India-made vaccine on political pressures on PM Modi to first provide vaccines to all Indians.The Leftist Governor of Sao Paulo province, Joao Doria, is backing a vaccine developed by the Chinese lab Sinovac with a local institute. She has already started an inoculation program forcing Bolsonaro, her Rightist rival, to begin pressing New Delhi for the faster supply of the vaccines as they are potential rivals in the 2022 presidential contest in Brazil.The free supply to India’s neighbouring countries from Wednesday and the beginning of commercial exports from today marked a dramatic turnaround in the Government’s position. A week back, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said it was “too early to make specific comments” as “we are still in the stage of domestic production and distribution and making assessments here.’’The vaccine shots developed by UK-based drugmaker AstraZeneca and Oxford University are being manufactured at the Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest producer of vaccines.India had started gifting India-made vaccines from Wednesday to countries in the region as part of its neighbourhood first policy.India also provided two days of training for health staff from 13 countries in administering the vaccines.India’s vaccine diplomacyFree suppliesOn the list||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/brazil-becomes-test-bed-for-contest-between-indian-chinese-vaccines-202087
22-01-2021||Kolkata||Wife, not father, has right over deceased man's sperm: High Court||The Calcutta High Court has refused to entertain the plea of a man seeking the right to collect his dead son's frozen sperm, maintaining that the only other person, apart from the deceased, having any right to it is his wife.Dismissing the plea on January 19, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said that the petitioner does not have any "fundamental right" to permission for collecting the preserved sperm of his son merely by dint of his father-son relationship with the deceased.The petitioner's counsel submitted that the widow of his son, in that case, ought to be directed to give her 'no- objection' or, at least, respond to his request.The court, however, rejected the prayer.The sperm preserved at a hospital in Delhi belonged to the deceased and, since he was in a matrimonial relationship till death, the only other person, apart from the deceased, having any right to it is his wife, the court said."The father-son relationship of the petitioner and the deceased does not entail any such right of the petitioner to the progeny of his son," Justice Bhattacharyya observed.The court further said that as far as the prayer for a direction upon the wife to respond to the petitioner's communication is concerned, the matter is beyond the scope of the writ court, as it does not involve any violation of fundamental or statutory right.The petitioner contended that his son was a patient of thalassaemia, and had preserved his sperm at the Delhi hospital for use in the future.According to the counsel, the petitioner, following the demise of his son, approached the hospital seeking access to the frozen sperm on the ground that he is the father of the deceased donor.The hospital, on its part, informed him that the he would need permission from the man's wife, and proof of marriage has to be provided.Following such intimation by the hospital, the petitioner urged the widow of his deceased son to issue a 'no-objection' to him for collecting the sperm, the petitioner's lawyer stated, adding that she refused to acknowledge the receipt of the communication.

In case of dense fog, visibility is between 51 and 200 metres, in case of moderate 201 and 500 metres, and in case of shallow fog it is between 501 and 1,000 metres.A fresh Western Disturbance affecting the western Himalayas is likely to provide some relief from the chill. The minimum temperature is expected to increase to 9 degrees Celsius by Sunday as a result of easterly winds and cloud cover.“Easterly winds have already started blowing in the national capital. A cloud cover will further increase the minimum temperature on Saturday and Sunday," Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said.Easterly winds are not as cold as northwesterly coming in from the snow-clad western Himalayas, while clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation, increasing the minimum temperature.However, Srivastava said, the minimum temperature would again drop to 4 degrees Celsius by Monday.“The WD will lead to widespread snow in the upper hills of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Cold, dry winds from the snow-capped mountains will bring the mercury down to 4 degrees Celsius by Monday,” he said.

22-01-2021||Mumbai||Woman withdraws rape complaint against Maharashtra minister Munde||The Mumbai-based woman who had accused Maharashtra cabinet minister Dhananjay Munde of rape has withdrawn her police complaint, an official said on Friday.The woman told the investigating officer that she is taking back the complaint against Munde, but did not cite any reason, the police official said.The police asked the complainant to submit a notorised affidavit, he said.The woman had approached the police with the complaint against the Social Justice Minister on January 11, accusing him of rape and sexual assault on the pretext of marriage in 2006.The police had started an inquiry and the woman had visited the Oshiwara police station to record her statement.Munde, a senior NCP leader from Beed district, has denied the rape charges and dubbed them as an attempt to blackmail him.The minister, however, has admitted that he was in a relationship with the complainant woman's sister.As the complaint came to light, the opposition BJP demanded Munde's resignation from the cabinet.However, the NCP ruled out any action against Munde till the charges were proved.Meanwhile, reacting to the development, NCP president Sharad Pawar said it seemed the party's decision to wait for the truth to come out after rape allegations were levelled against Munde was right.Addressing reporters here, Pawar also alleged that efforts are on from Delhi to Mumbai to bring down the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state.However, the Shiv Sena-led government, in which the NCP is a key constituent, would complete its five-year term, the former Union minister said.“I got to read the news about (the woman) withdrawing the complaint. I dont know the details. But after discussion with Munde and officials, we felt prima facie that the truth needs to be verified first."We felt we should not jump to a conclusion until the truth is found out,” Pawar said.The NCP chief, who had initially termed the rape charges as serious, said the party pitched for a detailed probe into the allegations after it saw some documents in connection with the episode.“And our decision was right, it seems,” he added.To a question about the various charges being made against MVA leaders, alleged attempts to bring down the Uddhav Thackeray government and its longevity, Pawar said there is no doubt that the government would run for five years.“Consistent efforts are being made right from day one, from Delhi to Mumbai (to bring down the government). But it will have no impact,” he said, without naming anyone or any party. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-withdraws-rape-complaint-against-maharashtra-minister-munde-202061

I wish a speedy recovery to the injured."He told reporters here that he would direct the deputy commissioner of Shivamogga district to release a solatium of Rs five lakh to the families of the victims."Tomorrow I am going there. There are illegal mining activities going on. I will try to take steps to prevent the repetition of such incidents in future," he said.Yediyurappa assured appropriate action against those responsible for the explosion, the cause of which was under investigation.To a question on allegations of increase in illegal mining, he said such activities have been stopped at four to five places and stringent action would be initiated to end the menace altogether.The chief minister said the newly inducted Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh Nirani would soon inspect the area.Yediyurappa's son and Shivamogga MP B Y Raghavendra has already visited the spot.The booming sound of the blast initially made local people mistake it for an earthquake, and it was heard in nearby areas in neighbouring Davangere, Chikkamagaluru and Uttara Kannada districts too.In Shivamogga, the effect was so severe with some houses developing cracks, while roof tiles and window panes were shattered to pieces. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-explosion-quarry-owner-2-others-arrested-202060
22-01-2021||Power dressing with a string of pearls... a formal dress in purple with a matching coat||American Vice President Kamala Harris sends a power-packed message through her sartorial choice||Not just the colour of the structured, feminine silhouette of her dress, but the choice of designer sets the tone for her new innings. Christopher John Rogers is a black, queer designer, the recent ‘king of colour’ patronised by the likes of Michelle Obama. While the colour purple is seen as Harris’ acknowledgment to women suffrage, something that she acknowledged in her tweet as well, ‘I’m here today because of the women who came before me’. In the US, purple is traditionally seen as a colour of bipartisanship, a mix of red and blue, colours of the Republican and Democratic parties.Harris’ choice in colour was deliberate, many see it as a tribute to Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to the Congress. She accessorised her attire with her favourite – pearls – for the special swearing in by Wilfredo Rosado and an American flag lapel pin by David Yurman. Looks like those who hoped to see the Madame Vice President in a saree or a creation by Prabal Gurung acknowledging her South-Asian roots have to wait for her acknowledgment of Indian roots.While President Joe Biden and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff took to Ralph Lauren suits, navy blue and grey, respectively; First Lady Dr Jill Biden stunned in Alexandra O’Neill’s ocean blue ensemble adorned with Swarovski pearls and crystals.Unity in diversityAn emotional Lady Gaga performed a dramatic version of the US national anthem, Garth Brooks sang a cappella, and Tom Hanks hosted a star-studded celebration to cap President Joe Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday. On a day marked by diversity and appeals for unity, Gaga wowed in a fuchsia Schiaparelli couture silk skirt and black top adorned by a large gold brooch of a dove carrying an olive branch as she sang The Star-Spangled Banner at the ceremony. Gaga at one point gestured to the US flag flying high over the Capitol. Jennifer Lopez, dressed in white pants and a long matching coat, performed a medley of This Land is Your Land and America The Beautiful, interjecting in Spanish the part of the US Pledge of Allegiance that says, “One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”Words of emotionPoet Amanda Gorman captured the mixed emotions of the past four years with a poem in which she called herself a “skinny Black girl, descended from slaves and raised by a single mother (who) can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one.” The cultural celebrations continued with a broadcast across television and social media, hosted by Tom Hanks. The events, bringing together some of the biggest white, Black and Hispanic celebrities, marked a sharp contrast with Trump’s inauguration in 2017, which was low on star power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/american-vice-president-kamala-harris-sends-a-power-packed-message-through-her-sartorial-choice-202010

This results in every acquisition process being tied up in knots.”The process and procedures, rather than product, become paramount and these were holding hostage defence modernisation, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/slow-acquisition-hinders-defence-upgrade-army-chief-201723
22-01-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Communalism threat to country’s unity: Netaji’s kin||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 21Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s unassailable commitment to secularism has returned to haunt Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is all set to visit Kolkata on January 23 to take part in Bose’s 125th birth anniversary celebrations.Two of Netaji’s grandnephews, both public figures, find the occasion appropriate to highlight the threat posed by communalism to the unity of the country.Like previous years, the Netaji Research Bureau (NRB), headed by Netaji’s grandnephew Sugata Bose, will organise a function on January 23 to pay homage to the intrepid freedom fighter.The Netaji Award instituted by the NRB will be this time given posthumously to Abid Hassan, a close associate of Netaji, who sailed with him in a German U-boat in 1943 on Bose’s voyage to South East Asia in the middle of World War II.Sugata, who teaches history in the prestigious Harvard University, and also a former Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member, is also slated to give a speech on Saturday on the subject of “Netaji, Abid Hassan and the unity of India”.In the biography of Bose written by Sugata (“His Majesty’s Opponent”), he has chronicled how Netaji was able to overcome the challenge posed by varied religious affiliations of the personnel of the INA.“The treatment meted out to minorities is tragic and far removed from Netaji’s ideals,” Sugata Bose told this reporter while explaining why he would be speaking on the issue of unity of India in the context of Netaji and Abid Hasan’s relationship.Despite being the chief of Netaji Research Bureau, which has played a key role in documenting information about Netaji, Sugata has not been invited for either of the two programmes — a seminar at National Library and an exhibition on Netaji at Victoria Memorial — which Modi will be attending during his January 23 visit to Kolkata.Chandra Bose, who too is a grandnephew of Netaji, said upholding the principle of secularism would be the best way to pay tribute to Netaji.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/communalism-threat-to-countrys-unity-netajis-kin-201724

It appeared to be a difficult decision for the union leaders to make as they held several rounds of talks through the day and even sought opinion from the protesters gathered on Delhi’s borders. The Haryana Police, meanwhile, have cancelled leave of its personnel in view of the stir.Sources claimed 17 of the total 32 farm unions of Punjab rejected the Centre’s offer, terming it as a “tactic to derail the agitation by dividing the farmers”. “Repeal of the three central laws and a legislation for remunerative MSP were reiterated as the pending demands of the movement, which will be communicated to the Union ministers tomorrow,” said Joginder Singh Ugrahan of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan).SC panel interacts with 10 farm bodiesUgrahan alleged the government was trying to buy peace for the time being by suspending the laws for 18 months, but the farmers would not relent till these were repealed. “The Centre is testing the patience of the farmers. The unions unanimously rejected the Centre’s offer. We won’t return till the laws are abolished,” he said.BJP leader RP Singh, meanwhile, condemned the farmers saying such “adamant attitude” wasn’t good for democracy.Earlier, the unions also rejected the Delhi Police’s proposal to shift their proposed Republic Day tractor rally from Delhi’s Outer Ring Road.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unions-reject-laws-on-hold-offer-201628

Chandigarh has made a leap forward to rank second among the UTs after Delhi.The index, launched last year, ranks states based on whether they provide a conducive environment for registering new businesses, applying for patents, human capital and investments, among other measures.Bihar at the bottomIn the second edition, Maharashtra has overtaken Tamil Nadu for the second spot. Telangana has claimed the fourth place, with Kerala moving one notch up to fifth slot, pushing Haryana to sixth place on the list of 17 major states. Bihar has featured at the bottom.“There is a very strong correlation between innovation and development. As states become more innovative, their per-capita GDP (gross domestic product) rises,” said Amit Kapoor, chairman of the Institute for Competitiveness, a Gurugram-based organisation that worked with NITI Aayog to develop the index.The index is modelled along the lines of the global innovation index, which is brought out by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, but tracks fewer parameters. It aims to add more parameters in the next report and sync it with the global index.“The Prime Minister is very clear that it is innovation and technology that will solve the immense challenges that India faces. Trying to spur innovation at the state level is important,” Kumar said.Kant said, “By providing a thrust to innovation, India can augment its manufacturing and export competitiveness.”“We will continue to work in very close collaboration with science and technology teams across all the states as well as the industrial and manufacturing teams across India. We will complement them as the knowledge partner to make India an innovative nation,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-haryana-among-10-most-innovative-states-201643

India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava when asked about the proposed S-400 purchase.“India has always pursued an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defence acquisitions and supplies which are guided by our national security interests. We have not made any waiver determinations with respect to Indian transactions with Russia,” he had added.At the send-off function for the military specialists, Kudashev listed more joint projects – an AK-203 Kalashnikovs factory to make over seven lakh rifles in India, building of 200 Ka-226 also in India, upgrades to Su-30MKI and T-90 tanks besides frigates, submarines and missiles.The Russian ambassador said Russia and India are also involved in the joint development and production of military equipment, components and spare parts as well as technologies sharing, improving after-sales service system. “We have developed an advanced legal base for this purpose,” he said.The next joint step in the military field is likely to be the implementation of the spare parts joint production agreement, which would fit well in Make-in-India and Atmanirbhar Bharat programmes. “Work also is going on the mutual logistics support agreement, strengthening maritime cooperation, including in the Indian Ocean,” added the Ambassador.Russia also plans a large footprint at the next Aero-India expo in February. It plans to demonstrate Su-57, Su-35 and MiG-35 fighter jets, helicopters Ka-52, Ka-226, Mi-17B-5, Mi-26 as well as S-400 systems.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-us-caution-indian-military-team-for-s-400-leaves-for-russia-201674
