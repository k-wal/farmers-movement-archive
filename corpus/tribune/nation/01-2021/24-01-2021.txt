Authorities have recovered more than Rs 820 crore from these fraudsters.Sources said that the chartered accountants’ regulatory body, namely, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India have been informed about these arrests and have been asked to take appropriate actions as per their own rules.Sources said the CAs who were arrested were allegedly operating multiple non-existent firms and fake entities to dupe the exchequer with fraudulent ITC utilisation in connivance with fraudsters and fly-by-night operators.DoR sources acknowledged that with complete data sharing among GST, customs and income tax, and apt use of Data Analytics, the GST intelligence authorities have been able to pin-pointedly identify those indulged in tax evasion through various means including fake bills and also those availing these bills through layers of intermediaries. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-officers-arrest-258-persons-for-fake-invoice-frauds-203135
24-01-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear plea for extra chance to aspirants who missed UPSC exam due to COVID-19||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday a plea seeking grant of one more chance to appear in the UPSC’s civil services examination to those aspirants who could not appear in their previous attempt last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation.The crucial hearing assumes significance in the wake of the Centre’s assertion last Friday that it was not in favour of granting one more opportunity to the civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt in 2020.A bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar had taken note of the submissions of Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing on behalf of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on January 22 and had asked the government to file an affidavit to this effect.“We are not ready to give one more chance. Give me the time to file an affidavit... yesterday night, I received instruction that we are not agreeable,” the law officer had told the bench.The bench, which also comprised Justices B R Gavai and Krishna Murai, had asked the law officer to supply the copy of the affidavit to the counsel of civil services aspirant Rachna who had moved the court with the plea for grant of extra chance to crack the test.Earlier, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the bench that the government was considering the issue of granting one more opportunity to those civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt to crack the UPSC exam.On September 30 last year, the top court had refused to postpone the UPSC civil services preliminary exam, which was held on October 4, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and floods in several parts of the country.However, it had directed the Central Government and the Union Public Service Commission to consider granting an extra chance to candidates who otherwise have their last attempt in 2020, with the corresponding extension of the upper age-limit.The bench was then told that a formal decision can be taken by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) only. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-plea-for-extra-chance-to-aspirants-who-missed-upsc-exam-due-to-covid-19-203131

24-01-2021||Bagalkot (Karnataka)||3 generations in Karnataka fought for 40 yrs over ‘Kalasha’, Lok Adalat resolves in 4 days||Three generations from two adjacent villages in Karnataka fought over who should possess a ‘kalasha’ (holy pot) placed on a temple car during the annual fair of Garuda Siddeshwara temple, for nearly four decades.The feud was finally resolved last week in a district Lok Adalat through arbitration in a mere four days.Kadlimatti and Mudapalajeevi are adjoining villages in Bagalkot district of Karnataka. These villages are located 480 km from state capital Bengaluru.According to Hindu belief, the ‘kalasha’ is believed to contain ‘Amrita’, the elixir of life, and thus is viewed as a symbol of abundance, wisdom, and immortality. The ‘kalasha’ is often seen in Hindu iconography as an attribute, in the hands of Hindu deities like the creator god Brahma, the destroyer god Shiva as a teacher, and the goddess of prosperity Lakshmi.Bagalkot district legal services authority (DLSA) secretary, Hemalatha Basappa Hullur who facilitated the arbitration process told IANS that this dispute over who should own the ‘kalasha’ dates back to the late 1970s but a formal court case was registered only in 2007. “Multiple rounds of discussions lasted almost four days to resolve this emotionally attached case,” she said.“The dispute between two villages was all about who should own the ‘kalasha’, two generations fought over it and died. The third generation was continuing their legal battle, as authorities toiled hard for four decades to resolve but could not succeed in their attempts to convince either parties. As a result of this, the ‘kalasha’ used to be deposited in the district treasury and it used to be unlocked only during the annual fair of the villages and once the religious ceremonies were over by evening, the ‘kalasha’ used to be taken back to the same treasury and deposited again. This went on for several years,” she said.Raghvendra, a lawyer, who assisted senior lawyer, P.A. Kulkarni in this case told IANS that the main reason for the dispute was the temple which is situated in Lavaleshwara Tanda, which is in between these villages.“Around 50 years ago, a ‘Mutt’ seer had toured across six villages - Kadlimatti, Mudapaljeevi, Acahnuru, Bennuru, Shiragumpi and Herkal villages - to raise funds to build a temple and also a temple cart. As per his plans all villagers donated generously but Kadlimatti’s contributions were highest among all villagers as a result of this, elated Ingalgi Matha seer assured that main ‘Kalasha’ of the temple car will retained with Kadlimatti, who will have the privilege of worshipping the ‘Kalasha’ throughout year,” he explained.One of the petitioners on behalf of Kadlimatti villagers, Vitthal Majjige, told IANS that it was ironic indeed that in the frivolous ego battle between both villages, the ‘Kalasha’ was paying the price of being locked up in a dark room. “Ideally it should be worshipped on a day-to-day basis but for our ego battle, it had remained in locked up status for nearly four decades. Therefore, we all villagers from both sides came to an agreement that now the ‘kalasha’ can be stationed in the main temple in Lavaleshwra, where priests will perform all rituals and devotees can have free ‘darshan’. But for one condition, during the annual fair Kadlimatti devotees will have the first right to offer pooja in Kadlimatti and it will go in procession from here to Mudaplajeevi village, who will welcome it and it will be taken in procession and placed on top of the temple car,” Majjige said.He added that but for this dispute, none of the villagers from either side had any dispute; they fought elections together and had cordial business relationships from day one of the dispute starting in the late 1970s.Mallaiah Poojari of Mudaplajeevi village and one of priests of this temple told IANS that all he wanted was that the ‘kalasha’ gets its due respect. “It was heartening to see that authorities bringing in police custody and taking it back in police security. I was a young child when this dispute began. My grandfather and my father both craved to offer pooja on daily basis to this ‘kalasha’ but they could not do so in their lifetime. At least am happy that I am getting that honour,” he said emotionally.According to him, the dispute over the ‘kalasha’ started when Mudapljeevi villagers came to know about Ingalgi Mutt seer decided to give the honour of ‘kalasha’ to Kadlimatti villagers.“At last this ego battle has ended on a good note and that is more than a fulfilling experience in itself,” the priest said.

24-01-2021||Tirupur (TN)||Rahul Gandhi slams PM Modi, says Chinese troops occupying Indian territory||Continuing to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his second day of campaign in Tamil Nadu, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday alleged Chinese troops have occupied Indian territory and the man with “56 inch-chest” cannot even utter the name of the neighbouring country.Addressing meetings here and in neighbouring Erode as part of three-day campaign tour of Tamil Nadu for the assembly elections to be held in the next few months, he also repeated his charge that Modi governed the country for just five or six business people.The Central government was not for the farmers, labourers or the Micro Small or Medium Enterprises, that are the nation’s future and abound in this region of the state, Gandhi, on a campaign tour of western districts, said.“For the first time, the Indian people can see that Chinese troops have occupied Indian territory. As we speak today, thousands of Chinese troops are occupying our territory and the man with a 56-inch chest cannot even say the word China. That is the reality of our country,” he said.Taking forward his ‘Tamil language and culture’ pitch to connect with the people and attack the BJP, the Congress MP said he wanted to be the soldier of the Tamil people in Delhi and reiterated that he would not allow the Saffron party to disregard Tamil culture.Gandhi, who also addressed people from his vehicle at some places during a roadshow, accused the BJP of trying to impose one culture one and language on people and relegate Tamil to a ‘second class place’.“I understand, accept and respect the Tamil spirit and culture. I am not going to allow the prime minister and the BJP to disrespect the Tamil people no matter what,” he said in his speeches in English, translated into Tamil.India was home to many diverse cultures, religions and languages... “it is the nation’s strength. It is our duty to protect ever single language, culture and religion in this country,” he said.In a veiled attack on Modi’s monthly radio programme, the top Congress leader said his Tamil Nadu visit was not to tell people his ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ or advise them on what they should do but to listen to them, understand their problems and help resolve them.He said the rest of the country could learn a lot from Tamil Nadu history and language.Waving at people from his car at key intersections, the Congress leader also got off the vehicle and shook hands with people waiting on the roadside at several junctions.He was accorded a warm welcome by party workers who played traditional music.  While many presented him shawls, some showered rose petals on him.An elderly woman applied ‘Vibuthi’ (sacred ash) on his forehead as a mark of blessings and several took ‘selfies’ with him.He garlanded a statue of late chief minister and Congress stalwart K Kamaraj. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-slams-pm-modi-says-chinese-troops-occupying-indian-territory-203120
24-01-2021||New Delhi||Arnab chats: Republic Media Network hits back at Congress, accuses it of peddling 'falsehoods'||The Republic Media Network on Sunday hit out at the Congress over its allegations that the purported WhatsApp chats of Arnab Goswami point to breach of national security and violations of the Official Secrets Act, and claimed that the party was peddling "falsehoods".In a statement, the Republic media group also accused rival TV channel Times Now of manipulating TRPs, suppressing facts and misleading the public on the alleged TRP scam.The statement comes after Times Network, under which Times Now operates, said it is contemplating “all possible legal actions” against Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) for its unacceptable and unpardonable" failure to act on complaints of large-scale manipulation of TRPs to favour Republic TV.Also, the Congress had on Friday demanded a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into the purported WhatsApp chats of Goswami for breach of national security and violations of the Official Secrets Act and booking those involved.In the statement, the Republic Media Network said there has been collusion of corporate and political interests to target its Editor-in-Chief Goswami.The validity, veracity and genuineness of the purported WhatsApp chats are still to be tested in the courts of law, but even keeping that aside for a moment, there is not one line, suggestion or shred of evidence in the chats which contain any wrongdoing or TRP manipulation by the Republic Media Network, the statement said.The Republic Media Network also called upon the Competition Commission of India to probe the existence of "collusion and cartelization" in the media industry "which is selectively targeting Goswami"."The Congress which cannot get over its own infighting has peddled lies and falsehoods against us, accusing us of leaking official secrets, when the truth is that the possibility of airstrikes was a much-discussed topic in the public domain, much before the strikes actually took place," it said.Last week, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said providing official secret information to a journalist is a "criminal act" and both the giver and the receiver will have to go to jail.He was referring to the allegations that the reported chats showed Goswami being privy to the Balakot air strikes beforehand. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-chats-republic-media-network-hits-back-at-congress-accuses-it-of-peddling-falsehoods-203116

Her fellow workers alleged that she died following coronavirus vaccination. Three days after she took a shot of the coronavirus vaccine, the 44-year-old ASHA worker complained of severe headache and fever on January 22. In a demonstration, the ASHA workers held a rally outside the Guntur hospital and demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the deceased’s family. Guntur district Collector Samuel Anand said the exact cause of the ASHA worker’s death would be revealed only after a post-mortem but maintained that not a single Adverse Event Following Immunisation was reported in the district as 10,099 healthcare staff were vaccinated in the first eight days. The Collector said he would send a proposal to the state government for payment of compensation to the ASHA worker’s kin, on the lines of that paid to frontline health workers who succumbed to COVID-19. “We first took her to a private hospital and later shifted to the GGH as her condition worsened. She was a very fit person and rendered tireless service during COVID-19 time,” the ASHA worker’s brother said. He denied that she suffered a brain stroke as was being said by the GGH doctors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/asha-worker-dies-after-vaccination-in-andhras-guntur-203108
24-01-2021|| Hyderabad||Congress demands relief for turmeric farmers||Telangana Congress legislative party leaders Bhatti Vikramarka Mallu has demanded a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for turmeric and also the setting up of a Turmeric Board at the earliest.In a statement, he said: “BJP at the Centre and the Telugu Rashtra Samithi (TRS) governments in the state were playing tricks and indulging in a blame game for delaying in fixing MSP for turmeric”. He demanded that the two governments immediately focus on the plight of the farmers and support the farmers by providing support price. Thousands of acres of turmeric were being cultivated in the state every year and the farmers are not getting appropriate support price, he said.  This year also the farmers cultivated turmeric in 40,624 acres in Nizamabad, 26,165 acres in Nirmal, 34,078 acres in Jagityal, 16,739 min Warnangal rural, 1766 acres in Bhupalpally, 10,234 acres in Mahabubabad, 4200 acres in Vikarabad, 1491 acres in Peddapalli, 1388 acres in Sangareddy, 1091 acres in Warangal Urban, 363 acres in Adilabad, 191 acres in Kamareddy, 140 acres in Manchiryala, Bhadra, 77 acres in Khammam, 50 acres in Janagam, 25 acres in Rangareddy, 8 acres in Suryapeta, 2 acres in Medak and 2 acres in Siddipet for a total crop of 1,39,698 acres.   The farmers were facing trouble and are unable to sell their harvest for a reasonable rate as there is no MSP. They are worried that the price of quintals, which was Rs 15,000, 8 years ago is now not even selling for Rs 4,000 or Rs 5,000 and that due to this situation they are facing huge losses, he said.Bhatti Vikramarka said the two governments are not looking after the farmers despite tall claims. He demanded that the state government should buy the crop till the issue is resolved by it in consultation with the centre.

24-01-2021||Kultali (WB)||Will quit if Centre brings law allowing only one member of family in politics: Mamata’s nephew||In a direct challenge to his detractors in the BJP, TMC MP and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday said he will quit politics if the Centre brings a law allowing only one member of a family in politics.Banerjee said he will publicly hang himself if the corruption charges levelled against him are proved to be true.The Diamond Harbour MP, while addressing a rally in Kultali assembly constituency, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should table a bill banning more than one member of a family from active politics and the next moment, Banerjee will no longer be in the political arena.“From Kailash Vijayvargiya to Suvendu Adhikari, Mukul Roy to Rajnath Singh, there are other members of your families who occupy important posts in the BJP.“If you ensure that there will be only one family member in active politics, there will be only Mamata Banerjee from our family in the TMC from the next moment. I promise that,” he said.Taking exception to BJP leaders calling him an “extortionist”, Banerjee challenged them to prove their allegations and said he will publicly hang himself if the charges against him are proved to be true.Referring to the Victoria Memorial incident during a programme on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on Saturday, he said ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans were deliberately raised to prevent Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee from delivering her speech.The chief minister had refused to deliver her speech after the slogans were raised in the presence of the prime minister, saying she felt insulted.“We are proud that Mamata Banerjee made it clear that if Netaji is insulted by such slogans during a government function, we will rise in protest. Bengal will rise in protest,” the TMC MP said.“You can chant Jai Shri Ram thousand times, but at temples, at religious functions, at your place but not in this fashion at a government programme to commemorate an icon like Netaji,” he said.By not allowing her to make her speech in such a programme, they also insulted the people who elected her to the assembly. This reminded people of the vandalism of the Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar bust in 2019, he said.Coming down heavily on BJP leader Sovan Chatterjee, the TMC leader said, “After waking up from hibernation after three years, he is now making a false claim that he was instrumental in my victory in Diamond Harbour in 2014. He should know what people in the area think about him.” Without naming Chatterjee, a TMC turncoat who joined the BJP in 2019, Banerjee challenged him to contest any of the 31 seats in South 24 Parganas district.On Banerjee’s comments on dynasty politics, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said that the TMC MP had never raised such demands earlier and is making such statements now as the party is faced with imminent defeat in the assembly elections due in April-May.

Mahapatra had come across an offer on Amazon that allowed him to purchase a laptop worth Rs 23,499 for a mere price of Rs 190.However, after two hours, he was contacted by the Amazon Customer Care Service Department and was notified that the order was cancelled due to a price recession issue.The student then sent a legal notice to Amazon. But when it went unnoticed as there was no response from the company, he went on to file a complaint before the District Forum seeking Rs 50,000 for mental agony and Rs 10,000 towards the cost of litigation. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amazon-penalised-rs-45-000-for-cancelling-students-laptop-order-203098
24-01-2021||New Delhi||Several countries have shown interest in procuring Tejas aircraft: HAL chairman Madhavan||The delivery of the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) to the Indian Air Force under a Rs 48,000-crore deal will begin from March 2024 and around 16 aircraft will be rolled out annually till the completion of the total supply of 83 jets, Chairman and Managing Director of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited R Madhavan said on Sunday.In an interview to PTI, Madhavan also said that a number of countries have shown keen interest in procurement of the Tejas aircraft and that the first export order is likely to come by in the next couple of years.Madhavan said that Tejas Mark 1A jet has superior performance levels compared to China’s JF-17 combat aircraft as it has better engine, radar system and electronic warfare suit, besides an edge in the overall technology.“The biggest difference, of course, is the air-to-air refuelling which is non-existent in the competitor’s plane,” he said.The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 13 approved the Rs 48,000-crore deal to procure 73 Tejas Mk-1A variants and 10 LCA Tejas Mk-1 trainer aircraft from the HAL to boost the Indian Air Force’s combat prowess.Giving a break-up of the cost components, Madhavan said the basic price of the aircraft will be around Rs 25,000 crore while Rs 11,000 crore will be used for ground support equipment and other required infrastructure at the bases and around Rs 7,000 for basic customs duty and output GST.The HAL chairman said the cost for each fighter version of the aircraft will be Rs 309 crore and Rs 280 crore for the trainer.“The price is tight but we are fine with it,” Madhavan said. The total cost of Rs 48,000 crore includes design and development cost of Rs 2,500 crore to be given to Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and around Rs 2,250 crore set aside for variations in foreign currency exchange rate.The Tejas Mk-1A will be equipped with an active electronically scanned array radar, beyond visual range missile, electronic warfare suite and air-to-air refuelling system.A formal contract for the deal is expected to be signed between the HAL and the IAF on February 5 at the Aero India exhibition in the presence of President Ram Nath Kovind.“Three years is the strategic timeline for developing infrastructure as well as delivery of the aircraft. We will meet the timeline. The first aircraft is expected to be delivered by March 2024.“Initially we will supply around four aircraft and increase the number to 16 annually from 2025,” Madhavan said.Asked whether a possible export order will push the delivery deadline for supplies to the IAF, Madhavan said the HAL will strictly follow the timeline for domestic order and can always set up additional production lines when necessary.“We are planning for more than 16 aircraft annually so that in case of any other order coming in, we can take it up. We are already increasing production rates.“The second phase of the LCA plant has already come up, though we need it after 2024-25,” he said.The IAF has already inducted a batch of Tejas aircraft as part of its initial order of 40 jets.Madhavan said the Tejas programme will boost the overall aerospace sector in India, noting that it currently involves 563 domestic enterprises. “And it will go up to 600 to 650. This is important for the ecosystem.”           He said Tejas will be able to operate as efficiently as any other aircraft in all regions including mountainous Ladakh.The government has been majorly focusing on boosting domestic defence production and set a target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore (USD 25 billion) turnover in defence manufacturing by 2025.According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around USD 130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years.In May last year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rolled out several reform measures for the defence sector including making separate budgetary outlay to procure Indian-made military hardware, increasing FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route and generating a year-wise negative list of weapons which won’t be imported. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/several-countries-have-shown-interest-in-procuring-tejas-aircraft-hal-chairman-madhavan-203097

When the government and administration needed it, you came forward as volunteers and provided help,” he said.“Whether it was spreading awareness about the Aarogya Setu App or coronavirus infection spread, the work done by you was praiseworthy,” Modi said.The prime minister said the youths should now step forward to assist in the COVID-19 vaccination programme by providing the right information to the people.“You need to take it to the next level now. Your reach is in all parts of society. I request you to come forward to help the country with the COVID-19 vaccination programme. You have to provide the right information on vaccines to the poor and general public,” Modi said.“Indian scientists have done their duty by developing the coronavirus vaccine and now we have to fulfill ours. We have to defeat through right information every network spreading lies and rumours,” Modi said.He also said India will not become self-reliant just by somebody saying so, but this will be achieved by actions of the youth for which they have to be armed with necessary skills.“India will not become ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) just by somebody saying so, it will become so by actions of youths like you. You will be able to do this better when you will have the necessary skill set,” Modi said.Realizing the importance of this, the ministry of skill development was formed when his government came in 2014 and more than 5.5 crore youths have been given training for different skills till now, Modi said.Under this skill development programme, not just training is being given, help is being provided for getting employment, the prime minister said.The aim is that the youths in India get new employment opportunities based on their skill sets, Modi said.He again stressed on ‘Vocal for Local’, saying it will gain more strength from the ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ sentiment.

The expenditure on the development of the entire 70 acre land there will exceed Rs 1,100 crore,” said Swami Govind Dev Giri Maharaj, treasurer of Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Nyas.He said he arrived at these figures after consulting experts involved in the Ram temple construction project.The Nyas (trust) had not come out with an official statement so far on the expenditure involved in the project, he said while talking to ABP Majha Marathi TV channel.“It was possible for us to raise funds (for the temple construction) from some corporate people.

24-01-2021||New Delhi||Increasing trend of egg freezing in India||Gone are the days, when women were asked to get married at the age of 18–22 years and were pressurized to complete their family by 24-26 years of age.Nowadays, most of the women are not ready to start the family due to social and economic reasons.Eggs freezing comes as a boon and most suitable option for these females who are advancing in age and their biological clocks are ticking. The first pregnancy with frozen Oocytes in the world was reported in 1986 by Dr Christopher Chen from Singapore.Chemo and Radiotherapy has toxic effects on gametes.Eggs freezing was started for cancer patients before starting chemotherapy / radiotherapy to prevent them from losing their eggs and to have their biological children later in future.Later on this technique was preferred by the patients and treating doctors for other medical illnesses like endometriosis, history of early menopause and also for other social reasons.With the increasing awareness, the trend of egg freezing is increasing in India also, the reason being medical and/or social.On the other hand, one should know that carrying the pregnancy in advanced age has its complications on mother and foetus too. So one should opt for this technique judiciously and at the right time.Women at the age of 40 have up to 45 per cent chances of miscarriage and by the age of 45 it increases to 75%. Freezing their eggs at an early age gives them a fair chance of having a healthy baby at later stage.It is an easily approachable and affordable process.The best time to freeze the eggs is before 35 years of age as the number and quality of eggs drastically declines after 35. Procedure of Egg freezing is absolutely safe and can be kept frozen for as long as one desires.With the development and advancement in oocytes freezing techniques it’s no longer in an experimental stage. The latest data says it's a well-established practice with good pregnancy outcome and its use has been extended to fertility preservation and social freezing.According to current data of Ferticity Fertility clinic, has the survival rate of frozen oocytes 95 per cent, fertilization rate is 85.3 per cent and pregnancy rate is 68.75 per cent.Egg retrieval is a day care procedure without any cut/stitch, done under general anaesthesia, transvaginally under ultrasound guidance. Patient is discharged on the same day and the eggs are frozen.When the woman decides to plan for pregnancy, eggs are thawed and fertilized with the sperms to form embryos, they are further cultured in the lab for 3-5 days and transferred in the uterus.The important factors which determine the success of having a healthy baby is the age at which oocytes freezing was done and the number of eggs stored.Expertise and experience of clinician/embryologist team is also important to have the good outcome.As awareness is increasing among general population, more and more women are coming forward. This procedure is gaining popularity in developing countries and in India too. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/increasing-trend-of-egg-freezing-in-india-203047
24-01-2021||Vijay Mohan||To meet global requirements, IAF transport planes to get satellite tracking system||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 24With the aviation sector worldwide switching over to a new generation, highly accurate satellite-based aircraft positioning and tracking system, the Indian Air Force is also modifying some of its transport aircraft with the new navigational aid.The new equipment, called the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), is a satellite-based system that replaces the current ground-based secondary surveillance radar network. Some countries have already made ADS-B capability mandatory in aircraft now being registered in or operating within their airspace.A senior Air Force officer said initially the IAF’s fleet of 12 C-130 Super Hercules would be upgraded with the additional avionics package. Besides retrofitting the hardware, processors and antennae, the work would also integrating the ADS-B with the aircraft’s existing navigation suite and mission computer.ADS-B transponder broadcasts the precise position and location information of an aircraft in real time, giving air traffic control better visibility to track and manage aircraft while enhancing aviation safety by providing aircrew more situational awareness of nearby aircraft.The IAF’s transport aircraft often fly overseas for various purposes, including humanitarian aid, joint exercises, support of UN peace missions, military diplomacy and logistics tasks. ADS-B will enable the IAF flights to shorten routes, reduce minimum separation distances, reduce fuel-burn and cut emissions. This in turn, will save time and money while granting access to safety indications and alerts on ground.According to the IAF officers, installation of ADS-B on other transport fleets like the IL-76, Embrarer and Boeing BBJ, which may be required to fly in international airspace, will be taken up at a later stage.The civil aviation sector in India is also gearing up to fully integrate ADS-B systems in its network. In 2014, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had issued a detailed note on the installation, certification and use of ADS-B in Indian civilian aircraft and its use in Indian controlled airspace, though it was not mandatory at that time. Infrastructure for using ADS-B data already exists at several stations in India.Since ADS-B is a satellite-based system, it can locate an aircraft carrying the requisite equipment virtually anywhere on the globe and track aircraft where no ground-based radar coverage is available such as over oceans or remote areas.The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH-370 in March 2014, when flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, and of an IAFAN-32 in July 2016 over the Bay of Bengal (en route to Port Blair from Chennai), are two recent examples of gaps in ground-based secondary radar coverage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-meet-global-requirements-iaf-transport-planes-to-get-satellite-tracking-system-203045

Although, the CBSE affiliation system has been online since 2006, the restructured system will be completely digital and based on data analytics with the least human intervention,” CBSE Secretary Anurag Tripathi said.“The restructuring will help in establishing ease of doing business in the CBSE affiliation system, attaining the goal of minimum government, maximum governance, automated and data driven decisions, achieve transparency, bring more accountability in the entire systemic processes and achieve quick and time-bound disposal of all applications,” he added.Tripathi said the board will soon come out with detailed guidelines on the restructured system.“A detailed document on the CBSE affiliation system containing the restructured online procedure for affiliation, documents required for affiliation application, modalities and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for inspection, guidelines for the inspection committee, videos for various process, will be released soon,” he said.The board has also revised timelines for the application process as per the restructured system.As per the revised timeline, every year the application window for fresh affiliation and upgradation of affiliation will open three times -March 1 to 31, June 1 to 30 and September 1 to 30.“The application for extension of affiliation will be accepted from March 1 to May 31 every year. Other applications such as those for additional subject, section increase, change of name of school, change of society or trust, will be accepted through the year,” Tripathi said.Procuring digital signatures of a school from authorised service provider or AADHAAR-based signatures; uploading mandatory documents such as no objection certificate, land certificate, safety certificate and certificate by district education officer, are among the prerequisites for application for affiliation.“After the online submission of application, details submitted by the school will be analysed in accordance with the CBSE by-laws and an inspection committee will be constituted immediately for the purpose of inspection. Schools will be able to get inspection done on any of the dates mentioned in the letter,” he said.The CBSE had introduced a facility for virtual inspection of schools for upgradation of affiliation in August last year in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The board is also in the process of setting up a facilitation centre to address queries, and problems of schools and inspection committees related to the virtual inspection.The board had revamped its norms in 2018 for granting affiliation to schools, leaving the onus of the infrastructural audit on states and limiting its own role to academic quality monitoring.The CBSE has 24,930 schools affiliated to it across the country and abroad, with over 2 crore students and more than 10 lakh teachers. The affiliation by-laws were formulated in the year 1998. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-restructures-affiliation-system-process-to-be-completely-digital-203038

In December, we captured the injured jumbo seen with pus on the injured area and later we provided treatment to that elephant and let it into the forest area.""The elephant again started moving to the residential area but did not cause any damage to anyone. In the first week of January 2020, the injured jumbo moved to the residential area and this was noted by the residents and they started to chase the elephant. Later, they torched a tyre and threw it on the injured jumbo. The elephant ran away with fire injury and later died," Srikanth added.Based on the video evidence, the house owner Prasad and Raymond were arrested on Friday evening under the Wildlife Protection Act section (9) (seven years imprisonment) and another person Ricky involved in this case is missing. A special team has been formed to arrest him.The arrested accused will be produced in the court today, said the forest official."In order to create awareness among the public, not to indulge in such incidents and harass wild animals, we will be distributing pamphlets," he added. --ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mudumalai-forest-department-arrests-2-men-for-elephants-death-in-tamil-nadu-203037
24-01-2021||New Delhi||TMC, BJP busy in ‘ego battles’; Cong-Left to fight for Bengal’s identity: Jitin Prasada||Alleging that the TMC and the BJP are busy in “ego battles”, Congress’ West Bengal in-charge Jitin Prasada on Sunday said the Congress-Left alliance for the upcoming assembly polls presents to the people an alternative that is committed to bread and butter issues and fighting for the identity of Bengal.He said the Congress was focused on sealing the seat-sharing arrangement with the Left parties “as soon as possible” and asserted that the panel formed to hold talks on it would focus on the “quality” of seats that the party got to fight.In an interview with PTI, Prasada said while the state unit and the All India Congress Committee (AICC) were working closely, there will be no “back seat driving” from Delhi and whatever is in the best interest of the party will be done taking all stakeholders into confidence.The AICC in-charge of West Bengal said there was a demand from the state leaders for Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to extensively campaign in the West Bengal Assembly polls and asserted that when the opportune time comes the top leadership will campaign.Asked about seat-sharing with the Left, Prasada said: “The seat-sharing process and talks are on which we plan to close as soon as possible and we should be having our candidates in place well ahead of time so that we can focus on the seats that the party is fighting on.”“We are very interested that this seat-sharing is finalised so that we can concentrate on joint programmes which will lead to vote transfer more easily,” the former union minister said.On when seat-sharing talks are expected to be closed, Prasada said a senior-level committee headed by state unit president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury with Congress Legislature Party leader Abdul Mannan, former state chief Pradeep Bhattacharya and Nepal Mahato as its members is working on it.“This committee which is in place is very equipped in terms of expertise and knowledge and they will take a decision (on seat- sharing) looking at not only the number but the quality of seats that we are going to be fighting,” the 47-year-old leader said.Accusing the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of not focusing on people’s issues, Prasada said this election in Bengal should have been about the performance of the BJP-led Central Government and what it had done for Bengal, as well as about the report card of the TMC, but sadly it had been about “ego battles”.“The benefit of a lot of schemes has not been passed on to the people because of the Centre-state conflict,” he said and cited that the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme were not reaching the people in West Bengal.Asserting that there were other critical issues such as employment, infrastructure, education, health, which were not being talked about, Prasada alleged that the BJP and the TMC were interested in taking the focus away from real issues because they “wanted to hide the failures of their governments”.“The other issue is we have seen how media muscle has been used by both parties (the TMC and the BJP) and the very identity and culture of Bengal, its rich cultural heritage, has been slowly destroyed. The Congress will fight to protect the heritage and culture of Bengal,” he said.The BJP especially wanted to impose its own culture on the people of West Bengal, which the Congress would not allow, Prasada asserted.The BJP and the TMC were trying to hide behind frivolous issues and creating an atmosphere of tension and ego, he said, adding that “We want people of Bengal First not personal egos”.Asked if this election will be for protecting Bengal’s identity and culture, Prasada said: “Of course, this is one of our main planks especially when the BJP wants to impose its own culture.”He also slammed the Mamata Banerjee-led state government, alleging that there had been a lot of law and order issues which have come to light, and asserted that “we will present an alternative to the people of Bengal”.Asked if the Congress-Left alliance will declare a chief ministerial face, Prasada said there would be a discussion on this issue but first the priority was to ensure that seat-sharing happens and the joint campaign begins.Underlining that the Congress-Left alliance has a deep-rooted connection with the people of West Bengal, he said the bread and butter issues had been put on the back burner which the alliance will bring to light.The elections for the 294-member West Bengal assembly are likely to be held in April-May.

24-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt may announce formulation of policy for toys sector in Budget 2021||The government may in the Budget next week announce formulation of a dedicated policy for the toys sector to boost domestic manufacturing, sources said.They said the policy would help in creating a strong ecosystem for the industry in the country and also attract startups.The Commerce and Industry Ministry is already taking steps to promote domestic manufacturing of toys. It has came out with a quality control order for the sector and had also increased import duty last year on toys.Quality control order is one of the ways to stop flow of cheap sub-standard toys into the domestic market.A source said the country had low share in the international toys industry and India’s exports account for less than 0.5 per cent of global demand, so there were immense opportunities in this segment.The other areas which could be considered for the sector include promotion of research and development and design centres for toys.“Boosting manufacturing would also help increase exports of toys from India. Countries like China and Vietnam are major players in the sector,” they added.India’s toy exports are limited to about $100 million.The toys industry in India is primarily in the unorganised sector, comprising about 4,000 small and medium enterprises.About 85 per cent of toys are imported in the country, with maximum coming from China. It is followed by Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Germany, Hong Kong and the US.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that India has talent and ability to become a toy hub for the entire world and called upon startups to work towards realising this potential while being “vocal about local toys”.

24-01-2021||Dharamsala||Tibetans hopeful of seeing Biden host the Dalai Lama||Tibetans are hopeful of being united with the United States once again with their globetrotting spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who has a special relationship with US presidents that began with a gold watch, calling on President Joe Biden soon for substantive discussions.After a four-year unusual exception of President Donald Trump, they feel Biden will continue a decades-old practice of the deep and enduring affinity between the Americans and the Tibetans, that has been followed religiously by American presidents by extending an invitation to the Buddhist monk in the Oval Office, generally reserved for visiting heads of state, as the pandemic subsides.A representative of the spiritual leader told IANS that since George HW Bush (1991), the Dalai Lama has met all US presidents, including Barack Obama on four occasions.Likewise, he met Bill Clinton and George W Bush several times.Every time, the meetings have prompted a sharp reaction from the Chinese government, which views the Nobel Peace laureate as a hostile element bent upon splitting Tibet from China.In 2007, the Dalai Lama received the US Congressional Gold Medal, even in the face of protests by China.The last official meeting was when Obama greeted the Dalai Lama in 2016 at the White House.At the last meeting, they reportedly discussed “the situation for Tibetans in the People’s Republic of China, and the then president had emphasised his strong support for the preservation of Tibet’s unique religious, cultural and linguistic traditions, and the equal protection of human rights of Tibetans in China”.“Barack Obama encouraged meaningful and direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and his representatives with Chinese authorities to lower tensions and resolve differences,” the White House had said after the meeting.The first meeting of the two old trusted friends — the Dalai Lama and Obama — was in 2005 when the latter was a member of the Senate. In 2017, Obama met the spiritual leader in New Delhi, sixth in the series, to discuss promoting peace in the world.The Dalai Lama-George W Bush proximity came to the fore when the leader-in-exile in an interview in 2012 with Piers Morgan, then with CNN, said: “I love President Bush.”“Really?” Morgan asked. “Yes, really,” he replied.“As a human being. Not as a president of America. Sometimes his policy may not be very, very successful but as a person, as a human being, very nice person. I love him.”The 85-year-old monk, who was enthroned two years before President Biden was born, has lived in exile in India since fleeing Tibet during a failed uprising against the Chinese government in 1959.On his first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order for the US return to the Paris climate accord, which earned accolades, including one from the Dalai Lama.Former US president Franklin Roosevelt also had sent the Dalai Lama a pocket-watch as a gift when he was a young boy. The Dalai Lama, who visits only on invitation, described the gold watch as magnificent and even took it with him when he fled Tibet in 1959.In his election campaign, Biden had said if voted to power, his administration would sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Tibet, besides meeting with His Holiness the Dalai Lama.“The invitation to His Holiness from the White House would provide an opportunity to discuss the situation in Tibet and to advance US support for the ‘middle-way approach’,” a representative from the spiritual leader’s office told IANS.The ‘middle-way approach’ demands ‘greater autonomy’ for the people in Tibet.Echoing similar sentiments, activist and poet Tenzin Tsundue, who twice “breached the wall” by unfurling protest banners during the visits of Chinese premiers to India, said: “Tibet emerged as one of the contesting issues during the US election campaigns.”“President Joe Biden promised to meet His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The Tibet support resolution — Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA), 2020 — was also passed by bipartisan support to show that Tibet is an important issue in dealing with China.”“As Tibetans, we must make sure we secure our interest from among American tussle with China. The US has benefitted tremendously from its One-China policy, which supports China’s 70 years of occupation of Tibet and China’s trade compared to any instances of Tibet support efforts,” Tsundue told IANS.In a congratulatory letter to Biden on becoming the 46th President, the Dalai Lama wrote: “The whole world places its hope in the democratic vision and leadership of the United States…Once again I take this opportunity to express our gratitude for your long-standing support for the Tibetan people. It has been our good fortune to have enjoyed the friendship and encouragement of the American people and their leaders in our endeavour to protect and preserve our ancient Buddhist culture, a culture of peace, non-violence and compassion.”In her speech at the Congressional Gold Medal award-giving ceremony by President George W Bush at the Capitol Hill in Washington on October 17, 2007, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would always be grateful to Chairman Tom Lantos for affording many Members of Congress their first meeting with His Holiness in 1987.The 14th Dalai Lama was born on July 6, 1935, in a small village in the remote Amdo region of Tibet.

24-01-2021||New Delhi||Tomar’s stern message to unions and 'gratitude' to Punjab officials for 'acting as bridge'||The government’s strategy for the day was set much before farmers’ unions walked in the conference hall for the eleventh round of talks. While asking unions to reconsider its “best offer” on the three contentious farm laws, the BJP-led Centre on Friday also made public a video of Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s stern message to them where he was seen outlining ethics for such discussions.As he called the curtains on the meeting, Tomar was also seen acknowledging the role of Punjab government officials in the Centre’s talks with the unions. Congress’ Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Government had last year countered the Narendra Modi-led Centre’s three farm laws.Tomar said: “I am happy that during this entire course (of discussions) Central and Punjab government officials helped us by being present during the talks…so that they could become a bridge between us (the Centre and unions) and find a solution, the hard work that was expected from them they put in that. For that, I am thankful to the Central government and Punjab government officials.”  Notably, the four-hour-plus meeting yesterday saw discussions for barely 30 minutes (some 20-odd minutes before the break and around 10 minutes after that when Tomar made his statement). If unions believe that during the three-hour-plus long break the government was considering giving them another offer, they are mistaken. The government wanted to give them some more time to reconsider their decision, officials say.   Sources say the government’s strategy for the day was set soon after the farm unions went public with their decision to not accept its proposal of 18-month suspension of the three contentious laws. Tomar also made clear “his angst” over the unions’ decision to do when a meeting had been planned between them and the government.While making clear that suspension of laws was the “best offer” he had for them, Tomar also gave the unions a talk on the ethics of negotiations between two sides. “Normally, no new agitation is announced during the talks…..However, you (unions) kept coming for talks and also kept declaring new agitations”. In another strong observation on their current status, he said: “they could not move forward because the vision that should have been there during the discussions was lacking”. Later, he also told the media that “resolution is not possible when sanctity/purity of an agitation is lost”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tomars-stern-message-to-unions-and-gratitude-to-punjab-officials-for-acting-as-bridge-203001

24-01-2021||Jaipur||Once beggars, these kids aspire to join Army, courtesy cop's school||Around 500 children who were once seen begging, rag picking and fighting on the streets in Rajasthan's Churu district have now transformed into decent students and are attending regular classes, singing patriotic songs and dreaming high to serve the nation as defence personnel, police officers and doctors. This is courtesy of the efforts of Dharamveer Jakhar, a police constable in Rajasthan who has been teaching them regularly for an hour every day since January 2016 in Aapni Pathshala, a school started by him.Surprisingly, even amid the Covid pandemic, Jakhar has been visiting the slum areas to ensure the kids receive their regular lessons and don't return to their old profession of begging.In 2011, Jakhar pursued his Bachelor of Education and wanted to become a school teacher, however, in between he cracked Rajasthan police service exam and was appointed as a constable.During one of his assignments, he was asked to counsel kids from the streets who were begging.His interaction with these kids revealed how they were limited in their goals, was abusive in their approach and did not want to do anything else than begging."I wondered how will these kids grow and what shall they become in future and what will be their role in nation-building? This question troubled me and I realised that these kids need mentoring. Many of them did not even have parents and this goaded me to start an informal school for them," he adds."It was at this time when I started calling these kids to the school run under a tree where they were given prizes too in the form of chocolates, biscuits or toys which lured them to attend regular classes," he says sharing that initially there were just 5 kids.Soon this number started multiplying. In around 1.5 years, there were 180 kids.At this time, he named his small school as 'Aapni Pathshala' which started running under the aegis of 'Muskan Sansthan, Churu. It came out as a joint venture of participation by civil society and police in the sphere of social service.The slum children attending the school were provided mid-day meals, bags, books, clothes, sports items and stationery, etc for free.The school was then shifted to a Pharma office nearby where they had decent space to run the classes. Out of these 180 students, 80 were around 10-year-old and hence were eligible to get admission in a decent school. We pushed and enrolled these kids in class V and VI in Zakir Hussain school so that they get regular education, he says.Overall, to date, we have connected around 500 students with education. No matter what the season is, education for these students has never stopped. Even my knee ligament damage did not bring a break in my schedule, he adds."We don't want these students to go back to begging and hence, have been visiting slum areas to teach them even in pandemic times," he adds."The NGO Muskaan has been helping us in many forms. When I am busy rendering my duty during day time, they take turns to teach the kids. Now with the help of society, we have been providing the best food for these kids too," he informs.The kids taking their regular classes here are from neighbouring states too which include UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh."Many of their parents have come here to work as labourers or beg, now their kids are being taught here who want to become Armymen, join the police and so on," he adds.Goverdhan, an 8th class student, is learning to shoot in a shooting range. "We were ragpickers once but now are attending shooting class and want to join the military," he says.Puru Kumar, running shooting classes in a shooting range, is providing them free learning.Another student Mitu Kumar, a ragpicker who worked in a tea stall, is now studying in class IX, and also wants to join the Army."We were given dresses, shoes, gifts on coming to school neat and clean and hence we thought of becoming regular students. Now, we have solar panels installed at our huts too so that we can study at night," says Ravi, a class VIII student.Bhoomi, a class V student from UP, says she is thankful to the team for helping her enrol in school.Jakhar, despite doing wonderful work, has not been promoted in the last four years."I want to be known for my work. Designations hardly matter. I shall soon spread the project to other parts of the nation to harness the capabilities of other kids who are spending their lives begging on the streets," he says.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/once-beggars-these-kids-aspire-to-join-army-courtesy-cops-school-202992

While the two countries are doing everything in their capacity to empower the small industry, India is doing everything to weaken it,” said Rahul, accusing the BJP-led Centre of imposing five tax slabs, which he said had been designed to weaken small industries.He said the GST would have to be restructured and taken back to the Congress idea of ‘one tax, minimum tax’.He also told the gathering of industry representatives at Coimbatore that the petrol and diesel prices would fall “only when the Congress comes to power and not otherwise”.Rahul, who later held a roadshow in the city, said the country needed harmony for economic growth. “The current government has created an atmosphere of disharmony, and the demonetisation and GST have devastated the small industry. The pandemic has further destroyed the sector,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-ensure-single-slab-gst-if-elected-rahul-in-tamil-nadu-202742

There has to be dignity. It doesn’t behove anybody to invite people and insult. I won’t speak. Jai Bangla, Jai Hind,” she said, wrapping up.#WATCH | I think Govt's program should have dignity.

You cant teach dignity. Nor can you teach lumpens to be dignified. Here is a one-min video of what exactly happened today. Including the dignified response by @MamataOfficial,” he said in a tweet, sharing the video clip.The BJP leadership, however, saw nothing wrong with the “Jai Shri Ram” slogans.“None of the dignitaries said anything. Why did she lose her cool? It reflects her mindset of appeasement politics. (She) appeases a particular community before elections,” BJP national general secretary and Bengal-minder Kailash Vijayvargiya told PTI.Assembly polls are due in the state in April-May this year.The saffron party’s state unit chief Dilip Ghosh said “Jai Shri Ram” is not a political slogan.“Why does she losses her cool every time someone raises this slogan? She should not have reacted like this.People raise this slogan because she reacts like this,” Ghosh said.BJP leader and grandnephew of Netaji, Chandra Kumar Bose, said there is nothing wrong with the slogan and Netaji’s birth anniversary should not be mixed with politics.In a statement, state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said some people insulted the chief minister of West Bengal by raising the slogan when she stood up to address the programme.“By raising Jai Sri Ram slogan in a government function, they have not only insulted her, but also the CM of the state, deliberately. They have also insulted a woman in public. I may be her political rival but I strongly condemn it,” Chowdhury, also the Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha said.Senior CPI(M) leader and Left Front chairman Biman Bose described the incident as disgraceful to the state .However, he also asked the chief minister to ensure that functions of the state government are not turned into political events.Claiming that Banerjee turns every government programme from block level to the state secretariat into her party’s event, CPI(M) leader Md Salim expressed hope that the chief minister will not do it as long as she is in the chair.

24-01-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Not ‘Parakram’, Mamata says Bose’s birth anniversary is ‘Desh Nayak Divas’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 23Oblivious to the announcement by Central Government regarding naming January 23, the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, as “Parakram Divas”, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday came out with another name for the occasion.While paying tribute to Bose on his 125th birth anniversary, Mamata announced that the day would be celebrated as “Desh Nayak Divas” (Country’s Hero Day).“Homage to Deshnayak Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his 125th birthday. He was a true leader & strongly believed in unity of all people. We are celebrating this day as #DeshNayakDibas. GoWB has also set up a committee to conduct year-long celebrations till January 23, 2022”, Mamata said in a tweet.The proximity of the event to the Assembly elections in West Bengal, which are just a couple of months away, has triggered off a fierce contest between Mamata and Modi about showing greater admiration for the Cambridge-educated freedom fighter who dared to throw a military challenge to the mighty Britain.Also read: Mamata kicks off procession on Netaji's 125th birth anniversaryBesides showing scanty respect to Modi government’s announcement of naming January 23 as “Parakram Divas”, the West Bengal Chief Minister also reiterated her demand to the Central Government of declaring Bose’s birthday a national holiday.Mamata also announced that a monument, named after Azad Hind Fauj, will be built at Rajarhat in Kolkata. A university named after Netaji will also be set up, which will be funded entirely by the state and will have tie-ups with foreign universities, she announced.The TMC chief will be also taking out a “grand padayatra” from the Netaji sculpture at Shyambazar to the Netaji statue at Red Road and offer flowers at its foot. Banerjee also announced that the Republic Day parade in Kolkata, this time, would also be dedicated to Netaji.A siren will be sounded on Saturday in Kolkata at 12.15 pm, the approximate timing of Netaji’s birth at Cuttack back in 1897. People have been urged by Mamata to blow conch shells at home around that time.‘India should have four capitals’Mamata also said India should have four capitals on a rotation basis and sessions of Parliament should be held in different locations in the country."During the British-era, Kolkata was the capital of the country. I think we must have four capitals on a rotation basis. Why does the country have only one capital? And the sessions of Parliament should be held in different places in the country. We will have to change our concept," she said.Mamata further alleged that there was a "game" going on to change the country's national anthem - "Jana Gana Mana"."There is a game going on to change our national anthem. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had endorsed 'Jana Gana Mana' as the national anthem. We will not allow to change it," she said.Modi's visit to KolkataPrime Minister Narendra Modi also has elaborate plan to associate himself with Netaji’s birthday celebrations. He is slated to visit Kolkata later in the afternoon on Saturday and attend a seminar on Netaji at the National Library and inaugurate an exhibition on Netaji at the Victoria Memorial.According to the PMO, Modi will also visit Netaji Bhawan, the Bose family home from where Netaji had dramatically escaped in 1941, and travelled to Germany via Afghanistan and Soviet Union. The historic residence has been converted into a museum by the Netaji Research Bureau.Modi also posted a series of tweets on Friday to highlight how people of Haripura, a Gujarat town where Bose was elected president of the Congress party in 1938, paid tribute to the INA chief on his birthday every year unfailingly.
